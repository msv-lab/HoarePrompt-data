The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, and `i` is 2.**
