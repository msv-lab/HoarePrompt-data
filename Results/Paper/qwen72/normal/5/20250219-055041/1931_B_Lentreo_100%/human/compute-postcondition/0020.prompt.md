Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), and the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`); `curr` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    curr += nums[i] - mean
    if curr < 0:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`), `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 0, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, and `i` is 1. If `curr` is less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function continues execution with the same values of `nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`, `curr`, and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 2, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`, and `i` is 2. If `curr` is less than 0, the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the same values of `nums`, `n`, `total`, `mean`, `curr`, and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
