### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's analyze the program and the annotations to understand why.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(nums)` to determine if it is possible to make the water amounts equal.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function first calculates the length of the list `n` and the total amount of water `total`.
   - It checks if `total` is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns 'NO'. However, the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant but does not affect correctness.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water per container `mean` as `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - It iterates through each container, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. This is because if `curr` is negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the containers up to that point is less than the expected cumulative mean, which implies that it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations (pouring from a higher-indexed container to a lower-indexed container).

3. **Key Insight:**
   - The program correctly identifies that if at any point the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative, it is impossible to achieve the desired equal distribution. This is because the operation only allows pouring from a higher-indexed container to a lower-indexed container, and a negative `curr` indicates that the lower-indexed containers have less water than they should have to reach the mean, which cannot be corrected by the allowed operations.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case `3 1 2 3`:
     - `n = 3`, `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
     - `total = 6`, `mean = 2`
     - `curr` starts at 0.
     - After the first container: `curr = 1 - 2 = -1` (returns 'NO').
   - This example correctly returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations.

5. **General Correctness:**
   - The program's logic is sound and correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.
   - The cumulative difference check ensures that the program can detect impossible distributions early, which is crucial for the problem's constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct. The original assessment was incorrect in its example and reasoning.

Final: **True**
