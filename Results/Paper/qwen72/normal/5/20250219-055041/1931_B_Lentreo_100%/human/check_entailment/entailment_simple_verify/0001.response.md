### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves `n` containers with different amounts of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container after equalization is `mean = total // n`.
   - To achieve equalization, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean does not become negative at any point during the iteration.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the water amounts.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the first `i` containers is less than the required cumulative mean, making it impossible to equalize the water amounts using the given operation (since water can only be poured from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index).

4. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **Initial State**: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`.
   - **Mean Calculation**: `mean = total // n` is correctly calculated.
   - **Cumulative Difference Calculation**: The loop iterates through each container, updating `curr` with the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - **Negative Check**: If `curr` becomes negative at any point, the function returns 'NO', indicating that it is impossible to equalize the water amounts.
   - **Final State**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to equalize the water amounts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Container**: If `n = 1`, the program will return 'YES' because the sum of a single element is always divisible by 1, and there is no need to pour water.
   - **Already Equalized**: If all containers already have the same amount of water, the program will return 'YES' because `curr` will remain 0 throughout the loop.
   - **Multiple Containers**: The program correctly handles multiple containers by checking the cumulative difference.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean.
   - The program correctly checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning above. The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
