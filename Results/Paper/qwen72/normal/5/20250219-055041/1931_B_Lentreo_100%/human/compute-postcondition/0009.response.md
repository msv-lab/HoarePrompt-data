Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`), `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `curr` is less than 0.**
