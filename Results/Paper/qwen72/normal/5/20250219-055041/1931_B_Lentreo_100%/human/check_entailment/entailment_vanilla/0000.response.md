### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with different amounts of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container after equalization is `mean = total // n`.
   - To achieve equalization, we need to ensure that we can always pour water from a container with more than the mean to a container with less than the mean, and this must be possible without violating the `i < j` condition.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean of the water amounts.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that we cannot pour enough water from the previous containers to the current container to reach the mean, and thus it is impossible to equalize the water amounts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n = 1`, the problem is trivially true because there is only one container.
   - If all containers already have the same amount of water, the problem is also trivially true.
   - The program correctly handles these cases.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean.
   - The program correctly checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point.
   - If `curr` becomes negative, it correctly returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it correctly returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
