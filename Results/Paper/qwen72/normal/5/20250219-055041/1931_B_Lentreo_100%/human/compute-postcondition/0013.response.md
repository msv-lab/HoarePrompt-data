Output State: **`nums` is a list of non-negative integers where the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 1, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (i.e., `mean = total // n`), `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[1] - mean`, `i` is 1, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly divisible by `n` (i.e., `total % n == 0`).**
