Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `result` is the result of `func_1(result, num)`**. 

The value of `result` is updated to the result of the function `func_1` when called with the initial value of `result` (which is equal to the first element of `numbers`) and `num` (which is the second element of `numbers`). The list `numbers` and the variable `num` remain unchanged.
