Reasoning:

The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided program does indeed solve the problem as described, and it includes the main logic to process the input and generate the required output. Let's break down the program and its behavior step by step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The function `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of integers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list.

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` and stores it in `m`.
   - It then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome by dividing `m` by each multiplier `k[i]`.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is strictly less than `m`.
   - If the sum is not strictly less, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - If the sum is strictly less, it prints the bets `c`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the bets for each outcome if a valid distribution is found, or `-1` if no valid distribution exists.

Let's analyze the example provided in the problem description:

**Example Input**:
```
6
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
5
5 5 5 5 5
6
7 9 3 17 9 13
3
6 3 2
5
9 4 6 8 3
```

**Example Output**:
```
27 41 12 
1 1 
-1
1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
-1
8 18 12 9 24
```

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:
- For the first test case:
  - `n = 3`, `k = [3, 2, 7]`
  - `m = LCM(3, 2, 7) = 42`
  - `c = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 < 42`
  - Output: `14 21 6` (Note: The provided output in the example is `27 41 12`, which is also a valid solution, but the program's output is correct as well.)

- For the second test case:
  - `n = 2`, `k = [3, 3]`
  - `m = LCM(3, 3) = 3`
  - `c = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`
  - `sum(c) = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3`
  - Output: `1 1`

- For the third test case:
  - `n = 5`, `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
  - `m = LCM(5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5`
  - `c = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `sum(c) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 >= 5`
  - Output: `-1`

- For the fourth test case:
  - `n = 6`, `k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
  - `m = LCM(7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13) = 13971`
  - `c = [13971 // 7, 13971 // 9, 13971 // 3, 13971 // 17, 13971 // 9, 13971 // 13] = [1995, 1552, 4657, 821, 1552, 1074]`
  - `sum(c) = 1995 + 1552 + 4657 + 821 + 1552 + 1074 = 10651 < 13971`
  - Output: `1995 1552 4657 821 1552 1074` (Note: The provided output in the example is `1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071`, which is also a valid solution, but the program's output is correct as well.)

- For the fifth test case:
  - `n = 3`, `k = [6, 3, 2]`
  - `m = LCM(6, 3, 2) = 6`
  - `c = [6 // 6, 6 // 3, 6 // 2] = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `sum(c) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 >= 6`
  - Output: `-1`

- For the sixth test case:
  - `n = 5`, `k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
  - `m = LCM(9, 4, 6, 8, 3) = 72`
  - `c = [72 // 9, 72 // 4, 72 // 6, 72 // 8, 72 // 3] = [8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`
  - `sum(c) = 8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 71 < 72`
  - Output: `8 18 12 9 24`

The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and then determines the bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the LCM. If no such distribution is possible, it correctly outputs `-1`.

Therefore, the program is correct and the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
