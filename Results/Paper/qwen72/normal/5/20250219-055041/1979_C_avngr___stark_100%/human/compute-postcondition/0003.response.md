The only objects in the loop head are the list `numbers` and the variable `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `numbers`. If the list `numbers` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute one more time for the third element.

At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, and `result` is the result of `func_1(result, num)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements. The next element to be processed in the loop will be the third element of `numbers`, and `num` will be set to this third element.

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `result` is the result of `func_1(result, num)`**
