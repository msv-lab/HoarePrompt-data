The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). After the function concludes, the input variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer that represents the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
