Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are updated to the values provided by the input, where both values are integers and `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, and the input value is greater than 0; `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`). If `k` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop. `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0). If `x % i` is 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, where `l` is a list containing the values 1 and, if `i` <= `k`, also `i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `x // i`. If `x % i` is not 0, `ans` remains 1 and `l` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3 if `x % 2 != 0` or 4 if `x % 2 == 0`, and `l` is a list containing the value 1 and possibly `x // i` if `i` <= `k`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 5 if `x % 2 != 0` or 6 if `x % 2 == 0`, and `l` is a list containing the value 1 and possibly `x // i` if `i` <= `k`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1. If `x // i <= k`, `l` now contains the value `ans` as its first element. If `x // i > k`, `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
