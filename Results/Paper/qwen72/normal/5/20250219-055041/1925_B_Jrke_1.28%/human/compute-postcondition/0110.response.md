The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts two parameters: `x` and `n`. `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. Each test case is represented by a pair of integers (x, n).

The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the provided information. However, we can infer that the function likely processes these parameters in some way and returns a result based on the values of `x` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `n`, where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `n`.**
