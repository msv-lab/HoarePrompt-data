Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)` (where `x` is the new first integer input), `ans` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), and `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `l` remains a list containing only the value 1.***
