Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is the first integer input.
- `n` is the second integer input.
- `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`).
- `i` is `int(x)` (which is the same as `x` since `x` is already an integer).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `ans` is not defined in the initial state or in the code snippet. This means that the value of `ans` is unknown and could be anything, including an undefined variable, which would result in a `NameError` if the code were to be executed.

### Output:
Since `ans` is not defined, the code will raise a `NameError` when it tries to print `ans`.

Output: **NameError: name 'ans' is not defined**
