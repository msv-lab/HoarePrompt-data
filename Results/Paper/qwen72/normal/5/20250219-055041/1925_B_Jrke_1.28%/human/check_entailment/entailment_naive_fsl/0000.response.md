Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, making the GCD 1. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

Example case:
- Input: `x = 11, n = 2`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: The program will not correctly identify that the only way to break 11 into 2 sub-problems is to have difficulties of 1 and 10, or 2 and 9, etc., all of which have a GCD of 1. Instead, the program may return a different value, which is incorrect.
