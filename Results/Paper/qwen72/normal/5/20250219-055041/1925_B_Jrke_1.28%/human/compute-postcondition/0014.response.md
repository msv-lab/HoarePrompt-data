Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0), `x % i` is 0, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and, if `i` <= `k`, also `i`. Additionally, the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
