Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)` (where `x` is the new first integer input), `ans` is 1, `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), the integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k` (i.e., `x // i <= k`), and the list `l` contains the values 1, `i`, and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
