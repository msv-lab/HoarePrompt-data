The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7. It prints either "4 1" followed by "1 2" if the list `c` contains exactly one element with the value 2, or "13 0" if the list `c` does not contain exactly one element with the value 2. The function does not modify the list `c` and does not return any value.
