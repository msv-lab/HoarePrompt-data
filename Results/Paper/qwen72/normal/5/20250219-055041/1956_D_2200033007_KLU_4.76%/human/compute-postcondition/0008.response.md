The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`. `c` is a list of integers of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18), and each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each integer in the list is between 0 and 10^7. The function does not return any value.**
