You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Annotated Code: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) where each element a_i in c satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: *`c` is a list of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) where each element a_i in `c` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7, and `m` is 0. If `c` is equal to [2], then `c` remains [2]. Otherwise, `c` is not equal to [2] and `m` remains 0.
    return
    #The program does not return any value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input values. It first reads the integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads the array elements as a string, splits them, and appends them to the list `a`. However, the elements are appended as strings, not integers, which is a significant issue since the operations will require integer arithmetic.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is correct in terms of function invocation.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the maximum sum of the array and the sequence of operations to achieve it.
   - The function has a conditional check for the length of the array `c`:
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This is correct for the specific case where the array has two elements, and the MEX of the set `{0, 1}` is 2. Setting both elements to 2 results in a sum of 4.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes the maximum sum is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all arrays of length greater than 2. The maximum sum and the sequence of operations depend on the actual values in the array.

4. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not implement a general solution to find the MEX of a subarray and apply the operations to maximize the sum.
   - The logic is hardcoded for a specific case (array length of 2) and a specific output (array length greater than 2), which does not address the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct for the specific cases handled, but it is not correct for the general problem. The program should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not compute the MEX or apply the operations to maximize the sum of the array.
