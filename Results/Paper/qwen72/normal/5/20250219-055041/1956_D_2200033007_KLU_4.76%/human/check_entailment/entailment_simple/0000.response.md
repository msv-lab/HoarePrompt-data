Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input values correctly but does not convert the elements of the array `a` to integers. This means that `a` is a list of strings, which will cause issues when performing operations that require numerical values.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `len(a)` as an argument, which is the length of the array `a`. However, the function expects the array itself, not its length. This mismatch in the function signature and the actual argument passed will lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases:
   - When the length of the array is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - For all other lengths, it prints `13 0`.

   This logic is not general and does not solve the problem for all possible inputs. The function does not compute the MEX of any subarray, nor does it perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array. It simply prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect for most inputs.

4. **Output Format**: The function does not return any value, which is fine for this problem since the output is printed directly. However, the output it prints is not based on the actual input array and does not follow the required format for the solution.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
