Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed fails to handle all potential cases as described in the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if the length of the array `c` is 2 and prints a hardcoded output for that specific case. For any other length, it prints `13 0` and does not perform any operations, which is incorrect.

The problem requires the program to maximize the sum of the elements of the array for any given input, and the solution provided does not achieve this for arrays of lengths other than 2. For example, with the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the case where the array length is 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
