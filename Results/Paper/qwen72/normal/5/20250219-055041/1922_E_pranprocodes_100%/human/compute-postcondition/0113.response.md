Output State: **After all iterations, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for even `x` and `min` values appended for odd `x`, and `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`i`**: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2 because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`x`**: The loop continues until `x` becomes 1. Each iteration either halves `x` (if it is even) or decrements it by 1 (if it is odd). Eventually, `x` will reach 1.
- **`max`**: For each even `x`, the current `max` value is appended to `ans` and then `max` is decremented by 1. The final value of `max` will be 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even.
- **`min`**: For each odd `x`, the current `min` value is appended to `ans` and then `min` is incremented by 1. The final value of `min` will be -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` will contain the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`.
- **`t`**: The variable `t` counts the total number of iterations the loop has executed, which is the number of times `x` was either halved or decremented until it became 1.
