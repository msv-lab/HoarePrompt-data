The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be any integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is 0**
