To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered).
   - `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered).
   - `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for even `x` and `min` values appended for odd `x`, but the order of elements in `ans` is reversed.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.

2. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - The variable `x` is initially 1, which is an odd number.
   - Since `x` is odd, `min` will be appended to `ans`.
   - The value of `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered). Initially, there is 1 odd `x` value (which is 1), so `min` is -100000000 + 1 = -99999999.
   - `ans` will be initialized as `[-99999999]`.
   - The variable `t` counts the number of iterations until `x` becomes 1. Since `x` is already 1, the number of iterations is 0.

3. **Final State:**
   - `ans` is `[-99999999]`.
   - `t` is 0.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(t)` statement will print the value of `t`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
