Initial State: `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1, the input value must be greater than 1.

Code:
```
x = int(input())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The value of `x` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, `t`) remain unchanged. The input value must be greater than 1, so `x` will be an integer greater than 1.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 100000000 - (number of even `x` values encountered), `min` is -100000000 + (number of odd `x` values encountered), `ans` is a list containing the sequence of `max` values appended for each even `x` and `min` values appended for each odd `x`, but in reverse order, and `t` is the total number of iterations it took for `x` to become 1.**
