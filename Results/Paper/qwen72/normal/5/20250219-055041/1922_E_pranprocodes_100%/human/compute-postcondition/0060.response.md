The code `ans.append(min)` adds the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Depending on whether `x` is even or odd, the value of `min` and the contents of `ans` will differ. However, the initial state specifies the values of `min` and `ans` for both cases.

1. If `x` is even:
   - `min` is -100000000
   - `ans` is a list containing 100000000
   - After appending `min` to `ans`, `ans` becomes [100000000, -100000000]

2. If `x` is odd:
   - `min` is -99999999
   - `ans` is a list containing -100000000
   - After appending `min` to `ans`, `ans` becomes [-100000000, -99999999]

The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1. If `x` is even, `x` is updated to `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing [100000000, -100000000], and `t` is 1. If `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing [-100000000, -99999999], `t` is 1, and `x` remains unchanged.**
