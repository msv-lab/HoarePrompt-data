The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the result of `int(input())`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - k, `min` is -100000000 + k, `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd, but now reversed to start with `max` and alternate with `min`, `t` is `k`**
