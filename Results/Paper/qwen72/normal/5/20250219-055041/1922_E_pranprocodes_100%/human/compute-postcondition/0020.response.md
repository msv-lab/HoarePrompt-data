Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` was even or 99999998 if `x` was odd, `min` is -100000000 if `x` was even or -99999999 if `x` was odd, `ans` is a list containing 100000000 if `x` was even or -100000000 if `x` was odd and now also contains `max`, `x` is updated to `x // 2` if `x` was even or remains unchanged if `x` was odd, `t` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `x` is updated to `x // 2` if `x` was even. If `x` was odd, `x` remains unchanged.
- The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` are not affected by the code snippet.
- The initial conditions for `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain the same, depending on whether `x` was even or odd.
- The updated value of `x` is `x // 2` if `x` was even, otherwise, it remains the same.
