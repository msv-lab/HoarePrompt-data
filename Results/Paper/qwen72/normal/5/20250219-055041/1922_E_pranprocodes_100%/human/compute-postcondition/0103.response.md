Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, and `t` is 2. If `x` is even, `x` is now `x // 2`, `max` is 99999998, `min` is -100000000, and `ans` is a list containing `[100000000, 99999999]`. If `x` is odd, `x` is one less than the initial value, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999998, and `ans` is `[-100000000, -99999999]`.**
