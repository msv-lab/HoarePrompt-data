Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an even integer and not 1, but now `x` is `x // 2`, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now half of its original value (using integer division). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
