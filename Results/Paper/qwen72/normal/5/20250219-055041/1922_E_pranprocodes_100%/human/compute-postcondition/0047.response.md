Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an even integer and not 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing 100000000, `t` is 0.** 

The code snippet `ans.append(max)` adds the value of `max` (which is 100000000) to the list `ans`. The list `ans` was initially empty, and now it contains the single element 100000000. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t` remain unchanged.
