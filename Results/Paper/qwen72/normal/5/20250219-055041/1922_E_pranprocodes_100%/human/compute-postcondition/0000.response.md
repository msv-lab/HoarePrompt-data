The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function before the loop starts.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
