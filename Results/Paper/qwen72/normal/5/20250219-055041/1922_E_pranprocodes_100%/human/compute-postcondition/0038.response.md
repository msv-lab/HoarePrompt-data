Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `max` is \(100000000 - k\).
   - `min` is \(-100000000 + k\).
   - `ans` is a list containing alternating values of `max` and `min` starting with `max` if `x` was originally even, or starting with `min` if `x` was originally odd, but now reversed to start with `max` and alternate with `min`.
   - `t` is `k`.

2. **Determine the structure of `ans`:**
   - Since `x` is 1 (which is odd), the original list `ans` would start with `min` and alternate with `max`.
   - However, the list is reversed to start with `max` and alternate with `min`.

3. **Construct the list `ans`:**
   - The original list would be: `[min, max, min, max, ...]`.
   - After reversing, the list `ans` becomes: `[max, min, max, min, ...]`.

4. **Print the list `ans`:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

5. **Determine the values of `max` and `min`:**
   - `max` is \(100000000 - k\).
   - `min` is \(-100000000 + k\).

6. **Final Output:**
   - The list `ans` will print the values of `max` and `min` in the reversed alternating pattern.

Since the exact length of the list `ans` is not specified, we can only describe the pattern of the output. The output will be a sequence of alternating `max` and `min` values starting with `max`.

Output: **100000000 - k, -100000000 + k, 100000000 - k, -100000000 + k, ... (alternating values starting with max)**
