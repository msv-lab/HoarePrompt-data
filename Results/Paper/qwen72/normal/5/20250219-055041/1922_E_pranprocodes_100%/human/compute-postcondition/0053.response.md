Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer and `x` must not be 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`, `t` is 0, and `x` is even.**

Explanation:
- The code `x -= 1` decrements the value of `x` by 1.
- Since `x` was initially an odd integer, after decrementing by 1, `x` becomes an even integer.
- The values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `x` must not be 1 still holds, as `x` was initially an odd integer and not 1, and after decrementing by 1, it is now an even integer.
