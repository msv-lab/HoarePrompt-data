The function `func_1` accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing coordinates and a string `d` representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It modifies the coordinates in `obj` based on the direction: if `d` is 'U', the x-coordinate is decreased by 1; if `d` is 'D', the x-coordinate is increased by 1; if `d` is 'L', the y-coordinate is decreased by 1; if `d` is 'R', the y-coordinate is increased by 1. The function does not return any value, but the list `obj` is updated with the new coordinates.
