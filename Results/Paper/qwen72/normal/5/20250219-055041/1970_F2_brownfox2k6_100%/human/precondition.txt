obj is a string representing an entity on the field (either a player "R0"-"R9", "B0"-"B9", the Quaffle ".Q", or the Bludger ".B"), and d is a string representing the direction of movement ("U", "D", "L", "R", "C .Q", or "T"). The field is a rectangle of N lines and M columns (3 <= N, M <= 99, N and M are odd), and the game consists of T steps (0 <= T <= 10000).
