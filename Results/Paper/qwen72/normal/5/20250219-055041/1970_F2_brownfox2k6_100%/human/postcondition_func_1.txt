The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `t` representing the current step in the game. It identifies all players in the `player` dictionary whose values match `blud` and updates their values to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints a message for each of these players, indicating that they have been eliminated at step `t`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `player` dictionary will have the values of the eliminated players set to `[-1, -1]`, and the values of other players remain unchanged.
