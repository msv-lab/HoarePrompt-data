### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses a custom function `putin()` to read input, which is not defined in the provided code. However, for the purpose of this evaluation, we can assume that `putin()` is a function that reads a line from standard input. This is a common practice in competitive programming to optimize input reading.
   - `func_1()` reads a single integer, which is the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of integers and returns them as a map of integers, which is then converted to a list.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` for Alice's and Bob's item prices, respectively.
   - The program creates a list of tuples `main_ar` where each tuple is `(b_i - a_i, a_i)`. This list represents the profit Alice can make from each item if Bob buys it from her.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program sorts the `main_ar` list in descending order based on the profit `(b_i - a_i)`.
   - Alice will choose the top `n - k` items from this sorted list because Bob will take the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
   - The program then calculates the total profit by summing the profits of the `n - k` items and the costs of the `k` items that Bob takes for free.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)` is responsible for calculating the profit.
   - `sub_summ` is initialized to 0.
   - The program adds the costs of the `k` items that Bob takes for free to `sub_summ`.
   - It then adds the profits of the `n - k` items that Bob buys from Alice to `sub_summ`.
   - The condition `if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0` ensures that only items with non-negative profit are considered, which is correct because Alice would not buy items that result in a loss.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for calculating the profit is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
- The use of sorting and the condition to ensure non-negative profit is appropriate for the given constraints and problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
