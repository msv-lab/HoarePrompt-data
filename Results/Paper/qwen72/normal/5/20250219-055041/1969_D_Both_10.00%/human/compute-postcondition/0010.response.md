Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must have at least one element, `val_b` is the first element in `main_ar`, and the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- `sub_summ` is updated by adding the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b` to its current value.
- The other variables (`sec_arr`, `val_a`, `main_ar`, and `val_b`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0 still holds.
