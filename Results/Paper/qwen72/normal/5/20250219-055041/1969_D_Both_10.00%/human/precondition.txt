The function `inp` is intended to read input data for the problem, but the specific input variables and their relationships are not defined within the function itself. The input is expected to follow the format described in the problem statement, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; 0 ≤ k ≤ n), the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
