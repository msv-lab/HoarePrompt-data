The only objects in the loop head are `val_a` and `sec_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `sec_arr`. If `sec_arr` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `sub_summ` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must have at least one tuple, and `val_a` will be the first tuple in `sec_arr`.

State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `val_a` is the first tuple in `sec_arr`**
