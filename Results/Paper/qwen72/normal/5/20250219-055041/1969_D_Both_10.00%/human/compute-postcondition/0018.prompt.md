Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`. If the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is updated to include this sum, and `sec_arr` remains unchanged. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least one element, with `val_b` being the first element in `main_ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is further increased by the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least two elements, with `val_b` being the second element in `main_ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0, plus the sum of the first and second elements of the second tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` also includes the sum of the first and second elements of the third tuple in `main_ar`. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least three elements, with `val_b` being the third element in `main_ar`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
