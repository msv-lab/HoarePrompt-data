Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0. `sec_arr` remains unchanged, and `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will have been updated to include the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` that meets the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. The initial value of `sub_summ` (which is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`) will be incremented by these sums. The variables `sec_arr` and `val_a` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
