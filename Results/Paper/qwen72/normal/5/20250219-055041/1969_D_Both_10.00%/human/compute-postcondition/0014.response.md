Postcondition: ***`sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of the first tuple in `main_ar` if that sum is greater than or equal to 0. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `sub_summ` is further increased by the sum of the first and second elements of `val_b`. `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` must have at least two elements, with `val_b` being the second element in `main_ar`.***
