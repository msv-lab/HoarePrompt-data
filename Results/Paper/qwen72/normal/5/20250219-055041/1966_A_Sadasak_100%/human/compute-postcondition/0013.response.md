Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the third integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first and second integers in `arr` as keys. The value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` is either 1 or `k`, depending on the initial condition. The value of the second integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` is either 1, `k`, or `k+1`, depending on the previous iteration's condition. If `frequency_table[num]` was greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` is now `k`. Otherwise, `frequency_table[num]` is either 1 (if `num` was not previously in `frequency_table`) or `frequency_table[num] + 1` (if `num` was already in `frequency_table`).***
