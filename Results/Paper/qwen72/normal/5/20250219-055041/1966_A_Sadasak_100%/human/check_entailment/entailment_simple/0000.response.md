Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If so, no operations can be performed, and the program correctly outputs `n` as the minimum number of cards.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` is used to calculate the frequency of each card number in the list `nums`, capping the frequency at `k`. This is a reasonable approach because if a card number appears more than `k` times, you can only exchange up to `k` cards at a time, so the frequency is effectively capped at `k`.

4. **Final Output**: The program then checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform an exchange operation and be left with `k - 1` cards. If no card number has a frequency of `k`, the program prints `n`, which is incorrect.

   - **Issue**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the frequencies of the cards can be reduced through multiple operations. For example, if you have 10 cards with the same number and `k = 4`, you can perform two operations to reduce the number of cards to 2. The program should calculate the minimum number of cards left after all possible operations, not just check if any card has a frequency exactly equal to `k`.

5. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
   - Calculate the frequency of each card number.
   - For each card number, determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged by performing the operation as many times as possible. This can be done by calculating the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k` (i.e., `freq % k`).
   - Sum these remainders to get the minimum number of cards left.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the reduction of card numbers through multiple operations.

Correctness: **False**
