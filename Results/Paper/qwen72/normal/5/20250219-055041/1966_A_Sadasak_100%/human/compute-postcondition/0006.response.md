The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, and `num` is assigned the value of the next element in `arr` at the start of each iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the first integer in `arr`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be the second integer in `arr`. The length of `arr` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the second integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the first integer in `arr` as a key. If `frequency_table[first integer in arr]` > `k`, then the value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` is set to `k`. Otherwise, the value of the first integer in `arr` in `frequency_table` remains 1.**
