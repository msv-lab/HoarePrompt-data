Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `num` is the first integer in `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is a dictionary with `num` as a key and its value is 1.** 

The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by adding the first integer in the list `arr` (which is `num`) as a key and setting its value to 1. If `num` was already a key in `frequency_table`, its value would have been incremented by 1. However, since `frequency_table` was initially empty, `num` is added as a new key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
