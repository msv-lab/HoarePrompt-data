To determine what will be printed by the `print(*p)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`.
   - `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`.
   - `i` is `-1`.

2. **Understanding the Calculation:**
   - The list `p` is constructed such that each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.
   - The value of `mex` is determined by the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The value of `mex` is initially not defined, but it is updated to be the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`.
   - Since `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`, `mex` must be the smallest value that can be subtracted from `a[i]` to produce non-negative values in `p`.

4. **Determine `mex`:**
   - If `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[mex, p[0], p[1], ..., p[n-1]]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, then `mex` must be the smallest value in the list `a` to ensure that all `p[i]` are non-negative.
   - Therefore, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `a`.

5. **Construct `p`:**
   - Each element `p[i]` is then calculated as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Since `mex` is the minimum value in `a`, `p[i]` will be `0` for the element in `a` that is equal to `mex`, and positive for all other elements.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.
   - The list `p` will contain values where each element is `mex - a[i]`, and `mex` is the minimum value in `a`.

Given the above reasoning, the output will be a list of integers where each integer is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `a` from the minimum value of `a`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where mex is the minimum value in the list a)**
