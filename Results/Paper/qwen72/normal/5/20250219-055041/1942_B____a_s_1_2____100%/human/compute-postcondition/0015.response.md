Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `mex` is the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`, `i` is `-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `p` is updated such that each element `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]` for `i` ranging from `n-1` down to `0`. This means that after the loop completes, `p` will contain the values calculated by the expression `mex - a[i]` for each index `i` in the list.
- The variable `mex` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum value among `n` and the elements of `p` that have been set so far. After the loop completes, `mex` will be the minimum value of the list `[n, p[n-1], p[n-2], ..., p[0]]`.
- The loop index `i` is `-1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`, and the final value of `i` is one less than the last index processed.
