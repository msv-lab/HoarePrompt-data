Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
- Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the element `p[n-2]` is updated to `mex - a[n-2]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`, and the structure of `p` remain unchanged except for the specific update to `p[n-2]`.
- The precondition that `n` is greater than 1 and the constraints on `t` and `n` still hold.
- The list `p` now has two elements that are not -1: `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 2`.
