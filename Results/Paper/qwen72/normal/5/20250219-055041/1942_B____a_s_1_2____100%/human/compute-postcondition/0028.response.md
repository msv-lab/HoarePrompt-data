The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `p`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates in reverse, starting from `n - 1` down to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 3`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`**
