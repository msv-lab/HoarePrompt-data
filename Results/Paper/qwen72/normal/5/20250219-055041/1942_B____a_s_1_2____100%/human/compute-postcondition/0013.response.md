Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, and `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`, `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`.**

In natural language: The value of `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Specifically, `p[n-1]` is still `mex - a[n-1]`, `p[n-2]` is still `mex - a[n-2]`, and `i` is still `n - 3`.
