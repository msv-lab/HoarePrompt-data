### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` from the array `a` where each element `a_i` is given by `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX function returns the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to `-1`.
   - It starts with `mex` set to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - It iterates from the last element of `a` to the first element (i.e., from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each element `a_i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The key insight is that the MEX of the permutation up to index `i` should be at least `p[i]` because `p[i]` is the largest element in the permutation up to that point.
   - By starting from the end of the array and working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly updated based on the values already placed in `p`.
   - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, the program will always find a valid permutation by following this approach.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as it will simply set `p[0]` to `mex - a[0]`, which will be a valid permutation.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and the update of `mex` ensure that the permutation remains valid.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the elements of `p` for each test case, which is the required output format.
   - The example provided in the problem description is correctly handled by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` based on the problem description and the execution summary. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
