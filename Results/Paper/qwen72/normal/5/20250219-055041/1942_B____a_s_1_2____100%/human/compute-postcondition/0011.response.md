Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mex` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[n-2]`.
- Therefore, `mex` is now `min(mex, mex - a[n-2])`.
- The value of `mex` is further constrained by the initial `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `p`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
