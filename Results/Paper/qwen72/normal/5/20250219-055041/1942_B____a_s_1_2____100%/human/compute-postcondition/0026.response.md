Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1])`, `i` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The code `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
- Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the element `p[n-2]` is updated to `mex - a[n-2]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mex`, and the structure of `p` remain unchanged except for the specific update to `p[n-2]`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 2` as it is not modified by the code.
