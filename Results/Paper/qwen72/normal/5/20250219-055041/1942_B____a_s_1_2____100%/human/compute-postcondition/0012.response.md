The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 2` and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to have executed up to this point. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 to `n - 3`, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure that `n - 3` is a valid index (i.e., `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1 except for `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]` and `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, `mex` is equal to `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`**
