Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0, except `nums[1]` and `nums[3]` which are set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. `k` is updated to `k - nums[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - nums[i]`, and since `i` is 3, `k` is updated to `k - nums[3]`.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- The list `nums` retains its initial structure, with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0, except `nums[1]` and `nums[3]` which are set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
- The new value of `k` is `k - nums[3]`.
