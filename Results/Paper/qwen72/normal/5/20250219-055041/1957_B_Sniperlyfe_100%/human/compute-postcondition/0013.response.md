Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and the rest of the elements initialized to 0. If `k` > 0, `k` is updated to `k - min(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}, k)`, and `nums[1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. `nums[3]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[i]` is updated to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
- Since `i` is 3, `nums[3]` is now set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.
- The value of `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\).
- The rest of the elements in `nums` remain unchanged.
- The value of `k` and the length of `nums` remain the same as in the initial state.
