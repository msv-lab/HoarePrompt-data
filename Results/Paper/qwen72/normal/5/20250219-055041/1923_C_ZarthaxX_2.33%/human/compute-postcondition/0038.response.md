Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 1, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**

Explanation:
- The variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values from the input, which are split by a space and converted to integers.
- The values of `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, and `sum` remain unchanged.
- The expressions for `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are still valid, as they depend on the updated values of `l` and `r`.
