The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop index) and `q`. The loop can execute again if `q` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is a non-negative integer that must be greater than 0, and it is decremented by 1 at each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 1, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.
