The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `nums`. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a non-negative integer, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.

After executing the code, the variable `nums` will hold a list of integers. The length of `nums` is not specified, but it is assumed to be `n` based on the context. The values of `n`, `q`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`. Each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
