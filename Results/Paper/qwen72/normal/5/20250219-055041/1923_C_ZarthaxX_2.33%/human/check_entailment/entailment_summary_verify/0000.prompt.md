You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on a list of positive integers. It reads the length of the list `n` and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the list of integers `nums` from the input. For each query `(l, r)`, it determines if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met, where `onesInRange` is the count of 1s in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` and `sumInRange` is the sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` in the range `[l-1, r-1]`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the original list `nums`, the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` (`ones`), and the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` (`sum`).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray is good but the logic in the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` fails to correctly determine this. Specifically, the condition should be `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange < sumInRange` to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into a good array. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
The program will output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
However, for the query `1 5`, the subarray `1 2 1 4 5` is good because we can transform it into `2 1 2 3 4` (which sums to 12, and all elements are positive and different from the original). The program incorrectly outputs `YES` for this query because the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` evaluates to `2 * 3 + 5 - 3 <= 11`, which is `7 <= 11`, and thus the program prints `YES` instead of `NO`.

The correct condition should be `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange < sumInRange` to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.
