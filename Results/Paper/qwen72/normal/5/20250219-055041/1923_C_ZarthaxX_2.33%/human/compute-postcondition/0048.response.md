The function `func_1` should accept three parameters: `c`, `q`, and `queries`. `c` is a list of positive integers with a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of tuples `(l, r)` where each tuple represents a query and `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The function processes these queries on the array `c` and returns the results of the queries.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `c` of positive integers, a non-negative integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of tuples `queries` where each tuple `(l, r)` represents a query. It processes the queries on the array `c` and returns the results of the queries.**
