Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be greater than 1, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`, `l` and `r` are input integers, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]` updates the value of `onesInRange` to be the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`.
- All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
- The value of `onesInRange` is now specifically `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- The condition `if l is equal to r` is still valid and will determine the next steps in the program.
