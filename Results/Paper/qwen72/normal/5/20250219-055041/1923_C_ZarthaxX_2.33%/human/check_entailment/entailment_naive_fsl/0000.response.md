Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the subarray is good but the logic in the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` fails to correctly determine this. Specifically, the condition should be `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange < sumInRange` to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into a good array. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
The program will output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```
However, for the query `1 5`, the subarray `1 2 1 4 5` is good because we can transform it into `2 1 2 3 4` (which sums to 12, and all elements are positive and different from the original). The program incorrectly outputs `YES` for this query because the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` evaluates to `2 * 3 + 5 - 3 <= 11`, which is `7 <= 11`, and thus the program prints `YES` instead of `NO`.

The correct condition should be `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange < sumInRange` to ensure that the subarray can be transformed into a good array.
