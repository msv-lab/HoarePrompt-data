The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on a list of positive integers. It reads the length of the list `n` and the number of queries `q` from the input. It then reads the list of integers `nums` from the input. For each query `(l, r)`, it determines if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met, where `onesInRange` is the count of 1s in the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` and `sumInRange` is the sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` in the range `[l-1, r-1]`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes the original list `nums`, the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` (`ones`), and the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` (`sum`).
