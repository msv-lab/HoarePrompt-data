You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The precondition for the function should be: `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of queries, and each query is a tuple `(l, r)` where `1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5) and must be 0, `c` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, `nums` is a list of integers with length `n`, `ones` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `ones[i]` is the cumulative count of 1s in `nums` up to index `i - 1`, `sum` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of `nums[j] - 1` for all `j` from 0 to `i - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `c` of positive integers, a non-negative integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of tuples `queries` where each tuple `(l, r)` represents a query. It processes the queries on the array `c` and returns the results of the queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
