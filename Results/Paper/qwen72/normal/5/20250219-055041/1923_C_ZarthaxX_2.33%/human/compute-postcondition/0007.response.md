The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `i` is 2, `ones[1]` is `ones[0] + (1 if nums[0] == 1 else 0)`, `sum[1]` is `sum[0] + nums[0] - 1`**
