Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `i` is 1, `ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `ones[i]` is updated based on the expression `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`. This means:
  - If `nums[0]` (since `i - 1` is 0) is equal to 1, then `ones[1]` is set to `ones[0] + 1`.
  - If `nums[0]` is not equal to 1, then `ones[1]` is set to `ones[0] + 0`, which is just `ones[0]`.
