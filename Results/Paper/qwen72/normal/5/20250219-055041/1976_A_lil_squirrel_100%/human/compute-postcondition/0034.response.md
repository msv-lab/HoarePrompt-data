Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**. This indicates that the given conditions are met: the string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20) consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and there is no position `i` in `password` where `password[i]` is a lowercase Latin letter and `password[i + 1]` is a digit. The lists `letters` and `digits` are sorted and contain the respective characters from `password`.
