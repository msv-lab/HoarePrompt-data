### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Separation of Characters:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - This is done using a loop that checks if each character is a digit or a letter and appends it to the respective list.
   - This part of the program is also accurate and follows the problem description.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(letters)`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to `sorted(digits)`.
   - If either list is not sorted, the function returns 'NO'.
   - This part of the program is accurate and correctly implements the sorting conditions specified in the problem description.

4. **Order Check:**
   - The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if the current character is a letter and the next character is a digit.
   - If such a pair is found, the function returns 'NO'.
   - This part of the program is accurate and correctly implements the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

5. **Final Return:**
   - If all the checks pass, the function returns 'YES'.
   - This part of the program is accurate and correctly implements the final condition.

### Analysis of the Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Password: `12ac`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Password: `123wa`
  - Letters: `['a', 'w']` (not sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Password: `allllmost`
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `[]` (empty, trivially sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Password: `ac123`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Digit '1' comes after a letter 'c'.
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Password: `011679`
  - Letters: `[]` (empty, trivially sorted)
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - No letter comes before a digit.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It separates the characters, checks the sorting of letters and digits, and ensures that no digit comes after a letter. The program produces the correct output for all the given test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
