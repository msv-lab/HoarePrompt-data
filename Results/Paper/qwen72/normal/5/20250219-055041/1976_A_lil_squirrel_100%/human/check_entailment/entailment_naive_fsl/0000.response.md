Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to verify the strength of a password based on the given conditions. It separates the letters and digits from the password, checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and ensures that no digit comes after a letter. The program handles all edge cases, including passwords with only letters, only digits, and mixed letters and digits, and it correctly outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case. No potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements has been identified.
