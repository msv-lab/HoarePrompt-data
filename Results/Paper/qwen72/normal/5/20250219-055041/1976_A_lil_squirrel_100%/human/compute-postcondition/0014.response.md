Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `ch` is the third character of `password`, `letters` is a list containing the first, second, and third characters of `password`, and `digits` is an empty list.** 

Explanation: The code `letters.append(ch)` adds the third character of `password` to the list `letters`. Since `ch` is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` initially contains the first and second characters of `password`. After appending `ch`, `letters` now contains the first, second, and third characters of `password`. The variable `digits` remains an empty list, and the values of `n` and `password` are unchanged.
