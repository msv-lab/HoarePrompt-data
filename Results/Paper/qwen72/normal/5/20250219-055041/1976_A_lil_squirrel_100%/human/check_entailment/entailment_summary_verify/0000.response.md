Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to verify the strength of a password based on the given conditions. Let's break down the function and verify each part:

1. **Separation of Characters**:
   - The function iterates over each character in the password and separates them into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - This ensures that we can independently check the sorting of letters and digits.

2. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if letters != sorted(letters): return 'NO'`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `if digits != sorted(digits): return 'NO'`.
   - These conditions ensure that all letters and digits in the password are in the correct order.

3. **Checking No Digit After a Letter**:
   - The function iterates through the password and checks if there is any lowercase letter followed immediately by a digit using `for i in range(len(password) - 1): if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit(): return 'NO'`.
   - This condition ensures that no digit comes after a letter, which is one of the requirements for a strong password.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles passwords with only letters, only digits, and mixed letters and digits.
   - If the password contains only letters, the `digits` list will be empty, and the sorted check for `digits` will pass.
   - If the password contains only digits, the `letters` list will be empty, and the sorted check for `letters` will pass.
   - If the password is empty (which is not possible given the constraints), the function will still work correctly as the sorted checks and the no-digit-after-letter check will pass.

5. **Output**:
   - If none of the conditions for returning 'NO' are met, the function returns 'YES'.
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case and prints the result of `func_1` for each password.

Given the function summary and the problem description, the program meets all the specified conditions and handles all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct is accurate.

Final: **True**
