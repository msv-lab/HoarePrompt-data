The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the length of `password`. For the loop to execute, the length of `password` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate up to `len(password) - 2` (since the range is `len(password) - 1`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means `len(password)` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`. Additionally, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, and `n` must be at least 2.**
