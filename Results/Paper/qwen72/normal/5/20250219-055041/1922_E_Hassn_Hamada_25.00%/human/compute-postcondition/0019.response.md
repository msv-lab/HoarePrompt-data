Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), `i` is `size - 1`, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.
