To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `size`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop initializes `i` to 0, and it increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.

2. **Variable `size`**: The loop will execute `size` times. For the loop to execute at least once, `size` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\).
- `i` is `size - 1`.
- `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `i` to 0, and `size` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`number`, `sequence`, and `result`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
