The code snippet updates the value of the element at the index `size - result - 1` in the `sequence` list by adding `result` to it. The value of `i` is 0, so it does not affect the index calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`size` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.
