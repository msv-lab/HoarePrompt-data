You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `X = 1` correctly. According to the problem description, `X` can be as low as 2, but if we consider the edge case where `X = 1`, the program should ideally return an array with exactly one element (since an array with one element has exactly one increasing subsequence, which is the element itself). However, the program will return an array of length 0, which is incorrect. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `X` is a power of 2 minus 1 (e.g., 3, 7, 15, etc.) correctly. For example, when `X = 3`, the program should generate an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences, but it fails to do so. 

For a more concrete example, consider the input `X = 3`. The program should generate an array with exactly 3 increasing subsequences. However, the output of the program for `X = 3` is:
```
3
0 1 0
```
This array has more than 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]`, `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this input.
