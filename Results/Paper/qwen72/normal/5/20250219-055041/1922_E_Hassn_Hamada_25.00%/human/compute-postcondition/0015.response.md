The value `1` is appended to the list `sequence`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << size) - 1 > \text{number}\), `i` is 1, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.
