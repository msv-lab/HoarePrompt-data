Output State: **The program returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the length of the `sequence` list, and `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. The `sequence` list has been modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1 - i] + result`.**
