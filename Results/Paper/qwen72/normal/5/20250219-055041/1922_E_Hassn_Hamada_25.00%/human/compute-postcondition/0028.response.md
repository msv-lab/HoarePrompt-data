The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].

**Case_1:** If the function determines that it should return 0, it does so.

**Case_2:** If the function does not return 0, it returns the sum of `size` and `result`, where `size` is the length of the `sequence` list, and `result` is the value returned by a recursive call to `func_1` with the parameters `number - (1 << size) + 1` and the modified `sequence`. The `sequence` list is modified such that each element at index `size - result - 1 - i` for each `i` from 0 to `size - 1` is incremented by `result`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the sum of the length of `sequence` and a value `result`, where `result` is obtained from a recursive call to `func_1` with a modified `number` and a modified `sequence` list. The `sequence` list is modified by incrementing each element at specific indices by `result`.**
