Output State: **`size` is increased by 3, `number` is in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and `number` is at least 3, and \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `size` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially increased by 2, it is now increased by 3.
- The value of `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\) and is at least 3.
- The condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) is updated to \((1 << (size + 2)) - 1 \leq \text{number}\) because `size` has been incremented by 1.
