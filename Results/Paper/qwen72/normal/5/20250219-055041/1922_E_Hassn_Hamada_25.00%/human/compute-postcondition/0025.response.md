Output State: **`size` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`, the element at index `-result - 2` is now `sequence[-result - 2] + result`, and the element at index `-result - 3` is now `sequence[-result - 3] + result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `size` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- The list `sequence` contains integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but two specific elements have been modified: the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`, and the element at index `-result - 2` is now `sequence[-result - 2] + result`.
- The code snippet `sequence[-result - i - 1] += result` modifies the element at index `-result - i - 1` by adding `result` to it. Since `i` is 2, the index becomes `-result - 3`.
- Therefore, the element at index `-result - 3` is now `sequence[-result - 3] + result`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
