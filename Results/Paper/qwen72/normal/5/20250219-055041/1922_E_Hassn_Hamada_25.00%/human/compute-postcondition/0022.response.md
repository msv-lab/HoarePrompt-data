The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `size`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `size`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `size` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`.
- `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `size` must remain greater than `i`, so `size` must be greater than 1.

State: **`size` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `number` remains in the range \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `sequence` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `size - 1`, but the element at index `size - result - 1` is now `sequence[size - result - 1] + result`, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
