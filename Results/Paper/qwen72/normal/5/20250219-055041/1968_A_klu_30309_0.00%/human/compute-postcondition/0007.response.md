Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is `x - 1`, `y` is `x - 1`, and `x` is divisible by `y` (i.e., `x % y == 0`). Additionally, 2 * y is less than x.**

The value of `max_val` is now updated to `x - 1`, which is the same as the value of `y`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
