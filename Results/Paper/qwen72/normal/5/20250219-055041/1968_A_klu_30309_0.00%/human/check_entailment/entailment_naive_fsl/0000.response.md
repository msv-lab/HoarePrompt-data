Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `x` is a prime number. For prime numbers, the only divisor is 1, and the function should return 1 as the optimal `y` because it is the only valid `y` (1 â‰¤ y < x) that satisfies the condition. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not return 1 for prime numbers. For example, if `x = 7`, the function should return 1, but it returns 6, which is incorrect. The function should return 1 for any prime number `x` to be correct.
