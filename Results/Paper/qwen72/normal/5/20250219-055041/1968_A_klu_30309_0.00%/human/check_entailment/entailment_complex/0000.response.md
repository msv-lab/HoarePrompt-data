Reasoning:

The program aims to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The function `func_1` attempts to achieve this by iterating over possible values of \( y \) in descending order from \( x-1 \) to 2. It checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)). If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \), it further checks if \( 2 \times y \ge x \). If this condition is met, it returns \( y \) immediately. If not, it updates `max_val` to \( y \) and continues the loop.

However, the logic in the function can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Divisibility Check**: The condition \( x \% y == 0 \) ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \). This is a good starting point because \( \gcd(x, y) = y \) when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).

2. **Maximization Condition**: The condition \( 2 \times y \ge x \) is used to ensure that \( y \) is as large as possible while still being a divisor of \( x \). This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( 2 \times y \ge x \), then \( y \) is at least \( \frac{x}{2} \), which is the largest possible \( y \) that is less than \( x \).

3. **Return Value**: If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 \times y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) found during the iteration. If no divisors are found, it returns 1.

The function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \) and is less than \( x \). This \( y \) will indeed maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( \gcd(x, y) = y \) for divisors of \( x \), and the largest divisor will give the highest value of \( y + y \).

However, the function could be simplified to directly return the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \), without the need for the additional check \( 2 \times y \ge x \). This is because the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) will always be \( \frac{x}{2} \) if \( x \) is even, and the largest odd divisor if \( x \) is odd.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the function works correctly and returns the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
