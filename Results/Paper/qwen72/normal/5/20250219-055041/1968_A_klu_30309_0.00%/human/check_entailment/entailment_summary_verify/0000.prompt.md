You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750
    3

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest integer `y` such that 2 <= y < x and `x % y == 0`. If no such `y` exists, the function returns 1. The function aims to find the `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `x` is a prime number. For prime numbers, the only divisor is 1, and the function should return 1 as the optimal `y` because it is the only valid `y` (1 ≤ y < x) that satisfies the condition. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not return 1 for prime numbers. For example, if `x = 7`, the function should return 1, but it returns 6, which is incorrect. The function should return 1 for any prime number `x` to be correct.
