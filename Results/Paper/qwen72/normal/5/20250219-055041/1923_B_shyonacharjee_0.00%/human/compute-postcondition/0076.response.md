Output State: **`n` and `k` are the first and second input integers respectively, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If at any point `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, `success` is False and the loop exits. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**
