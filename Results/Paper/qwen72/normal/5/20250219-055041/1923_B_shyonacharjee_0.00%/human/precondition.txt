The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x` of length `n`. The integers in `a` are such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the integers in `x` are such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
