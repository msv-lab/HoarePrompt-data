The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and the loop has just started. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers input by the user, `positions` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the initial `total_bullets_used` plus `bullets_needed`, `i` is 1, `position` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`. If the sum of `total_bullets_used` and `bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, `success` is False, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `success` remains True.**
