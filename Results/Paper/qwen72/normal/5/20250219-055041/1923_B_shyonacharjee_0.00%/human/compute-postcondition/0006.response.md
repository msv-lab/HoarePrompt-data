Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `healths` is a list of integers input by the user, `positions` is a list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `total_bullets_used` to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, and `monsters`, along with the new value of `total_bullets_used`.
