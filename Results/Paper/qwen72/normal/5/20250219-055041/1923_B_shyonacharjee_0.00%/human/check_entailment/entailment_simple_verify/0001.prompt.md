You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. For each test case, `n` and `k` were the input integers, `healths` and `positions` were the lists of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` and `health` are the values from the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of the last `position`, `time_available` is equal to the last `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to the last `health`, and `success` is True if the total bullets used did not exceed the time available for any monster, otherwise `success` is False.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets you can fire per second `k`.
   - It then reads the healths of the monsters and their positions.

2. **Monster Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (i.e., `abs(position)`). This is a crucial step because the closer a monster is, the sooner it will reach the character, and thus, it should be prioritized for elimination.

3. **Bullets and Time Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `total_bullets_used` to 0 and `success` to True.
   - It iterates through each monster in the sorted list.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character (`distance = abs(position)`).
   - The available time to kill the monster is equal to its distance (`time_available = distance`).
   - The number of bullets needed to kill the monster is equal to its health (`bullets_needed = health`).

4. **Survival Check:**
   - The program checks if the total number of bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the available time. If it does, the character cannot survive, and `success` is set to False.
   - If the character can survive, it adds the bullets needed to `total_bullets_used`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all monsters for a test case, the program prints 'YES' if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies that the closer a monster is, the sooner it must be killed.
- The logic for checking if the total number of bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the available time is sound.
- The program does not account for the number of bullets `k` that can be fired per second, which is a critical part of the problem. The program should ensure that the number of bullets fired in any second does not exceed `k`.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not consider the constraint on the number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`). The program should ensure that the number of bullets fired in any second does not exceed `k`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the number of bullets fired in any second does not exceed `k`. We can do this by keeping track of the number of bullets fired in each second and ensuring it does not exceed `k`.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        time_to_kill = [0] * (n + 1)  # Track the number of bullets fired in each second
        success = True
        for (position, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(position)
            if health > distance * k:
                success = False
                break
            time_to_kill[distance] += health
            if time_to_kill[distance] > k * distance:
                success = False
                break
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- We introduce a list `time_to_kill` to keep track of the total number of bullets fired in each second.
- For each monster, we check if the health of the monster is greater than the product of the distance and the number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`). If it is, the character cannot survive, and we set `success` to False.
- We add the health of the monster to the corresponding second in `time_to_kill`.
- We check if the total number of bullets fired in any second exceeds the product of the distance and `k`. If it does, the character cannot survive, and we set `success` to False.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the provided fix is correct.)
