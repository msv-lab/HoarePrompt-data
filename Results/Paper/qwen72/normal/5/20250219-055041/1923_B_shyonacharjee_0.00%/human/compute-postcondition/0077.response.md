The code snippet `healths = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `healths`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are the first and second input integers respectively, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters processed, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, and `success` remains True unless `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available` at any point.**
