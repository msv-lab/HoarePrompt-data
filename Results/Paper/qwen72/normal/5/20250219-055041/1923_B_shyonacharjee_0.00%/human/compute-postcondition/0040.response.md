Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `healths` is the list of integers input by the user, `positions` is the list of integers input by the user, `monsters` is the list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters that were processed before the loop exited or completed, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completed without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index of the last monster processed before the loop exited, `position` is the first element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the last tuple processed in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `success` is False if the loop exited due to the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` being met, otherwise `success` is True.**

Explanation:
- The code `healths = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `healths`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `positions`, `monsters`, `total_bullets_used`, `i`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `success` remain unchanged.
- The only variable that is updated is `healths`, which now holds the list of integers provided by the user.
