The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the strings `s1` and `s2`. `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, representing the initial and desired positions of cats in the boxes, respectively. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where '0' in `s1` corresponds to '1' in `s2`, and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where '1' in `s1` corresponds to '0' in `s2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. It returns the maximum number of changes required to convert the initial positions of cats (`s1`) to the desired positions of cats (`s2`), where changes can be either adding a cat (changing '0' to '1') or removing a cat (changing '1' to '0').**
