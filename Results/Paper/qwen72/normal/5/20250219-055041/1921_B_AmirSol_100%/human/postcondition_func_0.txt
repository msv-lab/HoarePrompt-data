The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1` (a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters), and `s2` (another string of the same length consisting of '0' and '1' characters). It returns the maximum number of changes required to transform the initial positions of cats (`s1`) into the desired positions of cats (`s2`). These changes can be either adding a cat (changing '0' to '1') or removing a cat (changing '1' to '0').
