Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds.
- Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other.
- If they are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('STAIR')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a `print` statement that prints the string `'STAIR'`.
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement is independent of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'STAIR'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **STAIR**
