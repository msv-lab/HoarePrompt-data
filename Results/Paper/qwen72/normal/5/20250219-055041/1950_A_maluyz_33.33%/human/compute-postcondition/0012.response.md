Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that \(a < b < c\).
- Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal.
- The maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not `b`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
