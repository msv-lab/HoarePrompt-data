### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled with `t = int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())`. This correctly parses the input as specified in the problem description.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The function checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is correct and matches the problem description.
   - The function checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are equal. This is also correct and matches the problem description, but it is not necessary to check this condition explicitly because it is already covered by the `else` clause.
   - The function checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a peak. This is correct and matches the problem description for a peak, where `b` is the maximum and `a` and `c` are not equal to `b`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "STAIR" if `a < b < c`.
   - The function prints "PEAK" if `max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - The function prints "NONE" in all other cases, which correctly handles the remaining scenarios.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal (though this is redundant with the `else` clause).
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the given conditions. The input and output handling is also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
