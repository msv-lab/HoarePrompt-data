Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- It is not the case that `a < b < c`.
- Additionally, `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal to each other.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will print the string 'NONE' regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` because the string 'NONE' is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions.

Output: **NONE**
