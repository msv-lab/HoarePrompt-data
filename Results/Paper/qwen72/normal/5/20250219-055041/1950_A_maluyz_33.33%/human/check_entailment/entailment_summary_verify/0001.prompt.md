You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (digits between 0 and 9). For each test case, the function prints one of the following strings based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `c`: 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of the three and `a` and `c` are not equal to `b`, or 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Equal Digits Condition:**
   - The program checks if all three digits are equal using the condition `a == b == c`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if all digits are equal, they do not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This is correct because a peak is defined by the condition `a < b > c`, and if `b` is the maximum of the three digits, it implies that `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

5. **None Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE".
   - This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they must be "NONE".

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description. It reads the input correctly, checks the conditions for a stair, peak, and none, and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
