Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `t-1` (since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`). For each of the `t` test cases, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will have been input as digits, and the loop will have checked the conditions for each set of inputs. If `a < b < c`, the loop will have printed 'STAIR'. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, the loop will have printed 'NONE'. If the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`, the loop will have printed 'PEAK'. Otherwise, the loop will have printed 'NONE'. The initial condition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 remains unchanged.
