Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `i` is 2.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
   - If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds.
   - Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
   - If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other.
   - If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet simply contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'NONE'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and relationships for the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the `print` statement in the code snippet.
- The `print` statement does not reference any of the variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Output: **NONE**
