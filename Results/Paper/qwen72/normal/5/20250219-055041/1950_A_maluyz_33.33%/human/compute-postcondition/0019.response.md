Let's break down the initial state and the given Python code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
4. If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds.
5. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
6. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other.
7. If they are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NONE')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NONE'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and relationships between the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement in the given code snippet.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, or `i`.

### Output:
Output: **NONE**
