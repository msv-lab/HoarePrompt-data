Reasoning:  
The function `func()` is designed to solve the problem as described. It reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` and determines whether they form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions provided.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t = int(input())` correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` correctly reads three digits for each test case.

2. **Conditions:**
   - `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair. This is correct.
   - `elif a == b == c:` checks if all three digits are equal. If they are, the function prints "NONE". This is correct.
   - `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits. This is intended to identify a peak, but it is not entirely correct. A peak should be identified by the condition `a < b > c`, not just `max(a, b, c) == b`. For example, `3 4 1` is a peak, but `3 4 4` is not a peak, even though `b` is the maximum in both cases.
   - `else:` prints "NONE" if none of the above conditions are met. This is correct.

3. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints "STAIR" for a stair and "NONE" for neither.
   - However, the condition for a peak is not correctly implemented, which can lead to incorrect outputs for some cases.

Given the issue with the peak condition, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
