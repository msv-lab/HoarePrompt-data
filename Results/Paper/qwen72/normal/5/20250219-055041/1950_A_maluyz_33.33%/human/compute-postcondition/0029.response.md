Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer such that \(2 \leq t \leq 1000\).
2. `i` is 2.
3. `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
4. If `a < b < c`, then this relationship holds.
5. Otherwise, it is not the case that `a < b < c`.
6. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, then they are equal to each other.
7. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are not all equal, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is either `a` or `c`, but not `b`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('PEAK')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'PEAK'`.
- The initial state provides conditions on the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these conditions do not affect the execution of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement will always print the string `'PEAK'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **PEAK**
