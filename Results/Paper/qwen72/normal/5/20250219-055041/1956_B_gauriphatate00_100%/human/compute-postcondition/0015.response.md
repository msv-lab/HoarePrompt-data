Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each integer `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all iterations, the list `a` remains unchanged. The dictionary `count_a` will contain each unique integer from the list `a` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. Since each integer in `a` can appear at most twice, the values in `count_a` will be either 1 or 2.
