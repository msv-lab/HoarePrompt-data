Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5) and must have at least three elements. `num` is the third element in the list `a`. `count_a` is a dictionary with the first element of `a` as a key and its value increased by 1. If `num` is in `count_a`, the value of `num` in `count_a` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the value of `num` in `count_a` is set to 1.***
