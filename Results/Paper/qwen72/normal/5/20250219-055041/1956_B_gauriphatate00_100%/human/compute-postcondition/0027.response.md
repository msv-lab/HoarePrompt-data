The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is 2 and `n` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be at least 3.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 · 10^5), `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. `n` must be at least 3, `num` is 3. If `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a` and `count_a[num]` is 2, then `max_score` is 2. Otherwise, `max_score` is 1.**
