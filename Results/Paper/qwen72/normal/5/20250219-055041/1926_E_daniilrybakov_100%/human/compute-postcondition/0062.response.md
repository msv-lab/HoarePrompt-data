Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`) remain unchanged. The new value of `x` is calculated based on the current value of `n`.
