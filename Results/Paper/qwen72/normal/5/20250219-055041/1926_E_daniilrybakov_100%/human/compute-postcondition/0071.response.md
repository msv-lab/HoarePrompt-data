The value of `n` is updated to `n //= 2`, which means `n` is divided by 2 and the result is assigned back to `n`. The value of `n` must be at least 1, so the new value of `n` will be `(n // 2) // 2` or `n // 4`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is `(n // 4)` and must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**
