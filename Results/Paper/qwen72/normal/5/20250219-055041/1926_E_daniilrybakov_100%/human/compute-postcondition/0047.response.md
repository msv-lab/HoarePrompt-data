Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `n` is now `n // 2` and must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `((n // 2) + 1) // 2`. If `s` is less than `k` and `k` is less than or equal to `s + x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `x` remain as described.**
