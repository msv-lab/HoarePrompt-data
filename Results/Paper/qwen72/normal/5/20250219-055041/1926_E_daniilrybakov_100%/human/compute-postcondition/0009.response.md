Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers and `n` must be non-zero, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is now `n // 2`, and `s < k` and `k <= s + x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
