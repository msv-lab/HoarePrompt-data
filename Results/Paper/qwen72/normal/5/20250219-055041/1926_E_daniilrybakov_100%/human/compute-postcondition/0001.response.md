The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the range function that depends on `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` are not directly relevant to the execution of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
