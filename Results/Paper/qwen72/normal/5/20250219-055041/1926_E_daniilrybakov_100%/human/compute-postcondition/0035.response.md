The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means `n` is divided by 2 and the result is the integer part of the division. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer and must be non-zero, but now `n` is equal to `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2` (where `n` is the original value before the division).
