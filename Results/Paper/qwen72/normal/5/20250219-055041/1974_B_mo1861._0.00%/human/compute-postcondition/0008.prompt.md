Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i, c in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
    char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))`, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with two entries where the keys are the first and second unique characters in the sorted set of `b`, and the values are `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))` and `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1 - 1))` respectively, `i` is 1, `c` is the second unique character in the sorted set of `b`, `sorted(set(b))` must have at least 2 unique characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with three entries where the keys are the first, second, and third unique characters in the sorted set of `b`, and the values are `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))`, `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 1 - 1))`, and `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2 - 1))` respectively, `i` is 2, `c` is the third unique character in the sorted set of `b`, `sorted(set(b))` must have at least 3 unique characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
