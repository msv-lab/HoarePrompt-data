The loop head involves the variables `i`, `c`, and the expression `sorted(set(b))`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop head will change after the previous iteration.

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
2. **`c`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`. In the next iteration, `c` will be the second unique character in the sorted set of `b`.
3. **`sorted(set(b))`**: This is a list of unique characters from `b`, sorted in ascending order. Since `b` is a string with at least one unique character, `sorted(set(b))` will have at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `sorted(set(b))` must have at least two elements.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 0 - 1))`, `i` is 1, `c` is the second unique character in the sorted set of `b`, `sorted(set(b))` must have at least 2 unique characters**
