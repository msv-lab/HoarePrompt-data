Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `char_map` is a dictionary with entries for each unique character in the sorted set of `b`, where the keys are the unique characters and the values are characters calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` for each unique character, with `i` ranging from 0 to the number of unique characters minus 1; `s` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for c in b:
    s += char_map[c]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least one unique character, `c` is the first character in `b`, `s` is updated by appending the value of `char_map[c]` to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least two unique characters, `c` is the second character in `b`, `s` is updated by appending the value of `char_map[c]` to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with at least three unique characters, `c` is the third character in `b`, `s` is updated by appending the value of `char_map[c]` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
