Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it constructs the `char_map` dictionary. The program incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to a character based on the length of `b`, rather than the length of the set of distinct characters in `b`.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-i-1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

In the corrected version, `distinct_chars` is a list of the distinct characters in `b`, sorted in alphabetical order. The `char_map` dictionary is then constructed by mapping each character in `distinct_chars` to its symmetric character in the same list. This ensures that the first character in `distinct_chars` is mapped to the last, the second to the second last, and so on, which is the correct approach for decoding the string.

Let's test the corrected function with the provided example:

```python
# Test the corrected function
num_test_cases = 5
test_cases = [
    (10, "serofedsoc"),
    (3, "ttf"),
    (9, "tlrhgmaoi"),
    (1, "w"),
    (15, "hnndledmnhlttin")
]

for num_chars, b in test_cases:
    print(func_1(b))
```

Expected output:
```
codeforces
fft
algorithm
w
meetinthemiddle
```

This should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
