Reasoning:

The program is designed to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm for encoding involves creating a string `r` of all distinct characters in `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, the program must reverse this process.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `num_chars` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Character Mapping**:
     - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character.
     - It sorts the set of unique characters in `b` alphabetically and assigns each character a symmetric character based on its position in the sorted set.
     - The symmetric character is calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which is incorrect. The correct calculation should be based on the length of the set of unique characters, not the length of the entire string `b`.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The program iterates over each character in `b` and appends the corresponding character from `char_map` to the string `s`.
   - Finally, it returns the decoded string `s`.

**Key Issue**:
- The mapping of characters in `char_map` is incorrect. The symmetric character should be based on the position within the set of unique characters, not the length of the entire string `b`. The correct mapping should use `len(set(b))` instead of `len(b)`.

**Corrected Code**:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - i - 1] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not produce the correct decoded string because the mapping is based on the wrong length.

Correctness: **False**
