### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "cdefors", 'c' is replaced by 's', 'd' by 'r', 'e' by 'o', and so on.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we need to create the same auxiliary string `r` and then map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its original character in `s`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and then the string `b` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` to store the mapping of each character in `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.
     - It sorts the set of characters in `b` to get the auxiliary string `r` in alphabetical order.
     - It then maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r` using the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. This formula is incorrect because it should map characters based on their position in `r`, not based on the length of `b`.

5. **Correct Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should be based on the length of `r`, not `b`.
   - The correct formula should be `char_map[c] = list(sorted(set(b)))[len(r) - i - 1]`.

6. **Constructing the Decoded String:**
   - The program constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it uses the wrong formula to map characters in the auxiliary string `r`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    r = sorted(set(b))
    for i, c in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = r[len(r) - i - 1]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Correctness:
- After the correction, the program is **correct** because it correctly maps each character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding character in the original string `s`.

Correctness: **False** (Before correction)  
Correctness: **True** (After correction)
