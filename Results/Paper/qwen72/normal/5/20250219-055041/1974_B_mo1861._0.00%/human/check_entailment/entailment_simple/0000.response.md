Reasoning:  
The program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm for encoding involves creating a sorted, unique set of characters from the original string and then replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric counterpart from this sorted set. To decode the string, the program needs to reverse this process.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the decoding function `func_1`. The flaw lies in the way the `char_map` dictionary is constructed. The program maps each unique character in the encoded string `b` to a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. This calculation is incorrect because it should map the characters based on the length of the unique set of characters, not the length of the entire string `b`.

For example, if the encoded string `b` is "serofedsoc", the unique characters are "cdefors". The correct mapping should be:
- 'c' -> 's'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'e' -> 'o'
- 'f' -> 'f'
- 'o' -> 'e'
- 'r' -> 'd'
- 's' -> 'c'

However, the program incorrectly maps the characters based on the length of `b` (10), which would result in:
- 'c' -> 't'
- 'd' -> 's'
- 'e' -> 'r'
- 'f' -> 'q'
- 'o' -> 'l'
- 'r' -> 'k'
- 's' -> 'j'

This incorrect mapping will not produce the original string.

To fix this, the mapping should be based on the length of the unique set of characters, not the length of the entire string `b`.

Correctness: **False**
