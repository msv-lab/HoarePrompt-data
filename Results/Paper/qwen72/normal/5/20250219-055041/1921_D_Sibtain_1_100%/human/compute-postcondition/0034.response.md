Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `i` is 1 if `t2` > `t1`, otherwise `i` is 2, `j` is 4 if `t2` > `t1`, otherwise `j` is 2, `t2` is updated to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`.**
