Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of elements in array `c` is exactly equal to the number of elements in array `a` and the elements in `c` are all the same but different from the elements in `a`. In such a scenario, the program should maximize the difference by selecting the largest possible elements from `c` that are different from `a`, but the current logic does not ensure this.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 3
1 1 1
2 2 2
```
The expected output should be 3, because the maximum difference is achieved by selecting all elements from `c` (i.e., `2, 2, 2`), resulting in:
```
D = |1-2| + |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
```
However, the program will output 0, because it incorrectly assumes that if the lengths of `a` and `c` are the same and all elements in `a` are the same, the only possible difference is 0. This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected.
