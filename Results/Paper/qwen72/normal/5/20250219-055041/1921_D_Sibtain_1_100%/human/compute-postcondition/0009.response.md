Output State: **`n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `m` is the second integer. `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, and `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order. If all elements in `a` are the same and all elements in `c` are the same, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program proceeds to the next statement after the if block.**
