Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5), a_i is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b_i is a list of m positive integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:
        print(0)
        continue
    a.sort()
    c.sort(reverse=True)
    if len(a) == 1:
        print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))
        continue
    i, j, ans = 0, 1, 0
    for k in range(len(a)):
        t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
        t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
        if t2 > t1:
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        ans += max(t1, t2)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c` for each iteration, `i` is the number of iterations where `t1` was not greater than `t2`, `j` is the number of iterations where `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, and `k` is `len(a) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `m` are assigned integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is the sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is the number of times `t1` was not greater than `t2`, `j` is the number of times `t2` was greater than `t1` plus 1, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other, or if `len(a) == 1`, the program retains the above state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `i` is the number of iterations where `t2 <= t1`, `j` is 1 + the number of iterations where `t2 > t1`, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences (`max(t1, t2)`) for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
