The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5) representing the lengths of the lists `a_i` and `b_i`, respectively. `a_i` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and `b_i` is a list of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5), a list `a_i` of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and a list `b_i` of `m` positive integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided.**
