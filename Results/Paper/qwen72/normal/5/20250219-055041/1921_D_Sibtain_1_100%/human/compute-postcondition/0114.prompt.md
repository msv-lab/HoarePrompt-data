Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are assigned new integer values from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input and must have at least one element, `c` is a sorted list of integers read from the new input in descending order, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `k` is `len(a) - 1`, `_` is incremented by 1, and the total number of iterations specified by `int(input())` must be greater than the current value of `_`. If `a` and `c` both contain only one unique element and that element is the same in both lists, then all these conditions are retained. Otherwise, the conditions are also retained, but no additional changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, `j` is increased by 1. If `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`, `i` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`, and the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `k` is 2, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is increased by the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. `i` and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
