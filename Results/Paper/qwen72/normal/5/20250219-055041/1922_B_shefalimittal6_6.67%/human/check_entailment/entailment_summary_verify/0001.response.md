### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is done efficiently using a single loop.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle based on the following logic:
     - **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length.**
       - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these is given by the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
       - This is correct because if all three sticks have the same length, they can form an equilateral triangle.
     - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length, and the third stick has a different length.**
       - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these is given by `math.comb(cnt, 2)`.
       - For each pair of sticks, the program then considers all other sticks (with different lengths) and adds the number of ways to choose the third stick from these other sticks. This is done by multiplying `math.comb(cnt, 2)` by the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths.
       - This logic is incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality theorem. Specifically, it assumes that any two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length can form a triangle, which is not always true. For example, if the lengths of the sticks are \(2^1, 2^1, 2^3\), the program will count this as a valid triangle, but it is not possible to form a non-degenerate triangle with sides \(2, 2, 8\) because the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides (2 + 2 = 4) is not greater than the length of the longest side (8).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length.**
  - This is correct because if all three sticks have the same length, they can form an equilateral triangle.
  - The combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length.

- **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length, and the third stick has a different length.**
  - This is incorrect. The program assumes that any two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length can form a triangle, but this is not always true.
  - The program fails to check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where two sticks have the same length and the third stick has a different length. It fails to check the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining whether a set of three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
