Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res`, and `res` is now `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated to `res` + `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
