Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
