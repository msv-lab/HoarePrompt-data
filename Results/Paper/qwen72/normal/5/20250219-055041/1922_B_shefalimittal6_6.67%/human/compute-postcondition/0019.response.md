Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is the value of the first entry in `num_of_lens` and is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its previous value.
- The previous value of `res` was `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- Therefore, the new value of `res` is `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `cnt`, and `total_sum` remain unchanged.
