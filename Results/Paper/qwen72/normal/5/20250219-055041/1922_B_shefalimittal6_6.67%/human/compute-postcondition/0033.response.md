Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key-value pairs representing the counts of integers in `nums`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is the sum of all combinations of 3 and 2 for each count in `num_of_lens` values, where combinations of 3 are added directly to `res` if the count is 3 or more, and combinations of 2 are multiplied by the sum of all other counts and added to `res` if the count is 2 or more.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The dictionary `num_of_lens` still contains the counts of each integer in the list `nums`.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged.
- The variable `res` is updated to include the sum of all combinations of 3 elements (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`) for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that is 3 or more, plus the sum of all combinations of 2 elements (`math.comb(cnt, 2)`) for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens` that is 2 or more, multiplied by the sum of all other counts in `num_of_lens` (excluding the current `cnt`).
