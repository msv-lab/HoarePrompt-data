Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `nums` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the third value in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt` and the second value, `res` is increased by the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, calculated using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `x`, `cnt`, `total_sum`) remain unchanged.
- The combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time is a specific value based on the current value of `cnt`.
- The conditions and values of the initial state are still valid after the code execution.
