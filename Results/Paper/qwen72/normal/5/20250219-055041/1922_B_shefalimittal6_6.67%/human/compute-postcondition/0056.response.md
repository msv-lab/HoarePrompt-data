Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to it.
- `math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 3 at a time.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged.
- If `cnt` is less than 3, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` will be 0, so `res` will remain unchanged.
- If `cnt` is 3 or greater, `res` will be increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
