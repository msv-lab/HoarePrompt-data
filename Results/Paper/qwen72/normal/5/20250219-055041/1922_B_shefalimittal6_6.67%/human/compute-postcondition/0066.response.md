Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is incremented by the number of combinations of `cnt` taken 2 at a time multiplied by `total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.***
