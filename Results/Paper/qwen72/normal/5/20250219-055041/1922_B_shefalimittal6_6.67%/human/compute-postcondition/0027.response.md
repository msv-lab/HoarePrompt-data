The only objects in the loop head are the variables `cnt` and the dictionary `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the dictionary `num_of_lens`. If `num_of_lens` has at least one more key-value pair, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the second entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`, and `res` has been updated based on the conditions given.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_of_lens` must have at least three key-value pairs. The next `cnt` will be the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least three key-value pairs, `cnt` is the value of the third entry in `num_of_lens`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except the current `cnt`. If the previous `cnt` was greater than or equal to 3, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` plus the previous value of `res`, and `res` is now `res` plus `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If the previous `cnt` was less than 3, `res` remains 0.**
