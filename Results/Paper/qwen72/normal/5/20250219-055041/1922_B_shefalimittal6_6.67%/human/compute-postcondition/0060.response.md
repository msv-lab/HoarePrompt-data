Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, and `res` is 0. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except for the value of `cnt`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
