The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `nums`. If `nums` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `x` will take the value of the first element in `nums` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in the list `nums`**
