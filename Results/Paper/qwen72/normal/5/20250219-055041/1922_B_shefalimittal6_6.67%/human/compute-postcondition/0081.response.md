To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`. The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, meaning there must be at least one integer in `nums` that appears at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is greater than or equal to 1 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant to the loop head)
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `nums` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `nums`
- `res` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop executed (relevant to the loop head, but indirectly through `num_of_lens`)
- `x` is the last element in the list `nums` (not relevant to the loop head)

The loop will execute if `num_of_lens` has at least one value. Therefore, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute. The variable `cnt` will be the first value in `num_of_lens` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the last element in the list `nums`, `cnt` is the first value in `num_of_lens`**
