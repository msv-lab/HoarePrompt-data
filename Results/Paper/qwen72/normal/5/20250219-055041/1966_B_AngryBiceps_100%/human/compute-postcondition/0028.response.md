Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each input string in `a` concatenated together, `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each input string in `a` concatenated together, and `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` and the last string in `a` each consist of a single repeated character and they are not equal, then the condition is met. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` consists of more than one unique character, or the last string in `a` consists of more than one unique character, or the first string in `a` is equal to the last string in `a`, or `first_row` and `last_row` are the same.**
