Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string.**

The code snippet initializes `last_row` to an empty string. The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `first_row` remain unchanged. Therefore, `last_row` is now also an empty string.
