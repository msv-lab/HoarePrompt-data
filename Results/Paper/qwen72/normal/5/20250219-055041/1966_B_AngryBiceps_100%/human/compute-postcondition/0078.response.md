Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **`t` is greater than 0**: This indicates that there is at least one test case.
2. **`n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0**: This means `n` is a positive integer representing the number of strings in the list `a`.
3. **`m` is the second input integer**: This is another integer, but its specific value is not directly relevant to the print statement.
4. **`a` is a list containing `n` input strings**: This list `a` contains `n` strings.
5. **`first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together**: For example, if `a = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']`, then `first_row` would be `'adg'`.
6. **`last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each of the `n` input strings concatenated together**: For example, if `a = ['abc', 'def', 'ghi']`, then `last_row` would be `'cfi'`.
7. **`i` is `n-1`**: This means `i` is the index of the last string in the list `a`.
8. **Additional conditions**:
   - Either the first string in the list `a` contains more than one distinct character, or the last string in the list `a` contains more than one distinct character, or the first string in the list `a` is the same as the last string in the list `a`.
   - Either the length of the set of `first_row` is not 1, or the length of the set of `last_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is the same as `last_row`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will always execute because the conditions ensure that at least one of the following is true:
- The first string in `a` has more than one distinct character.
- The last string in `a` has more than one distinct character.
- The first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`.
- The length of the set of `first_row` is not 1.
- The length of the set of `last_row` is not 1.
- `first_row` is the same as `last_row`.

Since the conditions guarantee that at least one of these is true, the print statement will always output 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
