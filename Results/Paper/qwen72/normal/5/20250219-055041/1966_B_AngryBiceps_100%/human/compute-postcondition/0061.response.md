Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`**

The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last (and only) string in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`. Since `a` contains only one input string, `a[-1]` refers to that string, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that string. The other variables remain unchanged.
