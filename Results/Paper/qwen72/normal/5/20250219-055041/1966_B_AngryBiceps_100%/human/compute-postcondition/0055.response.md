Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing `n` input strings, `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`, `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of a single repeated character and the last string in `a` also consists of a single repeated character, and these two strings are not the same, then this condition is true. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the last string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`, or the first row has more than one distinct character, or the last row has more than one distinct character, or the first row is the same as the last row.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` to the first and second input integers, respectively. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
