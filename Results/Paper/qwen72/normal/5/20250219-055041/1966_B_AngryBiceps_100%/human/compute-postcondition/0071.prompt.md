Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n-1`. If the first string in `a` consists of a single repeated character and the last string in `a` also consists of a single repeated character, and these two strings are not the same, then this condition is true. Otherwise, either the first string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the last string in `a` has more than one distinct character, or the first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`, or the first row has more than one distinct character, or the last row has more than one distinct character, or the first row is the same as the last row.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing one input string, `first_row` is the first character of the input string, `last_row` is the last character of the input string, `i` is `n-1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing the initial input string and a new input string, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string, `i` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 0, `m` is the second input integer, `a` is a list containing the initial input string, the new input string, and another new input string, `first_row` is the first character of the initial input string concatenated with the first character of the new input string and the first character of the last input string, `last_row` is the last character of the initial input string concatenated with the last character of the new input string and the last character of the last input string, `i` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
