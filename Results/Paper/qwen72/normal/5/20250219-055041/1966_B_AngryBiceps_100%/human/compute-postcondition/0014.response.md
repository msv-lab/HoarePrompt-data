Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing three input strings, `first_row` is the first character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the first character of the input string in `a` at index 1, `last_row` is the last character of the input string in `a` at index 0 concatenated with the last character of the input string in `a` at index 1, `i` is 2**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(input())` adds a new input string to the list `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` contains two input strings, so after the code execution, `a` contains three input strings.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `first_row`, `last_row`, and `i` remain unchanged.
