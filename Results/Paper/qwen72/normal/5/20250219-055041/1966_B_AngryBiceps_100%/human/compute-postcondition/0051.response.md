Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is the first input integer.
   - `m` is the second input integer.
   - `a` is a list containing `n` input strings.
   - `first_row` is a string composed of the first characters of each string in `a`.
   - `last_row` is a string composed of the last characters of each string in `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - The condition states that either:
     - The first string in `a` has more than one distinct character.
     - The last string in `a` has more than one distinct character.
     - The first string in `a` is the same as the last string in `a`.
     - The first row has more than one distinct character.
     - The last row has more than one distinct character.
     - The first row is the same as the last row.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides several conditions, but none of these conditions affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, `last_row`, or `i`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
