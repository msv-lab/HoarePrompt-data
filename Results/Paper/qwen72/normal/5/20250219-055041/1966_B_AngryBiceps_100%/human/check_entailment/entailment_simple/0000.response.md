### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The program provided checks the following conditions for each test case:
1. If the first row and the last row each consist of a single repeated character (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B') and they are not equal, it prints 'NO'.
2. If the first column and the last column each consist of a single repeated character (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B') and they are not equal, it prints 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Let's analyze why these conditions are sufficient:

1. **First and Last Row Check:**
   - If the first row and the last row are both entirely one color (either all 'W' or all 'B') but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because any operation involving these rows would not change the color of the other rows, and the grid would remain with at least two different colors.
   - If the first row and the last row are the same color, it is possible to make the entire grid that color by selecting the first and last row and performing the operation.

2. **First and Last Column Check:**
   - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are both entirely one color (either all 'W' or all 'B') but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because any operation involving these columns would not change the color of the other columns, and the grid would remain with at least two different colors.
   - If the first column and the last column are the same color, it is possible to make the entire grid that color by selecting the first and last column and performing the operation.

3. **General Case:**
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the grid can be transformed to a single color. This is because there are no constraints that prevent the transformation. For example, if the first row and last row are not entirely the same color or if the first column and last column are not entirely the same color, it is always possible to perform operations to make the entire grid one color.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the conditions described in the problem and ensures that it prints 'NO' only when it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. The logic is sound and covers all necessary cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
