You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers such that 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers such that 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array, `i` is `len(array) - 1`, `len(array)` is the same as in the initial state.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`. The function modifies the input list `array` to be sorted in ascending order. The length of the list remains the same as in the initial state, and the elements are within the range 1 to 10^9.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer. The list data contains the input for t test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).

    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()

    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is `1 + t + t*n`, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the last element of `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It applies the function `func_1` to each test case's array of integers and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list. After the function concludes, `t` remains the integer value of the first element in the input data (1 <= t <= 500), and `results` is a list containing `t` return values from `func_1`. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - **Sorting the Array:** The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - **Calculating Beauty:** It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Absolute Differences:** The use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` ensures that the differences are always non-negative.
   - **Summing Differences:** The sum of these absolute differences is returned as the beauty.

3. **Optimality of Sorting:**
   - Sorting the array in ascending order is not the optimal way to maximize the beauty. The optimal way to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in such a way that the largest and smallest elements alternate. This will maximize the positive and negative differences, leading to the highest possible sum.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the array \([2, 1, 3]\), the optimal arrangement is \([1, 3, 2]\) or \([3, 1, 2]\), which gives a beauty of \(2\).
   - For the array \([69, 69, 69]\), any arrangement will result in a beauty of \(0\).
   - For the array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\), the optimal arrangement is \([43, 100, 54, 90, 80]\) or \([100, 43, 90, 54, 80]\), which gives a beauty of \(57\).

5. **Function 2:**
   - **Reading Input:** The function `func_2` reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - **Processing Test Cases:** It processes each test case by extracting the length \(n\) and the array elements.
   - **Calling Function 1:** It calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty of the array.
   - **Storing Results:** It stores the results in a list and prints them at the end.

6. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_2` is correct. It reads the input, splits it, and processes each test case as described.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order, which does not maximize the beauty as required by the problem.
   - The correct approach should involve sorting the array in a way that maximizes the differences between consecutive elements, such as alternating the largest and smallest elements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem. It sorts the array in ascending order, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).
