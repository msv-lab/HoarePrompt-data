The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `results`. If there are more elements in `results`, the loop will continue to the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least two return values of `func_1(array)`, and `result` is the second element of `results`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `result` must be the next element in `results`. Since `result` is currently the second element, the next element will be the third element. Therefore, `results` must have at least three elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least three return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the third element of `results`**
