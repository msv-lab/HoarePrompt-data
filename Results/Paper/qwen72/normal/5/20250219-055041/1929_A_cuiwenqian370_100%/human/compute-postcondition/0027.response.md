To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty list. Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `index` is `1 + t + t*n`.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`.
   - `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop head is `for result in results:`.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, and `t` must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` will be non-empty as long as `t` is at least 1.
   - `result` will be the first element of `results` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `results` is non-empty and `result` is the first element of `results`.

State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing at least one return value of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the first element of `results`**
