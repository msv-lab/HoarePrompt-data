Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical issue with the `func_1` function: it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum beauty as defined in the problem. The problem specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, without taking the absolute value.

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - To maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be non-negative, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

2. **Current Implementation of `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array, which is correct.
   - However, it calculates the sum of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`, which is incorrect because the absolute value is not required.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     3 4 3 3
     ```
   - The sorted array is `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
   - The correct beauty calculation should be:
     ```
     (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
     ```
   - The current implementation calculates:
     ```
     abs(3 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) + abs(4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1
     ```
   - In this specific example, the result is correct, but the logic is flawed. For other inputs, this could lead to incorrect results.

4. **Corrected Implementation**:
   - The corrected version of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(array):
         array.sort()
         beauty = 0
         for i in range(1, len(array)):
             beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
         return beauty
     ```

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case's array.
   - The function collects the results and prints them, which is in line with the problem's output requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the `func_1` function. The program as it stands is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's definition of beauty.

Final: **False**
