Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer. The list `data` now contains the split input from `sys.stdin`.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 500, and `data` is a list of strings where each string represents an integer. After executing the code snippet, `data` is updated to contain the input from `sys.stdin` split into a list of strings. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
