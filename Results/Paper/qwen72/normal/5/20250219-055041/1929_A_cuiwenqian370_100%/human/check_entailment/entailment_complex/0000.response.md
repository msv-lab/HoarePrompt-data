Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i - 1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order.

### Analysis of the Functions:

1. **func_1(array):**
   - **Input:** A list of integers `array` such that \(2 \leq \text{len(array)} \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq \text{array}[i] \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).
   - **Process:**
     - The array is sorted in ascending order.
     - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - **Output:** The sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - **Correctness:** The function correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty as required by the problem. The beauty is indeed maximized by sorting the array in ascending order, as the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

2. **func_2():**
   - **Input:** The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain multiple test cases.
   - **Process:**
     - The first line of input is read to determine the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case:
       - The length of the array `n` is read.
       - The next `n` integers are read and stored in `array`.
       - `func_1(array)` is called to calculate the beauty of the array.
       - The result is appended to the `results` list.
   - **Output:** The function prints the results for each test case.
   - **Correctness:** The function correctly processes the input, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results. The input and output handling is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are correctly implemented to solve the problem. The sorting in `func_1` ensures that the beauty is maximized, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Correctness: **True**
