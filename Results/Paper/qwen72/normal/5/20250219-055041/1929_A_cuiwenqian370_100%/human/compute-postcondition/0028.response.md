Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500.
   - `results` is a list containing at least one return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `result` is the first element of `results`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The variable `t` is defined as the integer value of the first element in the list `data`, and it must be within the range 1 to 500. However, the exact value of `t` is not provided, so we can only say it is an integer in that range.
   - The list `results` contains at least one return value from the function `func_1(array)`. The exact return value of `func_1(array)` is not provided, so we can only describe it based on the function's behavior.
   - The variable `result` is the first element of the list `results`. Since `results` contains at least one return value from `func_1(array)`, `result` will be that first return value.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the first element of the list `results`.
   - Since the exact return value of `func_1(array)` is not specified, we can only describe the output as the first return value of `func_1(array)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **result (where result is the first return value of `func_1(array)`)**
