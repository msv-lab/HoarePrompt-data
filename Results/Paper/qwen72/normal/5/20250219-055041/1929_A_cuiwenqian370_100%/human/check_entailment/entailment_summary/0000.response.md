Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key insight here is that the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Function Behavior**: `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly sorts the array and computes the sum of the absolute differences. However, the problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, \(a_i\) will always be greater than or equal to \(a_{i-1}\), so the absolute value is not necessary. Despite this, the function still computes the correct result because the absolute value of a non-negative difference is the difference itself.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Function Behavior**: `func_2` reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and applies `func_1` to each test case's array. It then prints the results.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly reads the input, processes the test cases, and prints the results. It uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once, which is efficient for large inputs. The function correctly splits the input and processes each test case as described in the problem.

### Combined Correctness:
- **Overall Program**: The program as a whole correctly processes multiple test cases and applies the correct logic to each array to compute the maximum beauty. The sorting and summing of differences in `func_1` align with the problem's requirements, and `func_2` correctly handles the input and output format.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
