Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Functions:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers such that 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `array` is a sorted list of integers such that 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all i, `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the array, `i` is `len(array) - 1`, `len(array)` is the same as in the initial state.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `array`. The function modifies the input list `array` to be sorted in ascending order. The length of the list remains the same as in the initial state, and the elements are within the range 1 to 10^9.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer. The list data contains the input for t test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is `1 + t + t*n`, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the last element of `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It applies the function `func_1` to each test case's array of integers and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result in the list. After the function concludes, `t` remains the integer value of the first element in the input data (1 <= t <= 500), and `results` is a list containing `t` return values from `func_1`. The function does not return any value.
