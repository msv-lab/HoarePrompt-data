You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and data is a list of strings where each string represents an integer. The list data contains the input for t test cases, and each test case starts with an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is `1 + t + t*n`, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `1 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `2 + (t-1) + (t-1)*n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 500, `results` is a list containing `t` return values of `func_1(array)`, `result` is the last element of `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. It returns a result for each of the `t` test cases based on the provided inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
