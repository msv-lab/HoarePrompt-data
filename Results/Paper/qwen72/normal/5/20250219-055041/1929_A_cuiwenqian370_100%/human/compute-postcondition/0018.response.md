Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first element in the list `data` and must be in the range 1 <= t <= 499, `index` is `3 + 2*n`, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(array)` and the value of `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(array)`), `n` is the integer value of the element at the position `2 + n` in the list `data`, `array` is a list of `n` integers starting from the element at position `3 + n` in `data`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, and `results` already contains the return value of `func_1(array)`. Therefore, `results` now contains two elements, both of which are the return value of `func_1(array)`. All other variables (`t`, `index`, `n`, `array`) remain unchanged.
