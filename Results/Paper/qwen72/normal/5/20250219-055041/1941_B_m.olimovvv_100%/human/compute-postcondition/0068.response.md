Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`, `b[1]` is `b[1] - 2 * b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[0]`, `b[2]` is `b[2] - 2 * b[1]`, `b[3]` is `b[3] - b[1]`. If `b[1]` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `b`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` is executed with `i` being 1.
- This means `b[3]` is updated to `b[3] - b[1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
