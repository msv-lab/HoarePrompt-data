Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `b[0]` to `b[n-3]` are all 0, `b[n-2]` is `b[n-2] - 2 * b[n-3]`, and `b[n-1]` is `b[n-1] - b[n-3]`. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[n-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[n-1]` or `b[n-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all the iterations for each test case, the following conditions hold true:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 3 to 2 * 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is within the range 0 to 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- The variable `b` is a list of integers input by the user, and after the loop, the elements `b[0]` to `b[n-3]` are all 0.
- The element `b[n-2]` is updated to `b[n-2] - 2 * b[n-3]`.
- The element `b[n-1]` is updated to `b[n-1] - b[n-3]`.
- If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[n-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with the output 'NO'.
- If `b[n-1]` or `b[n-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'.
- Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
