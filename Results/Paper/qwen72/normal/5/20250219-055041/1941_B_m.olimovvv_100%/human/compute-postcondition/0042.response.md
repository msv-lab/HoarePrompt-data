Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[0]` is 0, `b[2]` is now `b[2] - b[1] * 2 - b[0]`. If `b[1]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` is executed, where `i` is 1.
- This means `b[3] -= b[1]`, but since `b[3]` is not mentioned in the initial state, it is not affected.
- The initial state already mentions that `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - b[0]` and then to `b[2] - b[1] * 2`.
- After executing the code, `b[2]` is further updated to `b[2] - b[0]`, which simplifies to `b[2] - b[1] * 2 - b[0]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `b[0]` remain unchanged.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement (`b[1] < 0`) is still valid and remains unchanged.
