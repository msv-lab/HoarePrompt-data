The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
- `a` is an input integer
- `b` is a list of integers input by the user
- `i` is `n - 3`
- `b[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 0 to `n - 3`
- `b[n-2]` is `b[n-2] - sum(b[i] for i in range(0, n-2, 1))`
- `b[n-1]` is `b[n-1] - sum(b[i] for i in range(0, n-1, 1))`
- If `b[n-2]` is not 0 or `b[n-1]` is not 0, the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, the program prints 'YES'.

After executing the code snippet:
- `b` is now a list of integers provided by the user, replacing the initial list of zeros.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `b[n-2]` and `b[n-1]` are no longer valid as `b` has been redefined.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`.**
