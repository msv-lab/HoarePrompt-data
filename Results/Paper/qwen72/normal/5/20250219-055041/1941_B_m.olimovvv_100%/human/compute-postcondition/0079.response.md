The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
