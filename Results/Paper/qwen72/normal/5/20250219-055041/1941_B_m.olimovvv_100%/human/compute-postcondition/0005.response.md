Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element \(a_j\) is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\).
- `b` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 0.
- The current value of `b[i]` is less than 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides information about the variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that `b[i]` is less than 0 does not affect the `print` statement because the statement is not conditional.

### Output:
Output: **NO**
