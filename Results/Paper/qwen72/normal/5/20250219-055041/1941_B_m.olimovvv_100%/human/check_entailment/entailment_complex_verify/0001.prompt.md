You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

                break

            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each element a_j is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, `b[0]` to `b[n-3]` are all 0, `b[n-2]` is `b[n-2] - 2 * b[n-3]`, and `b[n-1]` is `b[n-1] - b[n-3]`. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[n-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[n-1]` or `b[n-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `b` of `n` integers. For each test case, it modifies the elements of `b` according to a specific rule and checks if the final state of `b` meets certain conditions. If any element in `b` becomes negative during the modification process, or if the last two elements of `b` are not zero after the process, the function outputs 'NO' for that test case. Otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array `a` equal to zero using the given operation.
   - The operation allows us to choose an index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) and subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The operation affects three consecutive elements of the array.
   - The operation can be applied multiple times, and any index `i` can be used multiple times.
   - The goal is to reduce all elements to zero.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `a` and the array itself `b`.
   - It then iterates over the array from the first element to the second-to-last element.
   - For each element `b[i]`, it checks if `b[i]` is less than zero. If it is, the program immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation by subtracting `b[i]` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`, and setting `b[i]` to zero.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the operation might make some elements negative.
   - The program only checks if the last two elements are zero, but it does not ensure that the entire array is zero.
   - The program does not account for the fact that the operation can only be applied to indices `2` to `n-1`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array is divisible by 4 (since each operation subtracts a total of 4 from the array).
   - Additionally, we need to ensure that the array can be reduced to zero without any element becoming negative.
   - The program should check if the array can be reduced to zero by applying the operation in a way that maintains non-negativity of all elements.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. It only checks the last two elements and does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero without any element becoming negative. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
