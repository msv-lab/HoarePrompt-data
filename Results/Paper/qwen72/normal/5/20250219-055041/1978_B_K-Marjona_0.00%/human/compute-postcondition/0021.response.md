The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9\). The function returns different outputs based on the values of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function operates with parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is the number of test cases, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers for each test case. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
