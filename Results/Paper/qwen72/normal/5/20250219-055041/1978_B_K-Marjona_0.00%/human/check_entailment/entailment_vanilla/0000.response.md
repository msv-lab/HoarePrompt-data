### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - The first `k` buns can be sold at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the modified price dropping below the usual price `a`.
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, so Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit is `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, it calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is calculated as `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k`. This is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `(b - k + 1)`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Checking the Arithmetic Series Calculation:**
   - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `(b - k + 1)` is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})}{2}
     \]
   - Substituting the values, we get:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The program uses the formula `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k`, which is equivalent to the above formula.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b <= a`, the program correctly outputs `a * n` because the modified price is not beneficial.
   - If `b > a`, the program correctly calculates the profit from the first `k` buns and the remaining `n - k` buns.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The program runs in O(1) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns. It handles all edge cases and uses the correct arithmetic series formula.

### Correctness:
**True**
