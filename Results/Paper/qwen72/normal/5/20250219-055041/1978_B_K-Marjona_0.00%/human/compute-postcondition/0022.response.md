Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates and prints a result based on these inputs. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the result is `a * n`. Otherwise, the result is `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final state is that `t` lines of output have been printed, each corresponding to the result of a test case. **
