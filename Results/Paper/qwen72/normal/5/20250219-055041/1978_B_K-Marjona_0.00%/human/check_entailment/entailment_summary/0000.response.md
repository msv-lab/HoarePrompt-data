Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Choosing `k`**: The function sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a good choice because:
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, Bob can only sell up to `n` buns at the modified price.
   - If `k` is greater than `b - a`, selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would not be beneficial because the price would drop below the usual price `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would not be higher. The profit is correctly calculated as `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is calculated as the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns. The formula used is `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`.
     - The term `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k` calculates the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`. This is the correct way to sum the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
     - The term `(n - k) * a` calculates the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `b <= a` correctly by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - The function also handles the case where `b > a` and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, ensuring that the modified price is always at least `a`.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

Correctness: **True**
