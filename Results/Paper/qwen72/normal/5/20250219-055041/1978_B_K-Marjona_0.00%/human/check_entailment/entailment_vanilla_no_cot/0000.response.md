Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because of the formula used to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price. The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is supposed to calculate the sum of an arithmetic series, but it is not correctly implemented. The correct formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of the series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each term should be:

\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} \]

This formula correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of the series. The program should be corrected to use this formula. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

This corrected version will now correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.
