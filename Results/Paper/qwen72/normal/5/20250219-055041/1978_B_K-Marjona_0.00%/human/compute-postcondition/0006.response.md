Let's break down the given code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer, and `b` is greater than `a`.
- `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - `k` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - Since `b` is greater than `a`, `b - a` is a positive integer.
   - Therefore, `k` will be the smaller of `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:**
   - The expression is: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`.

3. **Simplify the expression:**
   - First, calculate `b - k + 1`.
   - Then, add `b` to the result: `b + (b - k + 1)`.
   - Divide the result by 2: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2`.
   - Multiply the result by `k`: `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k`.
   - Finally, add `(n - k) * a` to the result.

4. **Substitute the values:**
   - Let's denote `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.
   - The expression becomes: `((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`.

5. **Simplify further:**
   - `b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1`.
   - `(2b - k + 1) // 2` is the integer division of `2b - k + 1` by 2.
   - This can be simplified to `b - k // 2 + 1 // 2`, which is `b - k // 2` (since `1 // 2` is 0).

6. **Final expression:**
   - The expression now is: `(b - k // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print` statement will output the result of the expression `(b - k // 2) * k + (n - k) * a`.
- Since `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, the exact numerical value of the expression depends on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

### Output:
Output: **(b - k // 2) * k + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum of n and b - a, b is greater than a, and n is greater than 0)**
