Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 2 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the minimum of the new `n` and the new `b - a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a * n)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.
   - `a` and `n` are both input integers.
   - The value of `k` is calculated as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Since `a` and `n` are input integers and their exact values are not specified, the output will be the product of these two values.

Output: **a * n (where a is the input integer a and n is the input integer n greater than 1)**
