To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1, and it will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Given that `n` is 31, the loop will execute.

The initial state provided is:
- `i` is 0
- `n` is 31
- `ans` is 0

For the loop to execute, `i` must be 1 (as the loop starts with `i` set to 1), and `n` must be at least 1. Since `n` is already 31, it meets the condition. Therefore, we only need to adjust `i` to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `ans` is 0**
