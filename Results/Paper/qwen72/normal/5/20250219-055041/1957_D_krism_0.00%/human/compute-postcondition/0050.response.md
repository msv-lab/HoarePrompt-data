The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range which is fixed at 32. So, we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, the loop iterates over `j` from 0 to 31. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 32.

State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 2. If the result of `cur >> j & 1` is true, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1.**
