Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integer 0.
Code of the loop:
for v in arr:
    prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 integer, `v` is the first integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and `v ^ 0` (which is `v`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `v` is the second integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0, the first integer in `arr`, and the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` (which is the XOR of the second integer in `arr` and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `v` is the third integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0, the first integer in `arr`, the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` (which is the XOR of the second integer in `arr` and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution), and the new result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` (which is the XOR of the third integer in `arr` and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
