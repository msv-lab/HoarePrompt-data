Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 31, `ans` is `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[0]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[0]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][0]` is `pre[j][0] + 1`, `suf[j][0]` is `suf[j][0] - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `suf[j][0]` is now `suf[j][0] - 1`.
