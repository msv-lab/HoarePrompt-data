The only objects in the loop head are the variable `v` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers, the loop will execute again for the second integer. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `v` is the first integer in `arr`, and `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and `v`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `v` will be the second integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `v` is the second integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and the first integer in `arr`**
