Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 1, `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `suf[j][1] -= 1` decreases the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans`, `y`, `k`, `c`, `j`, `pre[j][1]`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `suf[j][1]` is now `suf[j][1] - 1`.
