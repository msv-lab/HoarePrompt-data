The only objects in the loop head are `j` and the range which is fixed at 32. The loop will execute 32 times regardless of the initial value of `j`. However, for the loop to start correctly, `j` should be set to 0, as the loop will iterate from 0 to 31 (inclusive).

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 0**
