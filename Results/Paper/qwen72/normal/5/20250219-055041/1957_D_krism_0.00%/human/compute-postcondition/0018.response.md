The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value, which is 32. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. The range value remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 2, the range is 32, `pre[0][0]` is increased by 1, `pre[1][0]` is increased by 1**
