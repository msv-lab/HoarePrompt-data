Postcondition: ***`size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number`, `i` remains unchanged, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
