Output State: **`i` is greater than or equal to `0`, `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `value` based on the bitwise shift operations. `1 << size` shifts the number 1 left by `size` positions, and `1 << i` shifts the number 1 left by `i` positions. The result of `value` is the difference between these two shifted values. Since `size` is defined as `i + 2`, the expression for `value` can be written as `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`. The values of `i` and `size` remain unchanged.
