Output State: **`size` is increased by 1, `number` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute the first time, `i` is at least `0`, `(1 << i) <= number` is true, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`**

The value of `value` is calculated as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. The other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
