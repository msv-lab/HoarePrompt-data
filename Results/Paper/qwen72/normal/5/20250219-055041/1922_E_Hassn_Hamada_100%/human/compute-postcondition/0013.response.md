To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Loop Condition:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```
This condition checks if the expression \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)\) is less than or equal to `number`.

### Current State:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\).
- `size` is increased by 1.
- `value` is \((1 << \text{size}) - (1 << i)\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `size` and `i`.
   - `number` is a constant in this context, as it is not modified in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Required Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) must be true.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `size` is increased by 1, so let's denote the new value of `size` as `size_new = size + 1`.
   - `i` remains the same.

4. **New Condition:**
   - The new condition for the next iteration will be \((1 << (size_new + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\).
   - Substituting `size_new = size + 1`, the condition becomes \((1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that \((1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\).
   - Since `number` is a constant and `i` remains unchanged, the only variable we can adjust is `size`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop can execute one more time if the new value of `size` (which is `size + 1`) satisfies the condition \((1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\).
- Therefore, the state of `size` needs to be adjusted to `size + 1`.

### Final State:
State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is increased by 1, `value` is \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)\)**

This ensures that the loop condition \((1 << (size + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\) is met for the next iteration.
