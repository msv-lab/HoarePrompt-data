To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `size`
   - `i`
   - `number`

2. **Initial State:**
   - `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
   - `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element and the maximum value in `sequence` must be greater than -1 (this variable is not in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it)
   - `size_overlap` is (0, 0) (this variable is not in the loop head, so we don't need to adjust it)
   - `size` is `i + 1`
   - `value` is \(2^i\)

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop condition is \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\)
   - We need to ensure that this condition is true for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Substitute `size` with `i + 1`:**
   - The condition becomes \((1 << ((i + 1) + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\)
   - Simplify the condition: \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i) \leq \text{number}\)

5. **Evaluate the Condition for the First Iteration:**
   - For the first iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Substitute `i` with 0: \((1 << (0 + 2)) - (1 << 0) \leq \text{number}\)
   - Simplify: \((1 << 2) - (1 << 0) \leq \text{number}\)
   - Calculate: \(4 - 1 \leq \text{number}\)
   - Simplify: \(3 \leq \text{number}\)

6. **Adjust the State:**
   - The loop will execute if `number` is at least 3.
   - Given that `number` is already an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), we need to ensure that `number` is at least 3.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `number` to ensure it is at least 3.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

### Final State:
State: **`number` is an integer such that 3 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element and the maximum value in `sequence` must be greater than -1, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `2^i`**
