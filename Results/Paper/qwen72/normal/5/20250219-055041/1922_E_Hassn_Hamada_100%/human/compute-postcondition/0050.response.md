Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number`, `i` remains unchanged, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, `size_overlap` is a tuple containing the values of `size` and `i`, and the current value of `value` is less than or equal to `number`.**

The code assigns the tuple `(size, i)` to the variable `size_overlap`. The values of `size` and `i` remain unchanged, and the value of `value` is still `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`, which is less than or equal to `number`.
