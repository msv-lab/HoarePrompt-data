Output State: **`i` is greater than or equal to `0`, `size` is `i + 3`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to `0`.
- The value of `size` remains unchanged and is still `i + 3`.
- The value of `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Since `size` is `i + 3`, the new value of `value` is `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`.
