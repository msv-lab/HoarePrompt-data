The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers that will be the output of the function. The function returns either -1 if no such array exists that meets the specified conditions, or a list of integers of length at most 200, where each integer is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, the provided output indicates that the function always returns 0, 0, which does not align with the described return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It is expected to return either -1 if no valid sequence exists, or a list of integers of length at most 200, where each integer is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. However, the function always returns 0, 0.**
