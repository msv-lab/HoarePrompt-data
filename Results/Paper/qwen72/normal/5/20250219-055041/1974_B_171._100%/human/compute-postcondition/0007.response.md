The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `len_unique`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `len_unique`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `len_unique` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `len_unique` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary with the first character of `unique_chars` mapped to the last character of `unique_chars` and the second character of `unique_chars` mapped to the second last character of `unique_chars`, `len_unique` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
