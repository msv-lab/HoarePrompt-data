Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary with the first character of `unique_chars` mapped to the last character of `unique_chars`, the second character of `unique_chars` mapped to the second last character of `unique_chars`, and the third character of `unique_chars` mapped to the third last character of `unique_chars`, `len_unique` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the `char_map` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is the third character in the `unique_chars` list (since `i` is 2), and the value is the third last character in the `unique_chars` list (since `len_unique - 1 - i` is the index of the third last character). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
