### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data` and increments the index.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`, and increments the index accordingly.
   - This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles the input.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `char_map` to store the character mappings.
   - It iterates over the unique characters and maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
   - It constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.
   - This part of the program is also correct. The function correctly identifies the unique characters, sorts them, and maps each character to its symmetric character. The decoding process is performed accurately by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list.
   - This part of the program is correct and ensures that the output is formatted as required.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "w", the unique characters list will be ["w"], and the mapping will be `{'w': 'w'}`, resulting in the correct decoded string "w".
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly. The `char_map` only contains unique characters and their symmetric mappings, so repeated characters in the encoded string are replaced correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct decoded strings. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
