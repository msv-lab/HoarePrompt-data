Reasoning:

The program provided is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to the specified algorithm. Let's break down the logic and verify if it correctly implements the decoding process:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Function `func_1` for Decoding:**
   - **Step 1:** It extracts unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically. This step correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` as described.
   - **Step 2:** It creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in the sorted unique characters to its symmetric character in the reversed list of unique characters. This step correctly implements the symmetric replacement as described.
   - **Step 3:** It decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary.
   - **Step 4:** It returns the decoded string.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the decoded string for each test case.

The program follows the correct logic for decoding the string based on the problem description. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` correctly, creates the symmetric mapping, and applies the mapping to decode the string. The input and output handling are also correct, as it processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
