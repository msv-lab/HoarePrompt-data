Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 1. `j` is equal to `n - 2` and `arr[j + 1]` must be equal to `arr[j]`.**
