Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr). `i` is 0. `n` is equal to the length of `arr`. `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**

The code assigns `j` the value of the length of `arr` minus 1. Since `n` is already equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is now equal to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
