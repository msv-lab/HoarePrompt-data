Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr)`. `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal. `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and `n` must be greater than 3. `j` is equal to `n - 4` and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `j` is decremented by 1, so `j` is now `n - 4`.
- The other conditions remain unchanged: `arr` is still a list of integers with the given constraints, `i` is still the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, `n` is still the length of `arr` and must be greater than 3, and `arr[j]` must still be equal to `arr[j - 1]` with `j` now being `n - 4` and still greater than 0.
