### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - The program then calls `func_1(arr)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It then moves `i` to the right as long as `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Similarly, it moves `j` to the left as long as `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`.
   - After these loops, `i` is the first index where the element is different from the next element, and `j` is the last index where the element is different from the previous element.
   - If `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`, it means the array is either already equal or can be made equal by setting the middle part to the same value, and the cost is `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - If `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`, the cost is the minimum of the two segments that need to be set to the same value: either from `i` to the end or from the start to `j`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements are equal, `i` will be `len(arr) - 1` and `j` will be 0. The function correctly returns 0 in this case.
   - If the array has only one element, the function will return 0, which is correct.
   - If the array has two elements and they are different, the function will return 1, which is correct.

4. **General Case:**
   - The function correctly identifies the segments that need to be set to the same value and calculates the minimum cost to do so.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the described cases and edge cases. It follows the problem description and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
