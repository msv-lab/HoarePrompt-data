The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in `arr` is between 1 and the length of `arr`.

**Case_1:** If there are elements in `arr` that are not equal to their adjacent elements, the function returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1, where `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`, and `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`. If all elements in `arr` are equal, `j` is 0 and `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.

**Case_2:** If all elements in `arr` are equal, or if the conditions for Case_1 are not met, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`, `i` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal, and `j` is the largest index such that `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]` and `j` is greater than 0, or 0 if all elements in `arr` are equal.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1, where `j` is the largest index of a non-repeating element and `i` is the first index of a non-repeating element. If all elements are equal, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, where `n` is the length of `arr`, `i` is the last index, and `j` is 0.**
