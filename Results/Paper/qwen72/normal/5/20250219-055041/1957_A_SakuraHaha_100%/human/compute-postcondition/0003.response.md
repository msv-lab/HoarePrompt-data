Output State: **`cnt` is an empty dictionary, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `cnt`. The other variables (`t`, `a`, `n`, and `ans`) are not affected by this code snippet, so their values remain as specified in the initial state.
