The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case:
- Case_1: If the number of sticks `n` is less than 3, the function returns "No" for that test case.
- Case_2: If the number of sticks `n` is 3 or more, the function returns "Yes" if there exists a triplet of sticks that can form a triangle (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick), otherwise it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. For each test case, if the number of sticks is less than 3, it returns "No". If the number of sticks is 3 or more, it returns "Yes" if any three sticks can form a triangle, otherwise it returns "No".**
