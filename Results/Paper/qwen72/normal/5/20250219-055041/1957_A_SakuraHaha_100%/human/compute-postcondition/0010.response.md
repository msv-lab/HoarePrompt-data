Output State: **`cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `cnt` will contain each unique integer from the list `a` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variables `t`, `a`, `n`, and `ans` will remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `x` will be the last element of `a` that was processed by the loop.
