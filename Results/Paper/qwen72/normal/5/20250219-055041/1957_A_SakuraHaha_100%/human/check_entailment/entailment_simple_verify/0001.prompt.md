You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the integer divisions of each value in the `cnt` dictionary by 3)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a good approach because it allows us to quickly determine how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Polygons**:
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` and for each value `x`, it adds `x // 3` to the answer `ans`. This is based on the assumption that each polygon requires at least 3 sticks of the same length.
   - However, this assumption is incorrect. The problem states that we need to form regular polygons, which can have more than 3 sides. For example, a square requires 4 sticks, and a pentagon requires 5 sticks.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of `x // 3` for all values `x` in the dictionary `cnt`.

### Issues:
- The program always divides the count of each stick length by 3, which is incorrect for forming polygons with more than 3 sides. For example, if we have 4 sticks of the same length, we can form a square, but the program will only count it as one triangle (which is incorrect).

### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible regular polygons (with 3 or more sides) and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed.
- For each stick length `x`, we should divide the count by the number of sides of the polygon (starting from 3 and going up to the count of sticks of that length).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it only considers triangles and does not account for polygons with more than 3 sides.

### Correctness:
**False**
