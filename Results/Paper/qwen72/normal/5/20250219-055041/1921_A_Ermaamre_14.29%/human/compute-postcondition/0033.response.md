Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are input integers.**

The code snippet `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and assigns the integer values of these parts to `x3` and `y3`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x4`, `y4`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the addition of `x3` and `y3` being assigned specific integer values from the input.
