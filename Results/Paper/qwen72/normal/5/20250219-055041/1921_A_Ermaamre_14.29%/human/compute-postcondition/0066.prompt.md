Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. The number of test cases, t, satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. `a` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, then if `y1` < `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `y1` is greater than or equal to `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`. Otherwise, if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, or if `x1` is equal to `x4` and `x3` is equal to `x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. If none of the above conditions are met, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then if `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute value of `y3 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y3`. If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, `res` remains undefined. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then if `y1 < y2`, `res` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y1` and `y3`. If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, `res` remains undefined. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, `res` is the absolute value of the difference between `y2` and `y1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
