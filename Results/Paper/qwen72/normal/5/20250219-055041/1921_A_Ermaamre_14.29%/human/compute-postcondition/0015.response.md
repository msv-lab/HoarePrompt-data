Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are input integers, `x1` is equal to `x2`, `x3` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1`.**

The value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Since `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is equal to `y2 - y1`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
