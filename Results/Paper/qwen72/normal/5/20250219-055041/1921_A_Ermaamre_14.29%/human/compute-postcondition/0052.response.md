Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are new input integers, and `res` remains undefined.**

The code snippet `x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these values to `x4` and `y4`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `res`) are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state reflects the new values of `x4` and `y4` while keeping the initial state of the other variables unchanged.
