Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then if `y1` < `y2`, `res` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute value of `y1 - y2`. If `x1 != x4` or `x3 != x2`, `res` remains undefined.***
