Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, `x1` is equal to `x4`, `x3` is equal to `x2`, and either `x1` is not equal to `x2` or `x3` is not equal to `x4`. If `y1` is less than `y2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Otherwise, if `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.***
