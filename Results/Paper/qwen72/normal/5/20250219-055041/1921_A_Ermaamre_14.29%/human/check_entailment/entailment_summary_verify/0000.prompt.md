You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        print(res ** 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the input. Each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of a square. The function calculates the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the appropriate pairs of points. It then prints the area of the square (side length squared) for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input coordinates have been processed, and the areas of the squares have been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the coordinates of the square's corners. Specifically, the program assumes a specific order of the input coordinates and only checks a limited set of conditions to determine the side length of the square. However, the problem statement guarantees that the input coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, but does not specify the order of the coordinates. Therefore, the program may fail to correctly compute the area if the coordinates are not in the expected order.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5
```
The program will not correctly compute the area because it does not handle the case where the first and third coordinates have the same x-values and the second and fourth coordinates have the same x-values. The correct area should be 9, but the program will not return this value.
