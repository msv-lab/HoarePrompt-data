Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are new input integers, `res` is equal to the absolute value of `y3 - y1`.**

The value of `res` is now defined as the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. All other variables retain their initial values and conditions.
