Output State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are new input integers.**

The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, and `y3` remain unchanged. The variables `x4` and `y4` are now assigned new input integers based on the user's input.
