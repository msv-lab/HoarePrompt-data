Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at index `w[0]` is 1 and the value at index `w[1]` is now 1, `j` is 1**

The value at index `w[1]` in the list `q` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
