The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w` where each integer represents the exponent of the length of a stick (2^{a_i}). If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, it calculates and prints the number of unique combinations of three sticks that can form a triangle. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without modifying any global variables.
