The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the expression `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must include at least one value, meaning `n + 1` must be greater than 0. Given that `n` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 3, `n + 1` will always be greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, the initial value of `j` must be set to 0 for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is 0 and `n + 1` is greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
