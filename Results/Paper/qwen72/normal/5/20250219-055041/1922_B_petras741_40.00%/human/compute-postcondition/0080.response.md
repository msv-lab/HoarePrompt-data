Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 2. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing the integers 0, 1, and 2. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.***
