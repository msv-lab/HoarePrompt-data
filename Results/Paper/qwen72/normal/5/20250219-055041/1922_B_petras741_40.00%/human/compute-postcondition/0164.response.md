Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln - 1`. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of q[eta[k]] for all k from 0 to i-1)` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the loop breaks.***
