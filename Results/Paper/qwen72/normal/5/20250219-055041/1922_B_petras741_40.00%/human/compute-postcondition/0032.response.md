Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`, `res` is the value of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is calculated as `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
- `q[eta[0]]` is the value at the index `eta[0]` in the list `q`, which is the same as `rho`.
- The expression `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6` is the result of the combination formula for choosing 3 items out of `rho` items.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
