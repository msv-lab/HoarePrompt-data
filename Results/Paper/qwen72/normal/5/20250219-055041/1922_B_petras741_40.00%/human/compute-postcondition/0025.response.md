Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list. If `q[j]` > 0, `eta` contains the integer 2. Otherwise, `eta` contains the integer 0.***
