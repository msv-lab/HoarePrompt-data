Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]` creates a list `q` of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, and `w`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, and `w` are still valid.
