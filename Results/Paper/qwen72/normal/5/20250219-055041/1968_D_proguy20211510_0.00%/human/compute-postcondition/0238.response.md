Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least one element, `rem` is `k - 1`**. 

This means that the value of `i` remains 0, the list `pres` is unchanged and still contains the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index with at least one element, and a new variable `rem` is created with the value of `k - 1`.
