Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by the parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, along with two lists `p` and `a`. The function determines the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on the maximum values in the array `a` and the permutations in `p`. The game is played for `k` moves, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha are given by `P_B` and `P_S`, respectively. The function prints 'Bodya' if Bodya has the higher cumulative score, 'Sasha' if Sasha has the higher cumulative score, and 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
