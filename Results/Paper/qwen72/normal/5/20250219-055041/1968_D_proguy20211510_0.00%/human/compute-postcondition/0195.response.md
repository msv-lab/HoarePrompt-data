Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `s` is a list that includes the value `a[ps - 1]` in addition to its previous contents, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `k` remains greater than 0.
- The values of `foundb` and `founds` remain either true or false.
- The list `s` still includes the value `a[ps - 1]` in addition to its previous contents.
- `ps` is updated to be equal to `p[ps - 1]`.
