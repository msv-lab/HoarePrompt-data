The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `pres`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pres`. If `pres` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start from 0 and iterate up to `len(pres) - 1`.

Given the initial state where `i` is `len(s) - 1`, this does not ensure that the loop will execute. To ensure the loop executes, `i` must start at 0, and `pres` must have at least one element.

State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least one element**
