Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `rem` is `k - 3`, `ptsb` has a new element appended which is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` and another new element appended which is `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `ptss` has a new element appended which is `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]` and another new element appended which is `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 2.
- `pres` remains a list with `len(s)` elements, each being the cumulative sum of `s` up to that index.
- `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which is `k - 3` since `i` is 2.
- `ptsb` and `ptss` retain their previously appended elements, which are `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` and `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]` for `ptsb`, and `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]` and `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]` for `ptss`.
