Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is unchanged, `founds` is unchanged, `pb` is unchanged, `ps` is unchanged, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is True, `b` has a new element appended, which is equal to `maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to True, and `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is also True, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `(k - 2) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true after this update, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
