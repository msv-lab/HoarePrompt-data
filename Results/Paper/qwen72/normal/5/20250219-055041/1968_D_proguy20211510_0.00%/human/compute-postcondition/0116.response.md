Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `rem` is `k - 2`, `ptsb` has a new element appended which is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` has a new element appended which is `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`**

Explanation: The value of `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2` since `i` is 1. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
