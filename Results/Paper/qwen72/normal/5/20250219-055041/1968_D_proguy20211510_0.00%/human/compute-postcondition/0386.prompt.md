Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are integers such that 1 ≤ `P_B`, `P_S` ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, representing the permutation `p`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, representing the array `a`. The sum of values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'. `MOD` is 1000000007. `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, pb, ps = input().split()
    n, k, pb, ps = int(n), int(k), int(pb), int(ps)
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxa = max(a)
    if a[pb - 1] == a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Draw')
        continue
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        print('Bodya')
        continue
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        print('Sasha')
        continue
    b, s = [], []
    founds, foundb = False, False
    for i in range(k):
        if foundb and founds:
            b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
            break
        if foundb:
            b.append(maxa)
        elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
            foundb = True
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
        else:
            b.append(a[pb - 1])
            pb = p[pb - 1]
        if founds:
            s.append(maxa)
        elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
            founds = True
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
        else:
            s.append(a[ps - 1])
            ps = p[ps - 1]
    preb, pres = [], []
    sb, ss = 0, 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        preb.append(sb + b[i])
        sb += b[i]
        pres.append(ss + s[i])
        ss += s[i]
    ptsb, ptss = [], []
    for i in range(len(pres)):
        rem = k - (i + 1)
        ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])
        ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])
    maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)
    if maxs > maxb:
        print('Sasha')
    elif maxs < maxb:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Draw')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `ptss` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` will be `len(pres) - 1`, `pres` will still be a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index, `rem` will be `k - len(pres)`, `ptsb` will be a list containing the values `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]`, `ptss` will be a list containing the values `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]`, `maxs` will be the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` will be the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` > `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`, `ptss` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]`, `rem` is `k - len(s)`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
