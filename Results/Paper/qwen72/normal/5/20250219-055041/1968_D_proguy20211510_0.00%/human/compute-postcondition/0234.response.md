Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the values `sb + b[i]`, `sb + b[k]`, and `sb + b[i]` (the last value is appended), `pres` is a list containing the values `ss + s[i]`, `ss + s[i]`, and `ss + s[i]` (the last value is appended), `sb` is `b[i] + b[i] + b[i]`, `ss` is `s[i] + s[i] + s[i]`, `s` must have a length greater than `k + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ss += s[i]` appends the value of `s[i]` to the existing value of `ss`.
- Initially, `ss` is `s[i] + s[i]`.
- After executing `ss += s[i]`, `ss` becomes `s[i] + s[i] + s[i]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
