Postcondition: ***`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `ptss` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`. If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`. Otherwise, `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`.***
