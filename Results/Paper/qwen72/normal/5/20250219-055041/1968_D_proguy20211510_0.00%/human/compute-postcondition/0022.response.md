Postcondition: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, and `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` are both equal to `maxa`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement if not in a loop. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` but `a[ps - 1]` is not, or if `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa` but `a[pb - 1]` is not, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If neither `a[pb - 1]` nor `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, the program does not continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
