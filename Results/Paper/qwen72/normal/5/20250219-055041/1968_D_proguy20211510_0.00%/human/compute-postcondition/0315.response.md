Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is True, and `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is also True, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `(k - 2) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and if `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
