Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index, `rem` is `k - 1`, `ptsb` has a new element appended which is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`.** 

The value of `i` remains 0, `pres` retains its initial state as a list of cumulative sums of `s`, and `rem` remains `k - 1`. The list `ptsb` now includes an additional element, which is the result of adding `preb[0]` and the product of `rem` (which is `k - 1`) and `b[0]`.
