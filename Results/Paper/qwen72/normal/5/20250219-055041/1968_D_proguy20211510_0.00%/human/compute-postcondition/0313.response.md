Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.** 

The value of `i` remains 1, and `k` is still greater than 1. The list `b` now has an additional element, which is the value of `a[pb - 1]`. The state of `s` and the conditions for `foundb` and `founds` remain unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
