Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `i` is `len(s) - 1`, meaning `i` is the last index of the list `s`.
- `pres` is a list that contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index.
- `ptsb` is a list that contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- `ptss` is a list that contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- The current value of `maxs` is less than the current value of `maxb`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of context about the lists and variables, but the `print` statement itself does not use any of these variables. It is a straightforward print of a string.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
