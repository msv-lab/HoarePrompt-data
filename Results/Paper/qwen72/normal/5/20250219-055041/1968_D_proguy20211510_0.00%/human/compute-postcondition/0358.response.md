Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `b` and `s` each have `k + 2` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with three elements `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k], b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]]`, `pres` is a list with two elements `[s[k - 1], s[k - 1] + s[k]]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1] + s[k]`**

Explanation:
- `i` is `k + 1`, so `b[i]` is `b[k + 1]`.
- `sb` was initially `b[k - 1] + b[k]`.
- After executing `sb += b[i]`, `sb` becomes `b[k - 1] + b[k] + b[k + 1]`.
- The values of `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, and `ss` remain unchanged.
