Output State: **`foundb` is True or False, `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `founds` is True. If `foundb` is True, `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `s` contains one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is True, and `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`. Otherwise, `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`, where `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. The current value of `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.**

In natural language:
- The variable `founds` is now set to True.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
- If `foundb` is True, the list `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`.
- If `foundb` is False, the list `s` contains one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.
- If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is True, and `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`.
- If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is False, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`.
- The current value of `a[ps - 1]` is still equal to `maxa`.
