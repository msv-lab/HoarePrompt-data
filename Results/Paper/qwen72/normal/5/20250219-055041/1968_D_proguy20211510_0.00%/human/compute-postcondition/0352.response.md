The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the sum of `sb` and `b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `i` is `k`, `sb` is `b[k - 1]`, and `b` has `k + 1` elements, the value being appended is `b[k - 1] + b[k]`.

Output State: **`i` is `k`, `b` and `s` each have `k + 1` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with two elements `[b[k - 1], b[k - 1] + b[k]]`, `pres` is a list with one element `s[k - 1]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1]`, `ss` is `s[k - 1]`**
