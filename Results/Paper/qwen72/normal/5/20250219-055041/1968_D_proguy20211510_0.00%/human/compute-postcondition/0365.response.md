Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with one element equal to `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, `ptss` is an empty list, `rem` is `k - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `preb[0] + rem * b[0]` to the list `ptsb`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `preb` and `b` is used in the calculation. The other variables remain unchanged.
