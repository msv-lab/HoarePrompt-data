Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `b` and `s` each have `k` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with one element `b[k - 1]`, `pres` is a list with one element `s[k - 1]`, `sb` is `b[k - 1]`, `ss` is 0.**

Explanation:
- `pres.append(ss + s[i])` adds the value of `ss + s[i]` to the list `pres`.
- `i` is `k - 1`, so `s[i]` is `s[k - 1]`.
- `ss` is 0, so `ss + s[i]` is `s[k - 1]`.
- Therefore, `pres` now contains one element, which is `s[k - 1]`.
- The other variables (`i`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `sb`, `ss`) remain unchanged.
