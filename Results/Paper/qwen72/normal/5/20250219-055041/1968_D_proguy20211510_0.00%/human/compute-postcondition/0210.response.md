Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `s` is a list that includes the value `maxa` and the new value `maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is true and `founds` is false, `s` is a list that includes the new value `(k - 2) * maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 2) * maxa` and the value `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa` and `founds` is false, `s` is a list that includes the new value `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.**
