Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is either true or false, and `founds` is either true or false. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` includes the values `maxa`, `(k - 2) * maxa`, and `a[ps - 1]`. If `foundb` is true, `b` includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `b` includes the values `(k - 2) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` includes the value `a[ps - 1]` in addition to its previous values, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. In all other cases, the state of `b` and `pb` remains unchanged.***
