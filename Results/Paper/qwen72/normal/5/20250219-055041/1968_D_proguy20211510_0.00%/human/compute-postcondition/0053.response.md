The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, and `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `k` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` and `ps` are integers, `p` and `a` are lists of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `s` contains one or two elements, and `b` contains two elements. `i` is incremented by 1, and `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`.**
