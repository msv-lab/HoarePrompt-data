Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation:
- The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`.
- `sb` is 0, and `i` is `k-1`, so the value being appended is `b[k-1]`.
- `preb` was initially an empty list, so after the code execution, `preb` contains the single value `b[k-1]`.
- The states of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
