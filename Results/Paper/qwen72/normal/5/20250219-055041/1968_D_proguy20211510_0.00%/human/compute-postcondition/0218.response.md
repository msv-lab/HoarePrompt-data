Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list.**

If `foundb` and `founds` are both true, `b` and `s` each contain `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` as their last element. If `foundb` is true but `founds` is false, `b` contains `maxa` as its last element. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `foundb` is set to true, and `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` as its last element. If `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `b` contains `a[pb - 1]` as its last element, and `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to true, and `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` as its last element. If `founds` is false and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` as its last element, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`.
