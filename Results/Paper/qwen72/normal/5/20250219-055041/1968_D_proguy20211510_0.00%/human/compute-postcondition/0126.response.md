Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` is the last index of the list `s`.
- `pres` is a list that contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index.
- `ptsb` is a list that contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- `ptss` is a list that contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
- `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
- It is given that `maxs` is greater than `maxb`.

The `print` statement in the provided code snippet is:
```
print('Sasha')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
