You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `d[i]` is the depth of the parentheses sequence at position `i-1`. The final value of `d[n]` is 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, and for positions with the same depth, they are sorted by their indices in descending order.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`. The string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, with positions of the same depth sorted by their indices in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and returns a string `ans` containing characters from `s` at indices specified by the first elements of tuples in `d`, where `d` is sorted by the depth of the parentheses in ascending order and by indices in descending order for the same depth.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` at the indices specified by the first elements of all tuples in `d`, in the order they appear in `d`. The string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, with positions of the same depth sorted by their indices in descending order.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
