Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and `d[1] = 1`; `i` is 0, and the character at the current position `i` in `s` is "(".** 

The code snippet updates the dictionary `d` by adding a new key-value pair `d[1] = 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
