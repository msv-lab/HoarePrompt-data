The code snippet `d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))` sorts the dictionary `d` by its values (depths) in ascending order. If there are multiple entries with the same depth, they are sorted by their keys in descending order.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `ans` is an empty string.
- `d` is a dictionary with `d[0] = 0` and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `d[i]` is the depth of the parentheses sequence at position `i-1`. The final value of `d[n-1]` is 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.

After executing the code snippet, the dictionary `d` is transformed into a list of tuples sorted by the specified key. The keys of the dictionary are the positions in the string `s`, and the values are the depths at those positions. The sorting ensures that positions with the same depth are ordered by their indices in descending order.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the depth of the parentheses sequence in ascending order, and for positions with the same depth, they are sorted by their indices in descending order.**
