### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`, which is responsible for performing the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The result of `func_1(n)` is then printed.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the prefix balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string.
   - The final value of `d[n]` is 0, which is correct for a balanced parentheses sequence.

3. **Removing the Last Balance:**
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the last balance is not needed for the sorting step.
   - This step is correct and necessary to avoid including the final balance (which is always 0) in the sorting process.

4. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance in increasing order, and for ties, in decreasing order of position.
   - This is achieved using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.
   - The sorting logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of tuples and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - This step correctly reorders the characters according to the balanced shuffle operation.
   - However, there is a subtle issue: the indices in the sorted list are 1-based (i.e., they start from 1), but the string `s` is 0-based (i.e., indices start from 0). Therefore, when appending characters to `ans`, the program should use `s[i-1]` instead of `s[i]`.

6. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.
   - This part is correct, but the issue in the construction step (using `s[i]` instead of `s[i-1]`) will lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is almost correct but has a critical issue in the construction of the result string. The indices used to access characters in the string `s` are off by one, which will result in incorrect output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
