### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the input string `n` and immediately calls `func_1(n)`, which is responsible for performing the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The result of `func_1(n)` is then printed.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the prefix balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string.

3. **Removing the Last Balance:**
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the last balance is not needed for the sorting step.

4. **Sorting the Prefix Balances:**
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance in increasing order, and for ties, in decreasing order of position.
   - This is achieved using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`.

5. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of tuples and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - This step correctly reorders the characters according to the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Returning the Result:**
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix balances and sorts them as required.
- The construction of the result string `ans` is done by appending characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
