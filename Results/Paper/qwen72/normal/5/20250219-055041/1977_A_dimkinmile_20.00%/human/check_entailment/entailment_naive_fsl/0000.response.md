Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the target number of cubes, but it does not consider whether the number of moves can actually result in the exact number of cubes on the tower.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`:
- According to the problem description, it is impossible to have exactly 4 cubes after 2 moves. The only possible outcomes are 0 or 2 cubes.
- However, the program will output "Yes" for this case, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because each move can only add or remove one cube, and the final number of cubes must be reachable by an even number of moves (if `n` and `m` have the same parity).

A correct implementation would be:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
