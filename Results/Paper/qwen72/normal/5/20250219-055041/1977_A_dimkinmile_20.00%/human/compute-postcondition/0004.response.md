The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'No'. The precondition describes the state of the program, indicating that `n` and `m` are input integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, and `n` is less than `m`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` in any way. It simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **No**
