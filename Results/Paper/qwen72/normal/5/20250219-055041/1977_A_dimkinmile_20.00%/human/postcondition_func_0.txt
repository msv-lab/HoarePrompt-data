The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from user input, where both integers are expected to be between 1 and 100, inclusive. It then compares `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged and are retained in the program.
