The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `m`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `m`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `m` must be greater than 1

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2
- `m` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `m` must be greater than 2

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is `n`, `y` is 1**
