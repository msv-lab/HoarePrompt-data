Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1`, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 4.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is updated to `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
- `cnt` was initially `n`.
- `x` is `n - 2`.
- `y` is 4.
- `x // y` is `(n - 2) // 4`.
- `i` is 2, so `(i > 1)` evaluates to `True`, which is equivalent to 1 in integer context.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
