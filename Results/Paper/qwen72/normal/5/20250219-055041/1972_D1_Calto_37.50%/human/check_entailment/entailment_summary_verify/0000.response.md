### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem description and the provided program to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It is correct and will be used in the main function to compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).

  - **Loop**: The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
  - **Calculation**:
    - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
    - \(y = i * i\)
    - \(cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)\)

  - **Return**: If `cnt` is zero, it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

#### Function Summary:
The function `func_2` is described as follows:
- It returns 1 if the sum of a series of calculations based on `n` and `m-1` is zero.
- Otherwise, it returns the sum of these calculations, which is the sum of \((n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect and provides a specific test case where the program fails:
- **Input**: \(1\), \(2\), \(3\)
- **Expected Output**: \(3\)
- **Actual Output**: \(2\)

#### Verification:
Let's verify the program with the given test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):

1. **Initialization**:
   - `cnt = 0`

2. **Loop**:
   - For \(i = 1\):
     - \(x = 2 - (1 * 1 - 1) = 2 - 0 = 2\)
     - \(y = 1 * 1 = 1\)
     - `cnt = cnt + 2 // 1 + (1 > 1) = 0 + 2 + 0 = 2`
   - For \(i = 2\):
     - \(x = 2 - (2 * 2 - 2) = 2 - 2 = 0\)
     - \(y = 2 * 2 = 4\)
     - `cnt = cnt + 0 // 4 + (2 > 1) = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3`

3. **Return**:
   - `cnt` is 3, so the function returns 3.

However, the expected output is 3, and the program correctly returns 3. This contradicts the original assessment.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Correct Pairs for \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)**:
  - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\)
  - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\)
  - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\)

The program correctly counts these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for the given test case and the provided logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
