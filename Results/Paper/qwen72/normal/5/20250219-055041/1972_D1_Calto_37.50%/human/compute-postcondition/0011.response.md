Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1`, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 9.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is updated to `i * i`, which is `3 * 3 = 9`. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `cnt`, and `x` remain unchanged.
