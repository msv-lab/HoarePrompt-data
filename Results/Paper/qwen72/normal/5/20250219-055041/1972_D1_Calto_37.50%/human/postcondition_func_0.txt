The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (with 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m) and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD). After the function concludes, the value of `a` is the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
