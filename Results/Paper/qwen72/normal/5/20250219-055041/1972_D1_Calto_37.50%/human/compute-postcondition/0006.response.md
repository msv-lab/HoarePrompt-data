Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `n`, `x` is `n - 2`, `y` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`.
- Given `i` is 2, the expression `i * i - i` evaluates to `2 * 2 - 2`, which is `4 - 2 = 2`.
- Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `cnt`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
