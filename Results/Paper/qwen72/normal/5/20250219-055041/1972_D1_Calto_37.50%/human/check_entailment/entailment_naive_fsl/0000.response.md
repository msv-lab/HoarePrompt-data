Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The pairs (1, 1), (2, 1), and (2, 2) should all satisfy the condition, but the program only counts (1, 1) and (2, 1). The pair (2, 2) is not counted correctly because the logic in `func_2` is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and `y` and the way `cnt` is incremented do not correctly handle all valid pairs.
