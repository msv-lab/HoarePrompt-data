### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The function works by repeatedly applying the operation `(a, b) = (b, a % b)` until `b` becomes zero. The GCD is then the value of `a`.
   - This function is correct and will return the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - The function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` and calculates `x` and `y` as follows:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
   - It then adds `x // y + (i > 1)` to the count `cnt`.
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not directly relate to the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
     - `a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b)` for some integer `k`.
     - This implies that `a` must be of the form `b * (k * gcd(a, b) - 1)`.
   - The current implementation does not correctly check this condition for all possible pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The expression `x // y + (i > 1)` is not a valid way to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair using the GCD function.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - A correct implementation would involve nested loops and the use of the GCD function to check the condition for each pair.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` based on the problem's conditions. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not match the required condition.

Final: **False**
