**Reasoning:**

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is a standard implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The loop continues until `b` becomes 0, and at that point, `a` holds the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
   - The function correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` and performs a series of calculations to update `cnt`.
   - The calculation `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` is intended to determine how many valid pairs `(a, b)` exist for each `i`.
   - The expression `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is used to increment the count of valid pairs.
   - If `cnt` is 0 after the loop, the function returns 1, which is incorrect because it does not account for the valid pair `(1, 1)` in the case where `n = 1` and `m = 1`.
   - The function returns `cnt` if it is not zero, which is also incorrect because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed.

3. **Flaw in the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` does not accurately represent the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition directly, but this would be inefficient for large values of `n` and `m`.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the function should count pairs like `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, `(3, 1)`, `(4, 1)`, `(5, 1)`, `(6, 1)`, `(6, 2)`, `(6, 3)`, `(7, 1)`, `(8, 1)`, `(9, 1)`, `(10, 1)`, and `(10, 2)`, which are 14 pairs.
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly count these pairs.

**Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the logic in `func_2` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given condition. The implementation is flawed and does not match the problem description.
