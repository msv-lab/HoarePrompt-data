Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.

2. **Pair Counting**:
   - The function `func_2(n, m)` is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions. However, the logic used in this function is incorrect.

   - The loop iterates from `1` to `m-1` (not `m`), which means it misses the last value of `b` (i.e., `b = m`).

   - The expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` are not derived from the problem's conditions. The problem requires that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, but the code does not check this condition directly.

   - The line `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is not a valid way to count the pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count pairs, but it does not correctly implement the required condition.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This program correctly iterates over all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. It will produce the correct output for the given test cases.
