### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The annotations are accurate: the function returns the GCD of the initial values of \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Function 2: `func_2(n, m)`**
   - The function is designed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
   - However, the logic within `func_2` is flawed. The calculations for `x` and `y` and the way `cnt` is incremented do not correctly handle all valid pairs.

4. **Flawed Logic in `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates `x` as \(n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and `y` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It then increments `cnt` by \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{y} \right\rfloor + (i > 1)\).
   - This logic does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\).
     - The function `func_2` should count these pairs, but it fails to do so correctly.
     - The actual output of the program for this input is 2, which is incorrect.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_2` does not perform this check and instead uses a flawed formula that does not match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Final: **False**
