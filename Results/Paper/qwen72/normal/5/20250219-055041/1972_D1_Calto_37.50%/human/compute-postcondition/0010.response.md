Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `m` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `n + (n - 2) // 4 + 1`, `x` is `n - 6`, `y` is 4.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 3, `i * i - i` equals `3 * 3 - 3` which is `9 - 3 = 6`. Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 6`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
