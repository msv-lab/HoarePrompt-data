Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions, and then outputting the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`. It also reads `m` lines of input for each test case, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using the `pow` function. This is correct because the total number of possible pairs of children is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), and the inverse is needed to compute the probability of selecting a specific pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `f_i` for all pairs of friends and stores this sum in `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each of the `k` excursions. However, there is a mistake in the calculation of `s`. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship value due to the selected pairs.

   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is \( \frac{m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \) because each pair of friends has an equal probability of being chosen.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase for each excursion, summed over `k` excursions.

   The correct formula for the expected value `s` should be:
   \[
   s = k \cdot a + k \cdot \frac{m \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot c
   \]
   where `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

5. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `s` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the above reasoning, the program's current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value for each excursion.

Correctness: **False**
