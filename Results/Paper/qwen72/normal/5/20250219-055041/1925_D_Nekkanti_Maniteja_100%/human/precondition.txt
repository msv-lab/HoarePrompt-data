t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and m are non-negative integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, pairs is a list of m tuples, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, f_i where 1 <= a_i, b_i <= n, a_i != b_i, and 1 <= f_i <= 10^9, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5.
