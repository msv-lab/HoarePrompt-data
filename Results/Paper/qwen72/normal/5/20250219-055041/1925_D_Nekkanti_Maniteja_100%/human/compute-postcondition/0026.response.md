Output State: **`i` is `k` (initial value), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of `f` values from `m` inputs, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

The code snippet `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` updates the value of `M` to 1000000007. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `M` while preserving the values and conditions of the other variables.
