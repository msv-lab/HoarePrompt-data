The code snippet `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The initial state specifies that `int(input())` must be greater than `k`, but since we are reading three values, we need to ensure that the third value (assigned to `k`) is greater than the initial `k`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is `k` (initial value), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of `f` values from `m` inputs, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**
