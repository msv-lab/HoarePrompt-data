Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `s + c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m + c * a * k`, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `u` is the last input integer, `v` is the second last input integer, `f` is the third last input integer, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the new input values, where `n` and `m` are integers and `k` is an integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than the initial `k`.**

The code snippet only reassigns the value of `M` to 1000000007, which was already its value in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the same conditions and values as the initial state, with the explicit confirmation that `M` is 1000000007.
