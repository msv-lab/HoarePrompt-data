Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `k` is unspecified, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

The value of `a` is updated to be equal to the input integer `f`. The other variables remain unchanged.
