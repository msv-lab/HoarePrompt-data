Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the sum `s` in the loop:

```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

This loop is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected value of the friendship values for each excursion. The expected value should be calculated based on the probability of selecting a friend pair and the current friendship values, but the loop incorrectly multiplies `i` by `c * m`, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.

The correct approach should be to calculate the expected value of the friendship values for each excursion and then sum these expected values. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the current friendship values of all friend pairs, plus the number of friend pairs (since each friend pair has a probability of being chosen and their friendship value increases by 1 if they are chosen).

Here is a corrected version of the loop:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Probability of selecting a friend pair
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f  # Sum of initial friendship values
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M  # Correct expected value calculation
        print(s)
```

In the corrected version, `s` is updated by adding the expected value of the friendship values for each excursion, which is `c * (a + i * m)`. This correctly accounts for the increasing friendship values over the excursions.

The original program fails to correctly calculate the expected value, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. For example, consider the test case:

```
3 1 2
1 2 1
```

The expected value for the first excursion is `1` (since the only friend pair has a friendship value of 1), and for the second excursion, it should be `1 + 2` (since the friendship value of the friend pair increases by 1). The correct output should be `3`, but the original program will produce a different result.
