### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\) for modular arithmetic.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads the friendship values for each of the `m` pairs and sums them up in `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions.
   - For each excursion, it updates the sum `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for a given excursion is calculated as:
     - `c * i * c * m`: This term represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the pairs being chosen and their friendship value increasing by 1 for each subsequent excursion.
     - `c * a`: This term represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the result is within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final result `s % M` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expected Value Calculation:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be broken down as follows:
  - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for a pair of friends is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in the friendship value for all pairs chosen over `k` excursions is:
    \[
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times i + \frac{2a}{n(n-1)} \right)
    \]
  - Simplifying the sum:
    \[
    \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{2m \cdot i}{n(n-1)} + \frac{2a}{n(n-1)} \right) = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i + \frac{2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - The sum of the first `k-1` integers is \(\frac{(k-1)k}{2}\):
    \[
    \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \cdot \frac{(k-1)k}{2} + \frac{2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)} = \frac{m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k}{n(n-1)} + \frac{2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - Combining the terms:
    \[
    \frac{m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k + 2a \cdot k}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - This can be simplified to:
    \[
    \frac{k \cdot (m \cdot (k-1) + 2a)}{n(n-1)}
    \]
  - The program should calculate this value and take it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Issues in the Program:
- The program's calculation of the expected value is incorrect. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` is not the correct way to calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion.
- The correct calculation should be:
  \[
  \frac{k \cdot (m \cdot (k-1) + 2a)}{n(n-1)} \bmod (10^9 + 7)
  \]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_value = (k * (m * (k - 1) + 2 * a) * c) % M
        print(expected_value)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
- The corrected program is **correct** and should produce the expected results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
