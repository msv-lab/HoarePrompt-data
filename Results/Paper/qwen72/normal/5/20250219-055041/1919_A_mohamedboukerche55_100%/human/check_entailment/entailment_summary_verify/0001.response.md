### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win.

3. **Parity Explanation:**
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will always end with both wallets being empty at the same time. Since Bob goes second, he will always be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the game will end with one wallet having one coin left while the other is empty. Since Alice goes first, she will always be the one to make the last move, thus winning the game.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the modulo operation `(a + b) % 2`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Function Summary Verification:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the program's behavior. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`, and determines the winner based on the parity of `a + b`.
   - The program's logic aligns with the optimal play strategy as explained in the reasoning.

6. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input format as specified in the problem description.
   - It processes each test case independently and prints the correct output for each case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the total number of coins and will determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play strategy for each test case.

Final: **True**
