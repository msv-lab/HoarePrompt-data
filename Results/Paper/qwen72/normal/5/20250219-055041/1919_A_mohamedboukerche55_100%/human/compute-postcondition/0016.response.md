Postcondition: ***`a` is the integer value of the first word in the new input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the new input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `s` is the new input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, then no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
