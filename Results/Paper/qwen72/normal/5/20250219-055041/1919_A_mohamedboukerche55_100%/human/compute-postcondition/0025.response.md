Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. `a` and `b` are integers, each with 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns "a is less than b". If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns "a is equal to b". If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns "a is greater than b".**
