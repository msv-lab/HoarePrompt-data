You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, so it should be revised to include them.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: `a` is the integer value of the first word in the last input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the program prints 'Bob'. If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the program prints 'Alice'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. `a` and `b` are integers, each with 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns "a is less than b". If `a` is equal to `b`, it returns "a is equal to b". If `a` is greater than `b`, it returns "a is greater than b".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
