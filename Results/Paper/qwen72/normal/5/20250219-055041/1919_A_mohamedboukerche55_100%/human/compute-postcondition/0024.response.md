Output State: **`a` is the integer value of the first word in the last input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the last input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input string. If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, the program prints 'Bob'. If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, the program prints 'Alice'.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variables `a` and `b` will hold the integer values of the first and second words in the last input string `s` that was read. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` will be `t-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration. The program will print 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.
