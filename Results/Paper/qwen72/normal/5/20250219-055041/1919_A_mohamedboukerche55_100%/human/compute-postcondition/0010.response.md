The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`a` is the integer value of the first word in the input string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second word in the input string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string. If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the program follows the postcondition of the if part. If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the program follows the postcondition of the else part.**
