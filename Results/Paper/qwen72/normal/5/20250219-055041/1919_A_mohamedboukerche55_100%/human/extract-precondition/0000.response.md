Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, so it should be revised to include them.**

Revised function definition:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Here, `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `a` and `b`.
