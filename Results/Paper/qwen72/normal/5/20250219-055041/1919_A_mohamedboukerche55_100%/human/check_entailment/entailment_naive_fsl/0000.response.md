Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. However, the game's outcome depends on the number of coins and the sequence of moves, not just the parity of the sum.

A counterexample to demonstrate the incorrectness:

Input:
```
1
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
Bob
```

In this case, Alice can win by following these steps:
1. Alice swaps wallets with Bob. Now, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 2 coins.
2. Bob cannot swap wallets (since it would just return the wallets to their original state) and must remove a coin. Now, Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin.
3. Alice removes a coin. Now, Alice has 0 coins and Bob has 1 coin.
4. Bob cannot make a move because Alice's wallet is empty. Therefore, Alice wins.

The program incorrectly outputs "Bob" for this case, demonstrating that it does not correctly handle the game logic.
