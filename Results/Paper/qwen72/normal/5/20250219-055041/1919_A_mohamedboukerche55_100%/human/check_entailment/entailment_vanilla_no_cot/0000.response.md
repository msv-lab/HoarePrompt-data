Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program to determine the winner is based on the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the winner of the game as described.

The correct approach involves understanding the game dynamics and the optimal strategy for both players. The key insight is that the player with the larger number of coins can always force the game into a state where they have an odd number of coins left, and the other player has an even number of coins left, which will eventually lead to the player with the even number of coins losing.

Here's a more accurate way to determine the winner:

1. If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win because Alice will be forced to make the first move, reducing her coins to an even number, and Bob can then mirror Alice's moves until Alice loses.
2. If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with the larger number of coins can always force a win by ensuring they always have an odd number of coins left after their turn.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly determines the winner based on the game's rules and the optimal strategy for both players.
