Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not used), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `last` is the last element of the `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `curr` will be the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in the list `nums` and the last element of `nums`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
