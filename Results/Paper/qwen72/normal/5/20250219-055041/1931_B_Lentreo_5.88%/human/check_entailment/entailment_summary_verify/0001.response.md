Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations (pouring water from a container to another container to its right).
   - The sum of the initial amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers, ensuring that the target amount of water in each container is an integer.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is `sum(nums) // n`.
   - The allowed operations (pouring from left to right) should be sufficient to redistribute the water if the initial distribution allows it.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided program compares each element in the list `nums` with the last element `last` and calculates a cumulative difference `curr`.
   - This approach is incorrect because the target amount of water should be `sum(nums) // n`, not the last element of the list.
   - The program does not correctly check if the water can be redistributed to the target amount using the allowed operations.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program's logic is fundamentally flawed. It does not calculate the target amount of water correctly.
   - The program does not check if the water can be redistributed to the target amount using the allowed operations.
   - The program's condition `if curr == 0` is not a valid check for the problem's requirements.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water `target = sum(nums) // n`.
   - Check if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have `target` units of water.
   - A key observation is that if the water can be redistributed, the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount should be zero at the end of the process.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the third test case `a = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`:
     - The target amount is `sum([4, 5, 2, 1, 3]) // 5 = 15 // 5 = 3`.
     - We can redistribute the water as follows:
       - Pour 1 unit from the first container to the fourth: `[3, 5, 2, 2, 3]`.
       - Pour 1 unit from the second container to the third: `[3, 4, 3, 2, 3]`.
       - Pour 1 unit from the second container to the fourth: `[3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
     - The program should output 'YES' for this case, but it does not because it uses the wrong logic.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if the water can be redistributed to the target amount.
   - The program's logic is flawed and does not align with the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
