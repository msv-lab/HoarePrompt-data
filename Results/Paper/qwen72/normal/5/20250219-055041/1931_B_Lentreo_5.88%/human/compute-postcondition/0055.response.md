The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop iterates over the elements of `nums`, so the state of `i` will be adjusted to the next element in `nums` for the loop to execute one more time. The list `nums` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least two elements, and `i` is the second element of `nums`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element of `nums`.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input that must have at least three elements, `last` is the second element of the `nums` list, `i` is the third element of `nums`. If `i` is not 0, `curr` is updated to `i - last` plus its previous value. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains 0.**
