Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder (not used).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `last` is the last element of the `nums` list.
   - `curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for all non-zero elements `i` in `nums`.
   - `curr` is not equal to 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, `last`, and `curr` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The condition that `curr` is not equal to 0 is given, but it does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **NO**
