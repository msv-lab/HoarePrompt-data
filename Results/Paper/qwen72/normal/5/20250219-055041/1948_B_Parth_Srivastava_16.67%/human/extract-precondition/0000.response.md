The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the array and its length, as well as potentially the number of test cases. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def can_sort_array(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.**
