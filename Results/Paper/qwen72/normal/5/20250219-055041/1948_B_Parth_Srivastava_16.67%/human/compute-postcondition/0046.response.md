Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` <= `x`, `n` is updated to `n + 2` and `c` now includes the values of `y` and `x`. Otherwise, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is updated to `n + 1`.***
