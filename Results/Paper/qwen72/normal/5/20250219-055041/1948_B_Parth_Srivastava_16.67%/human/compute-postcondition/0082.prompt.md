Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0 or greater than 0. If `a[i]` > 10 and `i` > 0, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer division of `a[i]` by 10, and if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (which is `c[n - 1]`) and `y` <= `x`, then `n` is 2 and `c` is a list with two elements `[y, x]`. Otherwise, `n` is 1 and `c` is a list with one element, `c[0]` is `a[i]`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0] / 10`, and if `y` <= `x`, then `n` is 2 and `c` is a list containing the integer part of `a[0] / 10` and the last digit of `a[0]`. If `y` > `x`, then `n` is 1 and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`. If `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, or if `i` is not 0 and `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, then `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, and `i` is 1 or greater than 1. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10. If `y` >= `c[n - 1]`, `n` is updated to `n + 2` and `c` now includes the values of `y` and `x`. Otherwise, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` at the end, and `n` is updated to `n + 1`. If `a[i] <= 10` or `i == 0`, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` appended to it, `x` and `y` are determined based on the new value of `a[i]` (if `i` is within the bounds of `a`), `n` is `n + 1`, and `c` and `x` and `y` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y` as described in the conditions.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `i + 1` elements, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, `x` is the last digit of the integer at index `i` in the list `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` by 10, `c` is a list that now includes the integer at index `i` in the list `a`, and `n` is `n + 1`. If `y` >= `c[n - 1]`, `c` is a list that now includes either the last digit and the integer part of the division of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` by 10, and `n` is `n + 2`. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, `x` is the last digit of the integer at index `i` in the list `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` by 10, `c` is a list that includes either the value of `y` and `x` at its end if `y <= x`, or the integer at index `i` from the list `a` if `y > x`, `n` is `n + 2` if `y <= x` or `n + 1` if `y > x`. Otherwise, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` which was appended to it, and `n` is `n + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
