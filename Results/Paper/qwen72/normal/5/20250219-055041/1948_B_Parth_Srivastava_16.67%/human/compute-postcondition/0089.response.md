The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is inferred that the function accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(n, a)` consisting of an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list `a` of `n` integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case `(n, a)`, the function processes the list `a` and returns a specific value based on the elements in `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
