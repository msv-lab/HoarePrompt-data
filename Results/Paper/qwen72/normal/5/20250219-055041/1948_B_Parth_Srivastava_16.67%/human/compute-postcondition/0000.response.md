The value of `k` is assigned the result of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The other variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer.**
