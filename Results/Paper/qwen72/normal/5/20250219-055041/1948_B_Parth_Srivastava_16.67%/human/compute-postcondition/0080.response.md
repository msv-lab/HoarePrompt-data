Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is `i + 1`. If `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, `x` is the last digit of the integer at index `i` in the list `a`, `y` is the integer part of the division of the integer at index `i` in the list `a` by 10, `c` is a list that includes either the value of `y` and `x` at its end if `y <= x`, or the integer at index `i` from the list `a` if `y > x`, `n` is `n + 2` if `y <= x` or `n + 1` if `y > x`. Otherwise, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` which was appended to it, and `n` is `n + 1`.***
