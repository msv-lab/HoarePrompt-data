The value of `y`, which is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, is appended to the list `c`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `x`, `n`, and any other variables not mentioned in the code remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i]` divided by 10, `n` and `c` are updated based on the new values of `x` and `y` as described in the conditions, `c` now includes the value of `y`.**
