### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - The function iterates over the array `a` and processes each element:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the digit `y` (the tens place) is greater than or equal to the previous element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x` (the units place). If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If the conditions are not met, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is the first in the array and greater than 10, it splits the element into digits `x` and `y` and appends them to `c` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` as is.
   - After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version `d`.
   - If `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After all test cases are processed, the program iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of the First Element:**
   - The condition `if i == 0 and a[i] > 10:` is redundant because the first element can be split without needing to check the previous element in `c`.

2. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The logic for splitting the digits and appending them to `c` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `if y >= c[n - 1]` and `if y <= x` are not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted.
   - The program should consider all possible splits and check if any of them can result in a sorted array.

3. **Inefficient and Incomplete Check:**
   - The program only checks if the array `c` is sorted after the first pass of the loop, which is not enough. It should recursively check if further splits are needed to sort the array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the splitting of elements and does not ensure that the array can be sorted after all possible operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
