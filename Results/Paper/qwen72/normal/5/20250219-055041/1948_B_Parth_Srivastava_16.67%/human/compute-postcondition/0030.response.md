Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0] / 10`, `n` is 0, `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, and `a[i]` is greater than 10, and `y` is greater than `x`.**
