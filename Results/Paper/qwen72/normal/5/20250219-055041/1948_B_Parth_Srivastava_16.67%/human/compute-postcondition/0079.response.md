Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `test_cases` is a list of t elements where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50 and a list a of n integers such that 0 <= a_i <= 99, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `i + 1` elements, `i` is `i + 1`, `c` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]` which was appended to it, `n` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `n` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `n` is `n + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
