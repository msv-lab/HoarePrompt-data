Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If any element `l[k]` is equal to `k + 2` and the next element `l[k + 1]` is equal to `k + 1` for any `k` in the range 0 to `n-2`, then `j` is 1 and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed its full run. The variable `j` will be 1 if there was any index `k` in the list `l` where the element at index `k` is `k + 2` and the element at index `k + 1` is `k + 1`. If no such index exists, `j` will remain 0. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
