The function `func` accepts parameters that represent a set of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers. `n` is the number of friends, and `p` is a list where each element `p_i` represents the best friend of friend `i`. The constraints are that `1 <= t <= 5000` for the number of test cases, `2 <= n <= 50` for the number of friends, `1 <= p_i <= n` for the best friend index, and `p_i â‰  i` and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, which is not specified in the output section. However, based on the parameters and constraints, a reasonable assumption is that the function returns some form of output for each test case, likely related to the best friend relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts a set of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the best friend relationships specified in `p`.**
