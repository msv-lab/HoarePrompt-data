The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(3)
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - There does not exist an index `i` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` in the list `l`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the integer value `3`.

3. **Determination of Output:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It directly prints the integer `3`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **3**
