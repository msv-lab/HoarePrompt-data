Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the first element of `l` is 3 and the second element of `l` is 2, then `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
