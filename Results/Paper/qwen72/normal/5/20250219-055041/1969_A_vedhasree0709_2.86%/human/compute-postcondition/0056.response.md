The loop head in the given task is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```
This loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, and the variable `_` is used as a placeholder for the loop index, which is not used inside the loop body.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `i` is `n`
- `l` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `j` is 0 or 1, depending on the conditions described

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
2. The number of iterations is determined by the user input, which is not modified within the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `_` will be 2. The user input for the number of iterations remains the same and is not modified.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is `n`, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0 or 1 (unchanged)**
