Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user. If the second element of `l` is 4 and the third element of `l` is 3, then `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.***
