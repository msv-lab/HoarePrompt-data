Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0 or 1 (unchanged)**

The value of `i` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `_`, `l`, and `j` is still valid, and `i` is now set to 0.
