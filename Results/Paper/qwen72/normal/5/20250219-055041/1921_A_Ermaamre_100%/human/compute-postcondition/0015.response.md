Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `a` is a 4xN list of integers, where N is the number of integers input on each line.
   - `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(dx * dx)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `a` is a 4xN list of integers. This means `a` has 4 sublists, each containing N integers.
   - `x` is a list that contains the first element of each of these 4 sublists. Therefore, `x` will have 4 elements, each being the first element of the corresponding sublist in `a`.
   - `dx` is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.
   - The `print` statement will output the square of `dx`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `x` contains 4 elements, and these elements are the first elements of each sublist in `a`, the values of `x` are determined by the first elements of the sublists in `a`.
   - `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.
   - The `print` statement will output `dx * dx`, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Since the exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `dx * dx`. However, we can describe the output based on the given information.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`, and `x` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `a`)**
