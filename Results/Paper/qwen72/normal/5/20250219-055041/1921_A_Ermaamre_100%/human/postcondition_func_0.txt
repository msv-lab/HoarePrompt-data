The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers `x_i`, `_y_i_` representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and prints the area of the square (side length squared) for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the areas of the squares.
