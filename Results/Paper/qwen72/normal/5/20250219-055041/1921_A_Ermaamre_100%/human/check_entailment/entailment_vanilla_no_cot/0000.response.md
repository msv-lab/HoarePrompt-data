Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four lines of input, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: The program extracts the x-coordinates of the four points and stores them in the list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation**: The program then calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`) and prints the result.

Given the constraints and the problem description, this approach is valid and will correctly compute the area of the square for each test case.
