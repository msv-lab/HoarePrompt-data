Reasoning: The original assessment points out that the program should consider both x and y coordinates to ensure the correct side length is determined and that it should validate the input to ensure the coordinates form a valid square. However, the problem description explicitly guarantees that the input coordinates will form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. This means that the program does not need to handle invalid inputs or check if the coordinates form a valid square, as these conditions are guaranteed.

Given this guarantee, the program's approach of calculating the side length using only the x-coordinates (or only the y-coordinates) is sufficient. The side length of the square will be the same whether calculated from the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates, and the program correctly computes the area by squaring this side length.

The original assessment's concern about the program not handling invalid inputs is not applicable because the problem guarantees valid input. Therefore, the program as written is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
