Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are given in random order, but it is guaranteed that they form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**
