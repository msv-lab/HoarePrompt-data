Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.** 

The value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, while the values of `T`, `_`, `S`, `N`, and `num` remain unchanged. The condition that `num` > `cur` is not checked by the given code, so the value of `cur` remains the same as it was before the execution of the code.
