Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, `cur` is equal to the second element in `N` if `num` <= `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is `cur` + 1, `num` remains the second element in `N`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
