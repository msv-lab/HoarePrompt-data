Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any), and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in `N` up to the point where `num` > `cur + 1` or the end of the list is reached, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any), and the sum of the values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`.**
