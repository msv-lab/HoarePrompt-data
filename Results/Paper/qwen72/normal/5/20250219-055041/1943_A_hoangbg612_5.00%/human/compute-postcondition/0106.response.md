Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary as described, `cur` is the first index `i` in the range of the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any) where `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`. If no such index exists, `cur` is the last integer in `N` that is exactly one more than the previous integer in `N` (if any).**

Explanation: The code snippet `S = int(input())` updates the value of `S` to an integer provided by the user. The other variables (`T`, `_`, `N`, `M`, and `cur`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `S` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
