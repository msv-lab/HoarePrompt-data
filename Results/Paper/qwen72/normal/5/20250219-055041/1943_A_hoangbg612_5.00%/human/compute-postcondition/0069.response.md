Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, `cur` is updated to `num`, and `num` is greater than `cur - 1`. If `num` â‰¤ `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with its value incremented by 1, and `cur` remains -1.***
