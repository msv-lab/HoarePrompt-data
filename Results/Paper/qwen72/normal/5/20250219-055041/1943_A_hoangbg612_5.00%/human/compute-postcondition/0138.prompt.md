Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element, `M` is a dictionary, `cur` is -1 or the first element in `N`, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, `cur` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is greater than -1. If `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is set to 0 and `num` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 0, `cur` remains -1, and `num` is less than or equal to -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, and `cur` is updated to the second element in `N` if `num` <= `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` <= `cur`, `cur` remains the first element in `N`, `num` remains the second element in `N`, and the value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` > `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cur` is incremented by 1 and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
