Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`. If `num` > `cur + 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.**
