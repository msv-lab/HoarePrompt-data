Postcondition: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `M` is a dictionary. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, and `cur` is updated to the second element in `N` if `num` <= `cur` + 1, otherwise `cur` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` <= `cur`, `cur` remains the first element in `N`, `num` remains the second element in `N`, and the value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
