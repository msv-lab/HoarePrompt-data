Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If the sum of the values in `M` is equal to `S`, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, incremented by 1. If `N` contains no such integers, `cur` is 0, and `M` is a dictionary with -1 as the key and the count of all elements in `N` as its value. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and `M` is unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cur):
    if M[i] <= i:
        cur = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to `i` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `cur` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers in `N` that are not greater than the previous integer by more than 1, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears consecutively in `N`, `i` is 2. If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, `cur` is set to 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains greater than 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
