### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`.
   - The list `a` is initialized with `n` elements, all set to 0.

2. **Setting the First Element:**
   - The first element of `a` is set to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` for all `1 \le i \le n`.

3. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `1 \le i < n`), the value is set to `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i]` because:
     - `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`
     - Therefore, `a[i] \bmod a[i-1] = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1] \bmod a[i-1] = x[i-1]` (since `x[i-1] < a[i-1]`).

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the list `a` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- The construction of the array `a` ensures that the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` is satisfied for all `2 \le i \le n`.
- The choice of `a[0] = 500` is arbitrary but valid, and the subsequent elements are constructed correctly based on the given `x` values.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
