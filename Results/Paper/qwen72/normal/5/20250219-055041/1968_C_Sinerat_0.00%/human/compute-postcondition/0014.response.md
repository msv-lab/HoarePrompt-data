Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a[1]` is set to `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is set to `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is set to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`**

The value of `n` is updated to an integer input by the user, which must be greater than 0. The value of `i` is still `n-1`. The array `a` is still being populated according to the initial state, where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-1`) is the sum of the previous element `a[j-1]` and the corresponding element `x[j-1]`.
