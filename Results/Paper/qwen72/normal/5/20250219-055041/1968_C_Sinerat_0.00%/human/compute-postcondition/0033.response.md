The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is the new input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2. The value of `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500 and the second element is 500 + `x[0]`, and the rest are 0, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
