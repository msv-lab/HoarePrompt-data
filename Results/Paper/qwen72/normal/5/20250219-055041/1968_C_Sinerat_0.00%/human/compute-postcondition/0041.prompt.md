You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle input through a predefined structure or external method not shown in the function definition. Typically, it would involve reading multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `x` where `2 <= n <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: After all iterations, the variable `t` (number of test cases) is reduced to 0, and for each test case, the variable `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` from `x[0]` to `x[i-1]` added to 500, and `x` is a list of integers provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `x`. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters but rather handles them through a predefined structure or external method. For each test case, `n` is an integer where `2 <= n <= 500`, and `x` is a list of integers where each element `x_i` satisfies `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`, and the sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
