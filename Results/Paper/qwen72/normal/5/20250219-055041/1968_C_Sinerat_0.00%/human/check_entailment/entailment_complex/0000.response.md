Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve the problem of finding an array \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\). The program initializes the first element of the array \(a\) to 500 and then constructs the subsequent elements of \(a\) by adding the corresponding element of \(x\) to the previous element of \(a\).

Let's break down the logic and check if it satisfies the problem constraints:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The first element \(a_1\) is set to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

2. **Construction of \(a\)**:
   - For each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), the program sets \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).
   - This ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because \(a_i\) is exactly \(a_{i-1}\) plus \(x_i\), making \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the array \(a\) for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the range of test cases.
   - The constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\) and \(2 \le n \le 500\) are respected.
   - The values of \(x_i\) are within the range \(1 \le x_i \le 500\), and the values of \(a_i\) will be within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) because the maximum value of \(a_i\) is \(500 + (n-1) \times 500\), which is well within \(10^9\) for \(n \le 500\).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with \(n = 4\) and \(x = [2, 4, 1]\):
     - \(a_1 = 500\)
     - \(a_2 = 500 + 2 = 502\)
     - \(a_3 = 502 + 4 = 506\)
     - \(a_4 = 506 + 1 = 507\)
     - The output is \(500, 502, 506, 507\), and:
       - \(502 \bmod 500 = 2\)
       - \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\)
       - \(507 \bmod 506 = 1\)
     - This satisfies the conditions.

   - For the second test case with \(n = 3\) and \(x = [1, 1]\):
     - \(a_1 = 500\)
     - \(a_2 = 500 + 1 = 501\)
     - \(a_3 = 501 + 1 = 502\)
     - The output is \(500, 501, 502\), and:
       - \(501 \bmod 500 = 1\)
       - \(502 \bmod 501 = 1\)
     - This satisfies the conditions.

   - For the third test case with \(n = 6\) and \(x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]\):
     - \(a_1 = 500\)
     - \(a_2 = 500 + 4 = 504\)
     - \(a_3 = 504 + 2 = 506\)
     - \(a_4 = 506 + 5 = 511\)
     - \(a_5 = 511 + 1 = 512\)
     - \(a_6 = 512 + 2 = 514\)
     - The output is \(500, 504, 506, 511, 512, 514\), and:
       - \(504 \bmod 500 = 4\)
       - \(506 \bmod 504 = 2\)
       - \(511 \bmod 506 = 5\)
       - \(512 \bmod 511 = 1\)
       - \(514 \bmod 512 = 2\)
     - This satisfies the conditions.

   - For the fourth test case with \(n = 2\) and \(x = [500]\):
     - \(a_1 = 500\)
     - \(a_2 = 500 + 500 = 1000\)
     - The output is \(500, 1000\), and:
       - \(1000 \bmod 500 = 0\)
     - This does not satisfy the condition \(x_2 = 500\). The correct output should be \(501, 500\) to satisfy \(500 \bmod 501 = 500\).

   - For the fifth test case with \(n = 3\) and \(x = [1, 5]\):
     - \(a_1 = 500\)
     - \(a_2 = 500 + 1 = 501\)
     - \(a_3 = 501 + 5 = 506\)
     - The output is \(500, 501, 506\), and:
       - \(501 \bmod 500 = 1\)
       - \(506 \bmod 501 = 5\)
     - This satisfies the conditions.

The program fails to handle the fourth test case correctly. The issue arises because the initial value of \(a_1\) is set to 500, which can lead to incorrect results when \(x_i\) is 500. To fix this, \(a_1\) should be set to a value greater than 500 to ensure that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

Correctness: **False**
