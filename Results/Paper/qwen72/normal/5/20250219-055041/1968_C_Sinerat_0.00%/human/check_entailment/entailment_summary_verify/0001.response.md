### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\), and 500 is within this range.

2. **Construction of `a[i]` for \(i \geq 1\):**
   - The program constructs `a[i]` as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - This ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\), because:
     - \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\)
     - Therefore, \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\).

3. **Constraints Check:**
   - The values of `a[i]` are constructed by adding `x[i-1]` to `a[i-1]`, which means `a[i]` will always be greater than or equal to `a[i-1] + 1`.
   - Since \(1 \le x_i \le 500\), the maximum value of `a[i]` will be \(500 + (n-1) \times 500\), which is \(500n\).
   - Given \(n \le 500\), the maximum value of `a[i]` will be \(500 \times 500 = 250000\), which is well within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a` for each test case, which is the required output format.

5. **Function Summary Validation:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func`.
   - It processes multiple test cases, initializes `a[0]` to 500, and constructs the subsequent elements of `a` as the cumulative sum of the elements in `x` added to 500.
   - The function prints the list `a` for each test case, which aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs. The function summary and the original assessment are accurate in their description and reasoning. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
