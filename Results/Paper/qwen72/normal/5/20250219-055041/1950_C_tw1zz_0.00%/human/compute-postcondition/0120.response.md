Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, and `h` is not equal to '02'. If `h` is '03', `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.***
