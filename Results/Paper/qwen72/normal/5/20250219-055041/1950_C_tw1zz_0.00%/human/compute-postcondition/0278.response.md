Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. For each iteration, the hour part `h` and minute part `m` of the input time are processed. If `h` is between '01' and '12', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is between '13' and '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is set to 'PM'. If `h` is '00', `h1` is set to '12' and `time` is set to 'PM'. The minute part `m1` is always set to `m`. After all iterations, the loop has printed the converted 12-hour format time for each input time.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all the iterations, the initial conditions for `t` and `s` remain unchanged. For each input time provided, the loop converts the hour part `h` to the 12-hour format and sets the appropriate period ('AM' or 'PM'). The minute part `m` is preserved and printed alongside the converted hour part `h1` and the period. The loop prints the converted time for each input time, and the variables `h1` and `time` are reset for each new input.
