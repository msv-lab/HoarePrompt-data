Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format.
- `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string.
- The conditions for `h1` and `time` are as follows:
  - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
  - If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour and `time` is 'PM'.
  - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
  - Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

### Print Statement:
```
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Extract `h` and `m` from `s`:**
   - `s` is in the format "hh:mm".
   - `h` is the first two characters of `s`.
   - `m` is the last two characters of `s`.

2. **Determine `h1` and `time` based on `h`:**
   - If `h` is '01', `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', or '12', `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '13', '14', '15', '16', '17', '18', '19', '20', '21', '22', or '23', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (i.e., `h` - 12) and `time` is 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '00', `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.

3. **Construct the output string:**
   - The `print` statement concatenates `h1`, ':', `m`, ' ', and `time` without any separators (due to `sep=''`).

### Example Scenarios:
- If `s` is "01:30":
  - `h` is '01'.
  - `m` is '30'.
  - `h1` is '01'.
  - `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **01:30 AM**

- If `s` is "13:45":
  - `h` is '13'.
  - `m` is '45'.
  - `h1` is '01' (13 - 12).
  - `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **01:45 PM**

- If `s` is "00:15":
  - `h` is '00'.
  - `m` is '15'.
  - `h1` is '12'.
  - `time` is 'PM'.
  - Output: **12:15 PM**

- If `s` is "12:00":
  - `h` is '12'.
  - `m` is '00'.
  - `h1` is '12'.
  - `time` is 'AM'.
  - Output: **12:00 AM**

### General Case:
- For any valid `s` in the format "hh:mm":
  - `h1` will be the 12-hour format of the hour part of `s`.
  - `time` will be 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part of `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **[h1]:[m] [time] (where [h1] is the 12-hour format of the hour part of `s`, [m] is the minute part of `s`, and [time] is 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour part of `s`)**
