The loop head in the given task is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

This loop iterates a fixed number of times based on the integer input provided by `int(input())`. The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will execute as long as the current iteration count is less than the integer provided by the input.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440
- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format
- `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string
- `m1` is equal to `m`
- `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string
- `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h` as described

Since the loop variable `_` is not used and the loop head only depends on the input provided by `int(input())`, the state of the loop variables does not change from iteration to iteration. The loop will execute the same number of times regardless of the values of `t`, `s`, `m`, `m1`, `h`, `h1`, or `time`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the implicit increment of the loop variable `_` which is not tracked in the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to `m`, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, `h1` and `time` are determined based on the value of `h` as described**
