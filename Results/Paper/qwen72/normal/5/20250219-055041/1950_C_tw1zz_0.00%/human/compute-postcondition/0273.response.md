Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `m` is the minute part of the input time as a string, `m1` is equal to the minute part of the input time as a string, `h` is the hour part of the input time as a string, and `h` and `m` are updated to the hour and minute parts of the new input time. If `h` is '04', `h1` is set to '04' and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is '05', `h1` is set to '05' and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is '06', `h1` is set to '06' and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is between '07' and '12', `h1` is set to the corresponding hour and `time` is set to 'AM'. If `h` is between '13' and '23' or '00', `h1` is set to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.) and `time` is set to 'PM'. Otherwise, `h1` remains an empty string and `time` remains an empty string.**
