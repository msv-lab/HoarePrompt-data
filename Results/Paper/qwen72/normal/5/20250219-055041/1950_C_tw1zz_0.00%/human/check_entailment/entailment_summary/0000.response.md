Reasoning:  
The program is designed to convert a given time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the correct use of 'AM' and 'PM'. The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to handle each hour from '00' to '23' and correctly converts the hour to its 12-hour format equivalent. However, there is a critical flaw in the handling of the '12' hour:

- For '12' in 24-hour format, the program sets `h1 = '12'` and `time = 'AM'`, which is incorrect. '12' in 24-hour format should be '12:00 PM' in 12-hour format, not '12:00 AM'.
- For '00' in 24-hour format, the program correctly sets `h1 = '12'` and `time = 'PM'`.

Additionally, the program could be simplified by using a more concise approach, such as calculating the 12-hour format hour directly and determining the 'AM' or 'PM' based on the hour value.

Given the critical flaw in the handling of '12' in 24-hour format, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
