### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at intervals of `a` and `b` minutes, respectively.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - If a firework from the first installation is launched at time `x`, it will be visible from `x` to `x + m`.
   - If a firework from the second installation is launched at time `y`, it will be visible from `y` to `y + m`.

3. **Simultaneous Visibility:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes, plus any additional fireworks that might be visible due to the overlap.

4. **Calculating the Number of Fireworks:**
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // a + 1`.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // b + 1`.
   - The total number of fireworks visible at any given minute is the sum of these two values.

5. **Handling Overlap:**
   - The provided solution adds 2 to the sum of `m // a + m // b` to account for the possibility of overlap.
   - However, this approach is incorrect because it does not accurately account for the overlap of visibility periods. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the exact overlap points.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the visibility window and the launch intervals.
   - The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute is:
     \[
     \text{max\_visible} = \max(1 + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{m + a}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m + b}{b} \right\rfloor)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the visibility window and the launch intervals, ensuring that we correctly handle the overlap.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `a` and `b` are both 1, the installations will launch fireworks every minute, and the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given minute will be `m + 2`.
   - The provided solution correctly handles this case by adding 2 to the sum of `m // a + m // b`.

8. **General Case:**
   - For other values of `a` and `b`, the provided solution does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility periods. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` can overestimate the number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect for the given problem. It does not accurately account for the overlap of visibility periods, leading to potential overestimation of the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
