Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem's requirements. Specifically, the program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and adds 2 to the result. However, this approach does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by both installations.

A correct approach would involve calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the visibility overlap. The program should find the time when the maximum number of fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time, which is not simply the sum of the number of launches plus 2.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The expected output is `2` because the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from each installation at time 7).

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```
This is incorrect because the program adds 2 to the sum of the number of launches, which does not reflect the actual visibility overlap.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
