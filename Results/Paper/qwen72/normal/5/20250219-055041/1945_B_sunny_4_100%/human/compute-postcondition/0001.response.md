Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `a`, `b`, and `m` are the input integers, `A` is `int(m/a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m/b) + 1`, and `A + B` is printed.**

Explanation:
- `t` is assigned the value of the input integer.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are still the input integers as they are not affected by the code.
- `A` is still `int(m/a) + 1`.
- `B` is still `int(m/b) + 1`.
- The value of `A + B` is still printed.
