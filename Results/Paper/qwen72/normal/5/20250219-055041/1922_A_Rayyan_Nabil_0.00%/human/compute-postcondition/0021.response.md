Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is an input string. If for any index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` is 'NO'.**
