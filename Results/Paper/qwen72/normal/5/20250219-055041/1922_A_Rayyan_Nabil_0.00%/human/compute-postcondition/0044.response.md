Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than `n`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings, and `l` is 'NO' or 'YES'. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `c` and the first character of `b` is not equal to the first character of `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.***
