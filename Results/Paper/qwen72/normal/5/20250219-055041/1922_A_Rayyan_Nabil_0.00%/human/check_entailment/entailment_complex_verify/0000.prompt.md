You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `l` is 'NO' or 'YES'. For each iteration, if any character at index `i` in `a` is not equal to the corresponding character in `c` and the character at index `i` in `b` is also not equal to the corresponding character in `c`, then `l` is 'YES'. Otherwise, `l` remains 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `n` is the length of the strings and all strings consist of lowercase Latin letters. The function then checks, for each character position in the strings, if the character in `a` or `b` matches the corresponding character in `c`. If at any position, both `a` and `b` do not match `c`, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to properly check if there exists a template that both `a` and `b` match, while `c` does not. The program only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the same template.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

The program will output:
```
YES
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
NO
```

In this case, there is no template that both `a` and `b` can match while `c` does not. The program incorrectly assumes that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for all `i`, then a valid template exists. This is not always true, as `a` and `b` must also match the same template.
