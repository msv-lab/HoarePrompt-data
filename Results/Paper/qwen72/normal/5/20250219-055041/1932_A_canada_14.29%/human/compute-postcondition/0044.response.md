The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `s`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first character in the list `s` at the start of the loop.

State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0**
