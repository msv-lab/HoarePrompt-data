Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s` and is currently equal to `@`, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `len` is the integer value of the input.**

The code snippet `thorn = 0` does not change the value of `thorn` because it was already 0 in the initial state. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
