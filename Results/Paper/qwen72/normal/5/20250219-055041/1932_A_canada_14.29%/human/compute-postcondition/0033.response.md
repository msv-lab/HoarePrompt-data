Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `thorn` was 2, `thorn` is increased by 1, `ret` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1, and if `i` is '*', `thorn` remains 1 and `ret` remains unchanged. If `i` is not equal to '*' or '@', `thorn` remains 1 and `ret` remains unchanged. If `i` is '@', `thorn` remains 1 and `ret` is increased by 1.***
