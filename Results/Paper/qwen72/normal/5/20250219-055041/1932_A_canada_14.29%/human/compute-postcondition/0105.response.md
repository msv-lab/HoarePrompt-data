Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0, and `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `s` and `i` remain unchanged.***
