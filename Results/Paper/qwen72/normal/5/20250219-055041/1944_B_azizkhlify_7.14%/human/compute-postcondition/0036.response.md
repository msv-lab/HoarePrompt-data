To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, we know that `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, which implies that the list `a` must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is 2 and `n` is the length of the list, `n > 2`).

3. **Accessing `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 2, the code will access the element at index 2 of the list `a`. The value of `a[2]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know it is the third element of the list `a`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[2]` twice.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **a[2] a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
