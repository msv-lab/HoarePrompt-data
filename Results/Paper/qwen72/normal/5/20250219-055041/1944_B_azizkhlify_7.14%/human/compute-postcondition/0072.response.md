The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `res`. If `res` has more than one element, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `res` is a non-empty list, and `i` is the first element of `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `res`.

State: **`res` must be a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `res`**
