Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is 1, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, `ur` is 0, and `k` is non-zero. The element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1.**
