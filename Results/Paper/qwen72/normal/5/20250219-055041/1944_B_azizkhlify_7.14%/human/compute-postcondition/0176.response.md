To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which `i` is defined:

1. **`a` is a list of integers**: This means `a` contains a sequence of integer values.
2. **`n` is at least 1**: This indicates that `a` has at least one element.
3. **`k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`**: This suggests that `k` is updated based on a formula involving `ul`.
4. **`res` is a list containing at least three elements**: This means `res` has at least three elements, and `i` is the next element in `res`.
5. **`l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1**: This means `l` is a frequency list for the first `n` elements of `a`.
6. **`r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1**: This means `r` is a frequency list for the elements from index `n` to `2 * n - 1` of `a`.
7. **`re` is the number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop broke early or the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a` if the loop completed)**: This indicates the size of `res` based on the loop's termination condition.
8. **`ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`**: This means `ul` counts the elements in the first `n` elements of `a` that appear exactly twice.
9. **`ur` is 0**: This indicates that `ur` is not used in the context provided.

Given the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, `i` is the next element in the list `res`. Since `res` is a list containing at least three elements, `i` will be the next element in `res` after the first three elements.

However, the exact value of `i` is not explicitly provided in the initial state. The value of `i` depends on the elements in `res` and the context in which `i` is determined. Since `res` is a list and `i` is the next element in `res`, we can only describe `i` in terms of the elements of `res`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the next element in the list res after the first three elements)**
