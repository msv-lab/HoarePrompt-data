### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the counts of each integer in the first and second halves of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero, which are used to track the number of elements selected for the arrays `l` and `r`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in the first half of the array `a` and stores the counts in `l`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the second half of the array `a` and stores the counts in `r`.

3. **Selecting Elements for `l`**:
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` and selects elements that appear exactly twice in the first half.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count `ul` until it has selected `2k` elements.
   - If fewer than `2k` elements are found, it then selects elements that appear exactly once in the first half and stores them in the list `res` and updates the count `re`.

4. **Selecting Elements for `r`**:
   - The program prints the elements stored in `res` (which are the elements that appear exactly once in the first half).
   - It then iterates through the second half of the array `a` and selects elements that appear exactly twice in the second half to match the count `ul` of elements in `l`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the selected elements for `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Counting and Selection**:
  - The program incorrectly counts the occurrences of elements in the first and second halves of the array `a`. The lists `l` and `r` are used to count occurrences, but they are not used correctly to select elements.
  - The program does not correctly handle the selection of elements for `l` and `r` to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

- **Logical Errors**:
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than 1. It only prints elements from the first half and then from the second half without ensuring the XOR condition.
  - The variables `ul` and `ur` are not correctly updated to ensure that the number of elements selected for `l` and `r` are equal.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`, and it does not correctly handle the selection of elements for `l` and `r`.

### Correctness:
**False**
