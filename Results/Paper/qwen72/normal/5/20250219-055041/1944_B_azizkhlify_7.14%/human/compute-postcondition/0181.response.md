Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`.
   - `res` is a list containing all elements from `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed (or `n` if the loop completed without breaking).
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
   - `re` is the number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop broke early or the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a` if the loop completed).
   - `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - The number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a` (`ul`) is not equal to 0 (`ur`).
   - The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.
   - From the initial state, we know that `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed.
   - The condition `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 indicates that the element at index `i` in `a` has been counted twice in the list `r`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, the element `a[i]` must have appeared exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value of the element at index i in the list a, and this element appears exactly twice in the first n elements of a)**
