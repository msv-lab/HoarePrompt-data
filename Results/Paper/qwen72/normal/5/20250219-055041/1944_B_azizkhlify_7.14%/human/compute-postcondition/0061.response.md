To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `ul` is either `k * 2` or less than `k * 2` depending on the number of times the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 2` was met.
- `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
- The elements of `l` and `r` remain unchanged except for the increments based on the initial values of `a`.
- If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `re` is increased by 1.
- `res` contains the first and second elements of `a`.
- If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `re` and `res` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is 2.
2. **Value of `a[i]`**: The initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[i]`. However, it mentions that `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is the third element of the list `a`.

Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

### Output:
The code prints the third element of the list `a` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
