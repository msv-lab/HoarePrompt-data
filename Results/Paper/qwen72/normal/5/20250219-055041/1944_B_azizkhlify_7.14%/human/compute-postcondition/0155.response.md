Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is at least 1.
   - `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`.
   - `res` is a list.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1.
   - `re` is 0 or 1.
   - `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `k` is non-zero.
   - If `re` is equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `l` is 1, then `res` contains the first element of `a` and `re` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains an empty list and `re` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is 1.
   - The `print` statement will print the element at index `1` of the list `a`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the second element of the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The code will print the second element of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list a)**
