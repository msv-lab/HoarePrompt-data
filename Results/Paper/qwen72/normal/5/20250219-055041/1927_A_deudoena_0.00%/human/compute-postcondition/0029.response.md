Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `i` is 2, `ind2` is 2, `outind` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
