The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `inpstr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `inpstr` and the value of `i`. If `i` is less than the length of `inpstr`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `inpstr` must have at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `inpstr` must still have at least 2 characters (so that `i` can be less than `len(inpstr)`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `i` is 2. If the character at the second-to-last position of `inpstr` is 'B', then `ind2` is set to 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ind2` remains 0, and `outind` remains 0.**
