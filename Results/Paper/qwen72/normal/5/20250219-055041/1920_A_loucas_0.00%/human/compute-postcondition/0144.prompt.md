You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by n lines, each containing two integers a (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), where a denotes the type of constraint and x is the value associated with the constraint. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop will have completed all iterations, with `iterable` equal to `loop - 1` and `num` set to the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1` that is not in `no` for each test case. If no such value is found in any test case, `num` will remain 0 for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` reads input from stdin, which includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a number of constraints, where each constraint is defined by a type (1, 2, or 3) and a value. The function processes these constraints and writes the output to stdout. The output for each test case is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function will produce some result based on the constraints provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
