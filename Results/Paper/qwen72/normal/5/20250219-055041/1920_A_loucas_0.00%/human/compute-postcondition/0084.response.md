Postcondition: ***`iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is `max(big)`, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is 1, `less` is a non-empty list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is 2, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big)`, `no` is a list containing all the values of `a` where `x` is not 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
