The only objects in the loop head are the variables `iterable` and `loop`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute until it finds the first value of `i` that is not in `no` and is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`. If such a value is found, `num` will be set to this value, and the loop will terminate. If no such value is found, `num` will remain unchanged, and the loop will complete all iterations.

For the loop to execute one more time, `iterable` must be incremented by 1, and `loop` must still be greater than the new value of `iterable`.

State: **`iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`**
