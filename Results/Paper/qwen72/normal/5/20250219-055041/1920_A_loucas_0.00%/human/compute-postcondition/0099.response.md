Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is an empty list, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `no` is an empty list.**

The value of `num` is now set to 0. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
