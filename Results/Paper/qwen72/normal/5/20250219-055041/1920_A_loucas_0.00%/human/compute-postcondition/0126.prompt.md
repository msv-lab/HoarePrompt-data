Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `less` is an empty list, `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `big` is an empty list, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`, `no` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`less` is an empty list or contains `[a]` if `x` is 2. `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list. `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `x` is 1, `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`. `x` and `a` are input integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` and `a` are input integers. `less` is an empty list or contains `[a]` if `x` is 2. `iterable` is `iterable + 1`, `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is the input integer that must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1. `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list or contains `[a, a]` if `x` is not 1. `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `x` is 1 or 2, `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` and `a` are assigned new input integers. `less` is an empty list or contains `[a]` if `x` is 2. `iterable` is `iterable + 1`. `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`. `num` is 0. `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 1. `iterable2` is 2. `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list or contains `[a, a]` if `x` is not 1. `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`. `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. If `x` is 1 or 2, `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `no` is a list containing the input integer `a`. If `x` is 1, `big` now contains `[a, a]`. If `x` is not 1, `big` now contains `[a, a, a]` if `x` is not 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
