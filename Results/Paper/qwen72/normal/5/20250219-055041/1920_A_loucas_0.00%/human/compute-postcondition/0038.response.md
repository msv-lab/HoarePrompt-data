The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `big`, and `less`. The loop iterates over the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, exclusive. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the conditions for the range must still hold true.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `big` must contain at least one element.
- `less` must contain at least one element.
- `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`.
- If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `big` must still contain at least one element.
- `less` must still contain at least one element.
- `max(big)` must still be less than `min(less)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`big` must contain at least one element, `less` must contain at least one element, `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`**
