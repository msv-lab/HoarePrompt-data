To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop head.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `big` is a non-empty list.
- `less` is a non-empty list.
- `max(big) < min(less)`.
- `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`.
- If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `max(big)` and `min(less)` are the bounds of the loop.

2. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute Again:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range from `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`.
   - The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - The lists `big` and `less` must remain such that `max(big) < min(less)` to ensure the range is valid.
   - The list `no` must not contain the new value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` must still be valid, meaning `max(big) < min(less)`.

### Final State:
State: **`big` is a non-empty list, `less` is a non-empty list, `max(big) < min(less)`, and `i` is the next integer in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no` and is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `no`, `num` is equal to `i`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
