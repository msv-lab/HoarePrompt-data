Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to find the first integer `k` that satisfies all constraints but does not count the total number of such integers `k`. The logic for determining the range of valid `k` values is also flawed. Here's a more detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Range Calculation**: The program should determine the range of valid `k` values based on the maximum value from the "greater than or equal to" constraints (`max(big)`) and the minimum value from the "less than or equal to" constraints (`min(less)`). The valid range is from `max(big)` to `min(less)`, inclusive.

2. **Counting Valid Integers**: Instead of finding the first valid integer and breaking out of the loop, the program should count all integers within the valid range that do not appear in the "not equal to" constraints (`no`).

3. **Output**: The program should output the count of valid integers, not the first valid integer found.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        big = []
        less = []
        no = set()
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                big.append(x)
            elif a == 2:
                less.append(x)
            else:
                no.add(x)
        
        min_k = max(big)
        max_k = min(less)
        
        if min_k > max_k:
            print(0)
        else:
            count = max_k - min_k + 1 - len([x for x in range(min_k, max_k + 1) if x in no])
            print(count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the number of constraints for each test case.
2. **Constraint Collection**: It collects the constraints into lists `big` and `less` for "greater than or equal to" and "less than or equal to" constraints, respectively. It uses a set `no` for "not equal to" constraints to ensure uniqueness and efficient lookup.
3. **Range Calculation**: It calculates the minimum valid `k` (`min_k`) as the maximum value in `big` and the maximum valid `k` (`max_k`) as the minimum value in `less`.
4. **Range Validation**: If `min_k` is greater than `max_k`, it prints `0` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
5. **Counting Valid Integers**: It counts the number of integers in the range `[min_k, max_k]` that are not in the `no` set and prints this count.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
