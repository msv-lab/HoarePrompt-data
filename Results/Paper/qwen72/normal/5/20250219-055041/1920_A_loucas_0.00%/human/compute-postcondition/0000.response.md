The code snippet `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and based on the initial state, it is guaranteed that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer `loop` (1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer `n` (2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, followed by `n` lines, each containing two integers `a` (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}) and `x` (1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9), where `a` denotes the type of constraint and `x` is the value associated with the constraint. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
