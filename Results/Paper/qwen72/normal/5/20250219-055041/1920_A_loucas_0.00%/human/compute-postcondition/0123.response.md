Output State: **`x` and `a` are assigned new input integers. `less` is an empty list or contains `[a]` if `x` is 2. `iterable` is `iterable + 1`. `loop` must be greater than `iterable + 1`. `num` is 0. `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 1. `iterable2` is 2. `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` if `x` is 1, otherwise `big` is an empty list or contains `[a, a]` if `x` is not 1. `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`. `i` is the first value in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)` that is not in `no`. `no` is a list containing the input integer `a` regardless of the value of `x`.**
