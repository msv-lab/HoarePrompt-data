Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input in the form of multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates are within the range -1000 to 1000, inclusive, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**
