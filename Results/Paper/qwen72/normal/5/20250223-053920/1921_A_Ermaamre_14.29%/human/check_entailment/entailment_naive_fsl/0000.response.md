Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the given problem. Specifically, the program assumes a fixed order of the coordinates for the sides of the square, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The coordinates of the corners are given in random order, and the program does not account for all possible permutations of the coordinates.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```
The program will correctly compute the area as 9. However, if the input is:
```
1
1 5
4 2
1 2
4 5
```
The program will not correctly compute the area because it does not handle the case where the coordinates are provided in a different order. The logic in the program is not robust enough to determine the correct side length of the square regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
