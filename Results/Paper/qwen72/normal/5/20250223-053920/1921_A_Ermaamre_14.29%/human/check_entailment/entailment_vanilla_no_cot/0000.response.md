Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw in how it determines the side length of the square. It assumes that the input coordinates are in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. The problem states that the coordinates of the corners are given in random order, so the program needs to handle any possible permutation of the coordinates.

To correctly determine the side length of the square, the program should identify the unique x and y coordinates and then calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x or y coordinates. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        # Collect all coordinates
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(point[0] for point in points))
        y_coords = sorted(set(point[1] for point in points))
        
        # The side length of the square is the difference between the two unique x or y coordinates
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])
        
        # Print the area of the square
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

This version of the program correctly handles the input coordinates in any order and computes the area of the square as required.
