Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each containing four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each valid test case, it prints the area of the square. The function assumes the input coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and within the specified range. If the input does not form a valid square, the function may produce incorrect results, but it does not explicitly handle or report invalid input. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the coordinates of the last test case and the side length of the last square. **
