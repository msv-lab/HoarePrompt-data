Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The input `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000.
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation:**
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and calculates the prefix balance at each position.
   - For each character at position `i`, if it is '(', the balance is incremented by 1; if it is ')', the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The balance is stored in the dictionary `d` with the key being the position `i + 1`.

3. **Dictionary Preparation:**
   - The function removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` (since the balance of the entire string is 0 and we don't need it for sorting).
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the prefix balance values, and in case of ties, by the positions in decreasing order.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The function iterates through the sorted dictionary `d` and constructs the string `ans` by appending the characters from `s` at the positions specified in the sorted dictionary.
   - The final string `ans` is returned.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The output string `ans` should be a balanced parentheses sequence that is the result of the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The balanced shuffle operation is defined as sorting the positions of characters by their prefix balance and breaking ties by position in decreasing order.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `(()(()))`, the prefix balances are:
     ```
     Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1
     ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
     Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8
     Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )
     ```
   - Sorting the positions by prefix balance and breaking ties by position in decreasing order gives:
     ```
     Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
     ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
     Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
     Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
     ```
   - The resulting string `ans` is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
