The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged based on their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence. Specifically, `ans` is constructed by concatenating the characters from `s` in the order of their indices, sorted by the depth of the parentheses at those indices. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a string with the same characters as `s` but ordered by their depth, and `s` remains unchanged.
