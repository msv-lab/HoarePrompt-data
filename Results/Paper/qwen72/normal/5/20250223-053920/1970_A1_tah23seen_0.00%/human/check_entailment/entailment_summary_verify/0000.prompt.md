You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged based on their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence. Specifically, `ans` is constructed by concatenating the characters from `s` in the order of their indices, sorted by the depth of the parentheses at those indices. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a string with the same characters as `s` but ordered by their depth, and `s` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the issue lies in how the prefix balances are computed and how the sorting is performed.

1. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - The dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balances, but the initialization `d[0] = 0` is incorrect. The prefix balance at position 0 should be 0, but the dictionary should be initialized with `d[0] = 0` and then updated accordingly for each character in the string.
   - The loop that calculates the prefix balances should start from position 1, not 0, and the balance should be updated based on the previous balance.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The sorting step is incorrect. The problem requires sorting the columns in increasing order of prefix balance, and breaking ties in decreasing order of position. The current sorting logic does not handle this correctly. It sorts the items based on the prefix balance but does not break ties in decreasing order of position.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balances = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balances[i + 1] = prefix_balances[i] + (1 if s[i] == '(' else -1)
    
    # Create a list of tuples (prefix balance, position, character)
    balance_positions = [(prefix_balances[i], -i, s[i-1]) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    
    # Sort the list in increasing order of prefix balance, and breaking ties in decreasing order of position
    balance_positions.sort()
    
    # Construct the result string
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in balance_positions)
    return result

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

In the provided program, the sorting step does not break ties in decreasing order of position, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balanced shuffle should be `()(()())`, but the provided program may produce a different result due to the incorrect sorting logic.
