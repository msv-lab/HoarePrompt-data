The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` which contains the characters from `s` at the indices specified in the first element of each tuple in `d`, in the order of the tuples in `d`.
