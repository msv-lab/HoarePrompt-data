Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases. The logic in the program is flawed because it only considers the first and last black cells in the string, which does not necessarily give the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn the entire strip white.

### Explanation:
- The program finds the index of the first black cell (`ind1`) and the index of the last black cell from the end (`ind2`).
- It then calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

However, this approach fails in cases where there are white cells between the first and last black cells. The correct approach should be to find the minimum segment that includes all black cells.

### Correct Approach:
- Find the index of the first black cell (`first_black`).
- Find the index of the last black cell (`last_black`).
- The minimum length of the segment to be painted is `last_black - first_black + 1`.

### Example:
For the input "WBBWBW":
- The first black cell is at index 1 (`first_black = 1`).
- The last black cell is at index 4 (`last_black = 4`).
- The minimum segment length is `4 - 1 + 1 = 4`.

This is the correct answer, but the provided program would incorrectly calculate it as `6 - 4 - 1 = 1`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    first_black = -1
    last_black = -1
    for i, j in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            if first_black == -1:
                first_black = i
            last_black = i
    print(last_black - first_black + 1)

# Example usage for multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    func()
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white for each test case.
