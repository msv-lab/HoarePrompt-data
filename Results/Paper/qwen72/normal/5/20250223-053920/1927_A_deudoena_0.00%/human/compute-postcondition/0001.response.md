Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character, `inpstr` is the input string provided by the user, `ind1` is 0.** 

The variable `ind1` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, and `inpstr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
