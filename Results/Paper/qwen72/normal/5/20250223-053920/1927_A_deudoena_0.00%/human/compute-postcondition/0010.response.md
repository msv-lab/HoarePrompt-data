Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character.
   - `inpstr` is the input string provided by the user, which is the same as `s`.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (counting from the end of the string).
   - `outind` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `len(inpstr)` is the length of the input string `inpstr`, which is the same as `n`.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` when counting from the end of the string. This is equivalent to the index of the last 'B' in the string when counting from the beginning.

4. **Calculation:**
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last 'B' characters.
   - Since `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' and `ind2` is the index of the last 'B', the sum `ind1 + ind2` represents the total distance from the start and end of the string to these 'B' characters.
   - Subtracting this sum from the length of the string gives the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters, excluding the 'B' characters themselves.

5. **Output:**
   - The value printed will be the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters in `inpstr`, excluding the 'B' characters.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where len(inpstr) is the length of the input string `inpstr`, ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, and ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`)**

To make it more concrete:
- If `inpstr` is "WBWBW", then `ind1` is 1 (first 'B' at index 1) and `ind2` is 3 (last 'B' at index 3).
- The length of `inpstr` is 5.
- The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` evaluates to \(5 - 3 - 1 = 1\).

So, the output will be:
Output: **1** (where 1 is the number of characters between the first and last 'B' characters in `inpstr`, excluding the 'B' characters)
