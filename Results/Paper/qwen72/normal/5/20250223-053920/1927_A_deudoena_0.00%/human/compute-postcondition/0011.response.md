The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'W' or 'B', with at least one 'B' character.
