Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement. The problem specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with a length `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. However, the program only reads a single string and does not account for the number of test cases `t` or the length `n` of the strip. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the strip is already entirely white, which should return 0 as the minimum length to be painted. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
6
WBBWBW
1
B
2
WW
```

Expected Output:
```
4
1
0
```

Actual Output:
```
4
1
2
```

The program incorrectly outputs 2 for the third test case, where the strip is already entirely white, and no painting is needed. The correct output should be 0.
