Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well. The key to solving this problem is understanding that the points are scored when a player places a card that matches a card already on the table. Since Nene plays optimally, she will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours. Therefore, the only way you can score points is if you have a pair of cards (i.e., two cards with the same number) and you play the first card, and Nene does not have the matching card to play.

The function `func_1` counts the number of integers in your hand that appear exactly twice. This count represents the maximum number of points you can score because for each such integer, you can place the first card and score a point when you place the second card, assuming Nene does not have the matching card.

However, the function does not consider the optimal play of Nene. Specifically, if you have a pair of cards (i.e., an integer that appears twice in your hand), Nene will play her matching card immediately after you play the first card to prevent you from scoring a point on the second card. Therefore, the function should only count the number of integers that appear exactly once in your hand, as these are the only cards that can potentially score points for you.

Given this, the function is incorrect because it does not account for Nene's optimal play strategy, which would prevent you from scoring points on the second card of any pair you have.

Correctness: **False**
