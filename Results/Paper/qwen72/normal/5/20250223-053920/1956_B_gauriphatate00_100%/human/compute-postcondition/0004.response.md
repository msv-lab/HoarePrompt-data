The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `num` should start at 1 and increment up to `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in `a`, so the values in `count_a` will be either 1 or 2.
- `max_score` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `n` is at least 1 and `num` starts at 1.

State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`, `max_score` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1**
