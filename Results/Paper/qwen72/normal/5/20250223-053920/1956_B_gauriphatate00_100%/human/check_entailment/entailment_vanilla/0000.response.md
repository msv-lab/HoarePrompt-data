### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, each with an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - The game proceeds in 2n turns, with each player taking n turns, starting with you.
   - On each turn, a player selects a card from their hand and places it on the table. If the same card is already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize your score, you should play cards that you know Nene will not have a duplicate of, or that you can force her to play her duplicate before you.
   - Nene will always play her cards to maximize her score and minimize yours. If she has a duplicate of a card you play, she will play it on her next turn to score a point.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of cards `a` in your hand.
   - It then calls `func_1` to compute the maximum score you can achieve.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each card in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
   - It then iterates through each integer from 1 to n and checks if you have both duplicates of that card. If you do, you can score a point for that card.
   - The function returns the total score.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly counts the duplicates in your hand.
   - It correctly calculates the maximum score you can achieve by counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
   - However, the program does not consider the optimal play of Nene. Nene will always play her cards to maximize her score and minimize yours. If you have both duplicates of a card, Nene will play her duplicate on her next turn, which means you can only score a point if you play the first duplicate and Nene does not have the second duplicate.

5. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - If you have both duplicates of a card, Nene will play her duplicate on her next turn, so you can only score a point if you play the first duplicate and Nene does not have the second duplicate.
   - If you have only one duplicate of a card, Nene will not score a point if you play it first, but you also cannot score a point for that card.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not fully account for Nene's optimal play, which means it may overestimate your score in some cases.
   - For example, in the first test case, the program correctly returns 1 because you can only score a point for the card with the number 1. However, in more complex scenarios, the program might not accurately reflect the outcome of the game.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly account for Nene's optimal play, which can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.
