Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns the count of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`. After the function concludes, the final state of the program is that the variable `max_score` holds the number of integers from 1 to n that appear exactly twice in the list `a`. **
