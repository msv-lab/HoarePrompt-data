Reasoning:

1. **Password Composition**: The program implicitly handles the condition that the password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods. Any character that is not a digit or a lowercase Latin letter would not be processed, but the problem guarantees valid inputs, so this is not a concern.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program checks this condition by iterating through the password and ensuring that no letter is immediately followed by a digit. This is done correctly with the loop:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(password) - 1):
       if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
           return 'NO'
   ```
   This loop ensures that if any letter is followed by a digit, the function returns 'NO'.

3. **Digits Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks this condition by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version:
   ```python
   if digits != sorted(digits):
       return 'NO'
   ```
   This ensures that all digits in the password are in non-decreasing order.

4. **Letters Sorted in Non-decreasing Order**: The program checks this condition by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version:
   ```python
   if letters != sorted(letters):
       return 'NO'
   ```
   This ensures that all letters in the password are in non-decreasing order.

The program also handles all edge cases correctly:
- If the password contains only letters, it will check that they are sorted.
- If the password contains only digits, it will check that they are sorted.
- If the password contains both letters and digits, it will check that letters are sorted, digits are sorted, and no digit comes after a letter.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and the problem description, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.

Final: **True**
