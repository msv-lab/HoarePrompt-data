### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Character Classification:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Order of Letters and Digits:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If all the conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** The program assumes that the input password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.
- **Condition 2:** The program ensures that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Condition 3:** The program ensures that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Condition 4:** The program ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Password:** The problem description guarantees that the password length `n` is at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **Password with Only Letters or Only Digits:** The program correctly handles these cases by not failing the sorting checks and the order check.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the required conditions for a strong password as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
