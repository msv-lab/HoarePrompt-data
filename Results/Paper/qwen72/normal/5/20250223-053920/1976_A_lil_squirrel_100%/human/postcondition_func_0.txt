The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if the letters in `password` are not in sorted order, if the digits in `password` are not in sorted order, or if any lowercase letter is immediately followed by a digit. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.
