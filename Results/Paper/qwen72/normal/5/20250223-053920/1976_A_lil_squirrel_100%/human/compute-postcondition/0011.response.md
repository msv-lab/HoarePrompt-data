The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the length of `password`. For the loop to execute, the range of `i` must be from 0 to `len(password) - 2` (inclusive), because the loop iterates from 0 to `len(password) - 2`. This means `len(password) - 1` must be at least 1, so `len(password)` must be at least 2.

Given the initial state, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `password` is a string of length `n`. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 2. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted, `i` is 0**
