Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program has a few logical issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Template Construction:**
   - The template is constructed by appending the lowercase letter from `a` if `a[i] == b[i]`, and the uppercase version of `a[i]` otherwise. This approach does not always ensure that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. For example, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template should be an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, not just the uppercase version of `a[i]`.

2. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template by verifying that if the template letter is lowercase, it must match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the template letter is uppercase. It should ensure that the corresponding letters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template letter.
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the template by verifying that if the template letter is lowercase, `c[i]` must be different from the template letter. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the template letter is uppercase. It should ensure that `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template letter.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different but `c[i]` is the same as one of them. For example, in the test case where `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, and `c = "abc"`, the program will incorrectly construct the template as `"Acc"` and will not correctly determine that `c` matches the template.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to correctly construct the template and verify the matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Initialize the template with None
        template = [None] * n
        
        # Construct the template
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template[i] = a[i]  # Both a and b have the same letter at this position
            else:
                # Find a letter that is different from both a[i] and b[i]
                for letter in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    if letter != a[i] and letter != b[i]:
                        template[i] = letter.upper()
                        break
        
        # Check if a and b match the template
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == template[i].lower() or b[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        # Check if c does not match the template
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == template[i].lower():
                match_c = True
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template is constructed correctly and that the matching conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c` are verified accurately.
