Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The function constructs a template where for each position `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` is set to `a[i].upper()` (or `b[i].upper()`).

2. **Matching `a` and `b` to the Template**:
   - The function then checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For lowercase positions in the template, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to the template.
     - For uppercase positions in the template, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of the template.

3. **Matching `c` to the Template**:
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - For lowercase positions in the template, `c[i]` must be different from the template.
     - For uppercase positions in the template, `c[i]` must be equal to the lowercase version of the template.

4. **Output**:
   - If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, the function prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, there is a logical error in the template construction and matching logic:

- **Template Construction**:
  - When `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template is set to `a[i].upper()`. This is incorrect because the template should be set to an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The current implementation only ensures that the template is different from `a[i]` but not necessarily from `b[i]`.

- **Matching `a` and `b` to the Template**:
  - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template is correct. However, the template construction error can lead to incorrect results.

- **Matching `c` to the Template**:
  - The logic for checking if `c` does not match the template is correct.

To fix the template construction, we need to ensure that when `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template is set to an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

Correctness: **False**

The function as written does not correctly handle the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different. It sets the template to `a[i].upper()`, which may not be different from `b[i]`. This can lead to incorrect results where `b` does not match the template, even though it should.
