Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from the user to process `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if the strings `a` and `b` can be transformed into a common template string, where characters that differ between `a` and `b` are marked as uppercase in the template. It then checks if the string `c` matches this template, with the condition that any lowercase character in the template must match the corresponding character in `c`, and any uppercase character in the template must not match the corresponding character in `c`. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
