Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is equal to the length of `arr`; `j` is equal to `n - 1`.**

The code assigns the value `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `j`. Since `n` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is now equal to `n - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
