To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(arr)` is `n`, and `n` is the length of `arr`.
   - Therefore, `i < len(arr) - 1` translates to `0 < n - 1`.
   - For this condition to be true, `n` must be greater than 1.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - `i` is 0, so this condition becomes `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
   - This condition depends on the values of the first two elements of `arr`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1.
- Additionally, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

### Adjusted State:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is equal to the length of `arr`, and `n` must be greater than 1.
- `j` is equal to `n - 1`.
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is equal to the length of `arr` and must be greater than 1; `j` is equal to `n - 1`; `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
