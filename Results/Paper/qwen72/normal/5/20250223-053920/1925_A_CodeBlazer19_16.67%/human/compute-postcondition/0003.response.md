The function `func` does not explicitly accept parameters, but it is expected to handle input through a predefined mechanism (such as reading from standard input). The input consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).

The function processes each test case and produces output through another predefined mechanism (such as writing to standard output). The output is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function will produce some result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines each containing two integers `n` and `k`. It processes each test case and produces output based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
