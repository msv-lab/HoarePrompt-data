You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. For the problem described, the function should take parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the permutation (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `k` is the number of turns in the game (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha respectively (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n), `p` is a permutation of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and `a` is an array of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: The loop will have completed its execution for all test cases, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` will have been updated and used to determine the winner of each game. The final output will be a series of 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, based on the conditions provided in the loop. The values of `MOD` and `alpha` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the result of the game for each test case, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the permutation, `k` is the number of turns, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `p` is a permutation, and `a` is an array of integers.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
