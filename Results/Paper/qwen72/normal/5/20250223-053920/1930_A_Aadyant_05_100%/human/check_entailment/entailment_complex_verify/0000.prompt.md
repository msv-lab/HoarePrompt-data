You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an input integer, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, final is a list of n integers where each integer is the sum of the smaller elements in each pair of sorted input integers.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: The list `final` remains unchanged, and all elements in `final` are printed one by one. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` from the user, and for each of the `n` test cases, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the smaller integers in each pair of the sorted list. It then appends these sums to a list `final`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `final` one by one. The function does not return any value. The variables `t` and `a` mentioned in the comments are not used in the function, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that `final` contains the sums of the smaller integers for each test case, and these sums have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the binary search implementation. Specifically, in the `while` loop condition, it should be `while left <= right:` instead of `while left < right:`. This is because when `left` equals `right`, the middle element is still a valid candidate to be checked. The current implementation will miss this case, potentially leading to incorrect results.

However, the program in question is for a different problem, so let's focus on the actual task.

The program provided for the task of finding the maximum final score in the game with 2n integers has the following issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case. However, it does not handle the input for the number of integers `n` in each test case correctly. It reads `a` which is supposed to be `n`, but it should read `n` directly and then read the list of integers.

2. **Sorting and Summing**: The program sorts the list of integers and then sums every second element starting from the first. This approach is correct because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always choose the smallest available number as the minimum value in each pair. However, the program does not handle the case where the number of integers is odd, which should never happen according to the problem description (it is always 2n).

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where the input might be invalid, such as non-integer inputs or inputs that do not conform to the problem constraints. However, since the problem description guarantees valid input, this is not a critical issue.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the input for the number of integers in each test case. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Number of pairs
        list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))  # List of 2n integers
        list1.sort()
        s = sum(list1[i] for i in range(0, 2*n, 2))  # Sum every second element starting from the first
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
```

This corrected version correctly reads the number of pairs `n` and then processes the list of 2n integers. It ensures that the sum is calculated correctly by summing every second element starting from the first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
