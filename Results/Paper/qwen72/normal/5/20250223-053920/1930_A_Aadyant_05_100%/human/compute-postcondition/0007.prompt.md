You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an input integer, a is a list of 2n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, final is a list of n integers where each integer is the sum of the smaller elements in each pair of sorted input integers.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: The list `final` remains unchanged, and all elements in `final` are printed one by one. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers, each between 1 and 10^7. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact output is not specified.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
