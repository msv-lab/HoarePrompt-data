Reasoning:  
The program provided is designed to solve the problem of constructing an array `a` based on the given array `x` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`. The program initializes `a[0]` to 500 and then constructs the rest of the array `a` by setting `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. This approach works because:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**: The program sets `a[0]` to 500, which is a valid value within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Construction of `a[i]`**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, the program sets `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. This ensures that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i` because:
   - `a[i]` is constructed as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
   - When `a[i]` is divided by `a[i-1]`, the quotient is 1 and the remainder is `x[i-1]`, which is exactly `x_i`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the array `a` for each test case, which meets the problem's requirements.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem statement. It ensures that all elements of `a` are within the range `[1, 10^9]` and that the modulo condition is satisfied for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
