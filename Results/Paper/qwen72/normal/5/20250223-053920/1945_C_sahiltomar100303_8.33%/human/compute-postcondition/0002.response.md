Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the optimal position `left` or `right` where the string can be split such that the number of zeros on the left side and the number of ones on the right side are as close as possible to the required counts. The variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will be reset for each test case, and their final values will be undefined after the loop completes.**
