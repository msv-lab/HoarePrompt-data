Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with multiple test cases, where each test case involves a string `a` of length `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) consisting only of 0s and 1s, and the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) is provided. The function should determine the optimal position `i` to lay a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the road are satisfied with their side, and the road is as close to the middle of the village as possible. The function should be called with the appropriate input parameters to handle each test case.**
