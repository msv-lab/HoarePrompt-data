### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for a winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by the corresponding multiplier \( k_i \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It then computes a value \( m \) using the function `func_2`.
   - The function `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - The program then calculates the bets \( c_i \) for each outcome as \( m \) divided by \( k_i \).
   - If the sum of the bets \( c_i \) is greater than or equal to \( m \), it prints \(-1\) indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets \( c_i \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` returns the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \).
   - This is correct because the LCM of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) is given by \( \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \).

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2(numbers)` computes the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It starts with the first number in the list and iteratively computes the LCM with each subsequent number using `func_1`.
   - This is correct because the LCM of a list of numbers can be computed by iteratively taking the LCM of pairs of numbers.

5. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The program calculates \( c_i \) as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - The sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) should be less than \( m \) for the distribution to be valid.
   - If \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \geq m \), it prints \(-1\), which is the correct behavior if no valid distribution exists.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The bets are calculated as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \), which ensures that the amount received back for any winning outcome is \( k_i \cdot c_i = m \).
   - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < m \) is checked to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly computes the LCM and the bets, and it checks the condition to ensure a valid distribution of coins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
