The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `index` is not part of the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. The state of `data` and the assignment of `t` from `data` are also not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is not relevant to the state before the loop starts**
