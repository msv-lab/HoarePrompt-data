Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. `t` remains the same as the number of test cases initially provided. `index` is now `2 * t + 1` because it was incremented by 2 for each test case. The variables `n` and `s` hold the values of the last test case processed, and `count_u` holds the count of 'U' characters in the last `s`. The function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' characters in `s` was odd or even, respectively.**
