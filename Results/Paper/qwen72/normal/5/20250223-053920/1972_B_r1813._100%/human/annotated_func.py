#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" characters, representing the number of coins and their initial states, respectively.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. `t` remains the same as the number of test cases initially provided. `index` is now `2 * t + 1` because it was incremented by 2 for each test case. The variables `n` and `s` hold the values of the last test case processed, and `count_u` holds the count of 'U' characters in the last `s`. The function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the count of 'U' characters in `s` was odd or even, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes a series of test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing "U" and "D" characters. The function prints 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters in `s` is odd, and 'NO' if the count is even. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, the input has been fully processed, and the results for all test cases have been printed. The final state of the program includes the variables `t`, `index`, `n`, `s`, and `count_u` holding the values from the last test case processed.
