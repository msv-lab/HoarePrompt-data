Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the winner of the game based on the problem description. The key logic in the program is to count the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` and check if this count is odd or even. If the count of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win. This is because:

1. **Odd Number of 'U' Coins**: If there is an odd number of 'U' coins, the player who starts (Alice) can always make the last move, ensuring that the opponent (Bob) will eventually be left with no 'U' coins to choose from.
2. **Even Number of 'U' Coins**: If there is an even number of 'U' coins, the player who starts (Alice) will eventually be left with no 'U' coins to choose from, and the opponent (Bob) will win.

The program reads the input correctly, processes each test case, and prints the appropriate result based on the count of 'U' coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
