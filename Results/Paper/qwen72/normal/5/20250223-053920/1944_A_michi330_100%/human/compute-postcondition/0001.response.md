To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, and `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to run at least once. The variables `n` and `k`, and the function `func`, are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
