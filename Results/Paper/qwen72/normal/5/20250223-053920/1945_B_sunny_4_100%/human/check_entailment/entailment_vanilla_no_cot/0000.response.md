Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` and adds 2, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the overlap and the visibility duration of the fireworks.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time
        count_a = (m + a) // a
        count_b = (m + b) // b
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks
        max_simultaneous = max(count_a, count_b)
        
        # Check for the possibility of both installations launching fireworks at the same time
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        if lcm <= m + 1:
            max_simultaneous += 1
        
        print(max_simultaneous)

from math import gcd

func()
```

Explanation:
1. **Counting Fireworks**: The number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility time `m` is calculated using `(m + a) // a` and `(m + b) // b`. This accounts for the fact that the first firework is launched at time 0 and the last firework is launched at the latest possible time within `m` minutes.
2. **Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**: The maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is initially set to the maximum of the two counts.
3. **Checking for Overlap**: If the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is less than or equal to `m + 1`, it means that both installations can launch fireworks at the same time, and thus the maximum simultaneous count is incremented by 1.

This corrected program should provide the correct output for the given problem.
