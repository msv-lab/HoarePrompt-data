Reasoning:
The program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap in the visibility of fireworks launched from both installations. The current logic calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m` and then adds 2, which is incorrect. The +2 seems to be a hardcoded attempt to account for the overlap, but it does not correctly handle all cases, especially when the launch intervals `a` and `b` are not relatively prime (i.e., they share a common divisor).

To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the following:
1. The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m` is `m // a + 1`.
2. The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m` is `m // b + 1`.
3. The overlap in the visibility of fireworks from both installations should be calculated and subtracted from the sum of the above two values. The overlap occurs when both installations launch a firework at the same time, which happens every `lcm(a, b)` minutes, where `lcm` is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.

The correct formula to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is:
\[ \text{max\_visible} = \left(\frac{m}{a} + 1\right) + \left(\frac{m}{b} + 1\right) - \left(\frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} + 1\right) \]

However, the program does not implement this logic and instead adds 2, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
