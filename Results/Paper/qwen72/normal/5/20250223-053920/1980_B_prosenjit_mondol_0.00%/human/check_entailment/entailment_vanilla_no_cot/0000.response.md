Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is equal to the value of the cube at the `k`-th position after sorting. Specifically, the condition `print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')` is flawed. This condition incorrectly checks if the favorite cube will be removed when its value is equal to the value of the cube at the `k`-th position.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # Check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes after sorting
            if a[:k+1].count(x) > 0:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')
```

In the corrected version, the program checks if the favorite cube's value `x` is among the first `k+1` cubes after sorting. If it is, the favorite cube will definitely be removed, so it prints "YES". If it is not, it prints "MAYBE" because the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact positions of the cubes with the same value.
