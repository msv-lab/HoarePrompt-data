### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly initializes `T` with the first integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculation of the Year:**
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1\right) // \text{a[i]} * \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to `next_year` for each sign.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the final `last_year` for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly by setting `last_year` to `a[0]` and appending it to `results`.
   - The program also handles the case where all periodicities are 1 correctly, as the next year will always be the next integer.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of signs `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given problem description and input constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
