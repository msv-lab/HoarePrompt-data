Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The key logic of the program is to calculate the next occurrence year for each sign, starting from the year the previous sign occurred. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and processes it using an index.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Year Calculation**:
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.
   - It updates `last_year` to this new value.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one and calculates the smallest year for the n-th sign to occur.

Given the execution summary, the program processes the input and output as expected, and the logic for calculating the next occurrence year is correct.

Correctness: **True**
