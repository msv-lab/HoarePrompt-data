You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing periodicities. For each test case, the function calculates the smallest year that is a multiple of all the periodicities and appends it to a list of results. After processing all test cases, it writes the results to standard output, each on a new line. The function does not return any value; instead, it directly outputs the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the rules specified in the problem description. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Initial Year Calculation**: For each test case, the program starts with the year of the first sign, which is `a[0]`.

3. **Sequential Year Calculation**: For each subsequent sign, the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it happens strictly after the previous sign. This is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{next\_year} = \left(\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1\right) // \text{a[i]} \times \text{a[i]}
   \]
   This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

4. **Output**: The program appends the final year for each test case to a results list and writes the results to `sys.stdout` in the required format.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly:
- **Single Sign**: If `n = 1`, the program correctly returns `a[0]` as the year.
- **Multiple Signs**: The program correctly calculates the year for each sign, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- **Large Periodicities**: The program can handle large periodicities up to \(10^6\) and a large number of test cases up to 1000.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct for all potential cases.
