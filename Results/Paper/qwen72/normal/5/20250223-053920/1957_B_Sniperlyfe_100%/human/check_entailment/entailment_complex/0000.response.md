Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is the largest number with the same number of bits as `k` but all bits set to 1. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` to update the remaining sum to be distributed among the other elements.
   - The function iterates from the second element to the last element of `nums`:
     - If `k` is greater than 0, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k`.
     - It then subtracts the assigned value from `k`.
   - After the loop, if there is any remaining value in `k`, it adds it to the first element `nums[0]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them, each on a new line.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` is equal to `k`.
   - The function also ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements in `nums` is maximized.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly sets `nums[0]` to `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the function distributes the sum `k` among the elements while ensuring the maximum number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The function runs in \(O(n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
