You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration, and `k` is 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and each subsequent element is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration, with `k` being 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This is done using the expression `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which creates a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit set in `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` to account for the sum used by `nums[0]`.
   - The program iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns each element the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`. This ensures that each subsequent element is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
   - Finally, any remaining sum is added back to `nums[0]`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The program ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly `k` by initially setting `nums[0]` to a large value and then distributing the remaining sum among the other elements.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR:**
     - By setting `nums[0]` to a number with all bits set to 1, the program ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s possible for the given `k`.
     - The subsequent elements are set to the smallest possible values that still contribute to the sum, which helps in maintaining the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (n = 1):** The program correctly handles this case by setting `nums[0]` to `k` and returning it.
   - **Multiple Elements (n > 1):** The program distributes the sum `k` among the elements in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program runs in linear time with respect to `n` for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
