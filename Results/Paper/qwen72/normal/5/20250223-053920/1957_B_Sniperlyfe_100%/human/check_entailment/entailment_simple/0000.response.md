Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k` and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For each subsequent element in the list, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) (which is the next largest number with a single bit set) and the remaining value of `k`.
   - It continues this process until `k` is exhausted.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining `k` to the first element `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

### Correctness Check:

- **Sum Condition**:
  - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by initially setting `nums[0]` to a large value and then distributing the remaining `k` among the subsequent elements.
  - Any remaining `k` after the loop is added back to `nums[0]`, ensuring the sum condition is met.

- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**:
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
  - This maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - Subsequent elements are set to the smallest possible values (either 1 or the remaining `k`), which ensures that the bitwise OR operation does not introduce unnecessary 0s.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element (n = 1)**:
  - If `n = 1`, the program correctly sets `nums[0]` to `k`, which is the only possible sequence.
- **Multiple Elements (n > 1)**:
  - The program distributes `k` in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - If `k` is small, the program will set subsequent elements to 0 or 1, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
