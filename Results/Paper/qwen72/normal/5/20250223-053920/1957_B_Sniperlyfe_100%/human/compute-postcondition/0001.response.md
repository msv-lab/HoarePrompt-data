Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^9; `nums` is a list of length `n` with `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements still initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the first element of the list `nums` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). The value of `k.bit_length()` is the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary, excluding leading zeros. Therefore, `nums[0]` is set to one less than the highest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `k`. All other elements in `nums` remain 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
