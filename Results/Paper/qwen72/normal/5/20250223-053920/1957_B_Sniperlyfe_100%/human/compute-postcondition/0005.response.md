Output State: **`nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1 + 0\) and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration, and `k` is 0.**

In natural language: The value of `nums[0]` remains \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) because `k` is 0 and adding 0 to it does not change its value. The rest of the list `nums` and the value of `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
