The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^9`. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and each subsequent element is the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1}\) and the remaining value of `k` at the start of each iteration. After the function concludes, the value of `k` is 0, and the list `nums` contains the computed values.
