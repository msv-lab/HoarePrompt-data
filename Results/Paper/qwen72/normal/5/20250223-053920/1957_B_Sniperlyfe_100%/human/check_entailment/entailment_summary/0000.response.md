Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Let's break down the logic of the program and verify if it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. For example, if `k` is 10, `k.bit_length()` is 4, and \(2^3 - 1\) is 7 (binary `111`).
   - `k` is then decremented by the value of `nums[0]`.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `k` is greater than 0, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`. This ensures that the values added to the sequence are as large as possible without exceeding `k`.
     - `k` is decremented by the value of `nums[i]`.
   - After the loop, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of all test cases and prints them.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **Sum Condition**: The sum of the elements in `nums` should be equal to `k`.
  - The initial value of `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and `k` is decremented by this value.
  - Each subsequent value in `nums` is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`, and `k` is further decremented.
  - Any remaining `k` is added back to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum is exactly `k`.

- **Maximize 1s in Binary Representation**:
  - The first element `nums[0]` is set to a number with all bits set to 1, which maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.
  - Subsequent elements are set to the smallest possible values that do not exceed the remaining `k`, ensuring that the bitwise OR operation retains as many 1s as possible.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0]` is set to 5 (binary `101`), and the sum is 5.
  - The number of 1s in the binary representation of 5 is 2.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - `nums[0]` is set to 1 (binary `1`), and `k` is decremented to 2.
  - `nums[1]` is set to 2 (binary `10`), and `k` is decremented to 0.
  - The sum is 1 + 2 = 3.
  - The bitwise OR of 1 and 2 is 3 (binary `11`), which has 2 1s.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 2`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0]` is set to 3 (binary `11`), and `k` is decremented to 2.
  - `nums[1]` is set to 2 (binary `10`), and `k` is decremented to 0.
  - The sum is 3 + 2 = 5.
  - The bitwise OR of 3 and 2 is 3 (binary `11`), which has 2 1s.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 6`, `k = 51`
  - `nums[0]` is set to 31 (binary `11111`), and `k` is decremented to 20.
  - Subsequent elements are set to 1, 1, 32, 2, 12, and `k` is decremented accordingly.
  - The sum is 31 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51.
  - The bitwise OR of 31, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 is 63 (binary `111111`), which has 6 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence for each test case, ensuring that the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
