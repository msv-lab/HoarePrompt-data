The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and `k` lines of `n` integers each. Here, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of chat participants, and `k` is the number of participants who posted screenshots. The integers `a_{ij}` represent the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`, who is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of the list. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`, along with the order of participants shown to each screenshot author. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided inputs.**
