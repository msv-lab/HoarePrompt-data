### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Naming and Usage:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used to represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively.
   - However, the variable names are not consistent with the problem description. The problem states that the input is `n`, `a`, and `b`, but the program uses `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a naming issue but does not affect the logic if the values are correctly assigned.

3. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt if bought under the promotion.
   - This calculation is correct, but it should be noted that `c` is the promotion price for two yogurts, so `d` is the price per yogurt under the promotion.

4. **Cost Comparison:**
   - The program compares `a * b` (the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price).
   - This comparison is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of the comparison using `print(a * b)` if the regular price is cheaper, and `print(round(a * d))` if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - The use of `round` is unnecessary because the promotion price is always an integer (since it is the price for two yogurts).

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read correctly.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `regular_cost` is calculated as `n * a`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `promotion_cost` is calculated as `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`:
     - `(n // 2) * b` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
     - `(n % 2) * a` is the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.

3. **Output:**
   - The minimum of `regular_cost` and `promotion_cost` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
