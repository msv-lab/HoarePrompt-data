Output State: **The loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers (a, b, c) from the input. It then calculates d as c / 2. If a * b is less than a * d, it prints a * b; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of a * d. The values of t and n remain unchanged, and the values of a, b, and c are read from input for each iteration.**
