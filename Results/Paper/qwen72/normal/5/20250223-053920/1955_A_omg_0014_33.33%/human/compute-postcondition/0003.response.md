The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function should return a result for each test case. If `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within the specified ranges, the function should return a result for each combination of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. It returns a result for each test case.**
