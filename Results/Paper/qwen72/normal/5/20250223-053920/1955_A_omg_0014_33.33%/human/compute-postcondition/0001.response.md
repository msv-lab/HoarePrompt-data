The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(n)` function and will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4 (this is not relevant to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
- For each test case, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 100.
- `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 30 (these are also not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted).

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
