You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: The loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers (a, b, c) from the input. It then calculates d as c / 2. If a * b is less than a * d, it prints a * b; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of a * d. The values of t and n remain unchanged, and the values of a, b, and c are read from input for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then calculates `d` as `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of `a * d`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Naming and Usage:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used to represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the promotion price for two yogurts, respectively.
   - However, the variable names are not consistent with the problem description. The problem states that the input is `n`, `a`, and `b`, but the program uses `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a naming issue but does not affect the logic if the values are correctly assigned.

3. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt if bought under the promotion.
   - This calculation is correct, but it should be noted that `c` is the promotion price for two yogurts, so `d` is the price per yogurt under the promotion.

4. **Cost Comparison:**
   - The program compares `a * b` (the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price).
   - This comparison is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of the comparison using `print(a * b)` if the regular price is cheaper, and `print(round(a * d))` if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - The use of `round` is unnecessary because the promotion price is always an integer (since it is the price for two yogurts).

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read correctly.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `regular_cost` is calculated as `n * a`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `promotion_cost` is calculated as `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`:
     - `(n // 2) * b` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
     - `(n % 2) * a` is the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.

3. **Output:**
   - The minimum of `regular_cost` and `promotion_cost` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
