### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The original program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the variable names `a`, `b`, and `c` do not match the problem description, which uses `n`, `a`, and `b`. This is a naming issue but does not affect the logic if the values are correctly assigned.

2. **Variable Naming and Usage:**
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` in the original program should be `n`, `a`, and `b` to match the problem description. This is a significant issue because it can lead to confusion and potential errors in understanding the code.

3. **Promotion Price Calculation:**
   - The original program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt if bought under the promotion. This is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts), and `d` should be `b / 2` (the price per yogurt under the promotion).

4. **Cost Comparison:**
   - The original program compares `a * b` (which should be `n * a`, the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (which should be `n * (b / 2)`, the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price).
   - This comparison is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price.

5. **Output:**
   - The original program prints the result of the comparison using `print(a * b)` if the regular price is cheaper, and `print(round(a * d))` if the promotion price is cheaper.
   - The use of `round` is unnecessary because the promotion price is always an integer (since it is the price for two yogurts).

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price
        regular_cost = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price
        promotion_cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(regular_cost, promotion_cost))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read correctly.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `regular_cost` is calculated as `n * a`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `promotion_cost` is calculated as `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`:
     - `(n // 2) * b` is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
     - `(n % 2) * a` is the cost of buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.

3. **Output:**
   - The minimum of `regular_cost` and `promotion_cost` is printed for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the corrected program, the original program is incorrect. The original program does not correctly handle the promotion price and the comparison logic.

Final: **False**
