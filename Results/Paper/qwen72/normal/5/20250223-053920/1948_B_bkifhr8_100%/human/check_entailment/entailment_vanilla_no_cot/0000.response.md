Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the program attempts to split only the element that is causing a non-decreasing order issue, but it does not properly split the element into its digits and reinsert them in the correct position. Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility of multiple elements being split and the resulting array being checked for non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                # Split the element into its digits
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i - 1])]
                # Replace the element with its digits
                arr = arr[:i] + digits + arr[i:]
                # Check if the new array is sorted
                if arr != sorted(arr):
                    ans = False
                    break
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

# Example usage
can_be_sorted()
```

This version correctly splits the element into its digits and reinserts them into the array, then checks if the resulting array is sorted. If at any point the array cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
