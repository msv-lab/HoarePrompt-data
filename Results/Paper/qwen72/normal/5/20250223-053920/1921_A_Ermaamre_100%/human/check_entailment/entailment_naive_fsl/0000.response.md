Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are not in a specific order, which can lead to incorrect calculations of the square's area. For example, if the input is:

```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

The program will calculate the area as 1, which is incorrect. The correct area should be 1 (since the side length is 1). However, the program assumes that the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always give the side length of the square, which is not always true. The side length should be calculated based on the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points that form the sides of the square. The current implementation fails to ensure that the points form a square correctly, leading to potential incorrect area calculations.
