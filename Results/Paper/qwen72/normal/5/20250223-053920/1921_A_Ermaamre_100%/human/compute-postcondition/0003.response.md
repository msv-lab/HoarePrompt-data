The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples. Each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i, y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing 4 tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) for the corners of a square. It returns a list of results indicating whether each set of coordinates forms a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**
