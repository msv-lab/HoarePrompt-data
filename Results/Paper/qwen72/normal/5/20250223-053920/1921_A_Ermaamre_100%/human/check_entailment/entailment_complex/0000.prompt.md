Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 4 tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates x_i, y_i are within the range -1000 to 1000, and the square has a positive area with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        
        print(dx * dx)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the area of the largest square that can be formed using the given coordinates. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is also unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads the coordinates of a square, calculates the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, and then prints the area of the square (side length squared).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads 4 tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) from the input, where each tuple represents a corner of a square. The function then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and prints the area of the square (side length squared). The function does not return any value; it only prints the area for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the input coordinates are not stored or modified after processing.
