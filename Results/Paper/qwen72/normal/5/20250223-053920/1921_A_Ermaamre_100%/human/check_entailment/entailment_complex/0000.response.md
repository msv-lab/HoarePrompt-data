Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads 4 lines of input, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of a corner of the square.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: The function extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points and stores them in the list `x`.

3. **Side Length Calculation**: The function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square.

4. **Area Calculation and Output**: The function then prints the area of the square, which is `dx * dx`.

5. **Assumptions**: The problem guarantees that the input coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area. Therefore, the function does not need to check for these conditions explicitly.

6. **Test Case Processing**: The function processes each test case independently and prints the area for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
