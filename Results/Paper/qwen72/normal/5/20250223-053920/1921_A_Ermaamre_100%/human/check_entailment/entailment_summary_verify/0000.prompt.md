You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads 4 tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) from the input, where each tuple represents a corner of a square. The function then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and prints the area of the square (side length squared). The function does not return any value; it only prints the area for each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the input coordinates are not stored or modified after processing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are not in a specific order, which can lead to incorrect calculations of the square's area. For example, if the input is:

```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

The program will calculate the area as 1, which is incorrect. The correct area should be 1 (since the side length is 1). However, the program assumes that the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always give the side length of the square, which is not always true. The side length should be calculated based on the difference between the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points that form the sides of the square. The current implementation fails to ensure that the points form a square correctly, leading to potential incorrect area calculations.
