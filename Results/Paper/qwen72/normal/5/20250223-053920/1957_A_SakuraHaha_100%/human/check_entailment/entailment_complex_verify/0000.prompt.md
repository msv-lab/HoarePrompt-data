You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the number of sticks and their lengths respectively, such that 1 <= t <= 100, 1 <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that integer in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3, `cnt` remains unchanged.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.
    #   - However, we can describe `ans` based on the given information.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of groups of three identical sticks that can be formed. The result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `n` remain unchanged, while `ans` contains the calculated number of groups.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of regular polygons is flawed. The program simply divides the count of each stick length by 3, which assumes that every polygon must have at least 3 sides. However, this does not account for the fact that polygons can have more than 3 sides, and the optimal solution may involve forming polygons with different numbers of sides.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
```
The program will output `2` because it assumes that each stick length can form at most one triangle (3 sides). However, the correct output should be `1` because the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed is a single hexagon (6 sides) using all 6 sticks of length 1. 

Thus, the program does not correctly handle this case and is therefore incorrect.
