You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the user. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of groups of three identical sticks that can be formed. The result, `ans`, is printed to the console. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that `a` and `n` remain unchanged, while `ans` contains the calculated number of groups.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. This is a good practice to modularize the code.

3. **Reading Stick Lengths**: Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the number of sticks `n` and the stick lengths `a` as a list of integers. This is done correctly using `input()` and `map()`.

4. **Counting Stick Frequencies**: The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is correct and efficient for the given constraints.

5. **Calculating Maximum Polygons**: The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` and calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using each stick length. It does this by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (`x // 3`). This is incorrect because it assumes that each polygon must have 3 sides (triangles), but the problem does not specify the number of sides for the polygons. A regular polygon can have any number of sides greater than or equal to 3.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result `ans` for each test case, which is the sum of the maximum number of polygons that can be formed using each stick length. This is correct in terms of output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it only considers triangles (3-sided polygons) when calculating the maximum number of regular polygons. The problem statement allows for any regular polygon with at least 3 sides, so the program should consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each possible number of sides.

Correctness: **False**
