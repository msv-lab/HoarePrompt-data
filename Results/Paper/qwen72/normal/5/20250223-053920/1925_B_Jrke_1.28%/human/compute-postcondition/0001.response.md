Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x. The values of x and n are updated for each iteration based on user input, and the loop prints the maximum value of the divisors of x that are less than or equal to k (where k = x // n) for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each iteration, `x` and `n` are read from user input.
- `k` is calculated as `x // n`.
- The loop then finds the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- If `k` is 1, the loop prints 1 and continues to the next iteration.
- Otherwise, it iterates over odd numbers starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`, checking if they are divisors of `x`.
- If a divisor `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it updates the maximum value `ans`.
- Finally, it prints `ans` for each test case.

The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` remain within their initial constraints, but their specific values change with each iteration based on user input. The loop does not modify the initial state of these variables outside of the loop body.
