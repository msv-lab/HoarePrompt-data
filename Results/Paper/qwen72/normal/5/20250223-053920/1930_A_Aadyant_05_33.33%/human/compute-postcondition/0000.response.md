The code snippet `num = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. The initial state specifies that the function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists containing integers for each test case. However, the code snippet provided does not involve these parameters directly. The input is taken from the user, and the value of `num` will be whatever the user inputs.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `test_cases` is a list of lists where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each test case, `num` is an input string.**
