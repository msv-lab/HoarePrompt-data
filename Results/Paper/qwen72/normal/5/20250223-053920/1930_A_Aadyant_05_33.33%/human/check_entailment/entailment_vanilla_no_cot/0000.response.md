Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Sorting and Pairing**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and then selects the minimum of each pair by taking every second element from the sorted list. This approach ensures that the smallest elements are chosen first, which is optimal for maximizing the score.
3. **Summing the Minimums**: It sums the selected minimums and appends the result to the output list.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem's requirements, and it should correctly compute the maximum final score for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
