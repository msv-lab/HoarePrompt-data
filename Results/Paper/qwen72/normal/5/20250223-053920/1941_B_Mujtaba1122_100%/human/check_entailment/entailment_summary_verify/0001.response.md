### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using the specified operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` for any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose well.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to make all elements zero by performing the operations.
   - The original implementation has a significant issue in the way the operation is applied. The line:
     ```python
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     - This is incorrect because it subtracts `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - The loop condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` is also incorrect. It should be `while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` to ensure that the operation can be applied without making any element negative.
   - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0:` is performed after the loop, which is not necessary. The loop should ensure that the operation is applied correctly, and the final check should be done using `func_1`.

4. **Corrected Implementation:**
   - The corrected implementation of `func_2` should correctly apply the operation and check the entire array after all operations.
   - The loop should ensure that the operation is only applied when the conditions `list[i] >= 2`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
   - After the loop, it should call `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and print the appropriate result.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the program, particularly the incorrect operation application and the incorrect check for zero.
- The corrected program provided in the original assessment is accurate and addresses these issues.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, and the provided corrected program is the proper solution.)
