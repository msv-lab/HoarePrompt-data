The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, and the range function. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value for `i`. The range starts from 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `n - 1` must be greater than 1).

State: **`list` is a list of integers with length `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1**
