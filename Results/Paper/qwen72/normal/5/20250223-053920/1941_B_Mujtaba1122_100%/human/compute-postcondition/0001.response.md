To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

### Initial State:
- `list` is a list of integers with length `n`.
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, n - 1)`):**
   - This loop iterates over the elements of the list from index 1 to index \(n-2\).

2. **Inner Loop (`while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0`):**
   - This loop continues as long as the current element (`list[i]`) is greater than 1, and both the previous element (`list[i - 1]`) and the next element (`list[i + 1]`) are greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, the following operations are performed:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - These operations decrement the values of `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` based on the value of `list[i - 1]`.

3. **Condition Check (`if list[i - 1] != 0`):**
   - After the inner loop, if `list[i - 1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately, terminating the loop.

### Key Observations:
- The inner loop will continue to decrement the values of `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` until one of the conditions (`list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, or `list[i + 1] > 0`) is no longer satisfied.
- If `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the inner loop, the program will print 'no' and return, which means the loop will not continue to the next iteration.
- Therefore, the loop will only complete all iterations if `list[i - 1]` becomes zero for all `i` in the range.

### Final Output State:
- If the loop completes all iterations without printing 'no', the final state of the list will be such that for each `i` in the range `1` to `n-2`, `list[i - 1]` will be zero.
- The first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) will remain unchanged because they are not modified by the loop.

### Natural Language Description:
- The loop will modify the list such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) will be zero if the loop completes without printing 'no'.
- If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not zero after the inner loop, the program will print 'no' and terminate.

### Output State:
Output State: **The list will be modified such that all elements from index 1 to index \(n-2\) will be zero, and the first element (`list[0]`) and the last element (`list[n-1]`) will remain unchanged. If the loop encounters a non-zero `list[i - 1]` after the inner loop, it will print 'no' and terminate.**
