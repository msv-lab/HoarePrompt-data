Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
no
NO
no
```

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Base Case:**
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the base case where the array is already all zeros. It should directly return "YES" in such cases.

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The operation logic in `func_2` is flawed. The while loop modifies the array elements in a way that does not align with the problem description. Specifically, the line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` and similar lines are incorrect. The operation should decrement `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operation logic in `func_2` has already potentially modified the array incorrectly. This leads to incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that the operations are applied in a way that respects the constraints and that the final array is checked for all zeros. A correct implementation would involve checking if the sum of the elements at even indices is equal to the sum of the elements at odd indices, as this is a necessary and sufficient condition for the array to be transformed to all zeros.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    even_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(0, n, 2))
    odd_sum = sum(arr[i] for i in range(1, n, 2))
    return even_sum == odd_sum

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This corrected version correctly checks if the sum of elements at even indices is equal to the sum of elements at odd indices, which is the key condition for the array to be transformable to all zeros.
