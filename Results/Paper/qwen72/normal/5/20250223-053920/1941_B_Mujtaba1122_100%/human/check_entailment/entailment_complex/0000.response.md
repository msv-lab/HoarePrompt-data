### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(list, n)`**:
     - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to \( n-1 \) are zero.
     - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
     - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
     - This function is correct for its purpose.

   - **`func_2(list, n)`**:
     - This function attempts to modify the list such that all elements from index 1 to \( n-2 \) are set to zero.
     - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
     - For each index \( i \), it uses a while loop to apply the operation as long as \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
     - The while loop decrements \( list[i+1] \), \( list[i] \), and \( list[i-1] \) by \( list[i-1] \), \( 2 \times list[i-1] \), and \( list[i-1] \) respectively.
     - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) is non-zero after the while loop, it prints 'no' and returns.
     - After the loop, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if the entire list is zero.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_2(list, n)` to determine if the array can be made zero.

4. **Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Decrement in `func_2`**:
     - The while loop in `func_2` decrements elements by \( list[i-1] \), which is incorrect. The operation should decrement \( list[i-1] \), \( list[i] \), and \( list[i+1] \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
     - The correct decrement should be:
       ```python
       list[i + 1] -= 1
       list[i] -= 2
       list[i - 1] -= 1
       ```

5. **Correctness**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly apply the operation as described in the problem.
   - The incorrect decrement logic will lead to incorrect results in many cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the decrement logic in `func_2` is flawed, leading to incorrect modifications of the array and potentially incorrect outputs.
