Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application in `func_2`:** The operation is applied incorrectly in the while loop. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`. However, the current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is not correct. The correct operation should be:
   ```python
   list[i - 1] -= 1
   list[i] -= 2
   list[i + 1] -= 1
   ```

2. **Incorrect Check for Non-Zero Elements:** The check `if list[i - 1] != 0:` is placed inside the loop and will prematurely exit the function if any element is non-zero before all operations are applied. This check should be done after all operations are applied to ensure the entire array is checked.

3. **Handling of Test Cases:** The program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. The function `func_2` should be called within a loop that processes each test case.

4. **Output Format:** The output format should be "YES" or "NO" for each test case, but the program uses "no" in one of the print statements, which is not a valid output.

5. **Edge Cases:** The program does not correctly handle edge cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros. For example, if the array has a small number of elements or if the sum of the elements is not divisible by 4, it may not be possible to make all elements zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if sum(arr) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] >= 2 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    return all(x == 0 for x in arr)

def solve_test_cases(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        if can_make_zero(arr):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    return results

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

results = solve_test_cases(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version includes a function `can_make_zero` that checks if the array can be reduced to all zeros and a function `solve_test_cases` that processes multiple test cases. The output format is also corrected to match the problem requirements.
