### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` for any index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to make all elements zero by performing the operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - After performing the operations, it checks if the previous element `list[i-1]` is zero. If not, it prints "no" and returns.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The operation is applied incorrectly in `func_2`. The line:
       ```python
       list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
       list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
       ```
     - This subtracts `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, `2 * list[i-1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` from `list[i-1]`.
     - The correct operation should subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]` without multiplying by `list[i-1]`.

   - **Incorrect Check for Zero:**
     - The check `if list[i - 1] != 0:` is performed after the loop, which is incorrect. The loop should ensure that the operation is applied only when all three elements are positive enough to perform the operation.
     - Additionally, the program should check the entire array for zero after all operations, not just the previous element.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should ensure that the operation is applied correctly and that the entire array is checked for zero after all operations.

### Correctness:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. The operation is applied incorrectly, and the check for zero is not comprehensive enough.
- The corrected program provided in the original assessment is accurate and addresses these issues.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] >= 2 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_2(a, n)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **func_1** remains the same, checking if all elements are zero.
- **func_2** now correctly applies the operation and checks the entire array after all operations.
- The loop ensures that the operation is only applied when the conditions `list[i] >= 2`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
- After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints the appropriate result.
