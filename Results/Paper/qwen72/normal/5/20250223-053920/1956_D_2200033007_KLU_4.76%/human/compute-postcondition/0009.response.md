Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `c` of integers, where the list length is between 1 and 18, and each integer is between 0 and 10^7. It prints either "4 1" and "1 2" if the list `c` contains exactly one element and that element is 2, or it prints "13 0" if the list `c` does not meet this condition. The function returns `None`. **
