Reasoning: 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program only handles specific cases based on the length of the array and does not implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the elements by performing the specified operations. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Array Length**:
   - The program checks if the length of the array `c` is 2 and prints a fixed output "4 1" followed by "1 2". This is only correct for the specific case where the array is `[0, 1]` and the MEX operation results in `[2, 2]`, which sums to 4.
   - For all other lengths, it prints "13 0", which is a fixed output and does not consider the actual content of the array. This is clearly incorrect for most inputs.

2. **No MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not calculate the MEX (Minimum Excluded Value) of any subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem statement. The MEX is used to determine the value to set in the subarray to maximize the sum.

3. **No Operations Performed**:
   - The program does not perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum. It simply prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Incorrect Output for General Cases**:
   - For the input example:
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     The correct output should be:
     ```
     105 2
     3 3
     3 4
     ```
     However, the program will output:
     ```
     13 0
     ```
     This is incorrect because it does not maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

5. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a`, but the function expects a list `c`. This is a mismatch in the function signature and the actual call, which should be fixed to pass the array itself rather than its length.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
