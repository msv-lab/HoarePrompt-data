Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The input is read into a list `a` as strings, and then `func_1` is called with the length of the list `a` as its argument. However, `func_1` expects a list of integers, not the length of the list. This is a mismatch in the function's expected input.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases:
   - When the length of the list `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" and "1 2".
   - For any other length, it prints "13 0".
   
   This logic is incorrect because:
   - The function does not actually compute the MEX of any subarray.
   - The function does not attempt to maximize the sum of the array elements.
   - The function does not output the correct number of operations or the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Example Mismatch**: The function's output does not match the examples provided in the problem description:
   - For the input `2 0 1`, the correct output should be `4 1` and `1 2`, which the function does correctly.
   - For the input `3 1 3 9`, the correct output should be `13 0`, which the function does correctly.
   - For the input `4 1 100 2 1`, the correct output should be `105 2` and `3 3` followed by `3 4`, but the function will output `13 0` regardless.
   - For the input `1 0`, the correct output should be `1 1` and `1 1`, but the function will output `13 0` regardless.

4. **General Solution**: The function does not provide a general solution to the problem. It only handles a few specific cases and does not compute the MEX or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
