### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet before removing a coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses the game.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is symmetric in the sense that the total number of coins (a + b) remains constant.
   - The player who starts with an even total number of coins (a + b) will always lose if both players play optimally.
   - The player who starts with an odd total number of coins (a + b) will always win if both players play optimally.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, the first player (Alice) will always be forced to make the last move that results in an empty wallet, thus losing the game.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, the first player (Alice) can always force the second player (Bob) into a position where Bob will be forced to make the last move that results in an empty wallet, thus winning the game.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Verification Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it correctly splits the input string `s` and converts the parts to integers `a` and `b`.
   - The program then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".
   - The final state of the program is consistent with the input and output format specified in the problem description.

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight and the optimal strategy for the game.
   - The program's logic aligns with this strategy.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and the input/output format as required.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner based on the provided problem description and the optimal strategy for the game.

Final: **True**
