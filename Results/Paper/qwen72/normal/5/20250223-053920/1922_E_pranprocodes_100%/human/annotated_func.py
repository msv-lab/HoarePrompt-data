#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop executes for each test case, and for each `X`, it prints the number of elements in the resulting array `t` and the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order. The variables `max` and `min` are updated based on the operations inside the loop, but their final values depend on the specific value of `X`. The array `ans` will contain at most 200 elements, and the elements will be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If `X` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `t` will be 0, with `ans` being an empty array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each `X`, it generates and prints an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It also prints the number of elements in the array. If `X` is 1, it prints 0 and an empty array. The function does not return any value.
