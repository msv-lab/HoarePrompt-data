You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

    #State: The loop executes for each test case, and for each `X`, it prints the number of elements in the resulting array `t` and the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order. The variables `max` and `min` are updated based on the operations inside the loop, but their final values depend on the specific value of `X`. The array `ans` will contain at most 200 elements, and the elements will be within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If `X` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `t` will be 0, with `ans` being an empty array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). For each `X`, it generates and prints an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It also prints the number of elements in the array. If `X` is 1, it prints 0 and an empty array. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - If it is impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \(-10^8 \).
   - It creates an empty list `ans` to store the array elements.
   - It uses a loop to reduce \( X \) to 1 by either appending `max` and decrementing `max` if \( X \) is even, or appending `min` and incrementing `min` if \( X \) is odd.
   - After the loop, it prints the length of the array `t` and the array `ans` in reverse order.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is reduced to 1 by appending elements to the array.
   - The use of `max` and `min` ensures that the elements are within the valid range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - The program appends `max` when \( X \) is even and `min` when \( X \) is odd. This ensures that the array can be constructed to have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The array is printed in reverse order to maintain the correct sequence of elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1. However, the problem description specifies that \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \), so this is not a concern.
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200. However, given the constraints and the way the program constructs the array, it is unlikely to exceed 200 elements.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and problem description. It constructs an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and ensures that the elements are within the valid range.
