Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Use of Dictionary `M`**:
   - The dictionary `M` is intended to keep track of the counts of elements in the array `N`. However, the program incorrectly increments the count of `cur` instead of the actual element `num`.
   - The line `M[cur] += 1` should be `M[num] = M.get(num, 0) + 1`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**:
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program should check if the current number `num` is equal to `cur + 1` and only then increment `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the game should end immediately because the MEX is `cur + 1`.
   - The program also has an incorrect condition to check if the sum of values in `M` equals `S`. This is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Handling of MEX Calculation**:
   - The program should correctly handle the MEX calculation by checking the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after all elements have been processed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work correctly:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = 0
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            M[num] = M.get(num, 0) + 1
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
        print(cur)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Dictionary `M`**: We use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array `N`.
- **Variable `cur`**: We initialize `cur` to 0, which will be used to track the MEX.
- **Loop through `N`**: We iterate through the sorted array `N`. For each number `num`, we update the count in `M`. If `num` is equal to `cur`, it means that `cur` is present in the array, so we increment `cur`.
- **Output**: After processing all elements, `cur` will be the MEX of the array `c`.

This corrected program should correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` for each test case.
