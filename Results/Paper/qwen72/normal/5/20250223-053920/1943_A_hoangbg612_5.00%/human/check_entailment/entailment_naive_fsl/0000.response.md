Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game's logic where Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
In this test case, the optimal strategy is as follows:
1. Alice picks 2. Now `a = [0, 1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
2. Bob picks 0. Now `a = [1, 2]` and `c = [2]`.
3. Alice picks 1. Now `a = [2]` and `c = [2, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 2. Now `a = []` and `c = [2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c = [2, 1]` is 3, which is the correct output. However, the provided program outputs 2, indicating that it does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of both players.
