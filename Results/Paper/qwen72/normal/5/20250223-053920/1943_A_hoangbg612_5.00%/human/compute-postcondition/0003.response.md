The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. It is expected to read input data that includes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n). The total number of test cases, `t`, is also provided, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is based on the input `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
