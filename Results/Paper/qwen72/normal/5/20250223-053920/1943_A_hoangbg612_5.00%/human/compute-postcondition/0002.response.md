Output State: **The loop will print the largest integer `cur` for each test case, such that the condition `M[i] <= i` is not violated for any `i` in the range `0` to `cur - 1`. The variable `cur` will be the final value after processing the list `N` for each test case. The dictionary `M` will contain the counts of integers that were processed, and the list `N` will be sorted. The variable `S` will be the number of unique integers in the list `N` that were processed.**
