### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - The function `func_2` reads a line of input and splits it into integers, which is used to read the values of `n` and `k` and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - The program creates a list `arr` of tuples where each tuple contains the negative price for Alice (`-a[i]`) and the price for Bob (`b[i]`). This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default).
   - The list `arr` is then sorted by Bob's prices in ascending order.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a min-heap `k_arr` and a variable `sub_sum` to 0.
   - It pushes the last `k` items from `arr` into `k_arr` and calculates the initial `sub_sum` by summing the negative Alice prices of these items.

4. **Optimization Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the remaining items in `arr` and updates `sub_sum` by:
     - Subtracting Bob's price of the current item.
     - Adding Alice's price of the current item if the sum of Alice's and Bob's prices is non-negative.
     - Pushing the current item into `k_arr` and popping the smallest item from `k_arr` (which is the item with the smallest negative Alice price).
     - Subtracting the Alice price of the popped item from `sub_sum`.
   - The program updates `max_value` if `sub_sum` is greater than `max_value`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit `max_value` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - These functions correctly read the input as described in the problem statement.
- **Correctness of `func_3`:**
  - The function correctly calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum is non-negative.
- **Main Logic:**
  - The main logic of the program is to maximize Alice's profit by selecting items such that Bob's free items are minimized and the profit from the remaining items is maximized.
  - The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the `k` items with the smallest negative Alice prices, which ensures that Bob will take the least profitable items for free.
  - The program iterates over the remaining items and updates the profit by considering the current item and the item that Bob will take for free.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's optimal strategy to minimize it. The use of a min-heap and the sorting of items by Bob's prices ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
