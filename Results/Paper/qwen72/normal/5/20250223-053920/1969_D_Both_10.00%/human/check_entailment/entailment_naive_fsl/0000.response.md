Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the optimal selection of items for Alice and Bob. The function simply adds up the values of `val_a[0]` from `sec_arr` and then adds up the values of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` from `main_ar` if they are non-negative, which does not align with the game's rules.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
According to the problem description:
- Alice should buy the items with prices `[1, 2, 1, 4]` for herself.
- Bob will take 2 items for free, and pay for the rest.

The optimal strategy for Alice would be to buy the items with prices `[1, 2, 1, 4]` and then Bob would take the two cheapest items for free (items with prices `1` and `1`), leaving Alice with the items priced `2` and `4`. Bob would then pay `3` and `3` for these items, resulting in Alice's profit:
- Bob pays: `3 + 3 = 6`
- Alice spends: `2 + 4 = 6`
- Alice's profit: `6 - 6 = 0`

However, the provided program does not correctly handle this scenario. The function `func_3` does not consider the optimal selection of items based on the difference between `b_i` and `a_i`, and it does not account for Bob taking the `k` cheapest items for free.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, Alice should:
1. Calculate the profit for each item as `b_i - a_i`.
2. Sort the items based on their profit.
3. Select the top `n - k` items with the highest profit (since Bob will take the `k` items with the lowest profit for free).
4. Sum the profits of the selected items to get Alice's maximum profit.

The provided program does not implement this logic, hence it is incorrect.
