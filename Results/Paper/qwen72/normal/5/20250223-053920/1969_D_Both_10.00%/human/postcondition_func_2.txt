The function `func_3` accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing item prices for Alice and Bob, respectively. It returns the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of these elements is non-negative. Both `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged after the function execution.
