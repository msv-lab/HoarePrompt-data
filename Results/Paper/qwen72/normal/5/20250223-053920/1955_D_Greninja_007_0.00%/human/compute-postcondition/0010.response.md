The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, and `m`. 

- `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where `1 <= m <= n`.
- `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= m`.
- `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- `m` is the length of the list `b`.

The function returns the value of `good_subarrays`, which is the count of subarrays in `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` integers with frequencies matching those in `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, an integer `k`, and two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively. It returns the count of subarrays in `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` integers with frequencies matching those in `b`.**
