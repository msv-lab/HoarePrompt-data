### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` from the input.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these inputs.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initial Counting**:
     - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in `b`.
     - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of the first `m` elements in `a`.
     - `matches` is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each position `i` from `0` to `n - m - 1`:
     - If the current number of matches (`matches`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `good_subarrays`.
     - It then updates the window by:
       - Decreasing the frequency of the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`).
       - Increasing the frequency of the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`).
       - Adjusting the `matches` count accordingly.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program checks the last subarray (from `n - m` to `n - 1`).
   - If the number of matches in this subarray is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `good_subarrays`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total count of good subarrays.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Sliding Window Approach**:
  - The sliding window approach is appropriate for this problem because it efficiently checks each subarray of length `m` in `a` without recalculating the entire frequency count from scratch.
  - The `matches` count is correctly updated by considering the element sliding out and the element sliding in.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where the last subarray is checked after the loop.
  - The constraints are respected, and the program should work within the given limits.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of `Counter` objects and the sliding window approach ensures that the program runs efficiently, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the number of good subarrays, and it handles the edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
