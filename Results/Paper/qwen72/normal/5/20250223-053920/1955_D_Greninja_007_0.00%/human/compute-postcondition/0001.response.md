Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= m, `good_subarrays` is 0, `b_freq` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `b`.** 

The `b_freq` variable now holds a Counter object that counts the frequency of each integer in the list `b`. All other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
