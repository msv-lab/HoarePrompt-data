You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` of length `m`.
   - This is a good approach because it allows efficient counting and comparison of elements.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and `b` using the `min` function to ensure that the count does not exceed the available frequency in either array.
   - This is done correctly by summing up the minimum of the frequencies of common elements.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` and update the frequency counts and matches.
   - For each new position of the window, it:
     - Decreases the frequency of the element that is leaving the window.
     - Updates the matches count if the leaving element is in `b`.
     - Increases the frequency of the element that is entering the window.
     - Updates the matches count if the entering element is in `b`.

5. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - The program checks if the current number of matches is greater than or equal to `k` and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if so.
   - This is done correctly for both the initial window and each subsequent window.

6. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check to see if the last window is good and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that have at least `k` elements matching the elements in array `b`. The sliding window approach ensures that the program efficiently updates the frequency counts and matches as it moves through the array.
