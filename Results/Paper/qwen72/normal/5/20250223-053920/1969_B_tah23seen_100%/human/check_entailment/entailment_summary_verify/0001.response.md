### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of operations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The function iterates through the string and maintains two variables: `cost` and `one`.
   - `one` counts the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - When a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic is based on the idea that each time a '0' appears after a '1', it needs to be moved to the left of all the '1's encountered so far.
   - The cost of moving a '0' to the left of `one` '1's is `one + 1` because it involves a cyclic shift of a substring of length `one + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the function correctly returns 0.
   - For strings like "101011", the function correctly computes the cost as 5 by moving each '0' to the left of the '1's.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For "10", the function correctly returns 2.
   - For "0000", the function correctly returns 0.
   - For "11000", the function correctly returns 9.
   - For "101011", the function correctly returns 5.
   - For "01101001", the function correctly returns 11.

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and returns the total cost calculated based on the number of '0's in `s` that appear after at least one '1'. Each '0' contributes a cost equal to the number of '1's seen before it plus one. The input string `s` remains unchanged.
   - This summary aligns with the logic and behavior of the function as described in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts of substrings. The solution is efficient and handles all edge cases as described. The function summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected.

Final: **True**
