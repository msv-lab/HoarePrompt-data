### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then reads `t` binary strings `s` and processes each one using the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.
   - The variable `cost` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total cost.
   - The variable `one` is initialized to 0 to count the number of '1's encountered so far in the string.
   - The program iterates through each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because each '0' that comes after a '1' requires a cyclic shift operation to move it to the correct position, and the cost of such an operation is the length of the substring containing the '0' and all preceding '1's.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total `cost` calculated.
   - The main loop prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - Each '0' that comes after a '1' contributes to the cost, and the cost is calculated as the number of '1's seen so far plus one.
   - The program handles the constraints correctly:
     - It processes up to `10^4` test cases.
     - Each string can have a length of up to `2 \cdot 10^5`.
     - The sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000").
   - It also handles the case where the string is a mix of '0's and '1's (e.g., "101011").
   - The program correctly calculates the cost for strings with multiple '0's and '1's in different positions.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using the given cyclic shift operation.

**Correctness: True**
