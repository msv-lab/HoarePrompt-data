### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length `r - l + 1` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` and maintains two variables: `cost` and `one`.
   - `one` keeps track of the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` whenever a '0' is encountered and there are some '1's before it.

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - The idea is to count the number of '1's before each '0' and add this count plus one to the cost. This is because each '0' that appears after a '1' in the string can be moved to the correct position by cyclically shifting the substring that includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - For example, in the string "11000":
     - The first '0' has 2 '1's before it, so the cost is 3 (2 + 1).
     - The second '0' has 2 '1's before it, so the cost is 3 (2 + 1).
     - The third '0' has 2 '1's before it, so the cost is 3 (2 + 1).
     - Total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function will correctly return 0 because no '0' will be encountered after any '1'.
   - If the string consists entirely of '1's or '0's, the function will also return 0, which is correct.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The function iterates through the string once, making it O(n) where n is the length of the string.
   - The overall complexity for t test cases is O(t * n), which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the function:
     - "10" -> 2
     - "0000" -> 0
     - "11000" -> 9
     - "101011" -> 5
     - "01101001" -> 11

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The function `func_1(s)` works as intended and handles the edge cases and constraints appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
