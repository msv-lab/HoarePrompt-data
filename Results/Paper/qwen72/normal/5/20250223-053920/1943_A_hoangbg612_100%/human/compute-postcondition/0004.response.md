Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`. It then processes the list `N` to determine the value of `cur` based on specific conditions and prints the final value of `cur` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the final values of `cur` for each test case have been printed. The variables `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset or updated within each iteration, and their values are not carried over to the next iteration. **
