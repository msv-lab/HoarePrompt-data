Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted list and checking if the current number is greater than the previous number. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array `c` might not contain all numbers from 0 to `cur` after the game ends.
   - The program breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a number that is greater than `cur + 1`, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Counts**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `N`. However, it does not correctly handle the case where a number appears more than once.
   - The program increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` even if the number is not the next expected number in the sequence, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice should try to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to minimize it. The program does not consider the turns or the optimal choices for each player.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem, we need to simulate the game correctly by considering the optimal moves for both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Initialize MEX to 0
        mex = 0
        
        # Create a frequency counter for the elements in N
        freq = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[mex] > 0:
                # Alice's turn: she picks the smallest number that is not in c
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    freq[mex] -= 1
                    if freq[mex] == 0:
                        mex += 1
                # Bob's turn: he picks the smallest number that is not in c
                else:
                    freq[mex] -= 1
                    if freq[mex] == 0:
                        mex += 1
            else:
                # If the current MEX is not in N, the game ends
                break
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Frequency Counter**:
   - We create a frequency counter `freq` to keep track of how many times each number appears in the array `N`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - We initialize `mex` to 0.
   - We iterate through the array `N` and simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - On Alice's turn (even index), she picks the smallest number that is not in `c` and decrements its frequency. If the frequency of `mex` becomes 0, we increment `mex`.
   - On Bob's turn (odd index), he picks the smallest number that is not in `c` and decrements its frequency. If the frequency of `mex` becomes 0, we increment `mex`.
   - If the current `mex` is not in `N` (i.e., `freq[mex] == 0`), the game ends, and we print the current `mex`.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the MEX is correctly calculated.
