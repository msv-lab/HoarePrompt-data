### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `S` (which is actually the size of the array `N` and should be `n` based on the problem description) and the list of integers `N`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach to process the elements in a structured manner.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `cur` to -1, which is used to track the current MEX value.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `N` and updates `cur` to the current element if it is greater than `cur`. If the current element is greater than `cur + 1`, it breaks the loop, indicating that the MEX has been found.
   - The dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S` (which should be `n`). If so, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is intended to handle cases where all elements in `N` are distinct and the MEX is the next integer.
   - The list `cnt` is used to collect elements that appear exactly once in `N`.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` is set to the second element in `cnt`. This step is intended to handle cases where Alice and Bob can play optimally to maximize or minimize the MEX.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the final value of `cur` for each test case.

### Issues:

1. **Variable Naming**:
   - The variable `S` should be `n` to match the problem description.
   - The variable `T` should be used consistently to represent the number of test cases.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating `cur` and breaking the loop when `num > cur + 1` is correct for finding the MEX.
   - However, the logic for handling the case where all elements are distinct and the MEX is the next integer is flawed. The sum of the values in `M` should not be compared to `S` (which is `n`), but rather the length of `N` should be considered.
   - The logic for setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` is also flawed. The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob should be to ensure that the MEX is maximized or minimized based on their turns, not just by setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.

### Corrected Logic:

- **Optimal Play**:
  - Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize or minimize the MEX.
  - Alice will always choose the smallest element that is not yet in `c` and is not the next MEX.
  - Bob will always choose the smallest element that is not the next MEX.
  - The MEX will be the smallest integer that is not in `c` after all elements in `N` have been processed.

### Correctness:

Given the issues in the logic, particularly in handling the optimal play and the MEX calculation, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
