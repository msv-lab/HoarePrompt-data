The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `b` is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and 'NONE' in all other cases. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained.
