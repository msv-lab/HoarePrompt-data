### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input and converts them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Stair Condition:**
   - The function checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - This condition correctly identifies a sequence where the digits are in strictly increasing order.

3. **Equal Digits Condition:**
   - The function checks if `a == b == c`. If this condition is true, it prints "NONE".
   - This condition correctly identifies a sequence where all three digits are the same, which does not form a stair or a peak.

4. **Peak Condition:**
   - The function checks if `max(a, b, c) == b`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - This condition correctly identifies a sequence where `b` is the maximum digit, which means `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. This is a valid peak condition.

5. **None Condition:**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function prints "NONE".
   - This condition correctly handles all other cases where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

### Analysis:
- The conditions are mutually exclusive and cover all possible cases:
  - `a < b < c` for a stair.
  - `a == b == c` for equal digits.
  - `max(a, b, c) == b` for a peak.
  - All other cases are handled by the "NONE" condition.
- The logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program assumes valid inputs, as specified in the problem description.
- The program does not retain the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` after processing, which is expected behavior for this type of problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description. The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's logic and behavior.

Final: **True**
