Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and incorrect. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, it should be considered "NONE" by default, as it does not form a stair or a peak. However, the program explicitly checks for this condition, which is redundant and can be misleading.

Additionally, the condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to determine a peak. It should also check that `a < b` and `b > c` to ensure the peak condition is met.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly handles all the cases as specified in the problem statement.
