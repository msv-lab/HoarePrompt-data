Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is "12" correctly for the PM part. According to the problem description, "12:00" in 24-hour format should be "12:00 PM" in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly sets it to "12:00 AM". This is a specific edge case that the program fails to handle correctly.
