Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It converts the hour part of `s` to a 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM/PM". The function does not return any value, and the variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
