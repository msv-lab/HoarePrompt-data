### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the time in 24-hour format using `input().split(':')`, which splits the input string into hours `h` and minutes `m`.

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour `h` from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, it correctly sets `h1` to the same hour and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, it correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM` (this is incorrect; it should be `PM`).
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, it correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, it correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - `00:00` is converted to `12:00 AM` (this is incorrect; it should be `12:00 AM`).
     - `12:00` is converted to `12:00 AM` (this is incorrect; it should be `12:00 PM`).
     - `23:59` is converted to `11:59 PM` (this is correct).

### Conclusion:
The program has a critical error in the conversion of the hour `12` from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. It incorrectly sets `12:00` to `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`. This error affects the correctness of the program for the specific case of `12:00`.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
