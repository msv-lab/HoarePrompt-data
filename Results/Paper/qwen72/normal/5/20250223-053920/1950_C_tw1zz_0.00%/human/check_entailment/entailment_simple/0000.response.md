Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the correct AM/PM designation. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Handling of 12:00 PM and 12:00 AM**: The program incorrectly sets `h1` to '12' for both '12:00' and '00:00', but it should set `h1` to '12' for '12:00' and '00:00' should be '12:00 AM'. The program correctly handles '12:00' as '12:00 PM' but does not handle '00:00' correctly.

2. **Redundant Code**: The program has a large number of `if-elif` statements that can be simplified. Instead of checking each hour individually, a more efficient approach would be to use a single calculation to convert the hour to 12-hour format.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case where the hour is '00' correctly. It should convert '00' to '12' and set the time to 'AM'.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it fails to handle the edge case of '00:00' and has redundant code.

Correctness: **False**
