Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in `s` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
