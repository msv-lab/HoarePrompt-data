Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference as the result. However, this does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve finding a way to split the array such that the penalty is minimized. This typically involves splitting the array at points where the sum of the subarray can be zero or as close to zero as possible to minimize the penalty. The program should calculate the sum of the penalties of these subarrays, not just the difference between the counts of '+' and '-'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        a = [1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in s]
        
        # Initialize the minimum penalty
        min_penalty = 0
        
        # Calculate the prefix sums
        prefix_sum = 0
        for num in a:
            prefix_sum += num
            min_penalty += abs(prefix_sum)
        
        print(min_penalty)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum penalty by considering the prefix sums and adding the absolute value of each prefix sum to the total penalty, which corresponds to the optimal way to split the array.
