You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string s (s_i ∈ { '+', '-' }, |s| = n) representing the length and content of the string for each test case.

    #State: For each test case, the output state is the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string s. The variables P and M are reset to 0 for each test case, and the loop iterates t times, processing each test case independently.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-'.
   - Each '+' corresponds to `1` and each '-' corresponds to `-1`.
   - We need to split the string into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty (sum of penalties of each subarray) is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - It initializes two counters, `P` for the number of '+' characters and `M` for the number of '-' characters.
   - It iterates through the string and increments `P` for '+' and `M` for '-'.
   - Finally, it prints `P - M`.

3. **Identifying the Issue**:
   - The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.
   - However, this does not directly correspond to the minimum possible penalty.
   - The correct approach should consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of the entire array is zero, the optimal split is to keep it as one subarray, resulting in a penalty of zero.
   - If the sum is non-zero, the optimal split is to split the array into subarrays of length 1, each contributing a penalty of 1 (since the absolute value of the sum of a single element is 1 and the length is 1).

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - Calculate the sum of the array.
   - If the sum is zero, the minimum penalty is zero.
   - If the sum is non-zero, the minimum penalty is the length of the array (since each element will be in its own subarray).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty.
   - It simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum penalty.
