Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
- `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`.
- `index` is now equal to the length of `data`.
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `arr`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`t` and `n`**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases, and it is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `n` is the number of integers in each test case, and it is an integer between 2 and 50.

2. **`arr`**:
   - `arr` is a list of `n` integers, each of which is between 1 and \(10^6\).

3. **`data`**:
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`. This means `data` contains all the input data as strings.

4. **`index`**:
   - `index` is the length of `data`, which indicates the total number of input strings.

5. **`results`**:
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` is the result of applying `func_1` to a list of `n` integers from `arr`.

6. **`print('\n'.join(results))`**:
   - The `print` statement joins all elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and prints the resulting string.
   - Each element in `results` is a string representation of the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `arr`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output a string where each element of the `results` list is printed on a new line. Since the exact values of `arr` and the function `func_1` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical results. However, based on the structure of the problem, the output will be a series of `t` lines, each containing the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `arr`.

Output: **Each element of the `results` list on a new line (where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `arr`)**
