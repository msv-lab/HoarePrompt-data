Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix, and then swapping these two parts. The operation can be performed any number of times.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Functionality**: `func_1` checks if an array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Logic**:
  - If all elements in `arr` satisfy `arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < len(arr) - 1`, it returns 'Yes'.
  - Otherwise, it returns 'No'.
- **Issue**: The function only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not consider the possibility of making the array sorted by performing the swap operation.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Functionality**: `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, processes each test case, and applies `func_1` to the array in each test case.
- **Logic**:
  - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `arr`.
  - It applies `func_1` to `arr` and appends the result to a list `results`.
  - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
- **Issue**: Since `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, `func_2` will also only check if the array is already sorted, without considering the possibility of making the array sorted by performing the swap operation.

### Example Test Cases:
1. **Input**: 
   ```
   3
   6
   1 1 4 5 1 4
   5
   7 9 2 2 3
   3
   1 2 3
   ```
2. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   No
   Yes
   Yes
   ```
3. **Actual Output**:
   - For the first test case `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, `func_1` will return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - For the second test case `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, `func_1` will return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, `func_1` will return 'Yes' because the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program as it stands is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing the swap operation. The function only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
