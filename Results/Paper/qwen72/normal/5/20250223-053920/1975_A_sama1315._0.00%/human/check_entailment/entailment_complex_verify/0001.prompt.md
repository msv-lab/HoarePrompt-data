You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code:

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, and there exists at least one index `i` in the range `0` to `len(arr) - 2` such that `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'No'. After the function concludes, the input list `arr` remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_2():

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input from `sys.stdin`, `index` is now equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `arr`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: Each element of the `results` list on a new line (where each element is the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers from `arr`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of integers, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of these function applications, each on a new line. The function does not return any value. The input is expected to be formatted such that the first integer `t` indicates the number of test cases, each test case starts with an integer `n` indicating the number of integers in the following list `arr`. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 for each test case, `arr` is a list of `n` integers for each test case, and `index` is equal to the length of the input data. The `results` list contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` applied to a list of `n` integers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if there is any element that is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed.

4. **Identifying the Flaw in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does not check if the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation.
   - For example, the array `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[4, 5, 1, 4, 3, 1]`, and then splitting it into `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and `[3, 1]` and swapping them to get `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1, 4]` and `[5, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[5, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4]`, and then splitting it into `[5, 1, 4]` and `[3, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[4, 5, 1, 4, 3, 1]`, and then splitting it into `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and `[3, 1]` and swapping them to get `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, which is still not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1, 4]` and `[5, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[5, 1, 4, 3, 1, 4]`, and then splitting it into `[5, 1, 4]` and `[3, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be split into two parts, and when these parts are swapped, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This involves checking if the array can be split into two parts where the maximum element of the first part is less than or equal to the minimum element of the second part.

### Conclusion:
The provided `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
