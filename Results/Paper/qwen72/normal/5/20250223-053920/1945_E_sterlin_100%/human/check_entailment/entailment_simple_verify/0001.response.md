Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using a binary search algorithm after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly described in the problem statement and is implemented in the provided code.

2. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Two integers `n` and `x`.
     - A permutation `p` of length `n`.
   - The input handling is done using the functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()`, which are correctly used to read the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly:
     - It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
     - It iterates, updating `mid` as the midpoint and adjusting `left` or `right` based on the comparison of `p[mid]` with `x`.
     - The loop continues until `left + 1 < right`, which is the correct condition for binary search.

4. **Swapping Operations**:
   - The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation using a dictionary `num_indx`.
   - It checks if `x` is already at the correct position (`p[left] == x`).
   - If `x` is not at the correct position and has not been seen during the binary search, it performs a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If `x` has been seen during the binary search, it performs two swaps to ensure that `x` is at the correct position and the binary search can find it.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program does implement the logic to solve the problem:
     - It reads the input correctly.
     - It performs the binary search algorithm.
     - It determines the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search finds `x`.
   - The program correctly handles the cases where no swaps, one swap, or two swaps are needed.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not contain the logic to solve the problem.
   - The provided program is complete and correctly implements the required functionality to solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
