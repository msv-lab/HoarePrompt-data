Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find a number `x` in a permutation `p` of size `n` using binary search after performing at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation if necessary.
   - The binary search algorithm is correctly described in the problem statement.

2. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - Two integers `n` and `x`.
     - A permutation `p` of length `n`.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm in the provided code is implemented correctly. It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, and then iterates, updating `m` as the midpoint and adjusting `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `p[m]` with `x`.

4. **Swapping Operations**:
   - The program needs to determine the positions of `x` in the permutation and the positions of the elements that need to be swapped to achieve the correct order for binary search.
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_indx` to store the indices of each element in the permutation.
   - It also uses a list `seen` to track which elements have been visited during the binary search.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program correctly reads the input and processes it.
   - It correctly implements the binary search algorithm.
   - The program checks if `x` is found at the correct position (`p[left] == x`).
   - If `x` is not found and `x` has not been seen during the binary search, it performs a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If `x` is not found and `x` has been seen during the binary search, it performs two swaps to correct the order of the permutation and place `x` at the correct position.

6. **Detailed Evaluation**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases.
     - `func_2()` reads `n` and `x`.
     - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p`.
   - **Binary Search**:
     - The binary search loop correctly updates `l` and `r` based on the comparison of `p[mid]` with `x`.
   - **Swapping Logic**:
     - The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation using `num_indx`.
     - It correctly checks if `x` is already at the correct position.
     - If `x` is not at the correct position and has not been seen, it performs a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
     - If `x` is not at the correct position and has been seen, it performs two swaps to correct the order and place `x` at the correct position.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program is complete and correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - It handles the input and output correctly, performs the binary search, and applies the necessary swaps to ensure the correct result.

Final: **True**
