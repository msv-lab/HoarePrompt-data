### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then reads the input for each test case and processes it using the `func_1` function.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a variable `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array:**
   - The function iterates over each element in the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and is not the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and is the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If the condition is met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c` as is.

4. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if the transformed list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b`, indicating that the array can be sorted.
   - Otherwise, it appends `0` to `b`.

### Issues:

- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The logic for transforming the array is flawed. The program only checks if the digits of the current element can be inserted in a specific order, but it does not consider all possible transformations that could make the array sorted.
  - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program does not correctly handle the transformation of `28` to `[2, 8]` and then check if the array can be sorted.

- **Incorrect Condition for First Element:**
  - The condition `if i == 0 and a[i] > 10:` is not necessary and can be simplified. The first element should always be split if it is greater than 10.

- **Redundant Variables:**
  - The variable `n` is not necessary and can be removed since it is always equal to the length of `c`.

- **Incorrect Comparison:**
  - The program should check if the transformed array can be sorted in non-decreasing order, not just if it is equal to the sorted array. This means it should check if the transformed array is already sorted.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **Initial State:**
  - The function `func_1` is called `m` times, once for each test case.
  - Inside `func_1`, the length `k` and the array `a` are read correctly.

- **Transformation Loop:**
  - The loop iterates over each element in `a`.
  - For elements greater than 10, the program splits them into digits `x` and `y`.
  - The conditions for appending `y` and `x` to `c` are too restrictive and do not cover all valid transformations.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, the list `c` is sorted and compared to itself.
  - If `c` is equal to `d`, it appends `1` to `b`, indicating a sorted array.
  - Otherwise, it appends `0` to `b`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program's transformation logic is flawed, and it does not correctly handle all possible transformations that could make the array sorted. Specifically, the conditions for appending digits to `c` are too restrictive, and the program does not consider all valid transformations. Additionally, the program should check if the transformed array can be sorted in non-decreasing order, not just if it is equal to the sorted array.

Final: **False**
