Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying an operation that splits any element of the array that is at least 10 into its constituent digits and inserts them back into the array in the same position.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Global List `b`**:
   - The program uses a global list `b` to store the results of each test case. While this works, it is generally better to avoid global variables and instead return results from functions.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case. However, the logic for splitting elements and constructing the new list `c` is flawed.
   - The condition `if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:` and `elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:` are not sufficient to handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the possibility of splitting elements at positions other than the first and ensuring the entire array remains sorted after each split.
   - The program only checks if the final list `c` is sorted, but it does not ensure that the array can be sorted by the described operations. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not correctly determine that it is impossible to sort the array by splitting elements.

3. **Handling of Digits**:
   - The program splits elements into digits and appends them to the list `c` in a specific order. However, it does not consider the possibility that splitting elements might create a situation where the array cannot be sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, splitting `28` into `2` and `8` will not help in sorting the array because `12` and `5` are already out of order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the array contains elements that are already single digits, it should not split them. Additionally, the program does not consider the possibility of multiple elements being split in a single test case.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for splitting elements and checking the sorted condition is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
