To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty list. Given the initial state, `a` is currently an empty list, and `n` is 0, which does not align with the function's requirements. Therefore, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element and `n` is at least 2.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `c` is an empty list**
