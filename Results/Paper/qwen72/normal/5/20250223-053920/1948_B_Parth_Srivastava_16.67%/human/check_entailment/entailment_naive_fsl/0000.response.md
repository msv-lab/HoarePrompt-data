Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly process the transformation of elements greater than 10 and does not consider the possibility of multiple elements being transformed in a single test case. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly appends the digits of the transformed elements in a way that does not maintain the correct order for all elements. For example, when transforming `12` to `[1, 2]` and `45` to `[4, 5]`, it does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted. This leads to incorrect results for cases where multiple elements need to be transformed.
