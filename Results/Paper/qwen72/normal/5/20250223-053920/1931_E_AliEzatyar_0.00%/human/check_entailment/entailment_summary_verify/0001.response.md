### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Handling:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by iterating through each item and summing the lengths of the strings.
   - It also uses the function `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of digits that can be removed by Anna by summing every second element in the `zeros` list (i.e., the maximum number of trailing zeros that Anna can remove in her turns).
   - The program then checks if the remaining total number of digits after Anna's optimal play is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given string `num` by iterating from the end of the string and stopping when a non-zero digit is encountered.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.
   - There is a typo in the output where it prints `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to count trailing zeros in a string. This is crucial for determining how many digits Anna can remove in her turns.

- **Total Digits Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list by summing the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - The strategy of summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list is a valid approach to simulate Anna's optimal play. By removing the maximum number of trailing zeros in her turns, Anna minimizes the number of digits left for Sasha to concatenate.

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is used to determine if Sasha wins. This condition is based on the total number of digits remaining after Anna's optimal play. However, the use of `abs` is unnecessary here because `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` are both non-negative, and `subtract_zero` is always less than or equal to `total_digits`.

- **Typo in Output:**
  - The typo in the output where it prints `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'` is a critical issue. This typo will cause the program to produce incorrect output, which is a failure in terms of correctness.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Corrected typo
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Final Answer:
- **Original Assessment:**
  - The original assessment correctly identified the typo in the output.
  - The strategy and logic of the program were generally correct, but the typo was a significant issue.

- **Final Evaluation:**
  - **False** (due to the typo in the output)

If the typo is fixed, the program is correct. However, as it stands, the program is incorrect due to the typo.
