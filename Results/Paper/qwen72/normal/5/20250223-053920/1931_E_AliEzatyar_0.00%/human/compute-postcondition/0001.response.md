The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`, so we can only adjust those. The loop is set to iterate from the last index of `num` to the first index, decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one element, and `i` must start at the last valid index of `num`.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in num satisfies 1 ≤ num[i] ≤ 10^9.
- `counter` is 0.

For the loop to execute:
- `num` must have at least one element (which it does, as the length is at least 1).
- `i` must start at `len(num) - 1`, which is the last index of `num`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in num satisfies 1 ≤ num[i] ≤ 10^9; `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
