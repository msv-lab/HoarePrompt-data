### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0, which will store the total number of digits in the list.
   - It also initializes an empty list `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - For each integer in `array`, it adds the length of the integer to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in the integer and appends the result to `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `num` and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing `counter` for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis**:
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It initializes `subtract_zero` to 0, which will store the sum of the trailing zeros that can be subtracted from the total digit count.
   - It iterates through the `zeros` list in steps of 2, adding the value of every second element to `subtract_zero`. This is because Anna can reverse the digits of the integers, and the trailing zeros will be moved to the front, effectively reducing the total digit count by these zeros.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Output**:
   - The program stores the result for each test case in the `answers` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Variable Name**: The program stores the result in `answers[test]` as `'Sashah'` instead of `'Sasha'`. This is a typo and should be corrected to `'Sasha'`.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the typo is corrected.
- **False** if the typo is not corrected.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Corrected from 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the typo in the result assignment).
