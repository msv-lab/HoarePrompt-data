You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99, and the list length between 2 and 50) and returns a boolean value indicating whether `lst` is sorted in ascending order. If `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**: The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the list to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each element of the array `list1` starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list at the appropriate positions.
   - This logic is intended to simulate the operation described in the problem statement.

4. **Final Check**: After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the modified array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`. If it is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only checks and modifies the array once per element. However, the problem statement allows for the operation to be performed any number of times. This means that if the array is not sorted after one pass, the program will not attempt to perform additional operations that might be necessary to sort the array.
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in a single pass or where the array might need to be split multiple times to become sorted.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted. The program will print 'Yes'.
   - For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. It will then split `28` into `[2, 8]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`. The array is still not sorted, and the program will print 'No'.
   - For the third test case `[0, 0]`, the array is already sorted, and the program will print 'Yes'.

However, the program does not correctly handle cases where multiple operations are needed. For example, consider the array `[9, 10, 11]`. The program will not sort this array correctly because it only performs one pass and does not recheck the array after each modification.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully implement the required logic to handle multiple operations as specified in the problem statement.
