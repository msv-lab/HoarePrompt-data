### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check**: The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Transformation Logic**: The program attempts to transform the array by iterating through it and checking if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10. If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.

4. **Insertion and Deletion**: The program correctly deletes the element and inserts its digits back into the list. However, the insertion logic is flawed because it only inserts the digits in the same position where the element was deleted, which may not always result in a sorted array.

5. **Final Check**: After attempting to transform the array, the program checks if the array is now sorted using `func_1(lst)`. If it is, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:

- **Inefficient Transformation**: The program only splits the previous element and inserts its digits in the same position. This does not guarantee that the array will become sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is still not sorted. The program should consider splitting any element that is greater than or equal to 10 and then re-check the entire array for sorting.

- **Single Pass Limitation**: The program only makes one pass through the array, which is insufficient. The transformation process may need to be repeated multiple times to achieve a sorted array. For example, in the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`. However, it does not consider splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` in the same pass, which would be necessary to achieve a fully sorted array.

### Conclusion:

The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the transformation process efficiently and may not achieve a sorted array in all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
