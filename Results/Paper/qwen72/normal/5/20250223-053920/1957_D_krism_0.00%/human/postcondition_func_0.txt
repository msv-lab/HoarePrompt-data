The function `func_1` is intended to process a list of integers `arr` of length `n` by computing a cumulative XOR prefix list and using it to calculate a final result `ans`. The function reads `n` and `arr` from user input, constructs a `prefix` list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, and initializes two lists `pre` and `suf` to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s at each bit position (0 to 31) in the `prefix` list. It then iterates through `arr` to update `pre` and `suf` and calculates `ans` based on the product of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position. The function prints the `arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `suf`, and the final `ans` value. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t` or `test_cases` (which are not used within the function). The final state of the program includes the printed outputs and the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, with `suf` containing all zeros.
