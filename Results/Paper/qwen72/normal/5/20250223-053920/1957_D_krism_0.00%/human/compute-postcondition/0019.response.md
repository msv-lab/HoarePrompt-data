Output State: **The `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` variables remain unchanged. The `suf` list now contains the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0), but all counts are 0. The `ans` variable is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of the products of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position for each element in `arr`.**
