Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` reordered based on the depth of the parentheses sequence at each position. The reordering is such that characters at the same depth are ordered by their original position in reverse (i.e., from right to left). The original string `s` and its length `n` remain unchanged. **
