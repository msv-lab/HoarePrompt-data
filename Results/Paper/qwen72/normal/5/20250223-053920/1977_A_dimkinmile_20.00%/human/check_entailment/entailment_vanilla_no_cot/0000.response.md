Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of removing cubes from the tower. The logic in the program simply checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower), which is not sufficient to determine if the tower can end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

For the tower to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes, the number of additions and removals must balance out in such a way that the final count is `m`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
