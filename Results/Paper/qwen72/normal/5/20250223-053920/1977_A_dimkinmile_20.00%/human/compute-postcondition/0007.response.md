Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the user input, where both integers are expected to be between 1 and 100. It then compares `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value and does not handle multiple test cases as described in the annotations. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` retain their values from the input, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output. **
