Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input, which are split and converted to integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, then `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Otherwise, `n` is less than `m`.***
