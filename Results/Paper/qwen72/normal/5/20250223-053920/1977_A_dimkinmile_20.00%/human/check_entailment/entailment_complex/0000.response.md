Reasoning:

The program provided is incorrect based on the problem description. The logic within the function `func_1` is flawed. According to the problem, Nikita can either add or remove a cube from the tower in each move. The key point is that after `n` moves, the tower can have any number of cubes that is the same parity (odd or even) as `n`, because each move changes the number of cubes by 1. Therefore, the tower can have `m` cubes if and only if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd).

However, the provided function `func_1` only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is insufficient because it does not account for the parity condition. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the function will incorrectly print "No" even though it is possible to have 4 cubes after 2 moves (by adding a cube twice).

Additionally, the function `func_1` is called in a loop, but it does not handle multiple test cases as described. The function should be called with the appropriate parameters for each test case.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity and handles multiple test cases as required.
