The code snippet `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- Each element in `cases` is a list containing two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `N` is an input integer.

The code snippet does not affect `t`, `cases`, or `N`. It only introduces a new list `vals` which contains the integers from the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input.**
