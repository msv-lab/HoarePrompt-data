#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a list containing two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    prod = 1
    for r in vals:
        prod *= r
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`.
    vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]
    den = prod - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - The code will print the integer `-1`.
        #
        #Output:
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty.
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`, `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod`.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the elements in `vprod` are the results of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of these values.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding integer in the input list. The function then calculates a value `den` as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
