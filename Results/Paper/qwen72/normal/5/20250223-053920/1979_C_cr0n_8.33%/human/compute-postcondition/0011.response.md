Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`, `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.**
