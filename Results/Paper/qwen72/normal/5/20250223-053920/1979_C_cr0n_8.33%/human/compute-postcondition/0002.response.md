Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of test cases, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is 1.**

The variable `prod` is initialized to 1. All other variables (`t`, `cases`, `N`, `vals`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
