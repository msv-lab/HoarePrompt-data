### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`N`) and the multipliers for each outcome (`vals`).

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes the value `vprod` for each outcome, which is the product of all multipliers divided by the multiplier for that outcome.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as the product of all multipliers minus the sum of the `vprod` values.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.
   - Otherwise, it prints the `vprod` values as the bets for each outcome.

3. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The approach is based on the idea that the total bet should be less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The total bet is the sum of the `vprod` values.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * vprod[i]`.
   - The program ensures that `k_i * vprod[i] > sum(vprod)` for all i, which is the required condition.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of `vprod` values will be `n * (prod // k_i)`, and `prod - sum(vprod)` will be `prod - n * (prod // k_i)`.
   - If `k_i` is the same for all outcomes, the program will correctly identify that no valid distribution exists if `prod - n * (prod // k_i) <= 0`.

5. **Output Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the bets `x_i` are integers and within the range `1 \le x_i \le 10^9`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and handles the problem as described. It correctly identifies when a valid distribution is possible and when it is not. The mathematical approach is sound and the implementation is correct.
