The function reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the input. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding integer in the input list. The function then calculates a value `den` as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the elements in `vprod` and returns. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
