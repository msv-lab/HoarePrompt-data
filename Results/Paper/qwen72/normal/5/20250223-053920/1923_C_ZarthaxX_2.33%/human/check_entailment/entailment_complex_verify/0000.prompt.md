You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the array `c` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for each query.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where `ones[i]` contains the count of 1s in the sublist `nums[0:i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. `sum` is a list where `sum[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in the sublist `nums[0:i]` and 1 for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` also remain unchanged. The loop has processed `q` queries, and for each query, it has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `nums`. It accepts no parameters and reads input from the standard input. The function initializes two lists, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s and the cumulative sum of differences from 1, respectively, for the elements in `nums`. For each query, it determines if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is satisfied for the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input array `nums` or any other external variables.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the subarray are 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that:

1. The sum of elements in `a` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.
2. `a_i` is not equal to `b_i` for every index `i`.
3. `b_i` is greater than 0 for every index `i`.

However, the program's logic for checking if a subarray is good is flawed. Specifically, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is incorrect. This condition is supposed to ensure that the sum of the subarray can be distributed into a new array `b` such that all elements are positive and different from the corresponding elements in `a`. 

Consider the following example:
```
Input:
1
5 4
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3

Expected Output:
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

For the subarray `1 1 1 1 1`, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` will be true, even though it is impossible to construct an array `b` that meets all the conditions. Specifically, if all elements in `a` are 1, there is no way to construct an array `b` where `b_i > 0` and `b_i != 1` for all `i`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
