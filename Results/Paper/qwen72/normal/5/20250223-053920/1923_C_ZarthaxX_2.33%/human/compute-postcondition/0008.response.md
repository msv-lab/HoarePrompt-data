The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the array `c` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `q` is the number of queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for each query.

The function returns the results of the queries. Each query result is the maximum value in the subarray defined by the borders `l_i` and `r_i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, the array `c` of positive integers, and a list of `queries` where each query is a tuple of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, the function returns the maximum value in the subarray of `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive).**
