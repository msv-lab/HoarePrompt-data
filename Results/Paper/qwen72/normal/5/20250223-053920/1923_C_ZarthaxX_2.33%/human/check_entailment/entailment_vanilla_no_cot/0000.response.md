Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Prefix Sums and Ones Counting**:
   - `ones` array is used to store the prefix count of ones in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` array is used to store the prefix sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in `nums`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray is a single element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to replace a single element with a different positive integer that satisfies the conditions.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, the program calculates the number of ones in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray adjusted by subtracting 1 from each element (`sumInRange`).
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be split into a different set of positive integers that are all different from the original subarray elements.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise, which matches the required output format.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program should work correctly for the given constraints.
