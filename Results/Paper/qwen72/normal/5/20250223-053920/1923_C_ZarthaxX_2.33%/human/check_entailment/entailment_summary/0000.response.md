Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing two arrays: `ones` and `sum`. The `ones` array keeps track of the cumulative count of 1s in the input array `nums`, and the `sum` array keeps track of the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1. This precomputation allows the program to efficiently answer each query in constant time.

For each query, the program checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is "good" by verifying the condition:
\[ 2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange} \]

Breaking down the condition:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray from `l` to `r`.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of the differences between each element in the subarray from `l` to `r` and 1.
- The term \( (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \) represents the number of elements in the subarray that are not 1.

The condition can be simplified to:
\[ \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange} \]
\[ r - l + 1 \leq \text{sumInRange} \]

This simplification means that the subarray is "good" if the number of elements in the subarray is less than or equal to the sum of the differences from 1. This is because if the sum of the differences from 1 is at least the number of elements, it implies that we can construct a corresponding array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `nums` and all elements in `b` are positive.

The program correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` by immediately printing 'NO' because a subarray of length 1 cannot be "good" (since there is no other element to differ from).

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic and efficiently solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
