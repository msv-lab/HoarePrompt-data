Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array `nums`. It accepts no parameters and reads input from the standard input. The function initializes two lists, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s and the cumulative sum of differences from 1, respectively, for the elements in `nums`. For each query, it determines if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is satisfied for the subarray from index `l` to `r` (inclusive). If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input array `nums` or any other external variables. **
