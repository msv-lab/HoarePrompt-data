### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions (`n` and `m`), the positions of the goals (`rg` and `bg`), the initial position of the Quaffle (`ball`), the initial position of the Bludger (`blud`), and the positions of the players (`player`).
   - The program also initializes the scores for the red (`rs`) and blue (`bs`) teams to zero.

2. **Action Processing:**
   - The program iterates over the number of steps (`T`), processing each action as described.
   - For each action, it first identifies the entity performing the action (`p`) and the action itself (`d`).

3. **Catching and Throwing the Quaffle:**
   - If the action is 'C' (catch), the program correctly sets the `carry` variable to the player who caught the Quaffle.
   - If the action is 'T' (throw), the program correctly sets `carry` to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If it is, the appropriate team's score is incremented, and the Quaffle is reset to the middle of the field.

4. **Movement of Entities:**
   - If the entity is the Quaffle (`.Q`), the program calls `func_1(ball, d)` to move the Quaffle.
   - If the entity is the Bludger (`.B`), the program calls `func_1(blud, d)` to move the Bludger and then calls `func_2(t)` to check for and handle any player eliminations.
   - If the entity is a player, the program calls `func_1(player[p], d)` to move the player and then calls `func_2(t)` to check for and handle any player eliminations. If the player is carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position is updated to match the player's new position.

5. **Player Elimination:**
   - The function `func_2(t)` correctly identifies players who are in the same position as the Bludger and prints the elimination message. It also updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate that they are out of the game.

6. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all actions, the program prints the final score in the correct format.

### Potential Issues:
- **Bludger and Player Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger. However, it does not explicitly check if a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle and if the Quaffle remains in the cell where the player was eliminated. This is a subtle point, but the problem statement guarantees that this never occurs while the player is in a cell containing a goal, so the program is correct in this aspect.

- **Quaffle Reset:**
  - The program correctly resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

- **Output Order:**
  - The program ensures that events are printed in ascending order of `t`, and if multiple players are eliminated at the same time, they are printed in alphabetical order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the rules and requirements of the problem. It handles all the specified actions, updates the field state appropriately, and prints the events and final score as required.

Correctness: **True**
