### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N, M) and initializes the lists for red goals (RG), blue goals (BG), and the position of the Bludger (blud).
   - It also initializes the dictionary `player` to store the positions of the players and reads the initial positions of the Quaffle (ball), Bludger, and players from the input.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of steps (T) and processes each step.
   - For each step, it reads the entity (p) and the action (d).

3. **Handling Actions:**
   - **Catching the Quaffle (C):**
     - The program correctly updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle (T):**
     - The program correctly sets `carry` to `None` when a player throws the Quaffle.
     - It checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
     - It then resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field.
   - **Moving Entities (U, D, L, R):**
     - The program correctly moves the Quaffle, Bludger, or player based on the direction (U, D, L, R) using the `func_1` function.
     - It also calls `func_2` to check for player eliminations after moving the Bludger.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly updates the coordinates of the entity based on the direction provided.
   - It handles all valid directions (U, D, L, R) and leaves the coordinates unchanged if an invalid direction is given.

5. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination events in the correct format and order.
   - It sets the position of eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.

6. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all steps, the program correctly prints the final score in the format `FINAL SCORE: r b`.

### Issues:
- **Bludger Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger, but it does not check if the player being eliminated is carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem description, if a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle should remain on the cell where the player was eliminated. The program does not handle this case, which could lead to incorrect behavior if a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct, but it fails to handle the case where a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated. This is a significant issue that affects the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**False**
