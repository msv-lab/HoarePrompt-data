The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `char`, and the list `password`. For the loop to execute, `password` must be a non-empty string. The variables `i` and `char` are initialized by the `enumerate` function, so they do not need to be adjusted manually. However, the state of `password` needs to be clarified to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `last_digit_index` is -1, `password` must be a non-empty string, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in the string `password`**
