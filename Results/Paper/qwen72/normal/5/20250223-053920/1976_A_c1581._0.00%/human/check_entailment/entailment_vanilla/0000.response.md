Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - It initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for validating the password.
   - It initializes two lists, `digits` and `letters`, to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it appends it to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it appends it to the `letters` list.
   - It also keeps track of the last index where a digit was found using `last_digit_index`.
   - If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not `-1`), it returns 'NO' immediately, satisfying the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If either check fails, it returns 'NO'.
   - If both checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list.
   - It prints the results, each on a new line, using `print('\n'.join(results))`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles passwords with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty (though the problem guarantees that `1 \le n \le 20`).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to validate the passwords according to the problem's conditions.

Correctness: **True**
