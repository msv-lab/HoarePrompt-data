Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for reading multiple test cases.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case by reading the length of the password, `n`, and the password itself.

3. **Character Separation**: The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for lowercase Latin letters.

4. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter. If such a case is found, it immediately returns 'NO'.

5. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'.

6. **Final Return**: If all conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given example. Therefore, the program is correct.
