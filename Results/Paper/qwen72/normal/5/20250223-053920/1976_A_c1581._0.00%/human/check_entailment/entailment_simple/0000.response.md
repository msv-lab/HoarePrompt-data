Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the password and the password itself from the list. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Character Segregation**: Inside `func_1`, the program segregates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for lowercase Latin letters. This correctly separates the characters based on their type.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by maintaining a `last_digit_index`. If a letter is found after a digit, it returns 'NO'. This ensures that the condition "there should be no digit that comes after a letter" is met.

4. **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'. This ensures that the conditions "all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order" and "all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order" are met.

5. **Output**: If all conditions are satisfied, the program returns 'YES'. The output is then printed for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. The state comments provided also accurately reflect the state of the program at each step.

Correctness: **True**
