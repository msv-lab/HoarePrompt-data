Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given `n` containers with water, and the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - We need to output "YES" if it is possible to equalize the water, otherwise "NO".

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `mean = total // n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.
   - To achieve the target, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the mean does not go negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot redistribute the water to achieve the target.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of water amounts.
   - `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the mean.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr`.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean and checks if the cumulative difference goes negative.
   - The logic ensures that if the cumulative difference is non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to redistribute the water to achieve the target amount in each container.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 1` (a single container).
   - It also handles cases where the water amounts are already equal.
   - The program ensures that the sum of water amounts is divisible by `n` before proceeding, which is a given condition in the problem.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
