Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies a logical flaw in the program. The program's approach of checking if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative at any point during the iteration is insufficient to determine if it is possible to equalize the water levels in all containers. This approach fails to account for the possibility of transferring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers in a way that balances the cumulative difference.

Let's revisit the test case provided in the original assessment:
```
Input:
1
3
1 5 3
```

The expected output should be "YES" because:
- We can pour 2 units of water from the second container to the first, resulting in `nums = [3, 3, 3]`.
- Alternatively, we can pour 1 unit from the second container to the third, and then 2 units from the second container to the first, also resulting in `nums = [3, 3, 3]`.

However, the program will return "NO" because:
- Initial `nums = [1, 5, 3]`, `mean = 3`.
- First iteration: `curr += 1 - 3 = -2` (negative, so it returns 'NO').

This test case demonstrates that the program's logic is flawed. The program should consider the possibility of transferring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers to balance the cumulative difference.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should ensure that the total amount of water that needs to be transferred from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed containers is non-negative. This means that the cumulative difference should never become negative when iterating through the containers in reverse order (from the last container to the first).

Given the provided test cases and the logical flaw identified, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
