Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the operation of pouring water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. The key points to consider are:

1. **Initial Check**: The sum of the water in all containers must be divisible by the number of containers. This is already guaranteed by the problem constraints, so the function `func_1` does not need to check this explicitly. However, it does this check, which is redundant but does not affect the correctness.

2. **Redistribution Process**: The function calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have. It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum (`curr`) of the difference between the current amount of water in the container and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the current container (or a previous one) does not have enough water to reach the mean, and the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the function returns 'YES'.

3. **Logical Validity**: The logic in the function is correct because:
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the mean is an integer.
   - If the running sum `curr` becomes negative at any point, it indicates that the containers before this point do not have enough water to balance out the containers that need more water, making it impossible to achieve the mean for all containers.
   - If the running sum `curr` remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it means that the water can be redistributed to achieve the mean for all containers.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly:
   - For a single container (n=1), the function will always return 'YES' because the mean is the same as the amount of water in the container.
   - For multiple containers, the function correctly identifies whether the redistribution is possible based on the running sum.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
