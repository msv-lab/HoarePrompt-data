Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**. This indicates that, given the conditions where `nums` is a list of integers representing amounts of water in containers, the length of `nums` (n) is a positive integer, each element in `nums` is a non-negative integer, and the sum of all elements in `nums` (total) is not divisible by `n`, the function concludes that the distribution of water does not meet a certain criterion, hence returning 'NO'.
