### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function first checks if the total sum of water amounts is divisible by `n`. However, this check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is always divisible by `n`.
   - It calculates the mean amount of water each container should have after the operations, which is `total // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `curr` to 0, which will be used to track the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean.

3. **Cumulative Difference Check**:
   - The program iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water amount and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the operation of pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container (where i < j) cannot make the water amounts equal. This is because a negative `curr` indicates that the cumulative water amount in the first `i` containers is less than the required mean amount, making it impossible to balance the water without violating the condition `i < j`.

4. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it means that the water can be balanced, and the function returns 'YES'.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program is sound. The cumulative difference check ensures that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water, adhering to the constraint that water can only be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.
