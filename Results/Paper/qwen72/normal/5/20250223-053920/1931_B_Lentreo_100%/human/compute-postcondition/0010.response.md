The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers, where the length of `nums` (n) is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`.

If the function determines that it is not possible to redistribute the water in such a way that all containers have the same amount of water, it returns 'NO'. If it is possible to redistribute the water so that all containers have the same amount of water, it returns 'YES'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 'NO' if it is not possible to redistribute the water so that all containers have the same amount. If it is possible, the function returns 'YES'.**
