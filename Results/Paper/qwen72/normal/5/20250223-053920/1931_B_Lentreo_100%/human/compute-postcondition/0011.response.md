Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in containers. It checks if it is possible to redistribute the water so that all containers have the same amount of water. If the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers or if during the redistribution process any container would need more water than is available to reach the average, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'. **
