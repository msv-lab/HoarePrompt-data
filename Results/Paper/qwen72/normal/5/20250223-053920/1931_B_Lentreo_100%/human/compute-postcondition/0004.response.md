Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in the containers, where the length of `nums` (n) is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` in `nums` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of all elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. `n` is the length of `nums`. `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. `total % n` is equal to 0.**
