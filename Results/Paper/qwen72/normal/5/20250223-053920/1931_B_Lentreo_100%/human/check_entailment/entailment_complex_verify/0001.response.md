Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that a mean value exists.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input is handled correctly, reading multiple test cases and the water amounts for each test case.
   - The output format is correct, printing "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is `mean = total // n`.
   - The operation allows pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.
   - The critical check is whether the cumulative difference `curr` between the current amount of water and the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration. If `curr` becomes negative, it indicates that we cannot achieve the target amount of water in all containers using the allowed operations.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It calls `func_1` with the list of water amounts.
   - `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the mean.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr`.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns "NO".
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns "YES".

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the mean and checks the cumulative difference.
   - The logic ensures that if the cumulative difference is non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to redistribute the water to achieve the target amount in each container.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 1` (a single container).
   - It also handles cases where the water amounts are already equal.
   - The program ensures that the sum of water amounts is divisible by `n` before proceeding, which is a given condition in the problem.

7. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly maintained at key points.
   - The cumulative difference `curr` is correctly updated and checked.
   - The final state of `curr` being 0 is a valid condition for the program to return "YES".

Based on the above reasoning and the validation of the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be redistributed as required.

Final: **True**
