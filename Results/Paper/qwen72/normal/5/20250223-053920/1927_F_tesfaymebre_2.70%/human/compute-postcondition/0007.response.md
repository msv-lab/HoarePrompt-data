Output State: **The loop has iterated through all neighbors of `curr` in the graph. If a neighbor `nei` of `curr` has not been fully processed (`colors[nei] != 2`) and is not the parent of `curr`, the `dfs` function is called with `nei` as the new current vertex, `curr` as the new parent, and the current path `path`. If the result of the `dfs` call contains `node_v`, the loop returns this result immediately. If no such neighbor is found or none of the `dfs` calls return a path containing `node_v`, the loop completes without returning. The values of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and `colors[curr]` are now `2`.**
