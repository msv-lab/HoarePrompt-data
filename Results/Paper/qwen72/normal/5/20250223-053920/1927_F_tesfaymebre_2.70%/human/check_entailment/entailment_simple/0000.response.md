Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the graph details for each test case using the `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` functions. This is appropriate for the problem's input format.

2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`) and a list of edges (`edges`). This is a suitable representation for the problem.

3. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their weights. This is necessary to ensure that the program can find the cycle with the minimal lightest edge.

4. **Union-Find Data Structure**: The `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) class is used to manage the connected components of the graph. The `find` and `union` methods are implemented correctly to handle path compression and union by size, which is essential for efficient cycle detection.

5. **Cycle Detection**: The program attempts to detect cycles by unioning the vertices of each edge. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component), it updates the minimum edge weight and the vertices involved in the cycle. However, there is a logical issue here: the cycle detection should be based on the condition where the union operation would create a cycle, not just when the vertices are already in the same component.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**: The `dfs` function is used to find the vertices in the cycle. It marks vertices as visited and backtracks to find the cycle. However, the current implementation of the `dfs` function is flawed. It does not correctly handle the cycle detection and traversal. Specifically, the condition `if (colors[curr] == 1)` should be `if (colors[curr] == 1 and curr == node_v)`, and the function should return the cycle path when it is found.

7. **Output**: The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in the cycle. However, due to the issues in the `dfs` function, the output may not always be correct.

Given these issues, the program is not correct in its current form. The cycle detection logic in the `func_6` function and the cycle traversal logic in the `dfs` function need to be fixed.

Correctness: **False**
