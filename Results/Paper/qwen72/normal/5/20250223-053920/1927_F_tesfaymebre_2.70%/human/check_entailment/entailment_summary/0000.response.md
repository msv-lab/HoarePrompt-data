### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` are used to read integers from the input, which are used to construct the graph and edges.
   - `func_5` is not used in the main logic, so it can be ignored.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - `func_6` reads the number of vertices and edges for each test case.
   - It constructs an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges`.
   - The edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their weights.

3. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `union` method is used to merge components and update the minimum edge weight for the components.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The function `func_6` iterates over the sorted edges and uses the union-find data structure to find the minimum weight edge that connects two vertices in the same component.
   - This edge is a candidate for the lightest edge in a simple cycle.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - The `dfs` function is used to find a simple cycle that includes the lightest edge found in the previous step.
   - The function marks vertices as being processed and fully processed to avoid revisiting them.
   - If a cycle is found, it returns the path of the cycle.

6. **Output:**
   - `func_6` prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Edge Sorting:** The edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their weights, which is correct for finding the lightest edge in a cycle.
- **Union-Find Usage:** The union-find data structure is used to detect cycles and keep track of the minimum edge weight in each component.
- **Cycle Detection:** The DFS is used to find a cycle that includes the lightest edge. However, the condition `if colors[curr] == 1` is used to detect a cycle, which is not the most efficient way to detect cycles in a graph. A more common approach is to use a visited set or array to detect back edges.
- **Cycle Path:** The DFS should return the cycle path correctly, but the condition `if res and node_v in set_res` might not always work as intended. It should ensure that the cycle includes both `node_u` and `node_v` of the lightest edge.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues in the DFS cycle detection, the overall logic of the program is correct in terms of finding the lightest edge in a cycle and printing the required output. The union-find data structure and the edge sorting are correctly implemented, and the DFS should generally find a valid cycle.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program meets the problem description and should correctly find and print the required simple cycle for each test case.
