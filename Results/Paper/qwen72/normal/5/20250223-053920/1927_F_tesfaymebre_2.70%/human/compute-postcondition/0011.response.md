Output State: **The `graph` remains a defaultdict of type `list` containing the adjacency lists for each vertex. The `edges` list is still sorted in descending order based on the weight of the edges. The `DSU` class and the `colors` list remain unchanged. The `dsu` instance has updated its parent and rank information to reflect the union operations performed. The `_min_edge` variable is set to the minimum edge weight that was successfully unioned. The `node_u` and `node_v` variables are set to the vertices that were part of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully unioned.**
