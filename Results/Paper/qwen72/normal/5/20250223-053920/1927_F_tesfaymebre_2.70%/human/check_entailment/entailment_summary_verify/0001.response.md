### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m`, and then reads the edges and their weights using the `func_3` and `func_4` functions.

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, which is appropriate for an undirected graph.
   - The edges are stored in a list, and each edge is represented as a tuple `(w, u, v)` where `w` is the weight, and `u` and `v` are the vertices.

3. **Edge Sorting**:
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is a crucial step because the goal is to find a cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. By processing the edges in descending order, the program ensures that it considers the heaviest edges first, which helps in avoiding cycles with heavier edges.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU)**:
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class should have methods for `find` and `union`, and it should also keep track of the minimum edge weight in each component. However, the `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code, which is a significant issue. Without the `DSU` class, the program cannot correctly manage the connected components and track the minimum edge weight.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   - The program attempts to detect cycles by checking if the two vertices of an edge are in the same connected component before performing a union operation.
   - If a cycle is detected, it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - However, without the `DSU` class, the cycle detection logic is incomplete and incorrect.

6. **DFS for Cycle Traversal**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to traverse the graph and find the cycle.
   - The function uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each vertex (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited).
   - The function correctly appends the current vertex to the path and returns the path if a cycle is detected.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the cycle is detected and the path needs to be trimmed to only include the cycle. This is a significant issue because the output should only include the vertices that form the cycle, not the entire path.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.
   - Due to the issues in the `dfs` function, the output may include incorrect or incomplete cycles.

### Issues:
- **Missing DSU Class**: The `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical error as the program relies on the `DSU` class for union-find operations and tracking the minimum edge weight.
- **Cycle Traversal**: The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the trimming of the path to only include the cycle. It should return the path from the first repeated vertex to the current vertex to form the cycle.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the missing `DSU` class and the incorrect handling of the cycle traversal, the program is not correct.

Final: **False**
