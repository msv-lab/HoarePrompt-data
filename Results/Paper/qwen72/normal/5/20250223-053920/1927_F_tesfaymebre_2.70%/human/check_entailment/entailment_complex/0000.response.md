Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_4` handle the input correctly. `func_1` reads the number of test cases, `func_3` reads the number of vertices and edges, and `func_4` reads the edges themselves. These functions are essential for parsing the input as described in the problem.

2. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`), which is a common and efficient way to represent graphs in Python. The edges are stored in a list and sorted in non-increasing order of their weights, which is necessary for the algorithm to find the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: The `DSU` class is used to manage the union-find data structure. This is appropriate for detecting cycles in the graph and keeping track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.

4. **Cycle Detection**: The function `func_6` processes the edges in descending order of their weights. For each edge, it checks if the two vertices are already in the same component using the `DSU` class. If they are, it updates the minimum edge weight and the vertices involved. This ensures that the minimum weight edge in a cycle is found.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: The `dfs` function is used to find the cycle. It starts from one of the vertices of the minimum weight edge and performs a DFS to find a path that includes the other vertex of the minimum weight edge. This is a valid approach to find a simple cycle.

6. **Output**: The function `func_6` prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in the cycle. This matches the required output format.

7. **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_7` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_6` for each test case.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function should return the cycle path when it finds one, but it currently returns the path only if a neighbor's DFS traversal contains `node_v`. This might not always be the correct cycle path. The function should also handle the case where the cycle is found and return the cycle path directly.

- **Cycle Path Construction**: The `dfs` function should construct the cycle path correctly. Currently, it might not return the correct path if the cycle is found.

- **Edge Case Handling**: The `func_6` function should ensure that it correctly handles the case where the graph is not connected and there are multiple components. It should find a cycle in the component that contains the minimum weight edge.

Given these issues, the program is not fully correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
