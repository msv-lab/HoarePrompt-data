The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It relies on the `func_3` function to provide the necessary inputs, which are expected to be a tuple of two integers (n, m) representing the number of vertices and edges in an undirected graph, and a list of edges, each represented as a tuple (u, v, w) where u and v are the vertices connected by an edge and w is the weight of that edge. The edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their weights. The function uses an adjacency list `graph` to represent the graph and a list `colors` to track the color of nodes during a depth-first search (DFS). It also utilizes the `DSU` class to manage a union-find data structure. The function is expected to return a result based on the processing of the graph and its edges using these data structures and methods.

Functionality: **The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It uses the `func_3` function to get the number of vertices and edges in an undirected graph, and processes the graph using an adjacency list, a list of edges sorted by weight, and a union-find data structure. The function returns a result based on the graph processing.**
