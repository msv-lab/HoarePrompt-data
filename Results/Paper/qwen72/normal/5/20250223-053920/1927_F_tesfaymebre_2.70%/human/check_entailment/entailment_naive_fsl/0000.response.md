Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the identification of a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_6` function, specifically in how it processes the edges and attempts to find a cycle.

1. **Incorrect Cycle Detection and Union Logic**:
   - The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to detect cycles, but it incorrectly attempts to union nodes even when they are already in the same set. This can lead to incorrect cycle detection.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v:` should be used to detect a cycle, but the program incorrectly unions the nodes in this case, which is not the correct behavior for cycle detection.

2. **Cycle Path Construction**:
   - The `dfs` function is supposed to construct the cycle path, but it does not correctly handle the case where the cycle is detected. The function returns the path prematurely, and the path may not include all the nodes in the cycle.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of nodes during the DFS, but the logic for handling the cycle detection and path construction is flawed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the graph is not connected or where the cycle is not straightforward to detect. For example, if the graph has multiple components, the program may not correctly identify the cycle in the component with the minimum weight edge.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
1
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 1 1
```
In this case, the graph is a simple cycle with all edges having the same weight (1). The program should output:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, due to the flawed cycle detection and path construction logic, the program may not correctly identify and output this cycle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
