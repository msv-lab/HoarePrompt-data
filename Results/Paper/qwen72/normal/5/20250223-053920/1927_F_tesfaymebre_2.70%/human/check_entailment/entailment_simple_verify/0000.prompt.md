You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

The graph is represented using an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges`. The graph is undirected, and the edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their weights.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the identification of a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_6` function, specifically in how it processes the edges and attempts to find a cycle.

1. **Incorrect Cycle Detection and Union Logic**:
   - The program uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to detect cycles, but it incorrectly attempts to union nodes even when they are already in the same set. This can lead to incorrect cycle detection.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v:` should be used to detect a cycle, but the program incorrectly unions the nodes in this case, which is not the correct behavior for cycle detection.

2. **Cycle Path Construction**:
   - The `dfs` function is supposed to construct the cycle path, but it does not correctly handle the case where the cycle is detected. The function returns the path prematurely, and the path may not include all the nodes in the cycle.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of nodes during the DFS, but the logic for handling the cycle detection and path construction is flawed.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the graph is not connected or where the cycle is not straightforward to detect. For example, if the graph has multiple components, the program may not correctly identify the cycle in the component with the minimum weight edge.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
1
4 4
1 2 1
2 3 1
3 4 1
4 1 1
```
In this case, the graph is a simple cycle with all edges having the same weight (1). The program should output:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```
However, due to the flawed cycle detection and path construction logic, the program may not correctly identify and output this cycle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
