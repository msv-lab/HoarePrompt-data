The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex in the graph), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal), and `path` (a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal). The function marks the current vertex as being processed and appends it to the path. It recursively explores all unprocessed neighbors of the current vertex that are not the parent. If a neighbor's DFS traversal returns a path containing a specific node `node_v`, the function returns this path. If no such path is found, the function marks the current vertex as fully processed and returns an empty list.
