The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. After executing the function, it returns a string `decoded` where each character from `encoded` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, as mapped by `char_map`. The `unique_chars` list and `len_unique` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, based on the mapping in `char_map`.**
