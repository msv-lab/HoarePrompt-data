You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is created by replacing each character in `encoded` with the corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters of `encoded`, in reverse order. The original `encoded` string and the internal state of the function (such as `unique_chars` and `len_unique`) remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program extracts the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in a list `results` and printed one by one after all test cases are processed.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them to form the auxiliary string `r`.
  - The mapping of characters in `r` to their symmetric characters is done correctly.
  - The decoding process, which involves replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, is also implemented correctly.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
  - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly by ensuring that the mapping is consistent.

- **Performance:**
  - The program efficiently processes the input and performs the decoding in linear time relative to the length of the string, which is suitable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
