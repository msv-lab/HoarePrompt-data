You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `encoded` is mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the `unique_chars` list, in reverse order. The `unique_chars` list remains unchanged, and `len_unique` remains the same as the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded` where each character from `encoded` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, as mapped by `char_map`. The `unique_chars` list and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, based on the mapping in `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `decoded` where each character from `encoded` has been replaced by the corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` in reverse order, as mapped by `char_map`. The `unique_chars` list and `len_unique` remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
