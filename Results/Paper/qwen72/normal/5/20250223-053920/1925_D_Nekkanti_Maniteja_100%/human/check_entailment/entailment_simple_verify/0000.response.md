### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to understand why the original assessment is correct and the program is indeed incorrect.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - `n`: Number of children.
   - `m`: Number of pairs of friends.
   - `k`: Number of excursions.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, we have `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the children and their initial friendship value.

2. **Output:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Key Concepts:**
   - **Total Possible Pairs:** The total number of possible pairs of children is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - **Probability of Choosing a Friend Pair:** The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:** For each friend pair chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. The expected increase in friendship value for a friend pair chosen in the `i`-th excursion is `f_i + i`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `M = 10 ** 9 + 7`: This is the modulus value.
   - `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`: This calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is used to compute probabilities.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - `a = 0`: This variable accumulates the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
   - The loop `for i in range(m):` reads each friend pair and adds their initial friendship value to `a`.

3. **Expected Sum Calculation:**
   - `s = 0`: This variable accumulates the expected sum of friendship values over all `k` excursions.
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` updates `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each excursion.

#### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. It does not correctly represent the expected increase in friendship value.
  - The term `c * i * c * m` is supposed to represent the expected increase in friendship value for all friend pairs chosen in the `i`-th excursion, but it is not accurate.
  - The correct expected increase in friendship value for each friend pair chosen in the `i`-th excursion should be `f_i + i`.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Expected Value for Each Excursion:**
  - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the number of excursions each pair has been chosen before.
  - The expected value for the `i`-th excursion is `a + i * m * c`.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        
        s = 0
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + a + i * m * c) % M
        
        print(s % M)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions. The loop that updates `s` is incorrect, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
