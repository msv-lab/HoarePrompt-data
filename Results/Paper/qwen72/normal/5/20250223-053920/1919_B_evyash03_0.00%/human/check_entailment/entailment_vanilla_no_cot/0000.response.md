Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum penalty, but it does not follow the optimal strategy for splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The program attempts to split the string based on the balance of `+` and `-` characters. However, it only increments the `count` when the balance becomes negative, which is not the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, or zero if possible, to minimize the penalty.

2. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which does not correctly compute the penalty as defined in the problem. The penalty should be the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays multiplied by their lengths.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would involve iterating through the string and dynamically deciding the best way to split the array to minimize the penalty. One effective way is to split the array at every point where the sum of the current subarray is zero, as this will ensure that the penalty for that subarray is zero.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression))

def min_penalty(expression):
    n = len(expression)
    balance = 0
    penalty = 0
    last_balance = 0
    last_index = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if expression[i] == '+':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0:
            penalty += (i - last_index + 1) * 0  # Penalty for this subarray is 0
            last_index = i + 1
            last_balance = 0
        else:
            penalty += abs(balance - last_balance) * (i - last_index + 1)
            last_balance = balance
    
    return penalty
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum penalty by dynamically splitting the array and summing the penalties of the subarrays.
