The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If the `expression` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `expression` is a string of length `length` (where `length` is a positive integer, 1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000), and `count` and `balance` are both 0. For the loop to execute, `expression` must be a non-empty string, and `char` should be the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` is a string of length `length` (1 ≤ `length` ≤ 5000) consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", `char` is the first character of `expression`, `count` is 0, `balance` is 0**
