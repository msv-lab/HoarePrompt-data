The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and `k` values, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
