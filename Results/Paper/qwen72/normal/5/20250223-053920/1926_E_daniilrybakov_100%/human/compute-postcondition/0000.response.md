Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. The variable `t` is now an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.**
