You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the number of cards and `k` represents the position of the card to be determined, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function then performs a series of calculations to determine the final position of the card and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is printed to the console. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are reset or redefined in each iteration, and their final state is undefined after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1. `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down, and `m` keeps track of the current multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the number of cards that are `m` times an odd number.
   - It then updates `n` to `n // 2`, which effectively removes the cards that are `m` times an odd number from consideration.
   - If `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, it means the k-th card is among the cards laid down in this iteration, so the loop breaks.
   - Otherwise, it adds `x` to `s` and multiplies `m` by 2 to move to the next set of cards.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Once the loop breaks, the k-th card is calculated as `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula works because `k - s` gives the position of the card within the current set of cards (which are `m` times an odd number), and `(2 * (k - s) - 1)` gives the odd number, which is then multiplied by `m`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles larger values of `n` and `k` correctly by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems using the loop.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The loop runs in logarithmic time relative to `n` because `n` is halved in each iteration.
   - The overall complexity is efficient enough to handle the constraints given in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles the problem efficiently and correctly for the given constraints.
