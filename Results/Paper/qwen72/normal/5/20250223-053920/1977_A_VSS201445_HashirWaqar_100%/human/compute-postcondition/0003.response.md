Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `m`, where both are between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 100) and then, for each test case, it prints 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `n` and `m` for each test case are discarded. **
