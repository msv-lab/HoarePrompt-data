### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( n \) is less than \( m \), it is impossible to have \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
   - If \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \), we need to check if the difference \( n - m \) is even. This is because:
     - Adding a cube and removing a cube (or vice versa) in two consecutive moves results in no net change to the number of cubes.
     - Therefore, to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes, the number of extra moves (i.e., \( n - m \)) must be even, allowing Nikita to balance out the extra moves by adding and removing cubes in pairs.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if the difference \( n - m \) is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - The condition \( n \ge m \) ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach \( m \) cubes.
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, allowing for the possibility of balancing out the extra moves.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( n \) is exactly \( m \) (which is a valid scenario and should return "YES").
   - It also handles the case where \( n \) is less than \( m \) (which should return "NO").

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. It checks both necessary conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
