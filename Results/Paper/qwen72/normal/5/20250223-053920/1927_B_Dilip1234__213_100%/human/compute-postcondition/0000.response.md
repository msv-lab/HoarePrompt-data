Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, `s` is an empty string.** 

The variable `s` is initialized as an empty string, while the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
