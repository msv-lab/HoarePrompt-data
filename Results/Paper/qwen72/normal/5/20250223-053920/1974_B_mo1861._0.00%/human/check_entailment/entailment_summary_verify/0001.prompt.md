You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by a corresponding lowercase Latin letter based on a reverse mapping of the unique characters in `b`. The unique characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the last character in this sorted list is mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on. The original string `b` and the `char_map` dictionary remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `num_chars` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Character Mapping:**
   - The program constructs a character mapping `char_map` from the sorted set of characters in the encoded string `b`.
   - The mapping is created by associating each character in the sorted set with its symmetric character in the set. For example, if `b` contains the characters "cdefors", the mapping would be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'n'
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'
   - This is done using the `enumerate` function to get the index `i` of each character `c` in the sorted set, and then mapping it to the character at position `len(b) - i - 1` in the sorted set.

3. **Decoding:**
   - The program then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.
   - The decoded string `s` is constructed by iterating over each character in `b` and appending the mapped character to `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - The decoded string `s` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Character Mapping Length:**
  - The mapping `char_map` is created based on the length of the set of characters in `b`, not the length of the string `b` itself. This means that the symmetric mapping is based on the number of unique characters, not the total length of the string.
  - For example, if `b` is "serofedsoc", the set of characters is "cdefors" (6 unique characters), and the mapping should be:
    - 'c' -> 's'
    - 'd' -> 'r'
    - 'e' -> 'o'
    - 'f' -> 'n'
    - 'o' -> 'e'
    - 'r' -> 'd'
    - 's' -> 'c'
  - The program correctly handles this by using `len(set(b))` to determine the length of the set of unique characters.

- **Character Mapping Construction:**
  - The program correctly constructs the `char_map` by mapping each character to its symmetric character in the sorted set.
  - However, the mapping should be based on the position in the sorted set, not the position in the string `b`.

- **Decoding Process:**
  - The program correctly decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach to decoding the string based on the provided problem description. The character mapping is correctly constructed and used to decode the string.

### Correctness:
**True**
