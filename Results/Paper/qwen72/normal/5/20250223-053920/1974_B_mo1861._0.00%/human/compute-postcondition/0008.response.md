The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, and `char_map` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, while `char_map` remains unchanged.**
