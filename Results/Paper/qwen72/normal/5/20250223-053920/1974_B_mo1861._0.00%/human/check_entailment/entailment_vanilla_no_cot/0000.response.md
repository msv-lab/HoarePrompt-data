Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the construction of the `char_map` dictionary. Specifically, the mapping of characters in the string `b` to their symmetric counterparts in the sorted set of characters is incorrect. The program should map each character in the sorted set of distinct characters to its symmetric counterpart within the same set, not within the entire range of lowercase Latin letters.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create a sorted set of distinct characters in b
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    
    # Create a mapping from each character to its symmetric counterpart
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    
    # Decode the string b using the char_map
    s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
    
    return s
```

### Explanation:
1. **distinct_chars**: This is a sorted list of distinct characters in the string `b`.
2. **char_map**: This dictionary maps each character in `distinct_chars` to its symmetric counterpart. For example, if `distinct_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
3. **s**: The decoded string is constructed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

This corrected program will correctly decode the encoded string `b` to the original string `s` as per the problem description.
