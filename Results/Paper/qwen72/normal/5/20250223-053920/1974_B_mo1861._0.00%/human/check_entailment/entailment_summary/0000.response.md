Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The decoding process involves creating a mapping of characters from the encoded string `b` to their original characters. However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the mapping of characters in `char_map` is incorrect. The function maps the characters in the sorted unique set of `b` to characters starting from 'a' and going in reverse order, but this is not the correct way to decode the string.

The correct decoding process should map the characters in the sorted unique set of `b` to their symmetric counterparts in the same set, not to a fixed range starting from 'a'. For example, if the encoded string `b` is "serofedsoc", the unique characters are "cdefors", and the correct mapping should be:
- 'c' maps to 's'
- 'd' maps to 'r'
- 'e' maps to 'o'
- 'f' maps to 'n'
- 'o' maps to 'e'
- 'r' maps to 'd'
- 's' maps to 'c'

However, the current implementation maps:
- 'c' to 'z'
- 'd' to 'y'
- 'e' to 'x'
- 'f' to 'w'
- 'o' to 'v'
- 'r' to 'u'
- 's' to 't'

This incorrect mapping will not produce the original string `s` from the encoded string `b`.

Correctness: **False**
