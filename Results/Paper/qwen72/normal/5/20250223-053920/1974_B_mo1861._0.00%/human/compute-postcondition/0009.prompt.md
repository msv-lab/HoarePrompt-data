You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last character in the sorted unique characters of `b` and mapping it to 'a', then the second last to 'b', and so on. The length of `b` remains unchanged.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string where each character in `b` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, and `char_map` remains unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` where each character in `b` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, and `char_map` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, while `char_map` remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s` where each character in `b` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`, and `char_map` remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
