You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the values shown on the cubes.

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `same_value_count`, and `greater_count` will be updated and reset for each iteration of the loop. After the loop finishes, these variables will hold the values from the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Dmitry has `n` cubes, each showing a value from 1 to 100.
   - The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order of their values.
   - Dmitry's favorite cube is at index `f` (1-based index).
   - The first `k` cubes are removed after sorting.
   - We need to determine if the favorite cube will always be removed, never be removed, or may be removed depending on the sorting order.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`.
   - It reads the values of the cubes into a list `a`.
   - It finds the value of the favorite cube `favorite_value`.
   - It counts the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube `same_value_count`.
   - It counts the number of cubes that have a value greater than the favorite cube `greater_count`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `greater_count` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite cube. Therefore, the favorite cube will always be removed.
   - If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, it means there are not enough cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube to fill the first `k` positions. Therefore, the favorite cube will never be removed.
   - Otherwise, the favorite cube may or may not be removed depending on the sorting order of the cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies the three cases:
     - **YES**: The favorite cube will always be removed.
     - **NO**: The favorite cube will never be removed.
     - **MAYBE**: The favorite cube may or may not be removed.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the test case `5 2 2` with `a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`:
     - `favorite_value = 3`
     - `same_value_count = 3`
     - `greater_count = 1`
     - Since `greater_count < k` and `greater_count + same_value_count > k`, the output is `MAYBE`.
   - For the test case `5 5 3` with `a = [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]`:
     - `favorite_value = 5`
     - `same_value_count = 1`
     - `greater_count = 0`
     - Since `greater_count + same_value_count <= k`, the output is `YES`.
   - For the test case `5 5 2` with `a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`:
     - `favorite_value = 3`
     - `same_value_count = 1`
     - `greater_count = 2`
     - Since `greater_count >= k`, the output is `NO`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the favorite cube will be removed, never be removed, or may be removed. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
