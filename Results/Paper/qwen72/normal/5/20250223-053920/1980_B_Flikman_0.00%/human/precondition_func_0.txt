The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the values shown on the cubes.
