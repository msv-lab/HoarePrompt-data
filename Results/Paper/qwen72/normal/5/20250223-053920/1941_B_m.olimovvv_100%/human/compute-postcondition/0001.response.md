Output State: **For each test case, if the loop completes all iterations without encountering a negative value in `b` and the last two elements of `b` are both 0, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is modified as per the operations inside the loop.**
