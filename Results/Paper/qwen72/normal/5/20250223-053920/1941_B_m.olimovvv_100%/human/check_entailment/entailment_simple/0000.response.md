### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of elements `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the array `b` for each test case.

2. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the array `b` from the first element to the second-to-last element (excluding the last two elements).
   - For each element `b[i]`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it immediately prints "NO" and breaks out of the loop, as negative values are not allowed.
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation:
     - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which is equivalent to `b[i] = 0`)

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both zero.
   - If they are, it prints "YES".
   - If they are not, it prints "NO".

### Issues:
- **Indexing Error**: The loop iterates from `0` to `a - 2`, but `a` is the number of elements in the array, not the length of the array. The correct variable to use for the length of the array is `n`.
- **Incorrect Variable Name**: The variable `a` is used to store the number of elements in the array, but it should be `n` to match the problem description.
- **Negative Values**: The program correctly checks for negative values and breaks if any are found, which is a necessary condition to ensure the operation can be applied.
- **Final Check**: The final check for the last two elements being zero is correct, but it should be applied after the loop has completed for all valid indices.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] = 0
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the loop range and variable name.
- The corrected program correctly handles the input and performs the required operations.
- The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is a necessary condition for the array to be all zeros.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the indexing error and incorrect variable name. The corrected program would be correct.
