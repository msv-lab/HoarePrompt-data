Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it determines if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is incorrect and does not properly simulate the robot's movement.

Here are the issues:
1. **Incorrect Update of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`:**
   - The code updates `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` based on the current cell's arrow direction, but it does not correctly handle the robot's movement along the arrows.
   - For example, if the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right, it should move to the next cell in the first row and then follow the arrow in that cell. Similarly, if the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right, it should move to the next cell in the second row and then follow the arrow in that cell.

2. **Handling of Movement Along Arrows:**
   - The robot should move along the arrow in the current cell after making its initial move. The current implementation does not simulate this correctly.

3. **Termination Condition:**
   - The code does not correctly check if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows. It only checks if the robot can reach the last column in the second row, which is not sufficient.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), you need to simulate the robot's movement step by step, considering both the initial move and the subsequent move along the arrow in the current cell. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    reachable_first_row = True
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_second_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row1[j] == '>':
                        reachable_first_row = True
            if j == n - 1 and reachable_second_row:
                results.append('YES')
                break
        if not reachable_second_row:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that the robot's movement is properly simulated, and it checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows.
