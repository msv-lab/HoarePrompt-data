Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not correctly account for the robot's movement along the arrows after the initial move. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
4
4
>><<
>>><
2
><
><
4
>>><
>><<
6
>><<><
><>>><
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
YES
NO
NO
```

For the first test case, the robot should be able to reach cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. (1, 1) -> (1, 2) (initial move right)
2. (1, 2) -> (1, 3) (arrow points right)
3. (1, 3) -> (2, 3) (initial move down)
4. (2, 3) -> (2, 4) (arrow points right)

However, the program incorrectly returns "NO" for this case. The issue lies in the logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`. The program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement along the arrows after the initial move, leading to incorrect results.
