The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and q, where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the array c and the number of queries, respectively. The next line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n, where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array c. The following q lines each contain two integers l_i and r_i, where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
