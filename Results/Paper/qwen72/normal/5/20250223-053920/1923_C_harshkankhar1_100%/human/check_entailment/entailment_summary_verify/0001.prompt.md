You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an array `a` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. It processes each query, which is defined by two integers `x` and `y` representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `a`. For each query, the function prints 'NO' if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum of the subarray `b[x:y]` or if `x` is equal to `y`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the input array `a` or the number of queries `q`. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original array, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good."
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another subarray `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in the subarray of `c` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `b`.
     - No element in the subarray of `c` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray of `b`.
     - All elements in the subarray of `b` are positive.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes `q` queries.

3. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that each element `b[i]` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` is greater than 1 or not.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always positive and different from `a[i]`.

4. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of subarrays.
   - `a` is the prefix sum array of the original array `c`.
   - `b` is the prefix sum array of the constructed array `b`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is greater than or equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]`.
   - If the sum of `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i, r_i]`, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to construct a subarray `b` that meets all the conditions.
   - If `l_i == r_i`, it prints "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be "good" (since `b[i]` must be different from `c[i]` and positive).
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l_i == r_i` by printing "NO".
   - It also correctly handles the case where the sum of the subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[l_i, r_i]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints. It efficiently checks the conditions for each subarray and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
