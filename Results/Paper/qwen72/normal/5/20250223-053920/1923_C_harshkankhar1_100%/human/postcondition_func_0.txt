The function `func_1` reads an array `a` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. It processes each query, which is defined by two integers `x` and `y` representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `a`. For each query, the function prints 'NO' if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the corresponding sum of the subarray `b[x:y]` or if `x` is equal to `y`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not modify the input array `a` or the number of queries `q`. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of prefix sums of the original array, and `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where `b[0]` is 0, and for each `i` from 1 to `n`: if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is greater than 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 1`; if `a[i]` (after the prefix sum) is less than or equal to 1, `b[i]` is `b[i - 1] + 2`.
