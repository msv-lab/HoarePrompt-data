The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a series of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5. Each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
