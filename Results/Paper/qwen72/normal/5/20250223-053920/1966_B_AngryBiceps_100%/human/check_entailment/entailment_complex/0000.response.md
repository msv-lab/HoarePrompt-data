### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by checking specific conditions on the grid:
1. It reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself.
2. It constructs the `first_row` and `last_row` by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
3. It checks if the first or last row is entirely one color and different from each other.
4. It checks if the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other.
5. If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. The conditions checked by the program are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios where it might be impossible to make all squares the same color.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
WBB
BWB
BBW
```
- The first row is "WBB".
- The last row is "BBW".
- The first column is "WBB".
- The last column is "BBW".

According to the program, since none of the conditions for 'NO' are met, it will print 'YES'. However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color in this grid. The middle square (2,2) is 'W', and it is surrounded by 'B's, making it impossible to change the color of all squares to 'W' or 'B' using the given operations.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, we need to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If the grid contains both 'W' and 'B', it is always possible to make all squares the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles. If the grid contains only one color, it is already in the desired state.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning and the counterexample, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
