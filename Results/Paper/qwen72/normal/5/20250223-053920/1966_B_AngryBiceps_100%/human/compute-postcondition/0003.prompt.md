You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a list of n strings, each of length m, consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' representing the colors of the grid. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) at the beginning of the input. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and checks specific conditions to determine if the grid is valid. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if the first or last row is entirely one color and different from each other, or if the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It processes each test case and returns a result for each, with the total number of test cases indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
