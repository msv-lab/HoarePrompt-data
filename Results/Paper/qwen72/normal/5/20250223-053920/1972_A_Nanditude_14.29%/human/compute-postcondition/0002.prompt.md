You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_new_problems(a, b):` where `a` and `b` are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both `a` and `b` are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    #The program returns a sorted list in descending order. Since the variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state, and the function `min_new_problems` is expected to take two lists `a` and `b` as arguments, the provided code snippet does not use these inputs and will result in an error if `arr` is not defined elsewhere in the code.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers of the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order with elements in the range 1 to 10^9. However, the provided function definition `def func_1(arr):` does not match the intended parameters and will result in an error if `arr` is not defined elsewhere in the code. The intended functionality is not reflected in the provided code snippet.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a sorted list in descending order. Since the variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state, and the function `min_new_problems` is expected to take two lists `a` and `b` as arguments, the provided code snippet does not use these inputs and will result in an error if `arr` is not defined elsewhere in the code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
