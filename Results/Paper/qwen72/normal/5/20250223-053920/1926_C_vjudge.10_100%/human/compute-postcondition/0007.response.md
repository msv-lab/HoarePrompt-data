Output State: **`t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains the same list where each element at index `i` (for 1 â‰¤ i < 200001) is the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `value` from the input and printing the corresponding element from the `values` list. The variables `t`, `inf`, and the list `values` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged after the loop finishes executing.
