### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The function initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (200001) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all integers from 1 to `inf-1`.
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to `inf-1`, it calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and adds it to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]`. This ensures that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - The inner loop converts each integer `i` to a string and iterates over its digits, converting each digit back to an integer and summing them up. This is a correct and efficient way to calculate the sum of the digits of an integer.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function reads the integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`. This is the correct output for the problem.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(inf) time, which is feasible given the constraints (200001).
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed list, which is efficient and meets the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles the constraints efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
