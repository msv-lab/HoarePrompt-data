The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder that will be incremented for each iteration of the loop, starting from 0. The function `func` is properly defined as per the problem description, but it is not directly involved in the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
