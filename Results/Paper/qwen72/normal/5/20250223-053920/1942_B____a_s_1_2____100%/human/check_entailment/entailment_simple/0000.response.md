Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given conditions. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness step by step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The permutation `p` is initialized as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Reconstruction of Permutation**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Verification of Logic:

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the sequence.
  - By iterating in reverse order, the program ensures that it is always considering the smallest possible value for `mex` that has not been used yet.

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the largest possible value for MEX in the sequence.
  - As it iterates, it updates `mex` to the smallest value that has not been used yet, ensuring that `p[i]` is a valid permutation element.
  - The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest unused value, which is crucial for maintaining the MEX property.

- **Correctness of `p[i]` Calculation**:
  - The calculation `p[i] = mex - a[i]` is derived from the given condition `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p[i]`.
  - Rearranging this, we get `p[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a[i]`.
  - Since `mex` is the current MEX of the sequence up to `p[i]`, the calculation is correct.

- **Output Verification**:
  - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.
  - The final value of `n` and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, as they are re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop.
