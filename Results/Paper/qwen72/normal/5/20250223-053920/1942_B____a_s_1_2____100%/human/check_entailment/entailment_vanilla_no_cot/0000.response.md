Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly constructs a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the rules for calculating `MEX`. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for all elements.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the highest possible value for `MEX` in the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
- The key insight is that the `MEX` of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is always greater than or equal to `p_i` because `p_i` is part of the prefix and `MEX` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix.
- By iterating from the end to the beginning, the program ensures that the `MEX` value is correctly updated and used to construct the permutation.
- The `mex` variable keeps track of the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the permutation up to the current index.

### Example Walkthrough:
- For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]` and `n = 5`:
  - Start with `mex = 5`.
  - For `i = 4`, `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, update `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`.
  - For `i = 3`, `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, update `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`.
  - For `i = 2`, `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, update `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`.
  - For `i = 1`, `p[1] = mex - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, update `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`.
  - For `i = 0`, `p[0] = mex - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, update `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`.

The resulting permutation `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which correctly satisfies the given array `a`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a` based on the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
