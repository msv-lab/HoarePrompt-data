Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple sets of three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each set, it calculates a value based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. After processing all sets, the function does not return any value, but the last set of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the final state of these variables. The function's primary purpose is to compute and print a specific value for each set of input integers based on the given conditions. **
