Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.** 

However, the function definition provided is missing the parameters. It should be defined as:

```python
def func(n, a, b):
```

This ensures that the function can accept the required inputs and compute the maximum profit based on the given conditions.
