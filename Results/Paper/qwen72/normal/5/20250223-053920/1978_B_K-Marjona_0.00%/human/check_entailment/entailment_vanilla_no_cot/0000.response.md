Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the maximum profit. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the profit from the first `k` buns sold at a modified price is incorrect. The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` does not correctly compute the sum of the first `k` modified prices.

The correct formula to calculate the sum of the first `k` modified prices should be the sum of an arithmetic series, which is given by:

\[ \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} \]

This formula correctly sums the prices from `b` down to `b - k + 1`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            # Corrected formula for the sum of the first k modified prices
            modified_profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2
            usual_profit = (n - k) * a
            print(modified_profit + usual_profit)
```

This corrected program should now correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.
