The function `func` accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` along with a list of queries. Here's a breakdown:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers, where the elements are strictly increasing (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9).
  - `m` is an integer representing the number of queries, with the constraint 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
  - Each of the `m` queries consists of two integers, `x_i` and `y_i`, where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

The function processes these inputs and returns the results of the queries. The exact nature of the queries and their corresponding results are not specified in the provided information, but the function is expected to handle multiple test cases and return appropriate results for each query.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n`, a list of `n` strictly increasing integers `a`, and `m` queries. For each query, it returns a result based on the elements of `a` specified by the query. The function processes up to 10^4 test cases, with each test case containing up to 10^5 elements in `a` and up to 10^5 queries, ensuring the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
