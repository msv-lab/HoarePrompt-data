Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The length of the list test_cases is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: The `results` list contains the calculated number of ways to form triangles for each test case, and the `test_cases` list remains unchanged.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged, and the `test_cases` list remains unchanged. The loop has printed each element in the `results` list to the console, but the state of the variables within the program itself is not altered by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case consists of the number of sticks and a list of exponents representing the lengths of the sticks. It calculates the number of ways to form triangles using the sticks for each test case and prints these results to the console. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the `results` list to store the calculated values. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
