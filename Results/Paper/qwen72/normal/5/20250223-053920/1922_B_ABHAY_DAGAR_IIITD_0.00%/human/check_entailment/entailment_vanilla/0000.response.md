### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is a correct approach to efficiently count the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the counts of each stick length and calculates the number of ways to form triangles.
   - **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length (`cnt >= 3`):**
     - The formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length. This is the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
   - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length (`cnt >= 2`):**
     - The formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from `cnt` sticks of the same length and one stick from the previously counted sticks (`total_count`). This is the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \) multiplied by the number of previously counted sticks.
   - **Updating Total Count:**
     - The program correctly updates `total_count` with the count of the current stick length.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result of each test case to the `results` list and prints the results after processing all test cases.

### Verification with Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `7`, `1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - All sticks have the same length.
  - Number of ways to choose 3 sticks: \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \)
  - Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4`, `3 2 1 3`
  - Stick lengths: 8, 4, 2, 8
  - Possible triangles: (8, 4, 8) and (8, 2, 8)
  - Number of ways to choose 3 sticks: 2
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3`, `1 2 3`
  - Stick lengths: 2, 4, 8
  - No possible triangles can be formed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1`, `1`
  - Only one stick.
  - No possible triangles can be formed.
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the stick lengths, and calculates the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles. The logic and formulas used are correct and match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
