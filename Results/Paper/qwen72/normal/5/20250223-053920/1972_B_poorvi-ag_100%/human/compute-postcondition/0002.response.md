The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0 (which is the default behavior of `range(t)`).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
