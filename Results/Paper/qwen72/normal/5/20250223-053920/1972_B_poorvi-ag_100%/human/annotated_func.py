#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the same input integer, `results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` was odd or even, respectively.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the `results` list, which contains 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` was odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". It then checks if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd. If it is, the function appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in the results list, which contains 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the condition. The function does not return any value.
