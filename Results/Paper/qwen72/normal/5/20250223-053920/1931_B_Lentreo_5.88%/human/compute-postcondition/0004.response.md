Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9`. The function then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` are no longer accessible as they are local to the function. **
