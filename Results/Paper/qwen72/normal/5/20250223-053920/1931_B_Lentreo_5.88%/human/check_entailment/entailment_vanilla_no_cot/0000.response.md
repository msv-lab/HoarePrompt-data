Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the difference between the last element and the sum of differences of all elements, which is not a valid criterion to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal by pouring water from any container to any container with a higher index. The key observation is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, and if the water can be redistributed such that all containers have the same amount of water, then the operation can be performed to achieve this.

Here is a correct approach:

1. Calculate the average amount of water each container should have after redistribution.
2. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have this average amount.

The correct program should look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        avg = sum(nums) // n
        # Check if the number of containers with water less than the average
        # is less than or equal to the number of containers with water more than the average
        if sum(1 for x in nums if x < avg) <= sum(1 for x in nums if x > avg):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This program correctly checks if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water by ensuring that the number of containers with less water than the average is less than or equal to the number of containers with more water than the average. This is a necessary and sufficient condition for the operation to be possible.
