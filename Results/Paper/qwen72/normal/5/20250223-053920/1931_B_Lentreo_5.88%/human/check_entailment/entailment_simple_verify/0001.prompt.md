You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers (nums). It then calculates the difference between each non-zero element in nums and the last element in nums, accumulating these differences in curr. If curr is 0 after the inner loop, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The values of t, n, and a remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, then the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a) / n`.
   - The operation allows us to move water from any container to any container to the right of it.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that we can always move water from containers with more than the target amount to containers with less than the target amount.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - It then calculates `last` as the amount of water in the last container.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through the list `nums`.
   - For each container `i`, it adds `i - last` to `curr` if `i` is not zero.
   - Finally, it checks if `curr` is zero. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program calculates `last` as the amount of water in the last container and uses it to compute `curr`.
   - This approach is incorrect because the target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) / n`, not the amount in the last container.
   - The program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from left to right.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the target amount of water in each container as `target = sum(nums) / n`.
   - Check if it is possible to make all containers have `target` amount of water by ensuring that the total excess water (sum of amounts greater than `target`) can be moved to the total deficit water (sum of amounts less than `target`).

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it uses an incorrect method to determine if the containers can be made to have the same amount of water. The target amount should be calculated as the average of the amounts in the containers, and the program should check if the total excess can be moved to the total deficit.
