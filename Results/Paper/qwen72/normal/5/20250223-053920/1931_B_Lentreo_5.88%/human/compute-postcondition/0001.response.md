The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n` and `a` do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they are part of the initial conditions.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is the loop variable that will start from 0 and increment up to `t-1`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
