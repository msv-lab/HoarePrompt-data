Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the difference between the last element and the other elements, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of equalizing the water levels.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
2
3
1 2 3
4
1 2 2 3
```

For the first test case:
- `nums = [1, 2, 3]`
- The last element is `3`.
- The program will calculate `curr` as `1 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 3 - 3 = -3`, which is not zero.
- The program will output `NO`, which is incorrect because it is possible to equalize the water levels by pouring 1 unit from the third container to the first container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2]`.

For the second test case:
- `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3]`
- The last element is `3`.
- The program will calculate `curr` as `1 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 2 - 3 + 3 - 3 = -4`, which is not zero.
- The program will output `NO`, which is incorrect because it is possible to equalize the water levels by pouring 1 unit from the fourth container to the first container, resulting in `[2, 2, 2, 2]`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for these test cases.
