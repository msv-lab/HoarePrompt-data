Output State: **The function `func_2` now has access to the input from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) represents the number of test cases. The variable `data` is a list of strings, where each string is an element from the input split by spaces. The variable `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element in `data`. The variable `index` is assigned the value 1. The variable `results` is an empty list.**
