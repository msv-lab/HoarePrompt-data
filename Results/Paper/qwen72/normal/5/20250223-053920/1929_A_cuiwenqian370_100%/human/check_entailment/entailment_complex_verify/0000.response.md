Reasoning: 

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. The issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`, which calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. This approach is flawed because the problem requires the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, without taking the absolute value. 

To maximize the beauty of the array, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be maximized when the elements are in descending order, as the larger elements will be subtracted from the smaller ones, leading to the largest possible positive differences.

However, the current implementation sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the absolute differences, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty. The absolute differences will always be non-negative, but they do not account for the requirement to maximize the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` without the absolute value.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 4`, `array = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
- Expected Output: `1` ( achievable by the arrangement `[4, 3, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 3, 4]` )
- Actual Output: `3` (achieved by the sorted array `[3, 3, 3, 4]`)

In this case, the correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences:
- Sorted array in descending order: `[4, 3, 3, 3]`
- Beauty calculation: `(3 - 4) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1`
- Since we are looking for the maximum beauty, we should consider the positive differences: `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

The program's approach of sorting in ascending order and using absolute differences does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})`.

Final: **False**
