Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as it was initially, representing the number of test cases. The variable `index` is now equal to the length of the `data` list, as it has been incremented by the total number of elements processed in all test cases. The variable `results` is now a list containing the results of calling `func_1` on each array from the test cases. The variable `data` remains unchanged.
