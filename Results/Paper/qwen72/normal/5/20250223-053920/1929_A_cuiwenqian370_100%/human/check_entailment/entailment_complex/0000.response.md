Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Input**: A list of integers `array` such that \(2 \leq \text{len(array)} \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq \text{array}[i] \leq 10^9\).
- **Processing**:
  - The array is sorted.
  - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Output**: The beauty of the sorted array.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly computes the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and then summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is the optimal approach to maximize the beauty.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input**: Multiple test cases read from `sys.stdin`.
- **Processing**:
  - The first integer `t` is read, representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - The length `n` of the array is read.
    - The array itself is read and converted to a list of integers.
    - `func_1` is called to compute the maximum beauty of the array.
    - The result is appended to the `results` list.
- **Output**: The results for each test case are printed one by one.
- **Correctness**: The function correctly reads the input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. The logic for handling multiple test cases and the input format is correct.

### Overall Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem for each test case.
- The sorting and difference calculation in `func_1` are appropriate and optimal for maximizing the beauty of the array.
- The input and output handling in `func_2` are correct and follow the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
