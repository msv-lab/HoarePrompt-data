You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, this approach is incorrect because sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by arranging the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then rearrange it such that the largest and smallest elements alternate.
   - For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\), we should rearrange it to \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, \ldots]\).
   - This way, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.

4. **Analyzing Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of each array.
   - It correctly calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1(array)` is incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because `func_1(array)` does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Function 1:
To correct the program, we need to modify `func_1(array)` to rearrange the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    rearranged = []
    for i in range(len(array) // 2):
        rearranged.append(array[i])
        rearranged.append(array[-(i + 1)])
    if len(array) % 2 == 1:
        rearranged.append(array[len(array) // 2])
    
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(rearranged)):
        beauty += abs(rearranged[i] - rearranged[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    rearranged = []
    for i in range(len(array) // 2):
        rearranged.append(array[i])
        rearranged.append(array[-(i + 1)])
    if len(array) % 2 == 1:
        rearranged.append(array[len(array) // 2])
    
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(rearranged)):
        beauty += abs(rearranged[i] - rearranged[i - 1])
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected program will now correctly maximize the beauty of the array for each test case.
