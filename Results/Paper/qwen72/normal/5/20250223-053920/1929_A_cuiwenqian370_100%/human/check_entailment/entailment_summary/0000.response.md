### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The array elements can be rearranged in any way to maximize this beauty.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. Sorting the array and summing the differences will not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from `sys.stdin`, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
   - The input and output handling is correct and matches the problem description.

4. **Correct Calculation of Maximum Beauty:**
   - To maximize the beauty \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\), the optimal strategy is to sort the array in descending order. This way, the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) will be negative, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.
   - The correct approach should be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order and calculates the sum of absolute differences, which does not match the problem's requirement.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
