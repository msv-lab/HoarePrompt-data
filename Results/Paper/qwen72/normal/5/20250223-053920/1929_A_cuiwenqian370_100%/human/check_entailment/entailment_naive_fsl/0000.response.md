Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. However, the problem requires the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`, without taking the absolute value. This means the program will not produce the correct output for arrays where the maximum beauty is achieved by a different arrangement that does not necessarily sort the array in ascending order.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input: `n = 3`, `array = [2, 1, 3]`
- Expected Output: `2` ( achievable by the arrangement `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]` )
- Actual Output: `2` (achieved by the sorted array `[1, 2, 3]`)

While the output is correct for this specific case, the program will fail for other cases where the maximum beauty is not achieved by sorting the array. For example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `array = [3, 4, 3, 3]`
- Expected Output: `1` ( achievable by the arrangement `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[3, 3, 4, 3]` )
- Actual Output: `3` (achieved by the sorted array `[3, 3, 3, 4]`)

The program does not handle the requirement to maximize the beauty correctly, as it assumes sorting the array will always yield the maximum beauty, which is not true in all cases.
