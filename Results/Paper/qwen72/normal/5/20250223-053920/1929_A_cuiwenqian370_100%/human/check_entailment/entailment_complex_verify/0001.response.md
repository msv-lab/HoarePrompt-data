### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the "beauty" of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by arranging the array in an alternating pattern of the largest and smallest elements.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to sort the array and then rearrange it such that the largest and smallest elements alternate.
   - For example, if the sorted array is \([a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]\), we should rearrange it to \([a_1, a_n, a_2, a_{n-1}, \ldots]\).
   - This way, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized, leading to the maximum beauty.

4. **Analyzing Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of each array.
   - It correctly calls `func_1(array)` to calculate the beauty for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1(array)` is incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because `func_1(array)` does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array.
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in `func_1` and providing a correct approach to maximize the beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified the flaw in the program and provided a corrected version of `func_1` that would maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.
