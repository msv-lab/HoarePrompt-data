The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from `sys.stdin`, which is expected to contain a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array. The first integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) represents the number of test cases. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input array for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from `sys.stdin`. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
