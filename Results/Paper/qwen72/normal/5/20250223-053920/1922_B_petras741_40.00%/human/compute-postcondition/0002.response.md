The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and `buffer` is an empty list, which is not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
