Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where there are two consecutive thorns correctly. The logic in the program breaks when it encounters two thorns in a row, but it does not account for the possibility of moving two cells at once to skip over thorns. This can lead to incorrect results.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
10
.@@*.*@.@@

Expected Output:
3

Actual Output:
1
```

In this case, the program will stop after encountering the second thorn, missing the coins that can be collected by moving two cells at once. The correct approach would be to consider both one-cell and two-cell moves to maximize the number of coins collected.
