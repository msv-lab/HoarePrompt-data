The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of `n` characters representing a path. The string consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of each path is guaranteed to be empty ('.').

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. For each test case, the result is the number of coins collected while traversing the path from the first cell to the last cell, avoiding thorns.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string representing a path. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of coins collected for the corresponding path, avoiding thorns.**
