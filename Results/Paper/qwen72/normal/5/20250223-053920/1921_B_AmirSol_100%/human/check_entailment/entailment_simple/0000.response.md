Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to an empty box.
2. Removing a cat from a box.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The key insight is that the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state is the maximum of these two values. This is because:
- If `cats_to_add` is greater than `cats_to_remove`, the limiting factor is the number of cats that need to be added, as each addition requires a separate operation.
- If `cats_to_remove` is greater than `cats_to_add`, the limiting factor is the number of cats that need to be removed, as each removal also requires a separate operation.
- If `cats_to_add` is equal to `cats_to_remove`, the operations can be balanced by moving cats where necessary, but the total number of operations will still be the same as the maximum of the two values.

The function correctly computes the number of cats to add and remove, and returns the maximum of these two values, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
