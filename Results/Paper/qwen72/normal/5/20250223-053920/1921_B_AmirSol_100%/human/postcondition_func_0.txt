The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. It returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1' (referred to as `cats_to_add`) and the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0' (referred to as `cats_to_remove`). After the function concludes, the input parameters `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged, and the function returns an integer representing the maximum of these two counts.
