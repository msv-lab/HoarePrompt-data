The only variables in the loop head are `y`, `x`, and the range parameters. The loop will execute if the starting value of the range (`x - 1`) is greater than the ending value (`1`). This means `x - 1` must be greater than `1`, or equivalently, `x` must be greater than `2`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000
- `max_val` is 1

For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 2. Since `max_val` is not involved in the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 3 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is 1, `y` is `x - 1`**
