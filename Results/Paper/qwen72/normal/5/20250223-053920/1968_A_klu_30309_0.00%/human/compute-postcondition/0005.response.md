The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns the largest integer divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. However, if there is a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x, the function returns that divisor `y` instead.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest integer divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If there is a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x, it returns `y`.**
