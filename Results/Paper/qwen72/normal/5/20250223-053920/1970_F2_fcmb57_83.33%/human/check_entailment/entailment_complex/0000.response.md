Reasoning:  
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The function `func_1` is defined to take two parameters `a` and `b`, where `a` is expected to be a tuple representing the current position of an entity, and `b` is a tuple representing the movement direction. However, when the function is called, it is passed a tuple for `a` (which is correct) and a tuple from the `mouvements` dictionary for `b` (which is also correct). The function itself, however, incorrectly treats `b` as a tuple of integers, which it is, but it does not correctly handle the movement logic. The function should return the new position after applying the movement, but it currently does not handle the boundaries of the field, which could lead to out-of-bounds errors.

2. **Catching the Quaffle**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who catches the Quaffle.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is flawed. The program checks if the player is in a goal and then increments the score accordingly. However, it does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. The program should increment the score of the opposing team in such cases.

4. **Bludger Elimination**: The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated by a Bludger and prints the elimination message. However, it does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. The Quaffle should remain on the cell where the player was eliminated, but the program does not ensure this.

5. **Final Score Printing**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end, but it does not handle the case where multiple players are eliminated at the same time, and the elimination messages should be printed in alphabetical order.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

Correctness: **False**
