Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t` which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and a list `cases` where each element is a tuple containing four elements: `n` (an integer representing the number of items), `k` (an integer representing a threshold value), `a` (a list of integers representing values), and `x` (a list of integers representing positions). The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided parameters. If `t` is out of the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4), or any of the `n`, `k`, `a`, or `x` values within the tuples do not meet their respective constraints, the function's behavior is undefined.**
