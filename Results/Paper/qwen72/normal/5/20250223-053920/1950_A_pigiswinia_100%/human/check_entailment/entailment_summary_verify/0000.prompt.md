You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` takes no parameters and reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) from the input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and the only effect is the output of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by checking the conditions for a stair and a peak, and prints the appropriate output for each case. The conditions `a < b < c` for a stair and `a < b > c` for a peak are correctly implemented, and the program outputs "NONE" for any other combination of digits. No edge cases or missing logic have been identified that would cause the program to fail.
