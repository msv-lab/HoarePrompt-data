Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no parameters and reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) from the input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained, and the only effect is the output of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each test case. **
