The only object in the loop head is `s`, and the expression `[*open(0)]` is used to read lines from standard input. For the loop to execute, the list created by `[*open(0)]` must have at least one element, and the loop will start with the second element (since the loop starts from index 1).

Given the initial state:
- The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required, and both are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
- The function should return a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9, that satisfies the conditions, or -1 if no such array exists.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `[*open(0)]` has at least two elements. The first element is typically the input specifying `n` and `k`, and the subsequent elements are the lines of data to be processed.

State: **`[*open(0)]` must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the second element in the list `[*open(0)]`**
