Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by considering different cases based on the values of `n` and `k`:

1. **Case 1: `k >= 2`**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints an array where all elements are equal to `k`. This is correct because if all elements are the same, every cyclic shift of the array will be sorted, and there will be exactly `n` (which is equal to `k`) sorted cyclic shifts.
   - If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`. This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays with `k` sorted cyclic shifts even if `n != k`. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 1, 2]` and `[2, 1, 2, 1]`.

2. **Case 2: `k < 2`**
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints an array of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself.
   - If `k == 0`, the program also prints an array of integers from 1 to `n`. This is incorrect because an array with `k == 0` should have no sorted cyclic shifts, but the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` is sorted and thus has one sorted cyclic shift.

### Issues:
- The program incorrectly handles the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k`. It should not print `-1` in this case.
- The program incorrectly handles the case where `k == 0`. It should print `-1` because no array can have zero sorted cyclic shifts.

### Corrected Program:
To correct the program, we need to handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` more carefully, and ensure that `k == 0` is handled correctly.

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k == 0:
            print('-1')
        elif k == 1:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        elif k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            elif n > k:
                # Construct an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
                print(*[1 for _ in range(n - k + 1)] + [2 for _ in range(k - 1)])
            else:
                print('-1')
```

### Explanation:
- **Case `k == 0`**: Print `-1` because no array can have zero sorted cyclic shifts.
- **Case `k == 1`**: Print the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
- **Case `k >= 2`**:
  - If `n == k`, print an array where all elements are equal to `k`.
  - If `n > k`, construct an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts by having a sequence of `1`s followed by a sequence of `2`s. This ensures that there are exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
  - If `n < k`, print `-1` because it is impossible to have more sorted cyclic shifts than the length of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
