Output State: The loop reads input from the file, processes each line to determine the values of n and k, and prints the output based on the conditions specified. For each line of input, if k is greater than or equal to 2 and n equals k, it prints n integers each equal to k. If k is greater than or equal to 2 and n does not equal k, it prints '-1'. If k is less than 2, it prints n integers in ascending order from 1 to n. The loop continues until all lines in the file are processed. The final output state will be the printed results for each line of input, adhering to the conditions described.
