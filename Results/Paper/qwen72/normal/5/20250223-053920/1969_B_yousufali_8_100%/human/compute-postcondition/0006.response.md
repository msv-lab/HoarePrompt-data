The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided information, it seems to operate on a binary string `s` and an integer `n` initialized to 0. The function returns a value based on the manipulation of `s` and `n`.

Since the exact output based on the input is not provided, we can only infer the general functionality from the given constraints. The function likely processes the binary string `s` in some way, possibly counting the number of '0's or '1's, or performing some other operation that involves the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function processes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` initialized to 0, and returns a value based on the manipulation of `s` and `n`.**
