The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `start` and `end`. Both `start` and `end` are integers, and they represent the range of folder names to be considered, where folder names are numeric. The parameter `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function returns a list of folder names as integers, starting from `start` and ending at `end` (inclusive).

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `start` and `end`, both integers where `start` <= `end`. It returns a list of integers representing folder names from `start` to `end` (inclusive).**
