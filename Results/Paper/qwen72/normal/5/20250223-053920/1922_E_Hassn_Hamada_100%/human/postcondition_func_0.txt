The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` by appending integers to it and recursively calls itself until `number` is reduced to a value that no longer satisfies the condition for further processing. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0) regardless of the input. The final state of the program is that `number` is reduced, and `sequence` contains additional integers that were appended during the function's execution.
