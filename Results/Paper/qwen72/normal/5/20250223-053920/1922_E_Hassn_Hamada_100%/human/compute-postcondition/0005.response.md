The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the `sequence` list, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if `max(sequence, default=0)` is greater than or equal to 0, because the loop starts from the maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) and decrements `i` until it reaches -1, which means the loop will run at least once if the starting value is 0 or greater.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18 (this is not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted).
- `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200.
- `size_overlap` is a tuple (0, 0) (this is not in the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted).

To ensure the loop executes, `sequence` must have at least one integer greater than or equal to 0, or it can be empty, in which case the loop will start from 0. The variable `i` should be set to the maximum value in `sequence` or 0 if `sequence` is empty.

State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with a length at most 200 that must have at least one integer greater than or equal to 0 or be empty, `size_overlap` is a tuple (0, 0), `i` is set to `max(sequence, default=0)`**
