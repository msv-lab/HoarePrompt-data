You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program: 
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Annotated Code: 
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the positive integer `n`, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the first line of input should contain the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line should contain a single integer `n` for each test case. The program, however, reads a single integer `N` and then iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` and summing the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. This means the program will only handle a single test case and will not reset the sum `soma` for each test case, leading to incorrect results for multiple test cases. Additionally, the function `func_1` should be applied to the range `1` to `n` (inclusive) rather than `0` to `n-1` (inclusive) to match the problem description.
