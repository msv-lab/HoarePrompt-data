### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because it's impossible to perform any exchange operations if `k` is greater than the number of cards `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` and caps it at `k`. This is done to ensure that the frequency of any card number does not exceed `k`, which is a valid operation since you can only exchange up to `k` cards at a time.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - After calculating the frequency, the program checks if any card number has a frequency of exactly `k`.
   - If a card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, the program prints `k - 1` because you can exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` new cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`, the program prints `n`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output Logic:**
  - The program prints `n` if no card number has a frequency of exactly `k`. This is incorrect because the goal is to minimize the number of cards left, and the program should consider the possibility of performing multiple operations to reduce the number of cards.
  - The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible operations, which is not done in the current logic.

### Correct Approach:
- **Calculate the Minimum Number of Cards:**
  - For each card number, determine the number of operations you can perform by dividing the frequency of that card by `k`.
  - After performing the operations, the remaining cards for that number will be the frequency modulo `k`.
  - Sum the remaining cards for all card numbers to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
