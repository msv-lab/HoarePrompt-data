You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100. Each integer in arr satisfies 1 <= arr[i] <= 100.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns the `frequency_table` dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is in the logic of the `func_1` function and the main loop where the minimum number of cards is calculated.

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   5 3
   4 1 1 4 4
   ```
   **Expected Output:** `2`
   **Actual Output:** `5`

   **Explanation:**
   - The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
   - The `func_1` function limits the frequency of any number to `k`, which is incorrect. The frequency should be allowed to exceed `k` to properly simulate the exchange operations.
   - The main loop incorrectly checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k - 1` if it is, which does not follow the problem description.

2. **Input:**
   ```
   1
   10 4
   1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
   ```
   **Expected Output:** `3`
   **Actual Output:** `10`

   **Explanation:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where all cards have the same number.
   - The `func_1` function limits the frequency to `k`, which is incorrect.
   - The main loop does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. For each frequency, calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing the exchange operations.
3. Sum the minimum number of cards left for all card numbers to get the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums)
        min_cards_left = sum((f % k + (1 if f % k != 0 else 0)) for f in freq.values())
        print(min_cards_left)

def func_1(arr):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

This corrected version correctly handles all potential cases and follows the problem description.
