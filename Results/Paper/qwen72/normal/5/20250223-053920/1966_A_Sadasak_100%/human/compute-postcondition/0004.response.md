The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `k`. `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 100, inclusive, and each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 100, inclusive. `k` is an integer between 2 and 100, inclusive. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`. The values of `arr` and `k` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value for each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k`.**
