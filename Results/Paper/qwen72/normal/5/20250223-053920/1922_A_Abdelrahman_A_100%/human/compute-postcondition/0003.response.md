The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.
