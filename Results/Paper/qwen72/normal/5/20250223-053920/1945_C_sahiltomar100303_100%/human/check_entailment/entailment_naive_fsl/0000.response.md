Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal position for laying the road is not necessarily the closest to the middle of the village. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
01010
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `0` or `5` because laying the road before the first house or after the last house ensures that all residents are satisfied, and these positions are also valid according to the problem description. The program incorrectly focuses on the middle of the village without considering other valid positions that might be more optimal.
