Output State: **`t` remains a non-negative integer representing the current time step in the game. `player` is a dictionary where the keys are strings representing the players, and the values are lists of two integers. For any player `p` whose coordinates matched the Bludger's coordinates (`blud`), the coordinates of that player are now `[-1, -1]`. The `out` list contains the keys (player identifiers) of all players whose coordinates matched the Bludger's coordinates.**
