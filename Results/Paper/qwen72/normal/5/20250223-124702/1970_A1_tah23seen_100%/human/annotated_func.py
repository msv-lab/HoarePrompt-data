#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `d[n]` is 0, `ans` is an empty string, and `d` contains the depth of the parentheses at each position, starting from 0 and ending at 0.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string containing the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the keys in `d`, sorted by the depth of parentheses in ascending order and then by the negative of the positions in ascending order. The dictionary `d` remains a sorted list of tuples.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans`, which contains the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the keys in `d`, sorted by the depth of parentheses in ascending order and then by the negative of the positions in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged such that the parentheses are sorted by their depth in ascending order. If two characters have the same depth, they are sorted by their original position in descending order. The function ensures that the returned string `ans` maintains the balanced nature of the parentheses sequence.
