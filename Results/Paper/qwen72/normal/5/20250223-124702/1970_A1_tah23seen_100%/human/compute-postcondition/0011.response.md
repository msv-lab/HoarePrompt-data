The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` at the positions specified by the keys in `d`, sorted first by the depth of the parentheses in ascending order, and then by the negative of the positions in ascending order.
