Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` rearranged such that the parentheses are sorted by their depth in ascending order. If two characters have the same depth, they are sorted by their original position in descending order. The function ensures that the returned string `ans` maintains the balanced nature of the parentheses sequence. **
