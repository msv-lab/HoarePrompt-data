Output State: **The function processes each test case by modifying a list `nums` and printing the length of `nums` followed by the elements in `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `n`, `k`, and `nums` will have been used and modified for each test case, but the final state of these variables will be the state after the last test case has been processed. The list `nums` will contain four elements: the original powers of 2 up to 2^23, plus the three new elements added in the last test case, and minus the element that was removed. The length of `nums` will be 26 for the last test case. The specific values of `n`, `k`, and `nums` will depend on the input for the last test case.**
