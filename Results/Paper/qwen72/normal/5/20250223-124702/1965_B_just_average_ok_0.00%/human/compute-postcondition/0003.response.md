Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n). For each test case, it modifies a list `nums` that initially contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^23. It then adds three new elements to `nums` and removes one element, and prints the length of `nums` followed by the elements in `nums`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the final state of `nums` will be modified based on the last test case, and the output will reflect the results for each test case. **
