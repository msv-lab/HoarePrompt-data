You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases and the arrays of integers, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [arr] [prefix] (where `arr` is a list of integers and `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0, and the length of `prefix` is `n + 1` where `n` is the length of `arr`)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]

        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[1, 0]`. `suf` remains a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros.

    #State: Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist is `[1, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1. Specifically, `suf[j][1]` is the count of 1s at bit position `j`, and `suf[j][0]` is the count of 0s at bit position `j`.
    print(pre)

    #State: Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1. Specifically, `pre[j][1]` is the count of 1s at bit position `j`, and `pre[j][0]` is the count of 0s at bit position `j`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1, but all counts are zero. `ans` is the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position across all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position across all elements in arr from index 0 to n-1)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case.
