Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases and the arrays of integers, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #This is printed: [arr] [prefix] (where `arr` is a list of integers and `prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0, and the length of `prefix` is `n + 1` where `n` is the length of `arr`)

Specifically, `suf[j][1]` is the count of 1s at bit position `j`, and `suf[j][0]` is the count of 0s at bit position `j`.
    print(pre)

    #State: Output State: `prefix` remains unchanged. `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1. Specifically, `pre[j][1]` is the count of 1s at bit position `j`, and `pre[j][0]` is the count of 0s at bit position `j`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, where each sublist contains the counts of 1s and 0s at the corresponding bit position across all elements in `prefix` from index `n` to 1, but all counts are zero. `ans` is the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position across all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `n-1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position across all elements in arr from index 0 to n-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from user input. It then computes a prefix XOR list `prefix` of length `n + 1`, where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0. The function initializes two lists `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists, to count the occurrences of 1s and 0s at each bit position across the elements in `prefix`. After processing the counts, the function calculates a result `ans` based on the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position. Finally, the function prints the original list `arr`, the prefix XOR list `prefix`, the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, and the result `ans`. The function does not return any value.
