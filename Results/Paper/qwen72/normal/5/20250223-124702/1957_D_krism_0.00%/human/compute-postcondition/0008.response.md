Output State: **`prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `suf` with 32 sublists, each containing two zeros. This does not change the values of `prefix`, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`, or `pre`. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain valid, and the only change is the creation of the `suf` list.
