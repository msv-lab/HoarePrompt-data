You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from user input. It then computes a prefix XOR list `prefix` of length `n + 1`, where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0. The function initializes two lists `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists, to count the occurrences of 1s and 0s at each bit position across the elements in `prefix`. After processing the counts, the function calculates a result `ans` based on the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position. Finally, the function prints the original list `arr`, the prefix XOR list `prefix`, the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, and the result `ans`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`.
   - This is done using the line `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])`.

3. **Initialization of `pre` and `suf` Arrays:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to keep track of the number of prefix and suffix values that have a particular bit set or not set.
   - The `pre` array is initialized with `pre[i][0] += 1` for all bits, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to count the number of prefix values with each bit set or not set.

4. **Suffix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program iterates from `n` to `1` to calculate the suffix XOR values and update the `suf` array.
   - This part is also incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of suffix values with each bit set or not set.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` by iterating over the array and using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - The logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The condition `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)` is not correctly checked using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.

6. **Bitwise XOR and Bit Counting:**
   - The program uses bitwise operations to check the bits of the current prefix and suffix values.
   - However, the way it updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays and uses them to count valid tuples is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program has several issues:
- The initialization of the `pre` array is incorrect.
- The suffix XOR calculation and updating the `suf` array are not done correctly.
- The logic for counting valid tuples does not correctly implement the condition `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly initialize and update the `pre` and `suf` arrays and properly check the condition for valid tuples. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1):
            for k in range(j, n + 1):
                f_x_y = prefix[j] ^ prefix[i - 1]
                f_y_z = prefix[k + 1] ^ prefix[j]
                f_x_z = prefix[k + 1] ^ prefix[i - 1]
                if f_x_y ^ f_y_z > f_x_z:
                    ans += 1
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible tuples `(x, y, z)` and checks the condition directly, which is more straightforward but less efficient. For a more efficient solution, the `pre` and `suf` arrays should be used correctly to count the number of valid tuples without nested loops.
