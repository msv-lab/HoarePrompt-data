#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases and the arrays of integers, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from user input. It then computes a prefix XOR list `prefix` of length `n + 1`, where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that index, starting with 0. The function initializes two lists `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists, to count the occurrences of 1s and 0s at each bit position across the elements in `prefix`. After processing the counts, the function calculates a result `ans` based on the products of the counts of 1s and 0s at each bit position. Finally, the function prints the original list `arr`, the prefix XOR list `prefix`, the updated `pre` and `suf` lists, and the result `ans`. The function does not return any value.
