Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of new problems needed to make the difficulty of each problem in the contest (`a_i`) less than or equal to the expected difficulty (`b_i`). The program reads multiple test cases, processes each case, and outputs the required number of new problems.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the list of current problem difficulties `a`, and the list of expected problem difficulties `b`.

2. **Logic for Inserting and Removing Problems:**
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through both lists `a` and `b` simultaneously.
   - If `b[j]` (expected difficulty) is less than `a[i]` (current difficulty), it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced.
   - The program then removes the last element from `a` (the most difficult problem) and inserts `b[j]` at the correct position to maintain the non-decreasing order of `a`.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - If `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`, both indices `i` and `j` are incremented to move to the next problem.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the number of new problems needed.

### Potential Issues:
- **Insertion and Sorting:**
  - The program uses `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` to insert `b[j]` into `a` at the correct position. This approach is correct for maintaining the non-decreasing order of `a`.
  - However, the program does not explicitly sort `a` after each insertion, but the insertion method ensures that the list remains sorted.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the number of problems `n` is 1 correctly.
  - It also handles cases where the difficulties in `a` and `b` are already in the correct order without needing any new problems.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program. It sorts a list in non-increasing order, which is not relevant to the problem. This function can be ignored as it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of new problems needed to make `a_i` less than or equal to `b_i` for all `i`. The insertion and removal operations are performed correctly, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
