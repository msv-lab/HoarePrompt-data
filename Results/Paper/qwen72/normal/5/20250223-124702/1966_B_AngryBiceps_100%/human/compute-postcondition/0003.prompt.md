You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, and a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed. The initial state of the function remains unchanged, and the function is ready to accept new test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each, though the specific nature of the result is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
