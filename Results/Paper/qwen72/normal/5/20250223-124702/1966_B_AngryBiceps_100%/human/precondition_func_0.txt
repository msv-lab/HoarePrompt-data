The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, and a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters 'W' and 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
