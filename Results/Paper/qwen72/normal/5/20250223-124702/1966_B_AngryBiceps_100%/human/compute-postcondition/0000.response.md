The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is being iterated over a range determined by the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is 0, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
