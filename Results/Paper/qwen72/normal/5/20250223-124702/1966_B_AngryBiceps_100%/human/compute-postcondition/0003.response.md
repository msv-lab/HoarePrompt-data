Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented by two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are either entirely one color and different from each other, or if the first column and the last column of the grid are entirely one color and different from each other. If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the program state is reset for each new test case, with no lasting changes to the initial state. **
