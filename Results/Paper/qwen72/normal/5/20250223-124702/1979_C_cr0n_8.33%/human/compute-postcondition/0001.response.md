The code snippet `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `k` is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from input.**
