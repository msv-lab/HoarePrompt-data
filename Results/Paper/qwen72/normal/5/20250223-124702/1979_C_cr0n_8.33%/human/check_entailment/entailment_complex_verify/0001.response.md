### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)`, and for each outcome `i`, `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)` must hold.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then calculates `vprod` as `prod // k_i` for each outcome.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome `k_i * x_i`.
   - By setting `x_i = prod // k_i`, the total bet is `sum(prod // k_i)`.
   - The condition `k_i * (prod // k_i) > sum(prod // k_i)` must hold for all `i`.
   - Simplifying, we get `prod > sum(prod // k_i)`, which is checked by the `den` variable.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` are the same, `prod` will be `k_i^n` and `sum(prod // k_i)` will be `n * (k_i^(n-1))`.
   - For `k_i = 2`, `prod = 2^n` and `sum(prod // k_i) = n * (2^(n-1))`.
   - For `n = 1`, `prod = k_1` and `sum(prod // k_i) = k_1 // k_1 = 1`, so `prod - sum(prod // k_i) = k_1 - 1` which is always positive for `k_1 >= 2`.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no solution exists by checking if `den <= 0`.
   - The program correctly calculates the bets `x_i` and ensures they satisfy the condition `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)` for all `i`.

6. **Challenges to the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment is generally correct, but there is a subtle issue in the algorithm that needs to be addressed.
   - The calculation of `prod` as the product of all `k_i` can lead to very large numbers, especially when `n` is large and `k_i` are high. This can cause integer overflow in Python, although Python's `int` type can handle arbitrarily large integers, it can still be inefficient and slow for very large products.
   - However, the problem constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 50` and `2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20`) ensure that the product `prod` will not exceed the limits of Python's `int` type, so this is not a practical issue.

7. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `prod` is zero, but this is not possible given the constraints (`2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20`).
   - The program correctly prints the bets in the required format and handles the `-1` case appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is correct and satisfies the problem requirements. The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
