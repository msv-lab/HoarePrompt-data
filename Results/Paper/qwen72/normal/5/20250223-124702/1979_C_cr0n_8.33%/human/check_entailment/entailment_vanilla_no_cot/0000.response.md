Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect due to a few issues:

1. **Function Call and Scope**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop, but it is defined after the loop. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bets**: The logic used to determine the bets is flawed. The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each multiplier to get the bets. However, this approach does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

3. **Sum of Bets**: The sum of the bets `vprod` is calculated and then subtracted from the product `prod` to get `den`. The condition `if den <= 0` is used to check if a solution exists, but this is not the correct way to determine if the bets are valid. The correct condition should be that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets such that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. One way to do this is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distribute the bets accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_multiple(numbers):
    return reduce(lcm, numbers)

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    lcm_val = lcm_multiple(vals)
    bets = [lcm_val // r for r in vals]
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    
    if total_bet >= lcm_val:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in bets]))

cases = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(cases):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The `lcm_multiple` function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers.
2. **Bets Calculation**: The bets are calculated as `lcm_val // r` for each multiplier `r`.
3. **Total Bet Check**: The total sum of the bets is checked to ensure it is strictly less than `lcm_val`. If it is not, the program outputs `-1`.
4. **Output Bets**: If a valid solution exists, the program outputs the bets.

This approach ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome, satisfying the problem's requirements.
