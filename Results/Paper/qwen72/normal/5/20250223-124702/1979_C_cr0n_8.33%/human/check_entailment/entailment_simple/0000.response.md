### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then calculates `vprod`, which is a list where each element is the product of all multipliers except the corresponding one in `vals`.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating no valid distribution of coins.
   - Otherwise, it prints the list `vprod`.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The key insight is that the product of all multipliers `prod` is used to ensure that the total bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The list `vprod` is constructed such that each element is the product of all multipliers except the corresponding one. This ensures that the total bet is `sum(vprod)`, and the amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod`.
   - The condition `den > 0` ensures that `sum(vprod) < prod`, which is necessary for the total bet to be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers are the same, the program will correctly identify that no valid distribution exists (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`).
   - If the multipliers are different, the program will correctly find a valid distribution (e.g., `3 2 7`).

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
   - The logic for calculating `vprod` and `den` is sound and ensures the required condition is met.
   - The program correctly prints `-1` when no valid distribution exists and prints a valid distribution otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided.
