You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)`, and for each outcome `i`, `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)` must hold.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It then calculates `vprod` as `prod // k_i` for each outcome.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no solution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total bet `sum(x_i)` is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome `k_i * x_i`.
   - By setting `x_i = prod // k_i`, the total bet is `sum(prod // k_i)`.
   - The condition `k_i * (prod // k_i) > sum(prod // k_i)` must hold for all `i`.
   - Simplifying, we get `prod > sum(prod // k_i)`, which is checked by the `den` variable.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` are the same, `prod` will be `k_i^n` and `sum(prod // k_i)` will be `n * (k_i^(n-1))`.
   - For `k_i = 2`, `prod = 2^n` and `sum(prod // k_i) = n * (2^(n-1))`.
   - For `n = 1`, `prod = k_1` and `sum(prod // k_i) = k_1 // k_1 = 1`, so `prod - sum(prod // k_i) = k_1 - 1` which is always positive for `k_1 >= 2`.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no solution exists by checking if `den <= 0`.
   - The program correctly calculates the bets `x_i` and ensures they satisfy the condition `k_i * x_i > sum(x_i)` for all `i`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and satisfies the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
