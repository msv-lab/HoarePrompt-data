Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes for each test case, `k` is a list of n integers (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome, `N` is an input integer.** 

The code snippet `N = int(input().strip())` assigns the value of `int(input().strip())` to the variable `N`. This means `N` now holds an integer value provided by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.
