Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `k` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer \( k_i \) is within the range 2 ≤ \( k_i \) ≤ 20.
- `N` is an input integer.
- `vals` is a list of integers read from input.
- `prod` is the product of all integers in `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all integers in `vals` except the corresponding integer in `vals`.
- `den` is the value of `prod - sum(vprod)`.
- The current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(-1)
```

The output is straightforward and does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. The statement simply prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
