Output State: **The loop reads lines from the standard input, processes each line to extract integers `n` and `k`, and prints either a list of `k` integers each equal to `k` if `n == k` and `k >= 2`, or `-1` if `n != k` and `k >= 2`, or a list of integers from 1 to `n` if `k < 2`. The loop continues until all lines from the standard input are processed.**
