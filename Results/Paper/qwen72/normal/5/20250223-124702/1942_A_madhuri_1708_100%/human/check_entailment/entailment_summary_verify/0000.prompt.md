You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines from standard input, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, if `k` is 1 or less, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. If `k` is 2 or more, it prints either `-1` if `n` is not equal to `k`, or a list of `k` integers, each equal to `k`, if `n` is equal to `k`. The function processes all lines until the end of the standard input is reached.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when `k == 1` and `n > 1`. According to the problem description, for `k == 1`, there should be exactly one sorted cyclic shift of the array. However, the program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` when `k == 1`, which is not guaranteed to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 1`. The program will output `1 2 3 4`. The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (sorted)
- `[2, 3, 4, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 4, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
- `[4, 1, 2, 3]` (not sorted)

This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is correct. However, for `n = 3` and `k = 1`, the program will output `1 2 3`. The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- `[1, 2, 3]` (sorted)
- `[2, 3, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[3, 1, 2]` (not sorted)

This array also has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is correct. However, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program incorrectly prints `-1` when it should be possible to find an array with exactly two sorted cyclic shifts. For example, the array `[1, 1, 2]` has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts:
- `[1, 1, 2]` (sorted)
- `[1, 2, 1]` (not sorted)
- `[2, 1, 1]` (sorted)

Thus, the program is incorrect for the case where `k == 2` and `n > 2`.
