Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads from the standard input, which is appropriate for the problem's input format.
   - It processes each line to extract `n` and `k` as integers, which is correct.

2. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - **Case 1: `k < 2`**:
     - If `k` is 1 or less, the function prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. This is correct because for `k = 1`, an array with a single sorted cyclic shift can be constructed by ensuring the array is strictly increasing. For `k = 0`, the problem description does not explicitly state what to do, but typically, no valid array exists for `k = 0`.
   - **Case 2: `k >= 2`**:
     - If `n == k`, the function prints a list of `k` integers, each equal to `k`. This is incorrect because it does not satisfy the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, if `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the array `[3, 3, 3]` will have all cyclic shifts sorted, which is more than `k` sorted shifts.
     - If `n != k`, the function prints `-1`. This is also incorrect because there can be valid arrays for `n != k` that satisfy the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 2, 3, 1]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For `k = 1`, a valid array can be constructed by ensuring the array is strictly increasing and then breaking the sequence at one point to ensure only one sorted cyclic shift.
   - For `k > 1`, a valid array can be constructed by ensuring the first `k` elements are in increasing order and the remaining elements are all equal to the last element of the first `k` elements. This ensures that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

Given the above reasoning, the provided function does not correctly handle all cases and produces incorrect outputs for some valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
