Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program attempts to solve this by checking the value of `k` and handling two cases:

1. **When `k` is 1 or less:**
   - The program generates an array `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This array is sorted, and when you perform a cyclic shift on it, only the original array remains sorted. Hence, this case is correctly handled because it ensures exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which satisfies the condition when `k = 1`. For `k = 0`, the problem statement guarantees that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, so this case is not applicable.

2. **When `k` is 2 or more:**
   - The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If `n == k`, it prints an array of `n` elements, each equal to `k`. This is incorrect because an array of `n` elements, each equal to `k`, will have `n` sorted cyclic shifts, not `k` sorted cyclic shifts.
   - If `n` is not equal to `k`, the program prints `-1`. This is also incorrect because there can be valid arrays that satisfy the condition even when `n` is not equal to `k`.

### Correct Approach:
- For `k = 1`, the array `[1, 2, ..., n]` is correct as it ensures exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
- For `k > 1`, a valid approach is to create an array where the first `k` elements are in increasing order, and the remaining elements are all equal to the last element of the first `k` elements. This ensures that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Example:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 2, 2]`. The cyclic shifts are:
  - `[1, 2, 2, 2]` (sorted)
  - `[2, 2, 2, 1]` (sorted)
  - `[2, 2, 1, 2]` (not sorted)
  - `[2, 1, 2, 2]` (not sorted)

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k > 1` and `n != k` properly. It incorrectly prints `-1` in many valid cases.

Correctness: **False**
