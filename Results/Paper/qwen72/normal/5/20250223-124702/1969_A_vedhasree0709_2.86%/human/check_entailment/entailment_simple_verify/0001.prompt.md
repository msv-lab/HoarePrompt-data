You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, the list `l` is processed. If the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met for any `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, the loop prints `2` and breaks. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to `0` at the start of each iteration, and their final values after the loop are not relevant to the output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Monocarp has `n` friends, and each friend has a best friend.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It then iterates through the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends `(i, i+1)` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is checking for a specific pattern in the list `l`.
   - This pattern is not general enough to cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party.
   - For example, in the second test case `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the correct answer is `3` because inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 ensures that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. However, the program does not correctly identify this scenario.
   - The program only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider other valid configurations where fewer than 3 invitations might be needed.

4. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct approach should be to identify the smallest set of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - This can be done by finding the smallest cycle in the best friend relationships or by ensuring that at least one pair of friends and their best friends are invited.
   - The program should consider all possible pairs and cycles, not just a specific pattern.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. It only checks for a specific pattern and fails to find the minimum number of invitations needed in general cases.

Correctness: **False**
