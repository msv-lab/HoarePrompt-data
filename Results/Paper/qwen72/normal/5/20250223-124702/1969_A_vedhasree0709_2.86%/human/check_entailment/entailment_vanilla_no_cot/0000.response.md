Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic implemented in the program is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios where friends can be invited to ensure at least two friends attend the party. Specifically, the program only checks for a very specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if it finds such a pattern, otherwise it prints `3`. This approach is too simplistic and does not handle the general case of finding the minimum number of invitations required.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The correct outputs should be:
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
3
3
2
```

This is incorrect for the first and second test cases. The program fails to identify that in the first test case, inviting friends 4 and 5 is sufficient, and in the second test case, inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 is sufficient.

A more correct approach would involve identifying connected components in the friendship graph and determining the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least two friends attend the party.
