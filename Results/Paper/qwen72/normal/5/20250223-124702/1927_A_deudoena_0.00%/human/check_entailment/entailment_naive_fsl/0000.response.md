Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The program is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the given code only processes a single string input and does not account for the number of test cases `t` or the length of the strip `n`. Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment to be painted white. It calculates the distance between the first and last black cells, but this approach fails in cases where there are white cells between the first and last black cells that are not part of the segment to be painted.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 6
s = "WBBWBB"
```
The correct output should be 4, as the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell needs to be painted to make the entire strip white. However, the program will output 6, which is incorrect.
