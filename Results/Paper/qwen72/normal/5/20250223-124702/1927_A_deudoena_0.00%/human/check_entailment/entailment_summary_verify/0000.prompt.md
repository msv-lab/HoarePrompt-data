You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from the user input, finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' (`ind2`) in the string, and then prints the length of the substring between these two indices, inclusive. The function does not return any value. The parameters `t` and the list of tuples mentioned in the comments are not used in the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The program is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the given code only processes a single string input and does not account for the number of test cases `t` or the length of the strip `n`. Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment to be painted white. It calculates the distance between the first and last black cells, but this approach fails in cases where there are white cells between the first and last black cells that are not part of the segment to be painted.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 6
s = "WBBWBB"
```
The correct output should be 4, as the segment from the 2nd to the 5th cell needs to be painted to make the entire strip white. However, the program will output 6, which is incorrect.
