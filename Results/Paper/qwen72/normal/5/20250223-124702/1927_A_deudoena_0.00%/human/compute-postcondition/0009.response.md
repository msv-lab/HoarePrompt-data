Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` when counted from the end.
   - `outind` is 0.
   - `t` remains unchanged (though `t` is not used in the print statement).

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` when counted from the end. This is equivalent to the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr` when counted from the beginning.
   - `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `inpstr`.

3. **Expression in the Print Statement**:
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` calculates the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B'.

4. **Example Calculation**:
   - Suppose `inpstr = "AABBCCBBAA"`.
     - The first 'B' occurs at index 2, so `ind1 = 2`.
     - The last 'B' occurs at index 7, so `ind2 = 7`.
     - The length of `inpstr` is 10.
     - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` becomes `10 - 7 - 2 = 1`.

5. **General Case**:
   - For any string `inpstr`, `ind1` and `ind2` will be the indices of the first and last 'B' respectively.
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` will always yield a value that represents the number of characters between the first and last 'B' (inclusive) plus the number of characters before the first 'B' and after the last 'B'.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The print statement will output the result of the expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`, and `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `inpstr`)**
