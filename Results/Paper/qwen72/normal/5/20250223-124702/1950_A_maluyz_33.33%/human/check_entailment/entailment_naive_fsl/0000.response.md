Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., 3 2 1) correctly. According to the problem description, such a case should output "NONE", but the program incorrectly outputs "PEAK" because the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is true for descending sequences where `b` is the middle digit. For example, for the input `3 2 1`, the program will output "PEAK" instead of "NONE".
