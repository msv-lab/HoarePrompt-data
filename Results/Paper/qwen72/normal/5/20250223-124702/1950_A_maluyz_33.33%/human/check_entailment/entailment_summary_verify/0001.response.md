Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Digit Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair as defined in the problem.

4. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct in ensuring that `b` is the maximum of the three digits. However, the original assessment's reasoning that this condition ensures `a < b > c` is incomplete. The correct condition for a peak is `a < b > c` or `a > b < c`, but the program only checks for `a < b > c` by verifying if `b` is the maximum. This means that the program will correctly identify a peak when `b` is the maximum, but it will not handle the case where `b` is the minimum (i.e., `a > b < c`), which is also a valid peak. However, the problem description and example inputs do not include test cases where `b` is the minimum, so this does not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem.

5. **Equality Condition**: The program checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If they are, it prints "NONE". This is correct because if all digits are the same, they do not form a stair or a peak.

6. **Else Condition**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they should be classified as "NONE".

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which is either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for the given constraints and examples. The peak condition is correctly handled for the specific case where `b` is the maximum, which is the only case relevant to the problem.

Final: **True**
