You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations for the given value of t. The values of a, b, and c for each test case have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case. The variables a, b, and c are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) and prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a <= b >= c` and `b` is the maximum, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate output has been printed for each. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., 3 2 1) correctly. According to the problem description, such a case should output "NONE", but the program incorrectly outputs "PEAK" because the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is true for descending sequences where `b` is the middle digit. For example, for the input `3 2 1`, the program will output "PEAK" instead of "NONE".
