Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a "STAIR," "PEAK," or "NONE" based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the program:

1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "STAIR."
   - It checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same, in which case it outputs "NONE."
   - It checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits (`max(a, b, c) == b`) to determine if the digits form a "PEAK."
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it outputs "NONE."

The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the expected results for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
