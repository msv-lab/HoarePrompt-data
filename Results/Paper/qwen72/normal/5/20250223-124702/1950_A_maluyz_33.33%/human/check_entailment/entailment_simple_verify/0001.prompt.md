You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations for the given value of t. The values of a, b, and c for each test case have been processed, and the appropriate output ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') has been printed for each test case. The variables a, b, and c are not retained between iterations, and their final values are undefined. The value of t remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Digit Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair as defined in the problem.

4. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct because it ensures that `b` is the maximum of the three digits, which is the definition of a peak (`a < b > c`).

5. **Equality Condition**: The program checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If they are, it prints "NONE". This is correct because if all digits are the same, they do not form a stair or a peak.

6. **Else Condition**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they should be classified as "NONE".

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which is either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
