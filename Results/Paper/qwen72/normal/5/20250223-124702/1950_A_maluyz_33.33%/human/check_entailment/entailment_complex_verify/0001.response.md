Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Digit Parsing**: For each test case, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair as defined in the problem.

4. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is correct in ensuring that `b` is the maximum of the three digits. However, it does not fully capture the peak condition `a < b > c`. Specifically, it does not check if `a < b` and `b > c` simultaneously. For example, if `a = 3`, `b = 3`, and `c = 1`, the program will incorrectly classify this as a peak because `max(3, 3, 1) == 3`, even though `a` and `b` are equal, which does not satisfy the peak condition.

5. **Equality Condition**: The program checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. If they are, it prints "NONE". This is correct because if all digits are the same, they do not form a stair or a peak.

6. **Else Condition**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NONE". This is correct because if the digits do not form a stair or a peak, they should be classified as "NONE".

7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which is either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the conditions checked. However, due to the issue in the peak condition, the program may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not fully implement the logic required by the problem description, particularly in the peak condition.

Final: **False**
