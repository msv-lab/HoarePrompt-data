The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is a placeholder**
