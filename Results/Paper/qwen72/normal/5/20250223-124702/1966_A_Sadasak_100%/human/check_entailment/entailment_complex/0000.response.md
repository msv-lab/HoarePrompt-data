Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the specified operations. The operations involve selecting `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` new cards, which can have any number. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left in the hand.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cards) and `k` (number of cards to exchange).
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, it is impossible to perform any exchange operations, so the program correctly prints `n` as the answer.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums`, but it caps the frequency at `k`. This is a crucial step because if a card number appears more than `k` times, the excess cards can be used in multiple exchange operations.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Cards:**
   - The program checks if any card number appears exactly `k` times in the `frequency_table`.
   - If a card number appears exactly `k` times, the program prints `k - 1` as the answer. This is because you can exchange `k` cards for `k-1` new cards, and the process can be repeated until no more exchanges are possible.
   - If no card number appears exactly `k` times, the program prints `n` as the answer. This is incorrect because the program should consider the possibility of performing multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards further.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Final Output:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where no card number appears exactly `k` times. It should instead calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchanges.
  - The correct approach would involve repeatedly performing the exchange operation until no more exchanges are possible, or using a more efficient method to determine the minimum number of cards left.

### Correct Approach:
- **Frequency Calculation:**
  - Calculate the frequency of each card number in `nums`.
- **Minimum Cards Calculation:**
  - For each card number, determine how many full exchanges can be performed and how many cards will be left after these exchanges.
  - The minimum number of cards left in the hand is the sum of the remaining cards after all possible exchanges.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where no card number appears exactly `k` times and does not calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchanges.

Correctness: **False**
