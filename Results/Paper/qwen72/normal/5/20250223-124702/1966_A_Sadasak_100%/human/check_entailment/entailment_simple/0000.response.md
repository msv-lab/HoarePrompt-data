Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the specified operations. However, the logic in the main part of the program and the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to create a frequency table of the numbers in the input list `arr`, but it caps the frequency at `k`. This is incorrect because the frequency should not be capped at `k` but should be used to determine how many cards can be exchanged.
   - The function should return the frequency of each number, not a capped value.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the goal is to minimize the number of cards left, not to check if any number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`.
   - The program should consider the total number of cards and the frequency of each number to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

A correct approach would involve:
   - Calculating the frequency of each number in the hand.
   - Determining how many cards can be exchanged for each number.
   - Calculating the minimum number of cards left after all possible exchanges.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
