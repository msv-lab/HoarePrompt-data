The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the caller will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
