Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from standard input, typically representing the number of test cases, and returns this integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns the first line of input from the user, with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the caller will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads a line from the standard input, splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return list(sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input (stdin), removes any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into words, and returns a list of these words as strings.

 Code:
 '''

''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters but initializes and uses `n`, `m`, `graph`, and `edges` internally. It constructs an undirected graph from a list of weighted edges and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find and union components of the graph. After processing, it prints the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU and the length of a list `res` obtained from a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specific node. It also prints the elements of `res`. The final state of the program includes the original `n` and `m` values, a `graph` representing the constructed undirected graph, a sorted `edges` list, an updated `dsu` instance, and the printed values.

    return []
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function marks the current vertex as being visited and appends it to the path. If the current vertex has already been visited (i.e., its color is 1), the function returns the current path. Otherwise, it recursively explores all unvisited neighbors of the current vertex, excluding the parent vertex. If a neighbor's path contains a specific node `node_v`, the function returns that path. If no such path is found, the function marks the current vertex as fully processed and returns an empty list.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases by calling `func_1()`, and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6()` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the function does not return any value.
