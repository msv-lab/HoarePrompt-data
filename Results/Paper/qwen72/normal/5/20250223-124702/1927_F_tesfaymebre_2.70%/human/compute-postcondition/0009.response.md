The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list of integers representing the current path in the DFS traversal.

The function can return in two cases:
- Case_1: The function returns the current path in the DFS traversal, represented by the list `path`.
- Case_2: The function returns an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). It returns the current path if a specific condition is met, otherwise it returns an empty list.**
