### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges` with their weights.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key step for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - This is used to detect cycles and to keep track of the minimum weight edge in each component.

3. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Weight Edge**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to union the vertices connected by each edge.
   - The logic for detecting cycles and updating the minimum weight edge is flawed. The program updates the minimum weight edge only when a cycle is detected, but it should update the minimum weight edge during the union operation.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the vertices and update the minimum weight edge. This is a critical error in the cycle detection logic.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle**:
   - The DFS function is not correctly extracting the cycle. It should return the cycle only when it finds a back edge to a vertex that is already in the path.
   - The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may not return the correct cycle.
   - The DFS function should be modified to correctly identify and return the cycle when a back edge is found.

5. **DSU Data Structure**:
   - The DSU class is defined and has methods `find` and `union` and a `min_edge` attribute.
   - However, the union operation in the DSU class is not correctly implemented. The union operation should update the minimum edge weight for the combined component, but it currently does not handle this correctly.

### Detailed Analysis of the Code:

- **DSU Class**:
  - The `find` method is correctly implemented to find the root of a vertex with path compression.
  - The `union` method is flawed. It should update the minimum edge weight for the combined component, but it currently does not handle this correctly.
  - The `union` method should also ensure that the root of the smaller component is attached to the root of the larger component to keep the tree balanced.

- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The program sorts the edges in descending order by weight, which is correct for the problem.
  - However, the cycle detection logic is incorrect. The program should update the minimum weight edge during the union operation, not when the vertices are already in the same component.
  - The correct logic should be:
    ```python
    if parent_u != parent_v:
        dsu.union(u, v, w)
        if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
            _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
            node_u = u
            node_v = v
    ```

- **DFS Cycle Extraction**:
  - The DFS function should correctly identify and return the cycle when a back edge is found.
  - The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may not return the correct cycle.
  - The DFS function should be modified to return the cycle only when a back edge is found to a vertex that is already in the path.

### Corrected Code:

Here is a corrected version of the program:
