### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Graph Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges` with their weights.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key step for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - This is used to detect cycles and to keep track of the minimum weight edge in each component.

3. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Weight Edge**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to union the vertices connected by each edge.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is intended to detect a cycle. However, this condition is incorrect. It should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the vertices and update the minimum weight edge.
   - The program updates the minimum weight edge only when a cycle is detected, but it should update the minimum weight edge during the union operation to ensure the correct minimum weight is tracked.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle**:
   - The DFS function is intended to find the cycle that includes the vertices `node_u` and `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each vertex during the DFS: 0 for unvisited, 1 for visiting, and 2 for visited.
   - The current implementation of the DFS function may not correctly extract the cycle. It should return the cycle only when it finds a back edge to a vertex that is already in the path.
   - The condition `if colors[curr] == 1` is intended to detect a cycle, but it should also ensure that the cycle includes both `node_u` and `node_v`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight edge and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is incorrect. It should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the vertices and update the minimum weight edge.
  - The logic for updating the minimum weight edge is flawed. It should update the minimum weight edge during the union operation, not only when a cycle is detected.

- **DFS Cycle Extraction**:
  - The DFS function is not correctly extracting the cycle. It should return the cycle only when it finds a back edge to a vertex that is already in the path.
  - The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may not return the correct cycle.

- **DSU Data Structure**:
  - The DSU class is defined and has methods `find` and `union` and a `min_edge` attribute, but the implementation details need to be reviewed for correctness.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the provided program is incorrect. The cycle detection logic and the DFS cycle extraction logic need to be fixed to ensure the program works as intended.

Final: **False**
