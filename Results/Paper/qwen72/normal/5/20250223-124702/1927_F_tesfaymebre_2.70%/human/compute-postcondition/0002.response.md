To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_1()` and `func_6()` within the context provided. However, since the specific implementations of these functions are not given, we can only make general assumptions based on typical Python behavior.

1. **Initial State**: `test_cases` is assigned the result of `func_1()`.
2. **Loop**: The loop runs `test_cases` times, and each iteration calls `func_6()`.

Assuming `func_1()` returns an integer value, and `func_6()` does not modify `test_cases` or any other variables outside its scope, the loop will simply execute `func_6()` `test_cases` times.

Since `func_6()` is called but does not change any variables in the loop head or body, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged after the loop completes.

Output State: **`test_cases` remains the same as the result of `func_1()`.**
