You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Graph Construction**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges `m`.
   - It then reads the edges and constructs an adjacency list `graph` and a list of edges `edges` with their weights.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key step for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - This is used to detect cycles and to keep track of the minimum weight edge in each component.

3. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Weight Edge**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to union the vertices connected by each edge.
   - If the vertices are already in the same component (i.e., a cycle is detected), it updates the minimum weight edge and the corresponding vertices `node_u` and `node_v`.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle**:
   - The program uses a DFS to find the cycle that includes the vertices `node_u` and `node_v`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each vertex during the DFS: 0 for unvisited, 1 for visiting, and 2 for visited.
   - If a vertex is visited again (i.e., a cycle is found), the path is returned.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum weight edge and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Cycle Detection Logic**:
  - The logic for detecting cycles and updating the minimum weight edge is flawed. The program updates the minimum weight edge only when a cycle is detected, but it should update the minimum weight edge during the union operation.
  - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the vertices and update the minimum weight edge.

- **DFS Cycle Extraction**:
  - The DFS function is not correctly extracting the cycle. It should return the cycle only when it finds a back edge to a vertex that is already in the path.
  - The current implementation may return a path that is not a cycle or may not return the correct cycle.

- **DSU Data Structure**:
  - The DSU class is not defined in the provided code. It is assumed to have methods `find` and `union` and a `min_edge` attribute, but the implementation details are missing.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
