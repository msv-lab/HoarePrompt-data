The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. However, the state of `test_cases` must be such that it ensures the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
