Output State: **The loop will iterate through all neighbors `nei` of the current vertex `curr` in the graph. If a neighbor `nei` is not already fully processed (i.e., `colors[nei] != 2`) and is not the parent vertex, the loop will call `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. If the result of the `dfs` call is not `None` and contains `node_v`, the loop will return this result. If no such result is found, the loop will complete all iterations, and the state of `curr`, `parent`, and `path` will remain unchanged. `colors[curr]` is now 2.**
