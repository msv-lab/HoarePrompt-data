Output State: **`n` and `m` remain unchanged, `graph` is a defaultdict of lists where each key has a list of nodes it is connected to, `edges` is now a sorted list of tuples in descending order based on the edge weights, `dsu` is an instance of the DSU class with updated parent and min_edge values, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `node_u` is the node u of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU, `node_v` is the node v of the edge with the minimum weight that was successfully added to the DSU.**
