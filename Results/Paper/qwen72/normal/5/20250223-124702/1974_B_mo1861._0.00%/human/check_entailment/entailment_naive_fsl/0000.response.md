Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. The issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The program maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet, but it should map each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted set of distinct characters from the original string `s`.

For example, consider the input string `b = "serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, and the decoding should map `s` to `c`, `e` to `o`, `r` to `d`, and so on. However, the current implementation will map `s` to `z`, `e` to `y`, `r` to `x`, and so on, which is incorrect.

A correct implementation should construct the `char_map` based on the symmetric positions within the sorted set of distinct characters from `b`, not based on the reverse order of the alphabet. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    distinct_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {distinct_chars[i]: distinct_chars[len(distinct_chars) - i - 1] for i in range(len(distinct_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This version correctly constructs the `char_map` by mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted set of distinct characters, ensuring the decoding process matches the problem description.
