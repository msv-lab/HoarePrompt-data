To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `c` and the string `b`.

1. **Variable `c`**: This variable will be assigned each character in `b` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `c` is not explicitly initialized, so it will be set by the loop on the first iteration to the first character in `b`.

2. **String `b`**: For the loop to execute, `b` must be a non-empty string. If `b` is empty, the loop will not run at all.

Given the state before the loop starts, the `char_map` dictionary is already populated, and `s` is an empty string. These do not affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is that `b` must be a non-empty string.

State: **`char_map` is populated with mappings from each unique character in `b` to a corresponding character, `b` is a non-empty string, `s` is an empty string, `c` is the first character in `b`**
