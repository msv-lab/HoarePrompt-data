The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the list contains between 1 and 100 integers, each between 1 and 100 inclusive. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique stick length by 3. The input list `arr` remains unchanged.
