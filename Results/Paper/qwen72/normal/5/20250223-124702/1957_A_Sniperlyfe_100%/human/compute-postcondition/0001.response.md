The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The state of `freq` is not in the loop head, so it cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive (1 <= len(arr) <= 100), with each stick length being between 1 and 100 inclusive (1 <= a_i <= 100).
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `n` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive (1 <= len(arr) <= 100), with each stick length being between 1 and 100 inclusive (1 <= a_i <= 100), `freq` is an empty dictionary, `n` is the first element of `arr`**
