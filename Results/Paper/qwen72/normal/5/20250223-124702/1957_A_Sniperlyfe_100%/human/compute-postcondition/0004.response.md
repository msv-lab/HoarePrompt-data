The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr` which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the length of a stick, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100 inclusive. Each stick length is also between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3, where `freq` is a dictionary that counts the frequency of each stick length in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers representing stick lengths and returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency count by 3.**
