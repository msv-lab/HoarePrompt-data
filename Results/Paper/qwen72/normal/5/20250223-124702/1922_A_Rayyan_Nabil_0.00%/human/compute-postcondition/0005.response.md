Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It checks if for each character position `i` in the strings, at least one of the characters in `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character in `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case failed the condition, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop. **
