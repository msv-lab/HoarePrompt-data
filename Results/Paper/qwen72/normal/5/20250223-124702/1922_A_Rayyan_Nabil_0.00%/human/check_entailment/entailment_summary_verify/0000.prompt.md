You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It checks if for each character position `i` in the strings, at least one of the characters in `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character in `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case failed the condition, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the strings `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`. This check is insufficient because it does not verify that `a` and `b` match the template as required.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will output "YES" for this input, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, there should be no template that allows both `a` and `b` to match while `c` does not. For each position `i`:
- `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, so they can match a template where `t[i]` is any uppercase letter.
- However, `c[i]` is also different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, so it can also match the same template.

Thus, there is no template that satisfies the condition where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. The program should output "NO" for this case, but it incorrectly outputs "YES".
