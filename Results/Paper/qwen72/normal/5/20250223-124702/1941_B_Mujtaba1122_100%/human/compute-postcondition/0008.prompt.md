You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers of length n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: The list is modified such that for each i in the range 1 to n-2, if the initial conditions (list[i] > 1, list[i - 1] > 0, and list[i + 1] > 0) were met, the values of list[i], list[i - 1], and list[i + 1] are decreased according to the operations inside the while loop. If at any point list[i - 1] becomes 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function. If the loop completes without list[i - 1] becoming 0 for any i, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list is modified such that for each i in the range 1 to n-2, if the initial conditions (list[i] > 1, list[i - 1] > 0, and list[i + 1] > 0) were met, the values of list[i], list[i - 1], and list[i + 1] are decreased according to the operations inside the while loop. If at any point list[i - 1] becomes 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, terminating the function. If the loop completes without list[i - 1] becoming 0 for any i, the list will have been modified but will not contain any 'no' print statements. Additionally, if `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function indicates that the list and n satisfy the conditions checked by `func_1`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`, the function indicates that the list and n do not satisfy these conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not described.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
