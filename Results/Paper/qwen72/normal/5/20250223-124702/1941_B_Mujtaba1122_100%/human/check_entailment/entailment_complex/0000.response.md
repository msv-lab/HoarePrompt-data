### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(list, n)`**:
     - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to \( n-1 \) are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
     - This function is straightforward and correct for its purpose.

   - **`func_2(list, n)`**:
     - This function iterates over the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) and applies the operation as long as the conditions \( \text{list}[i] > 1 \), \( \text{list}[i-1] > 0 \), and \( \text{list}[i+1] > 0 \) are met.
     - The operation is applied by decrementing \( \text{list}[i-1] \), \( \text{list}[i] \), and \( \text{list}[i+1] \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
     - If at any point \( \text{list}[i-1] \) becomes zero, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements zero.
     - After the loop, the function calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The loop in `func_2` ensures that the operation is applied as long as the conditions are met, which is a valid approach to try to make all elements zero.
   - However, the loop only applies the operation when \( \text{list}[i] > 1 \), \( \text{list}[i-1] > 0 \), and \( \text{list}[i+1] > 0 \). This means that if any element in the list is 1 or less, the operation will not be applied, and the function will continue to the next index.
   - The function correctly handles the case where \( \text{list}[i-1] \) becomes zero during the operation, indicating that it is not possible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, the function checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the list is already zero by calling `func_1` after the loop.
   - The function also handles the case where the list cannot be made zero by printing 'no' if any element becomes zero during the operation.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_2` uses the `print` function to output 'no' and 'YES'/'NO'. This is not ideal for a function that should return a result, but it matches the problem's requirement to print the result.
   - The function `func_2` does not handle the case where the list is initially not zero but can be made zero by a different sequence of operations. For example, if the list is `[1, 2, 1]`, the function will not be able to make all elements zero because it only applies the operation when \( \text{list}[i] > 1 \).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` is not correct because it only applies the operation when \( \text{list}[i] > 1 \), which is too restrictive. The problem statement does not specify this restriction, and there are valid sequences of operations that can make all elements zero even if \( \text{list}[i] \le 1 \) at some point.

### Correctness: **False**
