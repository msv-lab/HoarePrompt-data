The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `len_unique`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len_unique`. If `len_unique` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, and `char_map` is an empty dictionary. These conditions do not need to be adjusted as they are not part of the loop head. However, to ensure the loop executes, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5; `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary; `i` is 0, `len_unique` must be greater than 0**
