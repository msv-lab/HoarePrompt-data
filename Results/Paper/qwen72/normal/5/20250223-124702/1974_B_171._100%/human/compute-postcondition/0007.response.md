The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a string `decoded`, where each character in the original string `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`. `char_map` contains a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to the corresponding unique character in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in reverse order according to a character mapping.**
