### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the subsequent test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `b`.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` is called with the encoded string `b`.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program constructs a list `unique_chars` of all unique characters in `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is created to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character in reverse order.
   - The program then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique, sorted characters of the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a mapping where each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`.
   - The original string `b` remains unchanged, and the decoded string is returned.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the encoded string `b` has only one unique character correctly. For example, if `b` is "w", the unique characters list will be `['w']`, and the mapping will be `{'w': 'w'}`, resulting in the correct output "w".
   - The program also handles strings with multiple unique characters and different lengths correctly, as demonstrated in the example test cases.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly follows the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement.
   - It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the unique, sorted characters of the encoded string `b`.
   - It creates a symmetric character mapping and applies it to decode the string.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and reads input as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
