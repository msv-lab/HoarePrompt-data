The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function calculates and prints an integer for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The loop variables `s` and `m` are reset for each test case.
