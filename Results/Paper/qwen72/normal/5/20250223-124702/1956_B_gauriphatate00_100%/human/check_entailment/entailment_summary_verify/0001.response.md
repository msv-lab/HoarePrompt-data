### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a deck of 2n cards, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player (you and Nene) gets n cards.
   - Each player takes n turns, starting with you.
   - On each turn, a player selects a card from their hand and places it on the table.
   - If the card placed on the table matches a card already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to compute the maximum number of points you can score.
   - The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand using a dictionary `count_a`.
   - It then iterates through each integer from 1 to n and checks if it appears exactly twice in your hand.
   - If an integer appears twice, it adds 1 to `max_score`.

3. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If an integer appears twice in your hand, you can score a point for that integer by playing the second card after the first one.
   - Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. If you have a pair of the same integer, Nene will not play that integer until you have already played one of your cards with that integer.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of points you can score is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It correctly identifies the integers that appear exactly twice and adds 1 to the score for each such integer.
   - The program then prints the computed score for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where an integer appears only once in your hand (you get 0 points for that integer).
   - The program handles the case where an integer appears twice in your hand (you get 1 point for that integer).
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.

### Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand and returns the count of integers that appear exactly twice.
- The main logic of the program correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The program's output matches the expected output for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally. The logic and the implementation are correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
