You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers of length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer a_i in a satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list a at most 2 times.
def func_1(a, n):
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
        
    #State: `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged.
    max_score = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        if num in count_a:
            if count_a[num] == 2:
                max_score += 1
        
    #State: `count_a` remains the same, and `max_score` is the number of keys in `count_a` that have a value of 2.
    return max_score
    #The program returns the number of keys in `count_a` that have a value of 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns the count of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of keys in `count_a` that have a value of 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
