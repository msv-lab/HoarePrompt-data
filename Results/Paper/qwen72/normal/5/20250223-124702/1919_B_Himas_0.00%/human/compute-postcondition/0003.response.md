Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `s` (which is not used) and a string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in `e` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value and does not modify any input parameters. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the input string `e` for each test case has been processed and the result printed. **
