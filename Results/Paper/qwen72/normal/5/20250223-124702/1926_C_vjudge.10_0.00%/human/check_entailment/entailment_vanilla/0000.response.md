### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) should be computed, and then the sum of these results should be output.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - It then reads \( t \) integers \( n \) and processes each one.
   - For each \( n \), it iterates from 0 to \( n-1 \) and calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of \( i \).
   - The results are accumulated in the variable `soma`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `soma`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - **Incorrect Range**: The inner loop iterates from 0 to \( n-1 \), but the problem requires the sum of digits from 1 to \( n \). This means the program is missing the digit sum for \( n \) itself.
   - **Global Variable Misuse**: The variable `soma` is used as a global variable to accumulate the sum across all test cases. This is incorrect because the sum should be reset for each test case.
   - **Output Timing**: The program prints the final sum after processing all test cases, but it should print the sum for each test case separately.

4. **Correcting the Program**:
   - The inner loop should iterate from 1 to \( n \) inclusive.
   - The variable `soma` should be reset to 0 for each test case.
   - The sum for each test case should be printed immediately after processing that test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues identified. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
