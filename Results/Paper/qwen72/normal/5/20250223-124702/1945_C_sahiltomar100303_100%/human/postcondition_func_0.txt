The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. The function calculates and prints the optimal position (either `left` or `right`) where the number of residents living on their preferred side of the road is maximized. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes includes all test cases being processed and the optimal positions printed for each. The variables used within the function are reset or updated for each new test case, but the total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
