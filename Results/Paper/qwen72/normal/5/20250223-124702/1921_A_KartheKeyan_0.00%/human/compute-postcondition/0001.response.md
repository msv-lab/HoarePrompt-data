Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of the calculated values for each test case, and the calculated values for each test case have been printed. The number of test cases \(t\) is an integer such that \(1 \le t \le 100\), and the coordinates \(x_i, y_i\) are within the range \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\).**
