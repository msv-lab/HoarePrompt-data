The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Since the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, the input provided by `int(input())` should be the number of test cases, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
