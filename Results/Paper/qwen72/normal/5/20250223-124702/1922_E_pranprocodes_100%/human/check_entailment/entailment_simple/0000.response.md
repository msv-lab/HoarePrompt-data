Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the value of `X` for each test case.
2. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max` and `min` to the extreme values of 100,000,000 and -100,000,000, respectively. These values are within the specified range for array elements.
3. **Loop Logic**: The loop continues until `x` is reduced to 1. Inside the loop, the function checks if `x` is even or odd:
   - If `x` is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides `x` by 2.
   - If `x` is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from `x`.
4. **Reversing the List**: After the loop, the function reverses the list `ans` to ensure the correct order of operations.
5. **Output**: The function prints the length of the array `t` and then the array `ans` itself.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Handling of `X = 1`**: The problem statement specifies that `X` is at least 2, but the function does not handle the case where `X` is 1. This is not a problem in the given context since `X` is guaranteed to be at least 2, but it's worth noting.
2. **Array Length**: The function does not explicitly check if the length of the array `t` exceeds 200. If `X` is a very large number, the loop might run more than 200 times, which would violate the problem constraints.
3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm attempts to construct an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences by alternating between appending the largest and smallest possible values. This approach is not guaranteed to work for all values of `X`. For example, the sequence generated for `X = 5` is `[0, 1, 0]`, which has 5 increasing subsequences, but the sequence generated for `X = 13` is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, which does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
