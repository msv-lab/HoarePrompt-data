You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1

    #State: The function will print the number of operations (t) required to reduce X to 1 and the sequence of operations (ans) in reverse order. If the loop completes, the final value of X will be 1, and the array ans will contain the sequence of operations that were performed. The variables max and min will be updated based on the operations performed, but their final values depend on the specific input X.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one, and the elements appear in the same order as in the original array.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \(-10^8 \), which are the upper and lower bounds for the elements in the array.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce \( X \) to 1, appending elements to `ans` based on whether \( X \) is even or odd:
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - After the loop, it reverses the list `ans` to maintain the correct order of elements.
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format for multiple test cases.
   - The logic for constructing the array is based on the properties of increasing subsequences:
     - For even \( X \), appending a large value and dividing \( X \) by 2 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is halved.
     - For odd \( X \), appending a small value and subtracting 1 ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by 1.
   - The program ensures that the array length does not exceed 200 by using a while loop that terminates when \( X \) becomes 1.
   - The elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\) as required.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( X \) is 1 by printing the length of the array and the array itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1 correctly, which it does by printing the length of the array and the array itself.
   - The program should handle large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) efficiently, which it does by repeatedly halving \( X \) and reducing it by 1.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is 1 at the start, but it implicitly does so by the while loop condition.
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, but given the constraints and the halving mechanism, it is unlikely to exceed 200.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the constraints provided. It correctly constructs an array with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences and handles the input and output format as required.

Correctness: **True**
