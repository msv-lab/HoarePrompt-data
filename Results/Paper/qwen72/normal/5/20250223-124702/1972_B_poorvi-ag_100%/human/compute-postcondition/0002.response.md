The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer and `results` is an empty list. The loop will start with `i` being 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list**
