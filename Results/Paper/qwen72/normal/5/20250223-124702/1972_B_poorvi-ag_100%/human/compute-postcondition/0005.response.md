Output State: The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged. Each element in the `results` list will be printed to the console in the order they appear in the list.
