#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" characters, representing the number of coins and their initial states, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will remain unchanged, containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The loop will print each element of the `results` list, one by one, to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. It then checks if the count of 'U' characters in the string `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of the results list to the console. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the `results` list contains `t` elements, each either 'yes' or 'no', and these results are printed to the console. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
