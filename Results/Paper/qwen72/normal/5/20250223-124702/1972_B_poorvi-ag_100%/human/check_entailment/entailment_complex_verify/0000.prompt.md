You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" characters, representing the number of coins and their initial states, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list will remain unchanged, containing `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' characters in the corresponding string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The loop will print each element of the `results` list, one by one, to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. It then checks if the count of 'U' characters in the string `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of the results list to the console. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the `results` list contains `t` elements, each either 'yes' or 'no', and these results are printed to the console. The variable `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the game's rules and logic. Specifically, it only checks if the number of 'U' coins is odd or even and does not simulate the actual game play. This approach is flawed because the outcome of the game depends on the sequence of moves and the positions of the coins, not just the count of 'U' coins.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
UUD
```

According to the program:
- The number of 'U' coins is 2, which is even.
- The program outputs "no".

However, if we simulate the game:
1. Alice chooses the first 'U' coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes "DUD".
2. Bob chooses the first 'U' coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes "DDD".
3. Alice has no 'U' coins left to choose, so she loses.

The correct output should be "no" in this case, which the program correctly outputs. However, consider another input:
```
1
3
UDU
```

According to the program:
- The number of 'U' coins is 1, which is odd.
- The program outputs "yes".

However, if we simulate the game:
1. Alice chooses the only 'U' coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes "DDD".
2. Bob has no 'U' coins left to choose, so he loses.

The correct output should be "yes" in this case, which the program correctly outputs. However, the program fails to handle more complex scenarios correctly.

**Another Counterexample:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
UUUU
```

According to the program:
- The number of 'U' coins is 4, which is even.
- The program outputs "no".

However, if we simulate the game:
1. Alice chooses the first 'U' coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes "DUDU".
2. Bob chooses the first 'U' coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes "DDDU".
3. Alice chooses the last 'U' coin, removes it, and flips the adjacent coins. The state becomes "DDDD".
4. Bob has no 'U' coins left to choose, so he loses.

The correct output should be "yes" in this case, but the program outputs "no".

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game correctly and relies on an oversimplified condition.
