Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. It then checks if the count of 'U' characters in the string `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of the results list to the console. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the `results` list contains `t` elements, each either 'yes' or 'no', and these results are printed to the console. The variable `t` remains unchanged. **
