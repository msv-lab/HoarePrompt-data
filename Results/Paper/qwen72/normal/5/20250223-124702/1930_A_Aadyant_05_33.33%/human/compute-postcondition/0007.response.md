The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 to 5000. The second parameter is a list of lists, where each sublist contains 2n integers (with n ranging from 1 to 50), and each integer is within the range 1 to 10^7. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not specified in the given information.**
