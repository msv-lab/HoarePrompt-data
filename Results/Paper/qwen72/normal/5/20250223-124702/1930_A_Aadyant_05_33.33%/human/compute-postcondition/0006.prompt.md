Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, `list_of_lists` remains a list of lists where each sublist contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer in the range 1 to 10^7, `num` remains an input string, `out` is a list of integers where each integer is the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., integers from each sorted sublist of 2n integers read from the input, and the length of `out` is equal to the integer value of `num`.
Code of the loop:
for outputs in out:
    print(outputs)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
