### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs of integers to be processed.
   - It then reads a line of input containing `2a` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pick the smaller number from each pair. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Pair Selection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list, selecting every second element (i.e., the smaller number in each pair) and appending it to `list2`. This is done by the loop `for i in range(a): list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))`.

4. **Summing and Storing Results:**
   - The sum of the elements in `list2` is calculated and appended to the `out` list, which stores the results for each test case.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `out` list.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the smaller number in each pair by sorting the list and selecting every second element.
  - This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved because the smallest numbers are always chosen first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the constraints well, including the maximum number of test cases (5000) and the maximum number of integers per test case (100).
  - The program also correctly handles the input format and ensures that the list is cleared for each new test case.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(2n \log 2n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The subsequent loop to select pairs has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It will produce the correct output for the given inputs.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
