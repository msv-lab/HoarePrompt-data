### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The cost of each shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for processing a single binary string and calculating the minimum cost to sort it.
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function reads a binary string `s` from the standard input.
   - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's and `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string `s`:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - The function then prints `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, each time processing a new binary string.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to calculate the cost of sorting the binary string by considering the number of '1's before each '0'.
   - The cost calculation is based on the idea that each '0' that is followed by at least one '1' requires a cyclic shift of a substring of length `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before the '0'.
   - This approach is correct because it ensures that all '1's are moved to the right of all '0's, which is the definition of a sorted binary string in non-descending order.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It does not pass any variables to `func_1`, which is appropriate since `func_1` reads its input directly from the standard input.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - The input and output formats match the problem requirements.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description.
