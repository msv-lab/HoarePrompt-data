Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` will hold the integer value that was input by the user, and `func_1` will have been called `t` times. **
