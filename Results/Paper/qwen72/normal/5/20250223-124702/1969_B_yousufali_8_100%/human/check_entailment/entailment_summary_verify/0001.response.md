### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.
   - We need to minimize the total cost.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function processes a single binary string `s`.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered.
     - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string `s`:
       - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly identifies the number of '1's (`n`) in the string.
   - When it encounters a '0' and there are '1's before it (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to the total cost.
   - The logic `n + 1` is correct because:
     - To move all '1's before a '0' to the end, we need to perform a cyclic shift on the substring starting from the first '1' to the current '0'.
     - The length of this substring is `n + 1` (including the '0' and all '1's before it).

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function will correctly output 0 because no '0' will follow a '1'.
   - If the string has no '1's, the function will correctly output 0 because `n` will remain 0 throughout the loop.
   - If the string has no '0's, the function will correctly output 0 because `n` will be incremented but never used in the cost calculation.

5. **Overall Program:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - The input and output format matches the problem description.

6. **Validation with Examples:**
   - For the input "10", the function correctly outputs 2.
   - For the input "0000", the function correctly outputs 0.
   - For the input "11000", the function correctly outputs 9.
   - For the input "101011", the function correctly outputs 5.
   - For the input "01101001", the function correctly outputs 11.
