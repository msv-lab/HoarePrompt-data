Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Prefix Sums and Ones Count**:
   - The program initializes two prefix sum arrays: `ones` and `sum`.
   - `ones[i]` keeps track of the number of 1s in the subarray `c[0:i]`.
   - `sum[i]` keeps track of the sum of the elements in the subarray `c[0:i]` minus the number of elements (i.e., `sum[i] = sum(c[0:i]) - i`).

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `c[l:r]` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to create a different array `b` with the same sum and all elements greater than 0.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, the program calculates:
     - `onesInRange`: the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l:r]`.
     - `sumInRange`: the sum of the elements in the subarray `c[l:r]` minus the number of elements in the subarray.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` can be distributed among the elements in such a way that no element in the resulting array `b` is equal to the corresponding element in `c` and all elements in `b` are greater than 0.

4. **Correctness of the Condition**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` minus the number of elements in the subarray is at least the number of 1s plus the number of elements. This ensures that there is enough "slack" to change each element in `c[l:r]` to a different positive integer while maintaining the same sum.

Given the above points, the program correctly determines whether each subarray is good and prints the appropriate response for each query. Therefore, the program is correct.
