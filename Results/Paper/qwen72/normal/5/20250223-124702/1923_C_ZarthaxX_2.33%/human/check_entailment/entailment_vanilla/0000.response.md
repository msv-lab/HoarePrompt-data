### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `testCases` and then processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, both of length `n + 1`.
   - `ones[i]` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 from the start of the array up to the i-th index.
   - `sum[i]` is used to store the cumulative sum of the elements in the array, but each element is decremented by 1 before adding to the sum.

3. **Cumulative Arrays:**
   - The loop from `i = 1` to `n` updates the `ones` and `sum` arrays:
     - `ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)` calculates the cumulative count of 1s.
     - `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1` calculates the cumulative sum of the array with each element decremented by 1.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to create a different array `b` with the same sum and all positive elements.
   - For other queries, it calculates:
     - `onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]` to get the number of 1s in the subarray.
     - `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` to get the sum of the subarray after decrementing each element by 1.
   - The condition to check if the subarray is good is:
     - `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
     - This condition can be simplified to:
       - `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange = onesInRange + (r - l + 1)`
       - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
     - The left side of the inequality represents the minimum sum required to form a good array `b`:
       - `onesInRange` is the sum of 1s in the subarray.
       - `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is the number of elements in the subarray that are not 1.
       - Each of these elements can be replaced by 1 to form a different array `b` with all positive elements.
     - The right side of the inequality is the sum of the subarray after decrementing each element by 1, which is the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.

5. **Output:**
   - If the condition is satisfied, the subarray is good, and the program prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, preprocesses the array, and processes each query to determine if the subarray is good based on the given conditions. The logic and the implementation are correct.

**Correctness: True**
