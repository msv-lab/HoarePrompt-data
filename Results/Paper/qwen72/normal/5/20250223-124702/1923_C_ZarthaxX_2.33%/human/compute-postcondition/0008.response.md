The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `c`, `q`, and `queries`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c`. `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0. `q` is an integer representing the number of queries. `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. The function returns the results of the queries based on the input array `c` and the specified ranges in `queries`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the array), `c` (a list of positive integers), `q` (number of queries), and `queries` (a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing query ranges). It returns the results of the queries based on the input array `c` and the specified ranges in `queries`.**
