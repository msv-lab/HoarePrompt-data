You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array `c`, the number of test cases `t`, the length of the array `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. For example, the function might be defined as `def func_1(t, n, c, q, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the array `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of `1`s in the `nums` list from the start up to index `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. The values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged, and the values of `nums`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` (the length of an array) and `q` (the number of queries). It then reads `n` integers into a list `nums`. The function calculates two auxiliary lists, `ones` and `sum`, where `ones[i]` is the count of `1`s in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1`, and `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. For each of the `q` queries, which specify a range `[l, r]` within `nums`, the function checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts of `1`s and the sum of differences within the specified range, respectively. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values and does not modify the input variables `nums`, `n`, or `q`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if a subarray is good. Specifically, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is incorrect. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Condition Explanation**:
   - `onesInRange` counts the number of 1s in the subarray.
   - `sumInRange` calculates the sum of `(nums[i] - 1)` for the subarray, which is essentially the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.

2. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r+1]` can be split into two parts such that the sum of the parts is equal to the sum of the subarray and no element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in the new array `b`, and all elements in `b` are positive.
   - This can be simplified to checking if the sum of the subarray minus the number of 1s in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of elements in the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "room" to adjust the elements to form a valid `b` array.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5 4
     1 2 1 4 5
     1 5
     4 4
     3 4
     1 3
     ```
   - For the query `1 3`, the subarray is `[1, 2, 1]`.
   - The sum of the subarray is `4`.
   - The number of 1s in the subarray is `2`.
   - The condition `2 * 2 + (3 - 1 + 1) - 2 <= 4 - 3` simplifies to `3 <= 1`, which is false. However, the subarray `[1, 2, 1]` is actually good because we can construct `b = [2, 1, 2]` which satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if a subarray is good for every potential case.
