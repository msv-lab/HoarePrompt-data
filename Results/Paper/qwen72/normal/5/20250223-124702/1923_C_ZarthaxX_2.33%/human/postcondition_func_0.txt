The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` (the length of an array) and `q` (the number of queries). It then reads `n` integers into a list `nums`. The function calculates two auxiliary lists, `ones` and `sum`, where `ones[i]` is the count of `1`s in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1`, and `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. For each of the `q` queries, which specify a range `[l, r]` within `nums`, the function checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts of `1`s and the sum of differences within the specified range, respectively. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values and does not modify the input variables `nums`, `n`, or `q`.
