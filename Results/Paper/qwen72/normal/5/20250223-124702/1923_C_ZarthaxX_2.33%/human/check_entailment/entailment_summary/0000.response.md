Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem by precomputing two auxiliary arrays: `ones` and `sum`. These arrays help in efficiently answering the queries about whether a subarray is "good" or not.

1. **Precomputation:**
   - `ones[i]` is the count of `1`s from the start of the array up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` is the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` and 1. This is effectively the sum of all elements in `nums` from the start up to index `i-1` minus the number of elements (i.e., `sum[i] = (sum of nums[0] to nums[i-1]) - i`).

2. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]` is "good" by using the precomputed arrays.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition can be simplified to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
   - `onesInRange` is the count of `1`s in the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]`.
   - `sumInRange` is the sum of the differences between each element in the subarray `c[l]` to `c[r]` and 1.

3. **Simplification of the Condition:**
   - The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` can be interpreted as follows:
     - `onesInRange` is the number of `1`s in the subarray.
     - `(r - l + 1)` is the length of the subarray.
     - `sumInRange` is the sum of the differences between each element in the subarray and 1, which is equivalent to the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
   - The condition checks if the sum of the subarray minus the number of `1`s in the subarray is at least the length of the subarray. This ensures that there is enough "slack" to replace each element in the subarray with a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by immediately printing 'NO' because a subarray of length 1 cannot be good (since `a_i` must be different from `b_i`).

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The precomputation of `ones` and `sum` arrays takes O(n) time.
   - Each query is answered in O(1) time using the precomputed arrays.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is good based on the problem description.
