### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of `a` and stores it in `l`.
   - It also counts the occurrences of each element in the second half of `a` and stores it in `r`.

3. **Constructing the Subsets:**
   - The program attempts to construct the subset `l` by selecting elements that appear twice in the first half of `a`.
   - It prints these elements and keeps track of the number of elements selected (`ul`).
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, the program selects elements that appear once in the first half of `a` and prints them.
   - It also keeps track of the number of elements selected (`re`) and stores them in `res`.

5. **Constructing the Subset `r`:**
   - The program prints the elements stored in `res` to form the subset `r`.
   - It then attempts to construct the subset `r` by selecting elements that appear twice in the second half of `a` to match the length of `l`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed subsets `l` and `r`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Frequency Counting:**
  - The program incorrectly counts the frequency of elements in the first half of `a` and the second half of `a`. The arrays `l` and `r` are being used to count the occurrences of elements, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, the program should not be using `a[i] - 1` to index into `l` and `r` while counting the frequencies.
  - The correct approach would be to use a dictionary or a list to count the occurrences of each element in the first and second halves separately.

- **Incorrect Subset Construction:**
  - The program does not correctly ensure that the subsets `l` and `r` are of length `2k` and that their XOR values are equal.
  - The logic for selecting elements to form `l` and `r` is not robust and may not always produce valid subsets.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is 1 or when `n` is small.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
