### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `a` of 2n integers.
   - It initializes two lists `l` and `r` to keep track of the counts of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero, and an empty list `res` to store additional integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The function correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in the first half of `a` and stores them in `l`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the second half of `a` and stores them in `r`.

3. **Printing Pairs from the First Half:**
   - The function iterates through the first half of `a` and prints pairs of integers that appear twice in the first half until `k` pairs are printed.
   - It updates `ul` to keep track of the number of integers printed from the first half.

4. **Handling Remaining Integers:**
   - If fewer than `k` pairs are found, it prints additional integers from the first half that appear only once until a total of `2k` integers are printed.
   - It updates `re` to keep track of the number of additional integers printed and stores them in `res`.

5. **Printing Pairs from the Second Half:**
   - The function prints the remaining integers from the first half that were not printed in the previous steps.
   - It then iterates through the second half of `a` and prints pairs of integers that appear twice until the number of printed integers from the first half matches the number of printed integers from the second half.
   - It updates `ur` to keep track of the number of integers printed from the second half.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The function prints the required integers in the correct format for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for `r` Array:**
  - The function does not correctly handle the second half of the array `a` when printing pairs of integers that appear twice.
  - The loop that prints pairs from the second half of `a` should be based on the `r` array, but the function uses the `a` array directly, which can lead to incorrect output.

- **Mismatch in `ul` and `ur` Tracking:**
  - The function does not correctly ensure that the number of integers printed from the first half matches the number of integers printed from the second half.
  - The condition `if ul != ur` is not sufficient to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.

### Correctness:
- **False**
  - The function has logical issues in handling the second half of the array and ensuring that the number of integers printed from both halves match.
  - The function does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
