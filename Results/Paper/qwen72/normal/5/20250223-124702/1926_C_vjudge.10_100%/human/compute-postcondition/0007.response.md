The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `n` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the largest number written on the board for each test case, with the constraint \(1 \leq n_i \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) for each \(n_i\) in the list.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the largest number `n_i` is even, the function returns `True` for that test case; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `n` (a list of integers representing the largest number for each test case). It returns a list of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding largest number is even, and `False` if it is odd.**
