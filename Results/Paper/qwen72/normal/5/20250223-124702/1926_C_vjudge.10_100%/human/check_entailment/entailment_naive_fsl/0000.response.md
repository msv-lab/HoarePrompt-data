Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores these sums in a list. For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed sum for the given number and prints it. This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given time limit, as the precomputation is done once and each test case is handled in constant time. The logic for summing the digits of each number and updating the cumulative sum is also correct. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
