- The precomputation correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `inf`.
   - The cumulative sum is correctly stored in the `values` array.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and then processing each test case individually.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It efficiently precomputes the necessary values and processes each test case in constant time.

Correctness:
