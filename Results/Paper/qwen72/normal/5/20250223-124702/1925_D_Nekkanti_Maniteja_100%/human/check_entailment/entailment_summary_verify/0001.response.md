### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to avoid large numbers and ensure results fit within standard integer ranges.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the total number of pairs is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` of all pairs of friends.
   - This is done by reading `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adding these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions and calculates the expected sum of friendship values.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the increase in the friendship value of pairs chosen in previous excursions.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The final result is printed as `s % M`.

5. **Efficiency and Constraints:**
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using modular inverse and modular arithmetic, which are necessary for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The time complexity is \(O(m + k)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula used to update `s` is correct. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is indeed the sum of the expected increase due to previous excursions and the initial friendship values.
   - The use of the modular inverse `c` ensures that the probability of choosing any pair is correctly accounted for.

### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:

- **Initial Friendship Values:**
  - The initial sum of friendship values `a` is correctly calculated by summing up all `f` values from the input.

- **Expected Increase in Friendship Values:**
  - For each excursion, the expected increase in friendship value is given by the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
  - `c * i * c * m` accounts for the increase in friendship values due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions. This is because the probability of choosing any pair is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value for each pair is `i` (since the friendship value increases by 1 for each previous excursion).
  - `c * a` accounts for the initial friendship values of the pairs. This is because the probability of choosing any pair is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value for each pair is `a` (the sum of initial friendship values).

### Potential Issues:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
  - The calculation of the modular inverse `c` using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` is correct. This ensures that the probability of choosing any pair is correctly accounted for in modular arithmetic.

- **Summation of Expected Values:**
  - The summation of expected values in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is correct. However, the formula can be simplified to `s = s + c * (i * m + a)` to avoid redundant multiplications, which does not affect the correctness but can improve efficiency slightly.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion, taking into account the initial friendship values and the increase in friendship values due to previous excursions. The use of modular arithmetic and the modular inverse ensures that the results are within the required constraints.

Final: **True**
