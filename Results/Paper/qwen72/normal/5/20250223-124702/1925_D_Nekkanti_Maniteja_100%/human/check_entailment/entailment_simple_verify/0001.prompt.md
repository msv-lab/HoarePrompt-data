You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated based on the input. The variable `s` is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of all calculated values modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variable `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the input. The variable `c` is the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to avoid large numbers and ensure results fit within standard integer ranges.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the total number of pairs is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` of all pairs of friends.
   - This is done by reading `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adding these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions and calculates the expected sum of friendship values.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the increase in the friendship value of pairs chosen in previous excursions.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The final result is printed as `s % M`.

5. **Efficiency and Constraints:**
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using modular inverse and modular arithmetic, which are necessary for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The time complexity is \(O(m + k)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula used to update `s` is correct. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is indeed the sum of the expected increase due to previous excursions and the initial friendship values.
   - The use of the modular inverse `c` ensures that the probability of choosing any pair is correctly accounted for.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its approach and implementation. It correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values and handles the constraints efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
