Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen. However, the way it calculates the expected value is incorrect.
   - The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is not the correct way to compute the expected value. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated based on the probability of choosing a friend pair and the initial friendship values.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs plus the expected increase in friendship value due to the excursions.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is the probability of choosing a friend pair multiplied by the number of friend pairs and the number of excursions.

3. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic for the final result, but the way it accumulates the sum `s` is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen can be calculated as follows:
  - The probability of choosing a friend pair in any given excursion is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
  - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion is `m * (1 + (k - 1) * (m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)))`.
  - The initial sum of friendship values is `a`.
  - The total expected value is `a + k * (m * (1 + (k - 1) * (m / (n * (n - 1) // 2))))`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_increase = (m * (1 + (k - 1) * (m * c % M))) % M
        total_expected_value = (a + k * expected_increase) % M
        print(total_expected_value)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Pairs Calculation:** `total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2` calculates the total number of possible pairs of children.
- **Modular Inverse:** `c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)` calculates the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
- **Initial Friendship Sum:** `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values of all friend pairs.
- **Expected Increase:** `expected_increase` calculates the expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion.
- **Total Expected Value:** `total_expected_value` is the sum of the initial friendship values and the expected increase over k excursions, all taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
