Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails in cases where the order of participants in the screenshots does not allow a consistent order to be determined. Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 3
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
3 2 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the first screenshot shows the order `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the second shows `[2, 3, 1, 4]`, and the third shows `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. There is no consistent order of participants that can satisfy all three screenshots. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this case.
