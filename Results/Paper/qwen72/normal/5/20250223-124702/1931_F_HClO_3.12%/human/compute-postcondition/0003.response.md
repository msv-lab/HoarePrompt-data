The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: A positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: An integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of chat participants.
  - `k`: An integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of participants who posted screenshots.
  - `a`: A list of k lists, each containing n distinct integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}.

The function returns:
- For each test case, a list or a similar structure indicating the result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of k lists `a` where each inner list contains n distinct integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.**
