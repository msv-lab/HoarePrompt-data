### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array \(a\) is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of these differences. This can be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Sorting the Array:** The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - **Calculating Beauty:** It then iterates through the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Return Value:** The function returns the calculated beauty.

   However, sorting the array in ascending order does not maximize the beauty. Instead, we should consider the following:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should alternate the largest and smallest elements. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.
   - For example, if the array is \([1, 2, 3, 4]\), the optimal arrangement would be \([1, 4, 2, 3]\) or \([4, 1, 3, 2]\), which gives a beauty of \(3 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:** The function `func_2` reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - **Processing Test Cases:** It processes each test case by extracting the length \(n\) and the array elements, then calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
   - **Storing Results:** It stores the results in a list and prints them at the end.

   The input reading and processing part of `func_2` is correct. However, since `func_1` does not correctly maximize the beauty, the overall program will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. The correct approach would be to alternate the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
