Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in either ascending or descending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized when the elements are in a sorted order.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
- **Calculating Beauty**: It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Return Value**: The function returns this sum, which is the beauty of the sorted array.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Reading Input**: The function `func_2` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
- **Extracting Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases \(t\) and the arrays for each test case.
- **Applying `func_1`**: For each array, it calls `func_1` to calculate the maximum beauty.
- **Storing and Printing Results**: It stores the results in a list and prints them after processing all test cases.

### Verification:
- **Example 1**: For the array \([2, 1, 3]\), sorting it gives \([1, 2, 3]\). The beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\).
- **Example 2**: For the array \([69, 69, 69]\), sorting it gives \([69, 69, 69]\). The beauty is \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\).
- **Example 3**: For the array \([100, 54, 80, 43, 90]\), sorting it gives \([43, 54, 80, 90, 100]\). The beauty is \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
- **Example 4**: For the array \([3, 4, 3, 3]\), sorting it gives \([3, 3, 3, 4]\). The beauty is \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\).
- **Example 5**: For the array \([2, 1]\), sorting it gives \([1, 2]\). The beauty is \((2 - 1) = 1\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to sort the array and calculate the maximum beauty. The input and output handling in `func_2` is also correct, and it processes multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
