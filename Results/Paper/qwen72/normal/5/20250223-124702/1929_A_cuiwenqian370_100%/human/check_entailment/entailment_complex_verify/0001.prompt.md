You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers with a length of at least 2.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: `beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `array`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `array`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` with a length of at least 2. It sorts the list in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list. The function returns this sum, which represents the "beauty" of the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables in the function signature.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []

        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input read, `t` is equal to the integer value of the first element in `data`, `index` is equal to `1 + t * (1 + n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in each array processed in the loop, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `input` is still a reference to the `read` method of `sys.stdin`, `data` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop. Each element in `results` has been printed to the console.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple arrays, applies another function `func_1` to each array, and prints the results of these applications. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input state remains unchanged, and the results of `func_1` for each array are printed to the console.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array \(a\) is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of these differences. This can be achieved by arranging the array in such a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - **Sorting the Array:** The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - **Calculating Beauty:** It then iterates through the sorted array and calculates the beauty by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Return Value:** The function returns the calculated beauty.

   However, sorting the array in ascending order does not maximize the beauty. Instead, we should consider the following:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should alternate the largest and smallest elements. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.
   - For example, if the array is \([1, 2, 3, 4]\), the optimal arrangement would be \([1, 4, 2, 3]\) or \([4, 1, 3, 2]\), which gives a beauty of \(3 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:** The function `func_2` reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - **Processing Test Cases:** It processes each test case by extracting the length \(n\) and the array elements, then calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
   - **Storing Results:** It stores the results in a list and prints them at the end.

   The input reading and processing part of `func_2` is correct. However, since `func_1` does not correctly maximize the beauty, the overall program will not produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not maximize the beauty of the array as required by the problem statement. The correct approach would be to alternate the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
