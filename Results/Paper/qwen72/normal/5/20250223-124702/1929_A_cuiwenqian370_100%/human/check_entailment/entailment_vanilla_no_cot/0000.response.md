Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which calculates the beauty of the array after sorting it. However, sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty, as the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest elements in the array. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[4, 1, 3, 2]`, which would give a beauty of `(4-1) + (3-2) = 3 + 1 = 4`.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array), 2):
        beauty += (array[-1] - array[0])
        array = array[1:-1]
    return beauty
```

This function sorts the array and then alternates the largest and smallest elements, calculating the beauty as the sum of the differences between these pairs.

However, the above function can be optimized further to avoid repeatedly sorting and slicing the array. The maximum beauty can be calculated directly from the sorted array:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty
```

This function correctly calculates the maximum beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.

The `func_2` function reads input correctly and processes multiple test cases, so it is not the source of the error. However, the overall program is incorrect due to the flawed `func_1` function.
