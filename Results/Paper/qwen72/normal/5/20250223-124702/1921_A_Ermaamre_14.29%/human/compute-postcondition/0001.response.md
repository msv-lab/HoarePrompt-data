The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `a` is an input integer, but it does not specify that `a` must be greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `a` is greater than 0.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
