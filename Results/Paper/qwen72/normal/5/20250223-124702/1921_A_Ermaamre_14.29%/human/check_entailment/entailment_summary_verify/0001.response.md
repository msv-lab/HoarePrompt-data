### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the x-coordinates of two pairs of points are equal. This is a valid approach because for a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, opposite corners will have the same x-coordinates.
   - There are three conditions to check for the pairs of x-coordinates:
     - `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`
     - `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`
     - `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`
   - These conditions cover all possible pairings of the x-coordinates for the given points.

3. **Side Length Calculation:**
   - For each valid pairing of x-coordinates, the program calculates the side length of the square by taking the absolute difference of the y-coordinates of the points with the same x-coordinates.
   - The program uses `abs(y3 - y1)` or `abs(y2 - y1)` to ensure the side length is positive.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`res ** 2`).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the area for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Handling of y-coordinates:**
  - The program assumes that the y-coordinates will be in a specific order, but the problem states that the coordinates are given in random order. This means the program might not correctly identify the side length if the y-coordinates are not in the expected order.
  - For example, if the coordinates are `(1, 2)`, `(4, 5)`, `(1, 5)`, `(4, 2)`, the program will correctly identify the side length as `3` and the area as `9`.
  - However, if the coordinates are `(1, 5)`, `(4, 2)`, `(1, 2)`, `(4, 5)`, the program will not correctly identify the side length because it does not handle all possible permutations of the y-coordinates.

### Correct Approach:
- To handle all possible permutations of the coordinates, the program should:
  - Store all x-coordinates and y-coordinates in separate lists.
  - Find the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
  - The side length of the square is the absolute difference between the unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since they are the same for a square).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Collect all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [x1, x2, x3, x4]
        y_coords = [y1, y2, y3, y4]
        
        # Find the unique x and y coordinates
        unique_x = list(set(x_coords))
        unique_y = list(set(y_coords))
        
        # Calculate the side length
        side_length = abs(unique_x[0] - unique_x[1])
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        
        # Print the area
        print(area)
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible permutations of the coordinates, leading to potential incorrect side length calculations.

Final: **False**
