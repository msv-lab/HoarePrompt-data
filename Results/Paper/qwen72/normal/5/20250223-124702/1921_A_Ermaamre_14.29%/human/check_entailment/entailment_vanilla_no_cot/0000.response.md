Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly handle all possible configurations of the square's corners. The logic in the program only checks for specific pairs of coordinates to determine the side length of the square, which may not always be correct. The correct approach should be to find the unique x and y coordinates and then calculate the side length based on the differences between these unique coordinates.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        corners = []
        for j in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            corners.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract unique x and y coordinates
        x_coords = sorted(set(x for (x, y) in corners))
        y_coords = sorted(set(y for (x, y) in corners))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = abs(x_coords[1] - x_coords[0])
        
        # Print the area of the square
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

This version of the program correctly extracts the unique x and y coordinates, calculates the side length of the square, and then prints the area. It will work for any valid input configuration of the square's corners.
