The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. These strings represent the initial and desired positions of cats in the boxes, respectively. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1` has '0' and `s2` has '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `s1` (a string of '0' and '1' characters), and `s2` (a string of '0' and '1' characters), all of length `n`. It returns the maximum number of operations required to either add or remove cats to transform the initial positions (`s1`) into the desired positions (`s2`).**
