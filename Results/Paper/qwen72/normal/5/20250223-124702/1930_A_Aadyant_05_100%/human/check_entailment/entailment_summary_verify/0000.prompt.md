You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of lists to process. For each of the `n` lists, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). It stores these sums in a list `final` and then prints each sum on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `final` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the sum of the sorted even-indexed elements from the corresponding input list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input list has an odd number of elements. According to the problem description, the input list should always have 2n elements, which means it should always be even. However, the program does not check if the input list length is even, and it assumes that it will always be even. If an odd number of elements is provided (which should not happen according to the problem constraints but is a potential edge case), the program will incorrectly add the last element to the score, which is not part of a pair.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input is not a valid integer or the input list contains non-integer values. For example, if the input list contains a non-integer value like "a", the program will raise a ValueError when trying to convert it to an integer.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
2
1 1 2 a
```
The program will raise a ValueError when trying to convert "a" to an integer. This indicates that the program is not robust and does not handle invalid inputs gracefully.

To ensure correctness, the program should:
1. Validate that the input list length is even.
2. Handle non-integer values in the input list.
3. Ensure that the input values are within the specified range (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input().strip().split()
        if len(b) != 2 * n:
            raise ValueError("Input list length is not 2n")
        list2 = []
        for str in b:
            try:
                num = int(str)
                if not (1 <= num <= 10**7):
                    raise ValueError("Input value out of range")
                list2.append(num)
            except ValueError:
                raise ValueError("Invalid input value")
        list2.sort()
        s = sum(list2[i] for i in range(0, len(list2), 2))
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
```

This version of the program includes input validation to ensure that the input list length is 2n and that all elements are valid integers within the specified range.
