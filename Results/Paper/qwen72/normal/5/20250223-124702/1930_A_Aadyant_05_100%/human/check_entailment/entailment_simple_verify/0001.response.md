### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `final` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs of integers (i.e., `n`).
   - It then reads the next line of input, which contains the `2n` integers, and splits this line into a list of strings `list1`.
   - It converts each string in `list1` to an integer and appends it to `list2`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The program sorts `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers together. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired first.

4. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program initializes a score `s` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list `list2` in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair (which is the smaller number due to sorting) to the score `s`.

5. **Storing and Printing the Results**:
   - After calculating the score for each test case, it appends the score to the `final` list.
   - Finally, it prints each score in the `final` list.

### Analysis:

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and the number of integers `a` for each test case.
  - However, there is a redundancy in the input handling. The variable `a` is read but not used. This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program.

- **Sorting the List**:
  - Sorting the list `list2` in ascending order is the correct approach to ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together, which maximizes the score.

- **Calculating the Score**:
  - The program correctly iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2 and adds the first number of each pair to the score `s`.
  - This approach is optimal for maximizing the score, as it always pairs the smallest available numbers.

- **Storing and Printing the Results**:
  - The program correctly appends the calculated score to the `final` list and prints each score at the end.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The minor redundancy in reading the variable `a` does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
