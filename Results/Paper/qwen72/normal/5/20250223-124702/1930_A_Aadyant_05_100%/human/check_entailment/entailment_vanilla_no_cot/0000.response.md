Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading and Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the integer `n` which represents the number of pairs of integers.
   - It reads the next line, which contains `2n` integers, and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It converts each string in the list to an integer and appends it to `list2`.
3. **Sorting and Summing**:
   - The list `list2` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The program iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score `s`. This is because the minimum value in each pair will always be one of the smaller elements in the sorted list.
4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the final scores for each test case.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible score is achieved by always selecting the smallest available number in each pair, which is the optimal strategy for this problem.

Here is the program with some minor improvements for clarity:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    final_scores = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Number of pairs
        list1 = input().split()  # Read and split the 2n integers
        list2 = [int(x) for x in list1]  # Convert to integers
        list2.sort()  # Sort the list
        
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            score += list2[i]  # Add the minimum value of each pair
        final_scores.append(score)
    
    for score in final_scores:
        print(score)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version of the program is functionally equivalent to the original and maintains the correctness.
