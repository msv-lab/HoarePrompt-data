The function reads an integer `n` from the user, indicating the number of lists to process. For each of the `n` lists, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). It stores these sums in a list `final` and then prints each sum on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `final` is a list of `n` integers, each representing the sum of the sorted even-indexed elements from the corresponding input list.
