Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of subarrays of length `m` in array `a` that contain at least `k` elements matching the elements in array `b`. The solution uses a sliding window approach to efficiently count the matches in each subarray of length `m` as it moves through `a`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` (`b_freq`).
   - It initializes a sliding window of the first `m` elements in `a` and counts their frequencies (`window_freq`).

3. **Initial Match Calculation**:
   - It calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the sliding window and the elements in `b` by summing the minimum of the frequencies of common elements.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program then slides the window one element at a time from the start to the end of `a`.
   - For each new position of the window, it updates the match count by:
     - Subtracting the match count of the element that is leaving the window.
     - Adding the match count of the element that is entering the window.
   - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k` and increments the `good_subarrays` counter if true.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it performs a final check to see if the last window position meets the condition.

The program correctly implements the sliding window approach and handles the frequency matching efficiently. The provided execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` returns the correct number of good subarrays for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
