### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses the `Counter` class from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` (stored in `b_freq`).
   - It also counts the frequency of the first `m` elements of `a` (stored in `window_freq`).

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the first `m` elements of `a` and the elements of `b` by summing the minimum of the frequencies of common elements in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the first `m` elements to the last `m` elements.
   - For each new position of the window, it updates the `matches` count by:
     - Decreasing the count for the element that is sliding out of the window.
     - Increasing the count for the element that is sliding into the window.
   - It also updates the `window_freq` to reflect the current window.

5. **Counting Good Subarrays:**
   - The program increments the `good_subarrays` count whenever the `matches` count is greater than or equal to `k`.

6. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check to see if the last window is a good subarray.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly initializes the frequency counts for `b` and the first `m` elements of `a`.
- The sliding window approach is used to efficiently update the frequency counts and the number of matches.
- The logic for updating the `matches` count when elements slide in and out of the window is correct.
- The final check ensures that the last window is also considered.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output formats correctly, uses an efficient sliding window approach, and correctly counts the number of good subarrays.

### Correctness:
**True**
