Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n and 1 <= k <= m, each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6, and `good_subarrays` is 0.** 

The variable `good_subarrays` has been initialized to 0, while the lists `a` and `b` and the integer `k` remain unchanged.
