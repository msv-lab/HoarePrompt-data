The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`. It then calculates the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2. This result is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the printed output for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained in the function's scope.
