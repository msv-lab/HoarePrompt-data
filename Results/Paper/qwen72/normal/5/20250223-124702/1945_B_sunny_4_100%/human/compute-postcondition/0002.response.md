The only objects in the loop head are the variable `qi` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `qi` should start from 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.
- `A` is `int(m/a) + 1`.
- `B` is `int(m/b) + 1`.
- `A + B` is printed.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `qi` should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 0**
