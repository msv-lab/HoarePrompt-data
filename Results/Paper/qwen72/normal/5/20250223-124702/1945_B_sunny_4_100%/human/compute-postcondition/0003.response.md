Output State: **For each test case, the output is the sum of the integer division of m by a, the integer division of m by b, and 2. The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, the values of a, b, and m are read from input, and the result is printed. After all iterations, the values of t, a, b, and m remain unchanged, but the output for each test case is printed.**
