You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

After all iterations, the values of t, a, b, and m remain unchanged, but the output for each test case is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at different intervals (`a` and `b` minutes).
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - The first installation launches fireworks at times `a, 2a, 3a, ...`.
   - The second installation launches fireworks at times `b, 2b, 3b, ...`.
   - We need to find the maximum overlap of fireworks from both installations.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // a + 1`.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation within `m + 1` minutes is `m // b + 1`.
   - The total number of fireworks launched within `m + 1` minutes is the sum of the above two values.
   - However, we need to consider the possibility of a firework from one installation overlapping with a firework from the other installation.

4. **Overlap Calculation:**
   - The overlap occurs when a firework from the first installation and a firework from the second installation are launched within `m + 1` minutes of each other.
   - The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is the sum of the fireworks launched by both installations plus one additional firework for each overlap.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m + 1` minutes using `m // a + 1` and `m // b + 1`.
   - It then adds 2 to the sum of these values and prints the result.

6. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly adds 2 to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the number of overlaps and add that to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it adds 2 to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations, which is not the correct way to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The correct approach should be to calculate the number of overlaps and add that to the sum of the number of fireworks launched by both installations.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within m + 1 minutes
        fireworks_a = (m + 1) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + 1) // b
        # Calculate the number of overlaps
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        overlaps = (m + 1) // lcm
        # The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously
        ans = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlaps
        print(ans)

# Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD)
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **fireworks_a** and **fireworks_b** are calculated as the number of fireworks launched by each installation within `m + 1` minutes.
- **lcm** (Least Common Multiple) is calculated using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
- **overlaps** is the number of times both installations launch a firework at the same time within `m + 1` minutes.
- The final answer is the sum of the fireworks launched by both installations minus the number of overlaps.
