The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case, and an additional parameter `t` that specifies the number of test cases. Each of these parameters is an integer. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and for each test case, `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the inputs is not provided in the example. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general notion that the function processes these parameters to produce some output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
