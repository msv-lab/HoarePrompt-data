Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of finding the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the answer.

The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2 to the result. However, this approach does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2. This is because:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times 6, 12, 18, ...
- The second installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, ...

The only time both fireworks are visible simultaneously is after 7 minutes (from 7 to 11 minutes).

However, the program outputs:
```
3
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly handle the overlapping visibility periods.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the following:
1. Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period.
2. Determine the overlap between the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.
3. The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is the sum of the fireworks launched by each installation minus the overlap, plus 1 (since the overlap itself counts as a single time when both are visible).

A correct implementation would look something like this:
```python
def max_fireworks_visible(t, test_cases):
    for a, b, m in test_cases:
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation
        fireworks_a = (m + a) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b) // b
        
        # Calculate the overlap
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        overlap = (m + lcm) // lcm
        
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously
        max_visible = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlap
        print(max_visible)

from math import gcd

t = int(input())
test_cases = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(t)]
max_fireworks_visible(t, test_cases)
```

This approach correctly handles the overlapping visibility periods and ensures the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is calculated accurately.
