Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period
        fireworks_a = (m + a) // a
        fireworks_b = (m + b) // b
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks
        lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
        overlapping_fireworks = (m + lcm) // lcm
        
        # The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously
        max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlapping_fireworks + 1
        
        print(max_fireworks)

from math import gcd

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period:**
   - `fireworks_a = (m + a) // a` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation that are visible at any point within the `m + 1` minute visibility period.
   - `fireworks_b = (m + b) // b` calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation that are visible at any point within the `m + 1` minute visibility period.

2. **Calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`:**
   - `lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)` calculates the LCM of `a` and `b`, which is the time interval at which both installations launch a firework simultaneously.

3. **Calculate the number of overlapping fireworks:**
   - `overlapping_fireworks = (m + lcm) // lcm` calculates the number of times both installations launch a firework within the `m + 1` minute visibility period.

4. **Calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously:**
   - `max_fireworks = fireworks_a + fireworks_b - overlapping_fireworks + 1` accounts for the total number of fireworks launched by both installations, subtracts the overlapping fireworks, and adds 1 to account for the initial overlap.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
