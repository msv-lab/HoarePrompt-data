Output State: **The function will print the area of each square for each test case, calculated as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the square's corners. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the variable `a` will contain the coordinates of the last processed square. The list `x` will contain the x-coordinates of the last processed square, and `dx` will contain the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the last processed square.**
