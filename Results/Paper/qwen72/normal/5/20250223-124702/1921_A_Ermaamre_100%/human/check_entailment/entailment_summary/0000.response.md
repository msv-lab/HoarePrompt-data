Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It then extracts the x-coordinates of these points and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. This difference is the side length of the square, and the area is calculated by squaring this difference. The program prints the area for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue with the program. The problem statement guarantees that the input points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the side length of the square can be determined by either the difference in x-coordinates or the difference in y-coordinates. The program only considers the difference in x-coordinates, which might not always be correct if the square is oriented such that the y-coordinates vary more than the x-coordinates.

To ensure correctness, the program should also check the difference in y-coordinates and use the smaller of the two differences to calculate the area. However, since the problem guarantees that the input forms a valid square, the difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates should be the same. Therefore, using only the x-coordinates is sufficient.

Given the problem's constraints and the fact that the input is guaranteed to form a valid square, the program is correct as it stands.

Correctness: **True**
