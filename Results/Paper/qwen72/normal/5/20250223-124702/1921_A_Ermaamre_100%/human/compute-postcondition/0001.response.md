To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.

- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, and it has been assigned the value of the input integer.

Since `t` is already within the range 1 to 100, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `_` is a placeholder**
