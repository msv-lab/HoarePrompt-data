You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four tuples of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the square's corners. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `a` contains the coordinates of the last processed square, `x` contains the x-coordinates of the last processed square, and `dx` contains the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the last processed square.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the coordinates are given in a random order, and it assumes that the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will always correspond to the correct side length of the square. However, this is not always true. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```

The program will calculate the side length as `dx = max(x) - min(x) = 2 - 1 = 1`, and thus the area as `1 * 1 = 1`. However, the correct area of the square is `1 * 1 = 1`, but the program should also consider the y-coordinates to determine the side length correctly. In this case, the side length should be `dy = max(y) - min(y) = 2 - 1 = 1`, and the area should be `1 * 1 = 1`. The program fails to handle this correctly.

To fix this, the program should calculate both `dx` and `dy` and ensure they are equal, then return the area as `dx * dx` or `dy * dy`. If `dx` and `dy` are not equal, the input points do not form a square, and the program should handle this case appropriately.
