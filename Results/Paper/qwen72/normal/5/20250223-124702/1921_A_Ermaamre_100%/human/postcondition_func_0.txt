The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four tuples of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case, which is the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the square's corners. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, `a` contains the coordinates of the last processed square, `x` contains the x-coordinates of the last processed square, and `dx` contains the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the last processed square.
