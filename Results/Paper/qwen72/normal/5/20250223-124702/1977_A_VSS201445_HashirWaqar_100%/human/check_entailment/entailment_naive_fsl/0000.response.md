Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n < m`. According to the problem description, if `n < m`, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the program only checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not consider the case where `n < m` should always result in "NO". 

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if `n < m` and return "NO" in that case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n < m:
            print('NO')
        elif n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This version correctly handles all cases, including when `n < m`.
