### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can perform two types of moves: adding a cube or removing a cube.
   - After \( n \) moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The initial height of the tower is 0 cubes.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - For the tower to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves, the number of "add" moves must be exactly \( m \) more than the number of "remove" moves.
   - Let \( a \) be the number of "add" moves and \( r \) be the number of "remove" moves.
   - We have the equations:
     - \( a + r = n \) (total moves)
     - \( a - r = m \) (net cubes added)

3. **Solving the Equations:**
   - Adding the two equations:
     - \( (a + r) + (a - r) = n + m \)
     - \( 2a = n + m \)
     - \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \)
   - Subtracting the second equation from the first:
     - \( (a + r) - (a - r) = n - m \)
     - \( 2r = n - m \)
     - \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \)

4. **Constraints:**
   - Both \( a \) and \( r \) must be non-negative integers.
   - \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \) must be an integer, which means \( n + m \) must be even.
   - \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \) must be an integer, which means \( n - m \) must be even.
   - Since \( n \) and \( m \) are both integers, \( n + m \) and \( n - m \) will both be even if and only if \( n \) and \( m \) are either both even or both odd.

5. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - \( n \ge m \): This ensures that the number of moves is at least the number of cubes needed.
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, meaning \( n \) and \( m \) are either both even or both odd.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - The conditions \( n \ge m \) and \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) are both necessary and sufficient for the problem.
