The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as it represents the number of test cases `t`. The loop will not execute if the input is 0 or negative.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100)**
