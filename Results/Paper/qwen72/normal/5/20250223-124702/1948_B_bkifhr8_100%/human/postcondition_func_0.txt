The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `m` and an array `arr` of `m` integers. It then checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits followed by the next element. If the array can be made non-decreasing, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final output is a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
