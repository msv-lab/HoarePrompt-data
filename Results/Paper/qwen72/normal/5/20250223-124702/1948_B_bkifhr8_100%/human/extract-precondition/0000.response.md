Precondition: **The function `func` is intended to be part of a larger program or script that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer array `a` of length `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element `a_i` in the array is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should be called within a loop or similar construct that iterates over the test cases, each of which is defined by the integer `n` and the array `a`.**
