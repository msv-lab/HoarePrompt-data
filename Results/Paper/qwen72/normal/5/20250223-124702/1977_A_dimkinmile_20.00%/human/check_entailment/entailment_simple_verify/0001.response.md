### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, which is appropriate for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, which is correct for parsing the input.

3. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".
   - However, this logic is insufficient to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The correct condition should be whether `n - m` is even, as explained in the original assessment.

4. **Correct Condition:**
   - For Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of `k` removals and `n - k` additions must result in `m` cubes.
   - The condition `n - m` being even ensures that the number of removals and additions can balance out to achieve the desired number of cubes.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 0` (even), so the answer should be "Yes".
   - For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, `n - m = -2` (even), but `n < m`, so the answer should be "No".
   - For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, `n - m = 2` (even), so the answer should be "Yes".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program's logic is insufficient. The program should check if `n - m` is even to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
