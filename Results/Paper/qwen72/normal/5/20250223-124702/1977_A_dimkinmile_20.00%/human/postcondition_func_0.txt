The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from user input, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. After reading the input, the function prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and prints 'No' if `n` is less than `m`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `m` are retained in the program.
