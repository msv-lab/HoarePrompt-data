Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The program checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" if true, otherwise "No". However, this logic is incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of removing cubes. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program will print "No" because `n < m`, but it is actually possible to achieve a tower of 4 cubes after 2 moves if Nikita first puts 2 cubes and then continues to add more cubes in subsequent moves. The correct logic should check if `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd) or if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If either condition is true, then it is possible to achieve the desired tower height.
