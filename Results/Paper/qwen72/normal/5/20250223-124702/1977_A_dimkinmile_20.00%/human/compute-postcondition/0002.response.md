The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state mentions that `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
- However, the `print` statement does not reference any variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'Yes'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
