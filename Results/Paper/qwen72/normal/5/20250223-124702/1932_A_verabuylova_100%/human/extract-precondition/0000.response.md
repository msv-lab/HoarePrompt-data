Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') where the first character is always '.'.** 

However, the provided function definition `def func():` does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def max_coins(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the integer `n` and the string representing the path.
