Output State: **The loop processes each test case and prints the optimal position to split the string `s` into two parts such that the number of '0's in the left part and the number of '1's in the right part are as close as possible to half of the length of the string. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, and `s` will have been used and reset for each test case, but the values of `t` provided by the user will remain unchanged. The internal variables `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will be reset and used for each test case, and their final values will depend on the last test case processed.**
