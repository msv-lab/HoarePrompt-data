Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to handle the movement of entities on the grid, but it incorrectly unpacks the `b` parameter, which is a tuple representing the direction of movement, into `dx` and `dy`. However, the `b` parameter is correctly passed as a tuple, so the issue is not with the unpacking itself but with the description of the problem in the execution summary, which incorrectly states that `b` is not a tuple.

The actual issue is that the function `func_1` should also handle the movement of the Quaffle when a player throws it. The current implementation only moves players and does not account for the Quaffle's movement. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

Moreover, the program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, which is a critical part of the game rules.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
