### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length in `num_list`. This is an efficient way to group and count the sticks by their lengths.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{3}\) and adds it to `res`. This is correct because if all three sticks have the same length, they can form a degenerate triangle.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count\) and adds it to `res`. This is incorrect because choosing two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length will always result in a degenerate triangle (since \(2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}\) which is not greater than \(2^b\) if \(b > a\)).

4. **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
   - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - Given that the stick lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if the three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than a larger power of 2 (e.g., \(2^a + 2^b < 2^c\) if \(a, b < c\)).

5. **Combination Calculations:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using \(\binom{cnt}{3}\).
   - However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. This should not be included in the count of valid triangles.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks of the same length by not adding any combinations to `res`.
   - It also handles the case where there are no valid triangles by printing 0.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks when all three sticks have the same length. However, it incorrectly includes the count of combinations where two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length, which always results in a degenerate triangle. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
