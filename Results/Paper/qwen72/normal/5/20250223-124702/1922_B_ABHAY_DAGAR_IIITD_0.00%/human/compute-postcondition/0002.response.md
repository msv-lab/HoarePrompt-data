Output State: **`results` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square. The lengths of the sticks are determined by 2 raised to the power of the exponents given in each test case. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases, and each element in `results` corresponds to the respective test case in `test_cases`.**
