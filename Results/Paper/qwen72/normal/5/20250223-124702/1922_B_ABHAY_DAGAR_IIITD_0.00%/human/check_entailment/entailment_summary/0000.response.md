Reasoning:

The provided program is intended to solve a problem where the goal is to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a given set of sticks, such that these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. However, the execution summary incorrectly describes the program's objective. The summary states that the program calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the product of their lengths is a perfect square, which is not the problem described in the problem statement.

The program actually works as follows:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - It counts the frequency of each exponent in the list `num_list` and stores it in a dictionary `num_of_lens`.

3. **Triangle Formation Calculation:**
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same exponent (i.e., sticks of the same length) using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from the same exponent and one stick from a different exponent using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count \).

4. **Result Accumulation and Output:**
   - It accumulates the results for each test case in a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result.

The program correctly calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks. The key point is that for a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length (i.e., the same exponent).

The program correctly handles this by:
- Counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
- Counting the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, which is not possible for forming a non-degenerate triangle with lengths that are powers of 2.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
