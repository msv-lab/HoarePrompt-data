### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program expects three integers per test case, but it incorrectly assigns them to `(a, b, c)`. According to the problem description, the input should be `(n, a, b)`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program reads three integers per test case, but the variables are misnamed. This is a clear issue that needs to be corrected.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the logic inside the function is incorrect. The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This does not make sense because `c` is not defined in the problem description, and the comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying them using the promotion price.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program is performing an incorrect calculation. The variable `d` is not relevant to the problem, and the comparison `a * b < a * d` is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly suggests that the program should calculate the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price. The correct logic should involve calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
   - The annotated code does not provide the correct logic for this calculation. The program should calculate the total cost by considering the number of pairs and the remaining single yogurts.

### Corrected Version:
The corrected version provided in the original assessment is accurate and aligns with the problem description:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        single_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + single_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The program as given is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is the correct solution.

Final: **False**
