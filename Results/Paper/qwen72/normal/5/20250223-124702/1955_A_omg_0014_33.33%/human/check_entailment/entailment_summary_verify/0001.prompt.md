You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It calculates `d` as `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of `a * d`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the calculations for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input during each iteration and are not retained between iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `n` times, which is also correct as it processes each test case individually.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. However, the problem description specifies that the inputs should be `n`, `a`, and `b` where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The program incorrectly reads the inputs as `a`, `b`, and `c`, which does not match the problem description.

4. **Calculations**:
   - The program calculates `d = c / 2`, which is intended to represent the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotion price. However, since `c` is not the correct input, this calculation is incorrect.
   - The program then checks if `a * b < a * d` and prints `a * b` if true, otherwise it prints `round(a * d)`. This logic is flawed because:
     - `a * b` should be the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `a * d` should be the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price, but `d` is not correctly calculated.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be to compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is `(n // 2) * b`.
   - The cost of buying any remaining yogurts at the regular price is `(n % 2) * a`.
   - The total cost should be the sum of these two costs: `(n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a`.

6. **Output**: The program should print the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly read the inputs and does not implement the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
