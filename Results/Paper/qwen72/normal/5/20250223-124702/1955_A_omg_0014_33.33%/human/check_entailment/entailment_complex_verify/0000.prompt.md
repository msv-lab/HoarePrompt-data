You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: The loop will execute n times, and for each iteration, it will read three integers a, b, and c from the input. It will then calculate d as c / 2. If a * b is less than a * d, it will print a * b; otherwise, it will print the rounded value of a * d. The values of t and n remain unchanged, and the values of a, b, and c are read from input during each iteration and are not retained between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It calculates `d` as `c / 2`. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of `a * d`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the calculations for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input during each iteration and are not retained between iterations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func()` does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects three integers per test case, but it incorrectly assigns them to `(a, b, c)`. According to the problem description, the input should be `(n, a, b)`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The program should be reading `(n, a, b)` instead of `(a, b, c)`.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside the function is incorrect. The program calculates `d = c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This does not make sense because `c` is not defined in the problem description, and the comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying them using the promotion price.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program should calculate the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price. The correct logic should involve calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotion price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price
        single_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # Total minimum cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + single_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price and the regular price.
