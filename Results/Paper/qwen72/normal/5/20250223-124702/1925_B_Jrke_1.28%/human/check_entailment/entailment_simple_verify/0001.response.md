### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires breaking a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of these sub-problems equals `x`.
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of these sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the average difficulty of the sub-problems if they were all of equal difficulty.
   - If `k == 1`, it means that the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, so the GCD is 1.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - The loop iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x` in steps of 2 (to only consider odd divisors).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `x`, it checks if `i` or `x // i` can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum value among the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Case `k == 1`**: If `k == 1`, the program correctly prints 1, which is the correct GCD because the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1.
   - **Loop Iteration**:
     - The loop iterates over possible divisors of `x` starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x` in steps of 2. This is a valid approach to find all divisors of `x` efficiently.
     - For each divisor `i`, the program checks if `i` or `x // i` can be used as the difficulty of the sub-problems by ensuring they are less than or equal to `k`.
     - The program updates `ans` to the maximum value among the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if they are valid.
   - **GCD Calculation**:
     - The program aims to find the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k` and can divide `x` into `n` sub-problems. This is a valid approach to maximize the GCD.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - **Prime `x` and `n > 1`**: If `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1, the only possible GCD is 1, which the program correctly handles.
     - **Composite `x` and `n == 1`**: If `n` is 1, the GCD is `x` itself, which the program correctly handles by setting `k = x` and `ans = x`.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The loop runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient for the given constraints.
   - The program avoids unnecessary checks by only considering divisors that are less than or equal to `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly solves the problem by finding the maximum GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties. It handles all edge cases and uses an efficient approach to find the solution.

Final: **True**
