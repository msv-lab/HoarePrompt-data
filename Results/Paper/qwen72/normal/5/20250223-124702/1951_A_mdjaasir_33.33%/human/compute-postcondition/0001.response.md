The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `start` and `end` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0 (the initial value for the range function).

State: **`start` and `end` are integers, and `start` <= `end`; `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
