### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The program initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It uses a loop to perform binary search, which is a standard approach for narrowing down the search range.

3. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as `left + 1 < right`.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` and updates the `seen` array to mark the elements that have been considered.
   - If `p[mid] <= x`, it updates `left` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`.

4. **Result Checking**:
   - After the loop, if `p[left] == x`, it prints 0, indicating no swaps were needed.
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` array, it prints 1 and the indices to swap `x` to the correct position.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` array but not at the correct position, it prints 2 and the indices to swap `x` and another element to the correct position.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position but can be moved with one swap.
   - For the case where two swaps are needed, it correctly identifies the elements to swap.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that it performs no more than 2 swaps, which is within the problem constraints.
   - The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`, which is also handled by the program.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It reads the input, performs the binary search, and outputs the correct number of swaps and the indices to swap. The logic for handling the different cases (0, 1, or 2 swaps) is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
