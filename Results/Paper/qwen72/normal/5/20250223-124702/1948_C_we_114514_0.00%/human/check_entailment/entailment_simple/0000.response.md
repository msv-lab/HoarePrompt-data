### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows, storing them in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function processes each test case by iterating through the grid.
   - It initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - The loop iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Logic for Movement:**
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating it can move to the second row).
       - Otherwise, it continues to the next column.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (indicating it can no longer stay in the first row).
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating it can move to the second row).

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for `reachable_second_row`:**
  - The logic for `reachable_second_row` is flawed. Once the robot moves to the second row, it should continue to check if it can reach the end of the second row.
  - The current implementation only checks if the robot can move to the second row and then stops checking further movements in the second row.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot should be able to move between rows and continue checking the arrows in the second row until it reaches the end or gets stuck.
- The current implementation does not handle this correctly, as it only sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` once and does not continue to check the subsequent columns in the second row.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the robot can move between rows and continue checking the arrows in the second row.

### Example of Failure:
- For the test case:
  - `n = 4`
  - `row1 = ">>><"`
  - `row2 = ">><<"`
- The current program would incorrectly output `NO` because it does not continue to check the second row after the robot moves to it.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
