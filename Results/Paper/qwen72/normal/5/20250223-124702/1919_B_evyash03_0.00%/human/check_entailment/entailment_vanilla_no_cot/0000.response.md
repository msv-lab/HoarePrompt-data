Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum possible penalty, but it does not follow the optimal strategy for splitting the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it seems to count the number of times the balance (sum of elements) goes below zero and then adds a penalty if the final balance is positive. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

For example, in the third test case where the input is `"+-+-+-"`, the correct output should be `0` because the array can be split into subarrays with a sum of zero, such as `([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1])`. However, the provided function would not correctly handle this case and would likely return a non-zero value.

A correct approach would involve considering all possible splits of the array and calculating the penalty for each split to find the minimum possible penalty. This is a more complex problem that requires dynamic programming or a similar approach to solve efficiently.
