Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each `+` in the string corresponds to `1` in an array `a`, and each `-` corresponds to `-1`.
   - We need to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as \( p(c) = | \sum_{i=1}^{m} c_i | \cdot m \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It splits the string `expression` by `-` to get parts that are sequences of `+`.
   - It calculates the total length of these parts and passes it to `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` initializes `count` and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `-`, it decrements `balance` by 1.
   - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` by 1 and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

4. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The logic of `func_1` is to count the number of times the balance goes below zero and reset it, which effectively counts the number of subarrays needed to keep the balance non-negative.
   - If the balance is positive at the end, it adds 1 to the count to account for the remaining positive balance.
   - This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by splitting the array at points where the balance becomes negative, which is a valid and optimal strategy.

5. **Checking the Output**:
   - For the first test case `+`:
     - `balance` is 1, and `count` is 0.
     - The final result is `0 + (1 > 0) = 1`.
   - For the second test case `-----`:
     - `balance` becomes -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, and `count` is incremented 5 times.
     - The final result is `5 + (0 > 0) = 5`.
   - For the third test case `+-+-+-`:
     - `balance` alternates between 1 and 0, and `count` is 0.
     - The final result is `0 + (0 > 0) = 0`.
   - For the fourth test case `--+++++++--`:
     - `balance` becomes -1, -2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, and `count` is incremented 2 times.
     - The final result is `2 + (4 > 0) = 4`.
   - For the fifth test case `+---++++-+++++---++-`:
     - `balance` becomes 1, 0, -1, -2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, and `count` is incremented 2 times.
     - The final result is `2 + (6 > 0) = 4`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to minimize the penalty by splitting the array at points where the balance becomes negative.
   - The output for the given test cases matches the expected results.
