Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of characters "+" and "-" and an integer `length` that represents the length of `expression` (1 <= length <= 5000). It returns the number of times the balance (tracked by the number of "+" and "-" characters) goes below 0 during the iteration of the expression, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns only the number of times the balance went below 0. **
