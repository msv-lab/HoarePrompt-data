Reasoning:  
The program's logic is designed to calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` optimally. However, the approach used in `func_1` does not correctly implement the optimal splitting strategy. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of times the balance (the cumulative sum of `+1` for `+` and `-1` for `-`) goes below zero and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This does not necessarily minimize the penalty as defined in the problem statement.

The correct approach to minimize the penalty should consider splitting the array in a way that the sum of penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This can be achieved by ensuring that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, and the number of subarrays is minimized.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle the following scenarios:
1. **Balanced Subarrays**: If the sum of a subarray is zero, its penalty is zero. The function does not explicitly try to create such subarrays.
2. **Final Balance**: The function adds 1 to the count if the final balance is positive, but this does not necessarily reflect the correct penalty calculation.

For example, consider the input `expression = "--+++++++-"`. The function will return 4, but the optimal split can achieve a lower penalty. The optimal split would be `([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of 2 (since the sum of the subarray is 4 and the length is 8, the penalty is \(4 \times 2 = 8\), but the optimal split can be `([-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1])` which results in a penalty of 4).

Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
