The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000 and `length` equals the length of `expression`. The function returns the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns just the number of times the balance went below 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `expression` and an integer `length`. It returns the number of times the balance went below 0 during the iteration, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. If the final balance is not greater than 0, it returns only the number of times the balance went below 0.**
