Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon, `x` is the number of chosen vertices, and `y` is a fixed value (0). It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. The function calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted chosen vertices and adds this count to `x - 2`. It prints this result for each test case. The function does not return any value. **
