Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the initial value of `a[0]` is not correctly chosen to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Specifically, the program initializes `a[0]` to 500, which may not always be a valid choice. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 2
```

The program will output:
```
500 501 503
```

However, this output does not satisfy the condition `x_3 = a_3 mod a_2` because:
```
503 % 501 = 2, but x_3 = 2
```

The correct output for this case could be:
```
3 4 6
```

where:
```
4 % 3 = 1 (satisfies x_2 = 1)
6 % 4 = 2 (satisfies x_3 = 2)
```

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not always produce a valid array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for every potential input.
