The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters: `t`, which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 for each test case. Additionally, it accepts `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`, which are integers such that 1 <= x_i <= 500. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 500), and a list of integers `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n` (1 <= x_i <= 500). The function's return value is not specified in the provided information.**
