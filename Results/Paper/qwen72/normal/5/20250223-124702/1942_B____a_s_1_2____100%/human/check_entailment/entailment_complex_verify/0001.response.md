### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` such that `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The task is to reconstruct the permutation `p` from `a`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the sequence.
   - For each `i`, `a[i]` is the difference between the MEX of the first `i` elements of `p` and `p[i]`.
   - Therefore, `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` values.
   - It starts from the last element of `p` and works its way backward.
   - For each index `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the current minimum excluded value.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly set `p[i]`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Initialization:** `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible value for the MEX of a permutation of length `n`.
   - **Backward Construction:** By starting from the last element and moving backward, the program ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each prefix of `p` up to the current index.
   - **MEX Update:** The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - **Permutation Validity:** Since the input is guaranteed to have at least one valid permutation, the program will always find a valid `p` by the end of the loop.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and the update of `p` are designed to work with these values.

6. **Verification with Annotations:**
   - **State Before Function Call:** `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(-n \leq a_i \leq n\). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.
   - **State After Reading Input:** For each test case, `n` and `a` are correctly read and stored.
   - **State During Loop Execution:**
     - `p` is initialized with `-1` values, ensuring that no elements are prematurely set.
     - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible value for the MEX of a permutation of length `n`.
     - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`, setting `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` to `min(mex, p[i])`.
     - This ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated for each prefix of `p` up to the current index.
   - **State After Loop Execution:**
     - The list `p` contains the computed values for the current iteration of the loop.
     - The values of `mex` are not retained between iterations, which is correct as each test case is independent.
   - **Output:** The list `p` is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a valid permutation `p` from the given array `a` based on the problem description. The annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior align with the expected logic and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
