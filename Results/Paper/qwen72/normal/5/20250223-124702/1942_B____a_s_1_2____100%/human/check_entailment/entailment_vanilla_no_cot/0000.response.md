Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by constructing a permutation `p` from the array `a` as described. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes the permutation `p` with `-1` for all positions.
   - It sets the initial value of `mex` to `n`.

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` from the last element to the first.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, it prints the elements of `p`.

### Explanation of the Algorithm:
- The key insight is that the `MEX` of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` must be greater than or equal to `p_i` because `p_i` is part of the prefix and `MEX` is the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix.
- By iterating backwards, we can ensure that the `MEX` of the prefix is correctly maintained and updated as we go.
- The formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]` correctly reconstructs the permutation because `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` implies `p[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a[i]`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]` and `mex = 5`.
  - Iterate backwards:
    - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
    - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
    - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
    - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
    - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
  - Output: `0 1 4 2 3`

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]` and `mex = 5`.
  - Iterate backwards:
    - `i = 4`: `p[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = min(5, 4) = 4`
    - `i = 3`: `p[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = min(4, 3) = 3`
    - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
    - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
    - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
  - Output: `0 1 2 3 4`

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `a = [-2, 1, 2]`
  - Initialize `p = [-1, -1, -1]` and `mex = 3`.
  - Iterate backwards:
    - `i = 2`: `p[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = min(3, 1) = 1`
    - `i = 1`: `p[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
    - `i = 0`: `p[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = min(0, 2) = 0`
  - Output: `2 0 1`

The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` for all given test cases, and the logic ensures that the `MEX` condition is satisfied. Therefore, the program is correct.
