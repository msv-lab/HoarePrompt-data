The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple sets of signs based on the input, and writes the results to standard output. Each set of signs is defined by a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The function calculates the last year for each set of signs and appends it to a list of results. After processing all sets, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the `results` list containing the calculated last years as strings, and the variables `index`, `T`, and `data` remain unchanged.
