Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def count_triangle_ways(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing two elements: the integer `n` and the list of integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]`.
