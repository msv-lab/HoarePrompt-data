Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` integers from the input, counts the occurrences of each integer, and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length or 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. The result for each test case is printed. After all iterations, the loop finishes and the final state is that `t` is unchanged, and the input has been fully processed. The variables `num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `res` are reset for each test case.**
