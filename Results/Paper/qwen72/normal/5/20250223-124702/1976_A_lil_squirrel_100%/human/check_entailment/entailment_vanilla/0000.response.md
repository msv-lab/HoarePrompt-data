### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes immediately after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Output:**
   - If all the conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Condition 1:**
  - The program correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists.
  - The input is assumed to be valid, so this condition is inherently satisfied by the input constraints.

- **Condition 2:**
  - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `letters != sorted(letters)`.
  - This ensures that all letters are in the correct order.

- **Condition 3:**
  - The program checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `digits != sorted(digits)`.
  - This ensures that all digits are in the correct order.

- **Condition 4:**
  - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes immediately after a letter.
  - This is done using the loop `for i in range(len(password) - 1):` and the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Password:**
  - The problem constraints state that the password length `n` is at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **Password with Only Letters:**
  - The program will correctly return 'YES' if the password consists only of letters, as the `digits` list will be empty.
- **Password with Only Digits:**
  - The program will correctly return 'YES' if the password consists only of digits, as the `letters` list will be empty.
- **Password with Mixed Characters:**
  - The program correctly handles mixed characters by ensuring the letters and digits are sorted and that no digit follows a letter.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles all valid edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
