Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Character Segregation**: The function `func_1` segregates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits. This step is necessary to check the sorting conditions for letters and digits separately.

3. **Sorting Check for Letters**: The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'. This is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Sorting Check for Digits**: The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'. This is also correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Order Check for Letters and Digits**: The function iterates through the password to ensure that no letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a condition is found, it returns 'NO'. This is necessary to enforce the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

6. **Final Return**: If all the checks pass, the function returns 'YES'. This is the correct output if the password meets all the specified conditions.

The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. The logic is sound and the checks are comprehensive.

Correctness: **True**
