Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to verify if a password is strong based on the conditions outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze the program step by step to ensure it meets all the requirements:

1. **Password Composition**:
   - The program implicitly checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods. These methods are used to separate the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists. Since the problem guarantees that the input will only contain lowercase Latin letters and digits, this part is correctly handled.

2. **No Digit After a Letter**:
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter using the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit()`. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that no digit should come after a letter.

3. **Sorted Digits**:
   - The program collects all digits in the `digits` list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If the digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that all digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. **Sorted Letters**:
   - The program collects all letters in the `letters` list and checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. If the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the rule that all letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Password**: The problem description specifies that the password length \( n \) is at least 1, so an empty password is not a valid input. The program does not need to handle this case.
   - **Single Character Password**: The program correctly handles single character passwords, whether they are a letter or a digit. For a single character, the conditions for sorting and no digit after a letter are trivially satisfied.
   - **Only Digits or Only Letters**: The program correctly handles passwords that consist only of digits or only of letters. In such cases, the conditions for sorting and no digit after a letter are trivially satisfied.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles the edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
