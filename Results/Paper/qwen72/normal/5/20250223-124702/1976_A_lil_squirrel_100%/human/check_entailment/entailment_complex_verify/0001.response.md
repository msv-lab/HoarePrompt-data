### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   - The annotated code confirms that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \le n \le 20\) and `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

2. **Password Validation:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `letters != sorted(letters)`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - This ensures that all letters are in the correct order.
   - The annotated code confirms that `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password` and that the state is correct after this check.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `digits != sorted(digits)`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - This ensures that all digits are in the correct order.
   - The annotated code confirms that `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password` and that the state is correct after this check.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes immediately after a letter using the loop `for i in range(len(password) - 1):` and the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():`.
   - This ensures that the password does not violate the rule that no digit should come after a letter.
   - The annotated code confirms that the loop correctly checks for this condition and returns 'NO' if violated.

3. **Output:**
   - If all the conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.
   - The annotated code confirms that if the loop completes without encountering a return statement, the program returns 'YES'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Empty Password:**
  - The problem constraints state that the password length `n` is at least 1, so this case is not applicable.
- **Password with Only Letters:**
  - The program will correctly return 'YES' if the password consists only of letters, as the `digits` list will be empty.
  - The annotated code confirms that the program handles this case correctly.
- **Password with Only Digits:**
  - The program will correctly return 'YES' if the password consists only of digits, as the `letters` list will be empty.
  - The annotated code confirms that the program handles this case correctly.
- **Password with Mixed Characters:**
  - The program correctly handles mixed characters by ensuring the letters and digits are sorted and that no digit follows a letter.
  - The annotated code confirms that the program handles this case correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program meets all the conditions specified in the problem description and handles all valid edge cases. The annotated code provides a systematic validation of the program's behavior at key points, confirming that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
