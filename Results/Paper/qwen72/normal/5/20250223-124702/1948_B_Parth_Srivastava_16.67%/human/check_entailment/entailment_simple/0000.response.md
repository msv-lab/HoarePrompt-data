Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()` twice. This is a bit unusual, but it seems to be a mistake in the program structure rather than the function itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - **Processing the Array**:
     - The function iterates over the array `a` and checks if each element is greater than 10.
     - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It then checks if the digits can be inserted in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order of the array `c`.
     - If the element is not greater than 10, it is directly appended to `c`.
   - **Checking Sorted Order**: After processing all elements, the function checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version `d`.
   - **Storing Results**: The result (1 for sorted, 0 for not sorted) is appended to the list `b`.

3. **Output Handling**: After processing all test cases, the program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called twice for each test case, which is incorrect. It should be called once per test case.
- **Logic for Splitting Elements**: The logic for splitting elements and checking if they can be inserted in a way that maintains the non-decreasing order is not fully correct. Specifically, the condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` only checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`, but it does not ensure that the entire array remains sorted after the insertion of both digits.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where the first element is greater than 10 and needs to be split.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
