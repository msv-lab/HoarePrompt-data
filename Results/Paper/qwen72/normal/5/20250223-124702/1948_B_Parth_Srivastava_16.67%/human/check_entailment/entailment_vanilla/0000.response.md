### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates `m` times to process each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and an empty list `c` to store the transformed array.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and processes each element:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - It checks if the digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if `c` is not empty).
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
       - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
       - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
       - Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - After processing the array, it sorts the transformed array `c` and stores the result in `d`.
   - It checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to the sorted array `d`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends `0` to `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for `1` and 'NO' for `0`.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified.
- The logic for transforming the array by splitting elements greater than 10 into their digits is implemented.
- However, the logic for splitting and appending digits is not entirely correct. Specifically:
  - The program only splits elements greater than 10 if they are not the first element or if they are the first element but satisfy a specific condition (`y <= x`).
  - This means that elements greater than 10 that do not meet these conditions are not split, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`:
  - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `45` into `[4, 5]`.
  - The final array `c` will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
  - This array is sorted, so the program will print 'YES'.

- For the input `[12, 28, 5]`:
  - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`.
  - The final array `c` will be `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
  - This array is not sorted, so the program will print 'NO'.

- For the input `[0, 0]`:
  - The array is already sorted, so the program will print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical flaw in how it handles the splitting of elements greater than 10. It should split all elements greater than 10, regardless of their position or the relationship between their digits.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases where elements greater than 10 need to be split, leading to potential incorrect results.
