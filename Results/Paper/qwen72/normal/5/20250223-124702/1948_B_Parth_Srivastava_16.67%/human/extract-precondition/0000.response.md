The function definition provided does not match the problem description, as the problem involves processing multiple test cases and arrays, but the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Based on the problem description, a more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def can_sort_array(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing an integer `n` followed by a list of integers `a`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, test_cases is a list of t elements, each element is a list containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
