The function `func_1` reads a space-separated sequence of numbers from the user and returns a map object that converts each element into an integer. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user's input is transformed into a map object of integers, which can be further processed or converted to a list or other iterable as needed.
