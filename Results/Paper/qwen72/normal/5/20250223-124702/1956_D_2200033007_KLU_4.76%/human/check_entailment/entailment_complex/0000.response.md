Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input values correctly but does not convert the list elements from strings to integers. This will cause issues when performing operations that require integer arithmetic.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases:
   - If the length of the array `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" and "1 2".
   - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

   This logic is incorrect because:
   - It does not consider the actual values in the array.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum.
   - It does not handle all possible input lengths and values as required by the problem statement.

3. **Output Format**: The function does not output the correct format for the solution. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The current implementation only prints fixed values without any actual computation.

4. **General Solution**: The problem requires a more general approach to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation on subarrays. The current function does not implement this logic at all.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
