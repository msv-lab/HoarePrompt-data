Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input and Data Types**:
   - The input values are read as strings and appended to the list `a` without converting them to integers. This will cause issues when performing operations on the list elements.

2. **Limited Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array is 2 and prints a fixed output. It does not handle other lengths of the array, such as 3, 4, or 1, as shown in the examples provided in the problem description.
   - For lengths other than 2, it prints a fixed output of `13 0`, which is incorrect for most cases.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to compute the MEX of a subarray and update the subarray elements accordingly.
   - It does not calculate the maximum sum of the array elements after performing the operations.
   - It does not construct and output the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
which is incorrect. The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
