The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `c`, which is a list of integers. The list `c` has a length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`, and each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies `0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7`. The function does not return any value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `c` of integers, where the length of the list is between 1 and 18, and each element in the list is between 0 and 10,000,000. The function does not return any value.**
