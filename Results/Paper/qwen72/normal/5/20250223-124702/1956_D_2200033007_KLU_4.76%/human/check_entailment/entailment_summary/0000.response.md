Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the array `a` is 2, and it outputs a fixed result of "4 1" followed by "1 2". For all other lengths of the array, it outputs "13 0" and does not perform any operations. This is incorrect because the program should be able to handle any array length between 1 and 18 and should compute the maximum possible sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.

The problem requires a more dynamic approach to determine the MEX of subarrays and to apply the operations to maximize the sum. The current implementation does not attempt to calculate the MEX or to apply any operations to the array, which means it cannot achieve the correct solution for most inputs.

Correctness: **False**
