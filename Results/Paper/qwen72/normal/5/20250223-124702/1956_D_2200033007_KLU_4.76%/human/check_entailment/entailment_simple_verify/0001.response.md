Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The original assessment correctly points out that the elements are appended as strings, not integers. This is a critical issue because the program needs to perform integer operations to compute the MEX and the sum of the array. The correct approach would be to convert each string to an integer before appending it to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because `func_1` should be called with the array `a` itself, not just its length. The function needs to operate on the actual elements of the array to determine the MEX and perform the operations.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(c)` is defined to take one argument `c`, which is supposed to be the length of the array `a`. However, the function should take the array `a` as an argument to work with its elements.

4. **Handling Different Array Lengths**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the length of the array is 2. It prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`, which is the correct output for the example where the array has two elements, and the MEX operation can be applied to the entire array to maximize the sum.
   - For arrays of length other than 2, the function prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the array is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible input arrays of length 3 or more. The program should compute the MEX for the array and apply the operations to maximize the sum.

5. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2. It only handles the specific case of an array of length 2 correctly. For other lengths, it fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is correct for the specific case of an array of length 2, but it is incorrect for other lengths because it does not compute the correct sum and operations. The program should output the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations for any valid input array.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case of arrays of different lengths and does not compute the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations for those cases.

Final: **False**
