Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly and converts the input string into a list of integers. However, it passes the length of the list `a` to the function `func_1` instead of the list itself. The function `func_1` expects a list, but it receives an integer (`len(a)`), which is the length of the list. This is a mismatch in the function's expected input.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles the case where the length of the list is 2, and it prints a fixed output of `4 1` followed by `1 2`. For any other length, it prints `13 0`. This is clearly incorrect because the function does not actually compute the MEX or perform the operations described in the problem statement. The function should be designed to handle any valid input size and compute the maximum possible sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations.

3. **General Solution**: The problem requires a more general solution that can handle any array length and any initial values. The function should compute the MEX for different subarrays, apply the operation to maximize the sum, and output the sequence of operations. The current implementation does not do this and is overly simplistic.

4. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the required output format for the general case. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The current implementation only prints fixed outputs for specific cases.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem described.

Correctness: **False**
