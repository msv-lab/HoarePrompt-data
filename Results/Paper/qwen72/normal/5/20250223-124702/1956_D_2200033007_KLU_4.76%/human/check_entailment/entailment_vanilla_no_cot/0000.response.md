Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Output for General Case**: The function `func_1` only handles the case when the length of the array `c` is 2. For any other length, it outputs `13 0`, which is not the correct solution for all possible inputs.

2. **No MEX Calculation**: The program does not calculate the MEX of any subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem.

3. **No Operations Construction**: The program does not construct the sequence of operations that would achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Hardcoded Values**: The program outputs hardcoded values for the sum and the number of operations, which is not a general solution.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Calculate the MEX of Subarrays**: For each subarray, calculate the MEX and determine if applying the operation would increase the sum of the array.

2. **Construct the Sequence of Operations**: Keep track of the operations that maximize the sum.

3. **Output the Maximum Sum and Operations**: Finally, output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

Here is a more detailed and correct approach to the problem:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    m = 0
    while m in seen:
        m += 1
    return m

def maximize_sum(n, a):
    max_sum = sum(a)
    operations = []
    
    for l in range(n):
        for r in range(l, n):
            subarray = a[l:r+1]
            x = mex(subarray)
            new_sum = max_sum - sum(subarray) + (r - l + 1) * x
            if new_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = new_sum
                operations = [(l + 1, r + 1)]
    
    print(max_sum, len(operations))
    for l, r in operations:
        print(l, r)

# Read input
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# Solve the problem
maximize_sum(n, a)
```

This program correctly calculates the MEX of each subarray, determines the optimal operations to maximize the sum, and outputs the result.
