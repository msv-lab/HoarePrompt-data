Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the space-separated integers from the input. However, it appends these integers as strings to the list `a`, which is a critical error. The elements should be converted to integers before appending them to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because the function should be called with the list `a` itself, not just its length.

3. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(c)` is defined to take one argument `c`, which is supposed to be the array `a`. However, the function is called with the length of `a`, and within the function, `c` is treated as an integer (the length of the array) rather than the array itself.

4. **Handling Different Array Lengths**:
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, the program prints `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the specific example where the array has two elements `[0, 1]`, and applying the MEX operation to the entire array results in `[2, 2]`, giving a sum of 4.
   - If `c` is not 2, the program prints `13 0`. This is a hardcoded output that assumes the sum of the array is always 13 and no operations are needed, which is incorrect. The sum of 13 and no operations are only correct for the specific example `[1, 3, 9]`, but not for all possible input arrays of length 3 or more.

5. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of different lengths. It only handles the specific case of an array of length 2 correctly. For other lengths, it fails to compute the correct maximum sum and the sequence of operations needed to achieve that sum.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is correct for the specific case of an array of length 2, but it is incorrect for other lengths because it does not compute the correct sum and operations.

Given the above points, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the general case of arrays of different lengths and does not compute the correct maximum sum or the sequence of operations for those cases.

Final: **False**
