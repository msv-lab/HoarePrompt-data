### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - The index is used to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.

2. **Counting 'U' Coins:**
   - For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd (`count_u % 2 == 1`).
   - If the count is odd, Alice wins, and the program prints 'YES'.
   - If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Game Logic:**
  - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
  - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and leave an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. This ensures that Alice will always have a move when it's her turn, and Bob will eventually be left with no moves.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he will have a move when it's his turn, and Alice will eventually be left with no moves.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are no facing-up coins (`count_u == 0`), which results in Bob winning.
  - The program also handles the case where there is only one coin left, which is correctly identified as a win for the player who makes the last move (Alice if the coin is facing up, Bob if it is facing down).

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads all input at once and processes it in a loop, which is efficient for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.
