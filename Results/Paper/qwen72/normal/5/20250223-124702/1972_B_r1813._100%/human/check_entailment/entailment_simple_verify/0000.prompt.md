You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" only.

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `index` is now equal to `2 * t + 1`. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged. For each iteration, the loop has read an integer `n` and a string `s` from `data`, incremented `index` by 2, counted the occurrences of 'U' in `s`, and printed 'YES' if the count is odd or 'NO' if the count is even.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the program only checks if the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) is odd or even and determines the winner based on that. However, this approach does not consider the adjacency and flipping rules of the game, which are crucial for determining the winner.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  UDU
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks if the number of `'U'` coins is odd, which it is (3). However, if we follow the game rules:
1. Alice chooses the first coin (`'U'`), and `s` becomes `"DD"`.
2. Bob chooses the first coin (`'D'`), and `s` becomes `"U"`.
3. Alice chooses the only coin (`'U'`), and `s` becomes empty.
4. Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game.

But if we consider the correct game logic:
1. Alice chooses the first coin (`'U'`), and `s` becomes `"DD"`.
2. Bob chooses the first coin (`'D'`), and `s` becomes `"U"`.
3. Alice chooses the only coin (`'U'`), and `s` becomes empty.
4. Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game.

However, the program does not simulate the actual game play and just relies on the count of `'U'` coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner correctly in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
