Output State: **The function is now prepared to read input from the standard input stream, but no actual input has been read yet. The variables `t` and the list of tuples remain unchanged.**

Natural language description: The code snippet assigns the `read` method from the `sys.stdin` object to a variable named `input`. This setup allows the function to read input from the standard input stream, but since no actual reading has occurred, the values of `t` and the list of tuples provided in the initial state remain unchanged.
