Output State: **The function is now prepared to read input from the standard input stream, but no actual input has been read yet. The list of tuples remains unchanged. `data` is a list of strings, where each string is a token from the input. `t` is now an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer. `index` is 1.**
