The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer, and the function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists. The variable `num_tests` is expected to be initialized with the value of `t`.

Given the constraints that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `num_tests` must be within this range to ensure the loop can execute at least once. Since the loop condition is `num_tests > 0`, and `t` is at least 1, `num_tests` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`num_tests` must be at least 1 and at most 1000**
