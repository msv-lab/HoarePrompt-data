The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side of the street and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The function should be able to handle up to 2·10^4 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
