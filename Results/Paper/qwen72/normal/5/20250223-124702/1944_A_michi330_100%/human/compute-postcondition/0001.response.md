To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0. The other variables (`n` and `k`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
