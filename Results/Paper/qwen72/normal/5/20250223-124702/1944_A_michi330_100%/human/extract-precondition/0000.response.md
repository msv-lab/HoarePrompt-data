Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def min_islands(n, k):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of islands, and k is an integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2) representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed.**
