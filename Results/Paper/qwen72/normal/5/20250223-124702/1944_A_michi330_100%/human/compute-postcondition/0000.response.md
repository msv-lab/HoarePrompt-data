Output State: **The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).**
