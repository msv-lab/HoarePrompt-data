You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it will print `1`. Otherwise, it will print `n`. After all iterations, the value of `i` will be `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` will remain unchanged as they are input values and not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of islands), and `k` (maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). For each test case, if `k` is 0, it returns `n`. If `k` is greater than 0, it returns the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying up to `k` bridges.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
