Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified within the function. **
