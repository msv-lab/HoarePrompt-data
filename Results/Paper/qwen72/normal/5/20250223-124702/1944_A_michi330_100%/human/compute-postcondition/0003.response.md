The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that Dominater can destroy (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case:
- Case_1: If `k` is 0, the function returns the number of islands `n` as the result for that test case.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than 0, the function returns the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying up to `k` bridges.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (number of islands), and `k` (maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed). For each test case, if `k` is 0, it returns `n`. If `k` is greater than 0, it returns the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying up to `k` bridges.**
