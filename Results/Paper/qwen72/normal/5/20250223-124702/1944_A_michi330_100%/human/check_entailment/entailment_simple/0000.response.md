### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it prints `1`.
     - **Explanation**: If `k` is at least `n - 1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, making it impossible for Everule to visit any other island. Thus, the only island Everule can visit is island 1.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `n`.
     - **Explanation**: If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. Therefore, Everule can still visit all `n` islands, as there will always be a path to every other island through the remaining bridges.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `n - 1` correctly by printing `1`.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0 correctly by printing `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the logic described.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater destroys bridges optimally. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.
