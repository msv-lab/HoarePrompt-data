Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\). This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. For example, if `k = 5`, `k.bit_length() - 1` is 2, and \(2^2 - 1 = 3\), so `nums[0]` is set to 3.
   - The value of `k` is then decremented by `nums[0]`.

3. **Distributing Remaining `k`**:
   - The program then iterates over the remaining elements of `nums` (from index 1 to `n-1`).
   - For each element, if `k` is still greater than 0, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. This ensures that each element is as large as possible without exceeding `k`.
   - It then decrements `k` by the value assigned to `nums[i]`.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, if there is any remaining value in `k`, it is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The sequence `nums` is converted to a string and appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Sum Condition**: The program ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k` by initially setting `nums[0]` to the largest possible value and then distributing the remaining `k` among the other elements.
- **Maximizing 1s in Bitwise OR**: The initial value of `nums[0]` is chosen to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. By setting `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), it ensures that the highest possible number of bits are set to 1. The remaining elements are then set to values that do not introduce new 1s in the bitwise OR, but rather use the existing 1s or add minimal new 1s.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Sequence**: If `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs `k` as the only element.
- **Small `k`**: If `k` is small, the program ensures that the sequence is constructed such that the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring the sum condition and maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. The logic is sound and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
