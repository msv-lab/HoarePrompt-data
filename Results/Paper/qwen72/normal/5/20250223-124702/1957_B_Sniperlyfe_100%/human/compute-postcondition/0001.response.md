Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and all other elements still initialized to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\).
- `k.bit_length()` returns the number of bits required to represent `k` in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros.
- \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) calculates the largest power of 2 less than `k` and subtracts 1.
- The rest of the list `nums` remains unchanged, with all elements still initialized to 0.
