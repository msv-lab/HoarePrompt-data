The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. The parameter `n` is constrained to be between 1 and 2 Â· 10^5, and `k` is constrained to be between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` of length `n`, where all elements in the list are 0, including the first element `nums[0]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of length `n` where all elements are 0.**
