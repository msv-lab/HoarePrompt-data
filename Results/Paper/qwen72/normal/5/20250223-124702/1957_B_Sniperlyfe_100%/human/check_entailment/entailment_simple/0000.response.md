### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - The function `func_1` initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and distributes the remaining value of `k` among the remaining elements of the list, ensuring that each element is either 0 or 1 (or the smallest possible value to fit the remaining `k`).
   - Finally, it ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` is exactly `k` by adding any remaining value of `k` to the first element.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - **Sum Condition:** The sum of the elements in `nums` is maintained to be `k` by the final adjustment `nums[0] += k`.
   - **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
     - The initial value of `nums[0]` is chosen to maximize the number of 1s in its binary representation.
     - The remaining elements are set to the smallest possible values (0 or 1) to ensure the sum is `k` while not reducing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n = 1`, the program correctly outputs `k` as the only element.
   - If `k` is small and `n` is large, the program ensures that the remaining elements are set to 0 or 1, which is the optimal way to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
