Precondition: **The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The input `s` is always a valid time in 24-hour format. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).**
