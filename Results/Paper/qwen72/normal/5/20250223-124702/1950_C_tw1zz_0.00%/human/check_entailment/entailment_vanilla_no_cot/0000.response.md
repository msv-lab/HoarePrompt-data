Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the transition from 12-hour AM to PM and vice versa. Specifically, the program incorrectly classifies the hour "12" as AM, and it also incorrectly classifies the hour "00" as PM. According to the 12-hour clock format, "12" should be PM, and "00" should be AM. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, m1) = ('', m)
        time = ''
        if h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h if int(h) < 12 else str(int(h) - 12)
            time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the special cases for "00" and "12".
