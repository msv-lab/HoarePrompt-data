### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the amount received back is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. It is correctly implemented.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers by successively applying `func_1`. It is also correctly implemented.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
     - It computes the LCM of the multipliers and stores it in `m`.
     - It then computes the bets \(x_i\) as \(x_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\).
     - It checks if the total sum of bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is greater than or equal to \(m\). If so, it prints \(-1\).
     - Otherwise, it prints the bets \(x_i\).

3. **Critical Flaw**:
   - The program's approach of using the LCM of the multipliers to determine the bets is not appropriate for the problem.
   - The LCM of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\) does not necessarily help in finding a distribution of coins that satisfies the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\) implies that the total sum of bets must be less than the minimum of \(k_i \times x_i\). This is a more complex constraint that the program does not address.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     3
     3 2 7
     ```
   - The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42.
   - The program computes the bets as:
     - \(x_1 = \frac{42}{3} = 14\)
     - \(x_2 = \frac{42}{2} = 21\)
     - \(x_3 = \frac{42}{7} = 6\)
   - The total sum of bets is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\).
   - The amounts received back are:
     - \(3 \times 14 = 42\)
     - \(2 \times 21 = 42\)
     - \(7 \times 6 = 42\)
   - The condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) is not satisfied for any \(i\), because the total sum of bets (41) is not strictly less than 42.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The use of LCM is not a suitable method for solving this problem.

### Final Evaluation:
