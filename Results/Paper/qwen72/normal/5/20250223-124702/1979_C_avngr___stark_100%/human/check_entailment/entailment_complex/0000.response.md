### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)`.
   - We need to ensure that for each `i`, `k_i * x_i > sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`. The LCM is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers` by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements of the list. The result is the LCM of all the elements in the list.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The program checks if the total sum of the bets is less than `m`. If it is, the distribution is valid, and the bets are printed. If not, `-1` is printed.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` ensures that the bets `x_i` are integers and that the total sum of bets is a multiple of the LCM.
   - **Bet Distribution**: The bet on the i-th outcome is `m // k_i`. This ensures that the amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`.
   - **Sum Check**: The total sum of the bets is `sum(m // k_i)`. For the distribution to be valid, this sum must be strictly less than `m`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` are the same, the sum of the bets will be `n * (m // k_i)`. Since `m` is the LCM of `k_i` and `k_i` is the same for all, `m // k_i` will be 1, and the sum will be `n`. If `n >= m`, the distribution is invalid, and `-1` should be printed.
   - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be larger, and the sum of the bets will be smaller, making it more likely to satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and distributes the bets such that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM. The logic ensures that the condition `k_i * x_i > sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` is met for each `i`.

Correctness: **True**
