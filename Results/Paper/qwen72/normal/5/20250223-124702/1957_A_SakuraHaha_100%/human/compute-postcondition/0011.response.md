Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from user input, representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input, representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then calculates the number of groups of three sticks that have the same length and prints this count. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the printed count of such groups. **
