The function should take three parameters: t, a list of n values, and a list of stick lengths a. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
