You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of n values, and a list of stick lengths a. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` remains 0. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` is now the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the calculated value of `ans` based on the counts of stick lengths in the list `a`.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with the given sticks. Specifically, the program always divides the count of each stick length by 3 to determine the number of polygons that can be formed. This is incorrect because different polygons require different numbers of sides. For example, a triangle requires 3 sticks, a square requires 4 sticks, and so on. The program should consider the minimum number of sides required for a regular polygon, which is 3, and then check for the possibility of forming polygons with more sides (4, 5, etc.) using the available sticks.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
1
4
2 2 2 2
```
The program will output:
```
1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
1
```
This is because the program correctly identifies that 4 sticks of length 2 can form a square, but it does not consider the possibility of forming other polygons (like a triangle) with the remaining sticks.

For the input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The program will output:
```
2
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
2
```
This is because the program correctly identifies that 6 sticks of length 2 can form 2 triangles, but it does not consider the possibility of forming a single hexagon with all 6 sticks.

For the input:
```
1
7
2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The program will output:
```
2
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
1
```
This is because the program incorrectly divides the count of sticks by 3, resulting in 2 polygons, but the correct output should be 1 hexagon.
