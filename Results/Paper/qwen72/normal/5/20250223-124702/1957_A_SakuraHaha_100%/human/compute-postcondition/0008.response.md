Output State: **`t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` is now the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.**
