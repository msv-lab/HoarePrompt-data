You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of n values, and a list of stick lengths a. t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` remains 0. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. `n` remains an integer where 1 <= n <= 100, representing the number of sticks. `a` remains a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, representing the lengths of the sticks, and is unchanged. `ans` is now the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3. `cnt` is now a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer division of each count in `cnt` by 3.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the calculated value of `ans` based on the counts of stick lengths in the list `a`.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` from user input, representing the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers `a` from user input, representing the lengths of the sticks. The function then calculates the number of groups of three sticks that have the same length and prints this count. After the function concludes, `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the printed count of such groups.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`.

2. **Counting Stick Frequencies**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is done correctly using the `get` method to initialize the count to 0 if the length is not already in the dictionary.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Polygons**:
   - The program iterates over the values in the dictionary `cnt` and for each value `x`, it adds `x // 3` to the answer `ans`. This is because a regular polygon must have at least 3 sides, and each side must be of the same length. Therefore, for each stick length, the maximum number of polygons that can be formed is the integer division of the count of that length by 3.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the answer `ans` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - If there is only one stick or two sticks, the output is 0, which is correct.
     - If there are multiple sticks of the same length, it correctly calculates the number of polygons that can be formed.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The program's logic is optimal for the given problem. It correctly counts the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by each stick length and sums them up.

However, there is one minor issue in the code:

- The function `func_1` is called inside the loop, but it is not defined before the loop. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run. The function `func_1` should be defined before it is called.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

With this correction, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
