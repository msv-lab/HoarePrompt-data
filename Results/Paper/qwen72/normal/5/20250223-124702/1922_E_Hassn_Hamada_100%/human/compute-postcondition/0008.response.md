To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables `i` and the expression `size - overlap` in the loop head. The loop will execute if `size - overlap` is greater than 0. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `size_overlap` is a tuple `(size, i)`, where `size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`.
- `size` is the first element of `size_overlap`.
- `overlap` is the second element of `size_overlap`.

For the loop to execute:
- `i` must be 0 (as it is the starting index for the loop).
- `size - overlap` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `size` is greater than `overlap`.

State: **`size_overlap` is a tuple `(size, i)` where `size` is the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number` and `i` is the corresponding index from the loop, `size` is the first element of `size_overlap`, `overlap` is the second element of `size_overlap`, `i` is 0, and `size` must be greater than `overlap`.**
