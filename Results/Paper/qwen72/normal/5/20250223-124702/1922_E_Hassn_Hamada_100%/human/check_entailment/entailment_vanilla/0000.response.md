### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence where elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array can have repeated elements, and different positions of the same elements are considered different subsequences.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the length and elements of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values to find a suitable size and overlap for the sequence.
   - It appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Binary Representation and Subsequences**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) \) to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by a sequence of a certain length.
   - This formula is derived from the properties of binary numbers and combinations.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by carefully selecting the size and overlap.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning immediately.
   - It also ensures that the sequence is built correctly by appending elements and recursively calling itself.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - If no valid sequence can be generated, the program should print -1. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this case, but it is implied that the function will always generate a valid sequence or terminate early if \( X \) is not feasible.

7. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases in the example output seem to be consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The sequences generated by the program for the given \( X \) values have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given \( X \) values. The logic and structure of the program align with the problem's requirements, and the test cases provided in the example output are consistent with the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
