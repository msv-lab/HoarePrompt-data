Output State: **The program returns 0, 0.** 

In this output state, the program returns two values, both of which are 0. The initial state specified that `number` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18, but it was explicitly set to 0. The `sequence` list is also mentioned but not used in the return statement. Therefore, the return values are simply 0 and 0, as specified in the code snippet.
