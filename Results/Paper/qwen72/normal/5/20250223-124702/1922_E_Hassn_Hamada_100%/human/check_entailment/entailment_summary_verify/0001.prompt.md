You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It modifies the `sequence` list by appending a series of integers based on the input `number`. The function always returns the tuple `(0, 0)`. After the function concludes, the `sequence` list is extended, and the `number` and `sequence` variables are not otherwise modified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence where elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array can have repeated elements, and different positions of the same elements are considered different subsequences.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the length and elements of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values to find a suitable size and overlap for the sequence.
   - It appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Binary Representation and Subsequences**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) \) to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by a sequence of a certain length.
   - This formula is derived from the properties of binary numbers and combinations.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by carefully selecting the size and overlap.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning immediately.
   - It also ensures that the sequence is built correctly by appending elements and recursively calling itself.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - If no valid sequence can be generated, the program should print -1. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this case, but it is implied that the function will always generate a valid sequence or terminate early if \( X \) is not feasible.

7. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases in the example output seem to be consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The sequences generated by the program for the given \( X \) values have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given \( X \) values. The logic and structure of the program align with the problem's requirements, and the test cases provided in the example output are consistent with the expected results.
