Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of generating an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` is the core of the solution, and it works by recursively constructing the array. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Base Case Handling**: If the `number` is 0, the function returns `(0, 0)`, which effectively stops the recursion. This is correct because if we need 0 more increasing subsequences, we don't need to add any more elements to the sequence.

2. **Finding the Next Element to Add**: The function iterates from the maximum value in the `sequence` down to 0. It calculates the number of increasing subsequences that can be added by appending a new element with a specific size and overlap. The key idea is to find the largest power of 2 that fits within the remaining `number` of subsequences needed.

3. **Appending Elements**: Once the appropriate size and overlap are found, the function appends the required number of elements to the `sequence` to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The function then calls itself with the updated `number` (subtracting the number of subsequences added by the current elements) and the modified `sequence`.

5. **Output**: After constructing the sequence for each test case, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

However, there are a few issues to consider:

- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where \(X\) is very large or very small. For example, if \(X = 1\), the program should return `-1` because it's impossible to have exactly 1 increasing subsequence (an empty subsequence is considered, and any non-empty subsequence would add more than 1 subsequence).

- **Sequence Length**: The problem states that the array length should be at most 200. The program does not explicitly check if the sequence length exceeds this limit, which could lead to incorrect results for large \(X\).

- **Sequence Validity**: The program should ensure that the elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). The current implementation seems to generate valid elements, but this should be verified.

- **Correctness of Subsequence Count**: The program assumes that the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using powers of 2. This is a valid approach, but it needs to be confirmed that it correctly handles all possible values of \(X\).

Given the provided execution summary and the problem constraints, the program appears to be on the right track. However, without a thorough test on edge cases and large inputs, it's difficult to guarantee its correctness in all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**

The program lacks explicit checks for the sequence length limit and edge cases, which are crucial for ensuring the solution is valid for all inputs. Additionally, the recursive approach might not handle all possible values of \(X\) correctly, especially for very large \(X\).
