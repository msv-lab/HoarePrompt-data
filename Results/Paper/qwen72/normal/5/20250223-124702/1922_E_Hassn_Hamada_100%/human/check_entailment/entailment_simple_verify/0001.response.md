### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence where elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array can have repeated elements, and different positions of the same elements are considered different subsequences.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to determine the length and elements of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values to find a suitable size and overlap for the sequence.
   - It appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Binary Representation and Subsequences**:
   - The function uses the formula \( (1 << size) - (1 << overlap) \) to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by a sequence of a certain length.
   - This formula is derived from the properties of binary numbers and combinations.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by carefully selecting the size and overlap.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case where \( number = 0 \) by returning immediately.
   - It also ensures that the sequence is built correctly by appending elements and recursively calling itself.
   - However, the program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is not feasible (i.e., no valid sequence can be generated). This is a potential issue, but the problem statement implies that \( X \) will always be feasible within the given constraints.

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.
   - The provided test cases in the example output seem to be consistent with the problem's requirements.
   - The sequences generated by the program for the given \( X \) values have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial State**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases and the integer \( X \) for each test case.
  - The `result` list is initialized as an empty list.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function starts by checking if `number` is 0. If so, it returns immediately.
  - It then iterates over possible values of `i` from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
  - For each `i`, it calculates `size` and `value` using the formula \( (1 << size) - (1 << i) \).
  - It finds the largest `size` such that \( (1 << size) - (1 << i) \leq number \).
  - It appends elements to `sequence` and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of subsequences.

- **Annotated State**:
  - Before the function call, `number` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq number \leq 10^{18} \), and `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
  - After the function call, `sequence` is extended by appending integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.
  - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by carefully selecting the size and overlap.

- **Potential Issues**:
  - The program does not explicitly handle the case where \( X \) is not feasible. However, the problem constraints imply that \( X \) will always be feasible within the given range.
  - The function `func_1` should always return a valid sequence or terminate early if \( X \) is not feasible, but this is not explicitly checked in the code.

### Final Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly generate an array of integers that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given \( X \) values. The logic and structure of the program align with the problem's requirements, and the test cases provided in the example output are consistent with the expected results. The potential issue of not explicitly handling infeasible \( X \) values is not a concern given the problem constraints.

Final: **True**
