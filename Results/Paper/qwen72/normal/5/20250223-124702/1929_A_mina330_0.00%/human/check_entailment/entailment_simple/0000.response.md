### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a crucial step because the problem requires maximizing the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. Sorting the array allows us to pair the smallest and largest elements, the second smallest and second largest elements, and so on, which maximizes the differences.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The function then calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This is done using a loop that iterates from 0 to `len(a) // 2`, and for each iteration, it adds the difference `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to the variable `kq`.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated beauty (`kq`) for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For an array with all elements being the same, the beauty will be 0, which is correct.
   - For an array with distinct elements, the beauty will be maximized by the sorting and pairing approach, which is correct.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and pairing the elements as described. The output for each test case is correctly calculated and printed. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
