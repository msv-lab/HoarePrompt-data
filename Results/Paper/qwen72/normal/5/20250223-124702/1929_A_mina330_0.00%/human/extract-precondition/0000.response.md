Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.**

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. It should be:
```
def func(t, test_cases):
```
Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the elements of the array for a test case.
