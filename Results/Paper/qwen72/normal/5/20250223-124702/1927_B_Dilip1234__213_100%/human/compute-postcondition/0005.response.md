The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < `n`. The function returns a string `s` of length `n`, where `s` is composed of characters from 'a' to 'z'. The exact composition of `s` is determined by the counts stored in the list `a`, which represents the count of each character in `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` of length `n` composed of characters from 'a' to 'z', where the counts of each character in `s` are determined by the values in the list `a`.**
