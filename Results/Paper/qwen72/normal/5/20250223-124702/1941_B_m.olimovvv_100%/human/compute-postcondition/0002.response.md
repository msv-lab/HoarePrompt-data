The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general structure of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (0 <= a_j <= 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
