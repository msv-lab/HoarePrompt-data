Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd. However, the game's outcome is not solely determined by the parity of the sum of coins but rather by the specific number of coins each player has and the sequence of moves they can make.

To correctly determine the winner, consider the following:
- If both players have an equal number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because the game will end in a draw where both players have an empty wallet, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
- If the number of coins is not equal, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the opponent has to make a move with fewer coins, leading to the player with more coins eventually winning.

A correct approach would involve comparing the number of coins each player has and determining the winner based on the optimal strategy, which is not what the given program does. The correct logic should be:

- If `a` and `b` are equal, Bob wins.
- If `a` and `b` are not equal, Alice wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy.
