### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is essentially a sequence of moves where each player must reduce the number of coins in their wallet by one.
   - The total number of coins in both wallets combined is \( a + b \).
   - Each turn, one coin is removed, so the total number of moves that can be made is \( a + b - 1 \) (since the last coin cannot be removed).
   - If the total number of moves \( a + b - 1 \) is even, then Bob will make the last move and Alice will lose.
   - If the total number of moves \( a + b - 1 \) is odd, then Alice will make the last move and Bob will lose.
   - This can be simplified to checking if \( (a + b) \% 2 == 0 \):
     - If true, Bob wins.
     - If false, Alice wins.

3. **Reviewing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the program is correct. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of \( a + b \).
   - The program uses the modulo operator to check the parity, which is the correct approach.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( a \) and \( b \) are both 1 correctly (Bob wins).
   - It also handles larger values of \( a \) and \( b \) correctly, as the modulo operation is valid for large integers.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The values of \( a \) and \( b \) are correctly parsed from the input.
   - The modulo operation is used correctly to determine the winner.
   - The final state of the program is consistent with the problem description and the logic of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Final: **True**
