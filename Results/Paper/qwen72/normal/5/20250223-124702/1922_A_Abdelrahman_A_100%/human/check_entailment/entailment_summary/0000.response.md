Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. However, the logic in the program has a critical flaw that makes it incorrect.

1. **Initial Check for Equality**:
   - The program first checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it cannot be the case that `a` and `b` match a template while `c` does not.

2. **Character Matching Logic**:
   - The program then iterates through each character in `c` and checks if the character is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. This logic is flawed because it only checks if the character in `c` is different from the characters in `a` and `b` at the same position, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template correctly.

3. **Template Matching**:
   - The correct approach should be to construct a template `t` where:
     - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `t[i]` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - For each position `i`, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `t[i]` can be any character that is not equal to `c[i]` and is different from the lowercase versions of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

4. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program does not construct the template `t` and only checks if `c` has a character that is not in `a` or `b` at the same position. This is insufficient because it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template correctly.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct solution would involve constructing the template `t` and then verifying if `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
