You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `tests` number of times, each time processing a new set of inputs `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each test case, if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `no` will be reset for each iteration, and `counter` will be used to track the position in the strings during each test case. After all iterations, `tests` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program has a logical flaw in how it checks the conditions for the template.

### Issue:
1. **Incorrect Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program checks if each character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b` using the condition `if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]`. This is incorrect because it only checks if the character in `c` is not present in `a` and `b` at the same position, but it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` match the template correctly.
   - For example, if `a = "abc"`, `b = "def"`, and `c = "ghi"`, the program will incorrectly print "YES" because it does not check if `a` and `b` can both match the same template.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will output "YES" because it only checks if each character in `c` is not in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. However, there is no template that can make `a` and `b` match while `c` does not. For example:
- If the template is "ABC", then `a` and `b` do not match because their characters are not different from the lowercase version of the template.
- If the template is "abc", then `a` and `b` do not match because their characters are not the same as the template.
- If the template is "AaA", then `a` and `b` do not match because `a` and `b` have different characters in the same position.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
