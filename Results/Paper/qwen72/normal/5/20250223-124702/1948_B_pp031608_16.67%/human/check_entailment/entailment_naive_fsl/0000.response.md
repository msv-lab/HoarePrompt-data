Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when it needs to apply the operation multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. The program only applies the operation once, and only to the first out-of-order element it encounters. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted, so it will print `Yes`. However, if the input is:
```
3
4
12 3 55 67
```

The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 55, 67]`, which is sorted, so it will print `Yes`. But if we split `55` into `5` and `5`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 67]`, which is still sorted. However, the program does not consider this and will print `Yes` without further checking, which is incorrect.

Another case where the program fails is when the array is initially unsorted and the operation needs to be applied to multiple elements to achieve a sorted array. For example:
```
3
4
12 3 55 4
```

The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 55, 4]`, which is still unsorted. The program will then print `No`, but if we split `55` into `5` and `5`, and then split `4` into `4`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4]`, and then `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4]` is still unsorted. The program does not handle this correctly and will print `No` prematurely.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider applying the operation to all elements that are at least 10 and then check if the resulting array is sorted.
