Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**: The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Operation Application**: The program attempts to apply the operation to elements in the array to make it sorted. It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10. If both conditions are met, it performs the operation:
   - It removes the previous element `list1[p - 1]`.
   - It inserts the tens digit `a // 10` at the previous position.
   - It inserts the units digit `a % 10` at the current position.

4. **Operation Logic**: The operation logic is correct in the sense that it splits the element into its digits and inserts them in the correct positions. However, the program only applies this operation once per element, which might not be sufficient to sort the array in all cases. The problem description allows for the operation to be applied any number of times, so a single pass might not be enough.

5. **Final Check**: After potentially applying the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`. If it is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the array might need multiple operations to become sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it might need to split `28` into `[2, 8]` and then recheck the array, which the current program does not do.

7. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The program does not have a mechanism to handle the case where the array might need multiple operations to become sorted. This could lead to an infinite loop if the array is not sorted after one pass and the operation is applied repeatedly without a termination condition.

Given these points, the program is not correct because it does not handle the possibility of needing multiple operations to sort the array.

Correctness: **False**
