You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check Function**: The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Operation Application**: The program attempts to apply the operation to elements in the array to make it sorted. It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10. If both conditions are met, it performs the operation:
   - It removes the previous element `list1[p - 1]`.
   - It inserts the tens digit `a // 10` at the previous position.
   - It inserts the units digit `a % 10` at the current position.

4. **Operation Logic**: The operation logic is correct in the sense that it splits the element into its digits and inserts them in the correct positions. However, the program only applies this operation once per element, which might not be sufficient to sort the array in all cases. The problem description allows for the operation to be applied any number of times, so a single pass might not be enough.

5. **Final Check**: After potentially applying the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`. If it is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the array might need multiple operations to become sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it might need to split `28` into `[2, 8]` and then recheck the array, which the current program does not do.

7. **Infinite Loop Risk**: The program does not have a mechanism to handle the case where the array might need multiple operations to become sorted. This could lead to an infinite loop if the array is not sorted after one pass and the operation is applied repeatedly without a termination condition.

Given these points, the program is not correct because it does not handle the possibility of needing multiple operations to sort the array.
