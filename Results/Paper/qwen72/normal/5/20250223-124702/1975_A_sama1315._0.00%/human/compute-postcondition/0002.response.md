Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0.** 

The variable `index` is initialized to 0, and the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `data` remain unchanged.
