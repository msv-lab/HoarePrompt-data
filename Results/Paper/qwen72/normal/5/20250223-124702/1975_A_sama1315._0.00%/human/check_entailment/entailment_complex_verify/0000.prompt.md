You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(arr) <= 50.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: `arr` is a list of positive integers such that 2 <= len(arr) <= 50, and there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` where the first element is greater than the second element.
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers with a length between 2 and 50. It returns 'Yes' if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and arr is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [result_1]
    #[result_2]
    #...
    #[result_t] (where each [result_i] is the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers, and there are `t` such results)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of integers, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of these function calls, one per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is the last integer value read from the input, `arr` is the last list of integers read from the input, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is equal to the length of `data`, and `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it does not correctly handle the operation described in the problem, which involves splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them to check if the array can be sorted. The function only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of sorting the array through the allowed operation.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
7 9 2 2 3
```
According to the problem description, this array can be sorted by performing the operations:
1. Split the array into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]`, then swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
2. Split the array into `x = [9]` and `y = [2, 2, 3, 7]`, then swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.

The correct output for this case should be "Yes", but `func_1` will return "No" because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of sorting through the allowed operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
