### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that `func_1` does not handle the operation described in the problem. Specifically, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements. The problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the operation of splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them.

Let's break down the issues and the necessary changes:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Current Behavior**: It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - **Required Behavior**: It should check if the array can be sorted by performing the allowed operation of splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Current Behavior**: It reads input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Required Behavior**: It should call a function that correctly checks if the array can be sorted by the allowed operation.

### Correct Implementation of `func_1`:

To correctly handle the problem, `func_1` should check if there exists a split point such that the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix. This can be done by finding the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order and then checking if the array can be sorted by swapping the parts around this point.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the first index where the array breaks the non-decreasing order
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Check if the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix
            # around the break point
            if all(arr[j] <= arr[(j + i + 1) % n] for j in range(n - 1)):
                return 'Yes'
            else:
                return 'No'
    return 'Yes'  # The array is already sorted
```

### Explanation of the Corrected `func_1`:

1. **Finding the Break Point**:
   - Iterate through the array to find the first index `i` where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`. This is the point where the array breaks the non-decreasing order.

2. **Checking the Sorted Condition After Swap**:
   - If a break point is found, check if the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix around this point.
   - This is done by checking if `arr[j] <= arr[(j + i + 1) % n]` for all `j` in the range `[0, n-2]`. This condition ensures that the array is sorted after the swap.

3. **Returning the Result**:
   - If the array is already sorted, return 'Yes'.
   - If a break point is found and the array can be sorted after the swap, return 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, return 'No'.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the original assessment and the reasoning above, the original program is indeed incorrect because `func_1` does not handle the required operation. The corrected implementation of `func_1` is necessary to solve the problem correctly.

Final: **False**
