Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. The key insight is that if the array can be split into two parts such that the suffix is non-decreasing and the prefix is non-decreasing, and the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix, then the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array and swapping parts to achieve a sorted array. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the input format and collects the results from `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are then printed, one per line.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
