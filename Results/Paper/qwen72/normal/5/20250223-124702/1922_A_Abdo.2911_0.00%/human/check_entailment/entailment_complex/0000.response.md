Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` as specified.

2. **Template Construction**: The function constructs the template in a way that ensures `a` and `b` match the template:
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends the lowercase letter to the template.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This ensures that `a` and `b` will match the template, as the uppercase letter will not match the lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

3. **Matching Check for `a` and `b`**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the template by iterating over each character.
   - If the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same as the template character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Matching Check for `c`**:
   - The function checks if `c` does not match the template by iterating over each character.
   - If the template character is lowercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is different from the template character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that `c[i]` is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

5. **Output**: The function prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are identical by using the same character in the template.
   - The function also handles the case where `a` and `b` differ in some positions by using uppercase characters in the template.

However, there is a logical error in the template construction and matching checks:

- **Template Construction**: The template construction logic is flawed. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, appending `a[i].upper()` to the template is not always correct. For example, if `a[i] = 'a'` and `b[i] = 'b'`, appending 'A' to the template would mean that `a` and `b` both must not have 'a' in that position, which is not necessarily true. Instead, the template should be constructed in a way that ensures both `a` and `b` can match it, and `c` cannot.

- **Matching Check for `c`**: The matching check for `c` is also incorrect. The function should ensure that `c` does not match the template in at least one position. The current logic only checks if `c` matches the template in all positions, which is the opposite of what is required.

To fix these issues, the template should be constructed differently, and the matching checks should be adjusted accordingly.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(None)  # Use None to indicate a flexible position
        
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i] is not None:
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
        
        match_c = False
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i] is not None:
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    match_c = True
                    break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

In this corrected version:
- The template is constructed with `None` for positions where `a` and `b` differ.
- The matching check for `a` and `b` ensures they match the template.
- The matching check for `c` ensures that `c` does not match the template in at least one position.
