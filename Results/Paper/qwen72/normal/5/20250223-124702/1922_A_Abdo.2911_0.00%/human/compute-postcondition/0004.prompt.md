You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer n, and three strings a, b, and c. n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and a, b, and c are strings of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        template = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        match_a_b = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
                ].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        match_c = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will read n, a, b, and c from the input. After processing, it will print 'YES' if the conditions for matching a and b with the template are met and c does not match the template, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The variables n, a, b, and c will be overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be the values from the last iteration. The template list will be reset and recalculated in each iteration, so its final state will be the result of the last iteration's calculations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. It returns a string that is the concatenation of `a`, `b`, and `c` in that order.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
