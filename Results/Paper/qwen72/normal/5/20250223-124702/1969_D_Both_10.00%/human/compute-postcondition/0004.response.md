To determine the output state after the loop executes, let's break down the given information and the loop logic:

### Initial State:
- `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
- `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial `sub_summ` Calculation:**
   - `sub_summ` starts as the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `val_b` in `main_ar`.
   - For each tuple, it checks if the sum of the first and second elements (`val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) is greater than or equal to 0.
   - If the condition is true, it adds the sum of the first and second elements to `sub_summ`.

### Final Output State:
- `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
- `sub_summ` will be the initial sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.

### Example:
Let's assume:
- `main_ar = [(1, 2), (-3, 1), (4, -2)]`
- `sec_arr = [(5, 6), (7, 8)]`

**Initial `sub_summ` Calculation:**
- `sub_summ = 5 + 7 = 12`

**Loop Execution:**
- For `val_b = (1, 2)`: `1 + 2 = 3` (which is >= 0), so `sub_summ += 3` → `sub_summ = 15`
- For `val_b = (-3, 1)`: `-3 + 1 = -2` (which is < 0), so `sub_summ` remains `15`
- For `val_b = (4, -2)`: `4 + (-2) = 2` (which is >= 0), so `sub_summ += 2` → `sub_summ = 17`

### Final Output State:
- `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
- `sub_summ` is now `17`.

### General Output State:
- `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
- `sub_summ` is the initial sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged. `sub_summ` is the initial sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the elements is greater than or equal to 0.**
