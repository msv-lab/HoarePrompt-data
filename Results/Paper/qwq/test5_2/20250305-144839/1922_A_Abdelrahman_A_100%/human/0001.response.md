Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The problem describes two conditions:

1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the i-th character of the template.

2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of the template.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template, meaning that at least one position doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider each position i from 1 to n and determine what constraints a, b, and c impose on the template t at that position.

Let's consider position i:

- For a to match t:

  - If t[i] is lowercase: a[i] must be equal to t[i].

  - If t[i] is uppercase: a[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- Similarly, for b to match t:

  - If t[i] is lowercase: b[i] must be equal to t[i].

  - If t[i] is uppercase: b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- For c to not match t:

  - There must be at least one position where:

    - If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] is not equal to t[i].

    - If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, I need to choose t[i] (either lowercase or uppercase) in such a way that for a and b, the matching conditions are satisfied, and for c, there's at least one position where the matching condition fails.

This seems like a problem of finding a template t that satisfies certain constraints for a and b, and violates constraints for c in at least one position.

Let me think about the possibilities for each position i.

For each position i, I have to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase.

- Then, a[i] must equal t[i], and b[i] must equal t[i].

- So, a[i] must be equal to b[i] for this to be possible.

- Also, for c[i], if t[i] is lowercase, c[i] must not equal t[i] for c to not match t.

- But since t[i] = a[i] = b[i], c[i] must not equal a[i] for this position to make c not match.

- However, this must hold for at least one position, but it's not required for all positions.

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase.

- Then, a[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- Similarly, b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

- For c[i], if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i] for c to not match t.

Wait, actually, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, in the case where t[i] is uppercase, for c to not match t, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

But in this case, since t[i] is uppercase, lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i].

So, for t[i] uppercase, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]) for c to not match t.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i.

- For c to not match t, at least one position must fail the condition, meaning:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

  - If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, in the case where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]) for c to not match t.

But in the matching condition for a and b, when t[i] is uppercase, a[i] and b[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

So, for each position i, I have to choose t[i] (lowercase or uppercase) such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

  - a[i] == t[i]

  - b[i] == t[i]

  - c[i] != t[i] (but this is not necessarily required, as c can fail to match at some position)

- If t[i] is uppercase:

  - a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

  - b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

  - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but for c to not match t, it's sufficient that there exists at least one position where the condition fails.

So, for the overall template t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Meanwhile, for a and b, all positions must satisfy:

- If t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

I need to find if there exists such a template t.

Let me try to think of this position by position.

For each position i, I can consider the choices for t[i]:

- Choose t[i] as lowercase: t[i] = a[i] (since a[i] must equal t[i]), and b[i] must equal a[i].

- Choose t[i] as uppercase: t[i] is an uppercase letter such that lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i].

Additionally, for c[i]:

- If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where one of these fails.

So, I need to ensure that for the chosen t, there is at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Meanwhile, for all positions:

- If t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

Let me consider the possibilities.

First, for positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If a[i] == b[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i], provided that c[i] != a[i].

- Or, choose t[i] as uppercase, set t[i] to any uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i], provided that c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, but if a[i] == b[i], and I choose t[i] as lowercase, then t[i] = a[i], and for c to not match at this position, c[i] != a[i].

If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], then choosing t[i] as lowercase satisfies the conditions for this position.

If a[i] == b[i], and c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because c would match at this position.

In that case, I need to choose t[i] as uppercase.

For t[i] uppercase, t[i] must be an uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

But c[i] == a[i] in this case.

So, I need to choose an uppercase t[i] such that lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], but c[i] == a[i].

Wait, but c[i] == a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which would imply lowercase(t[i]) == a[i], but t[i] was chosen such that lowercase(t[i]) != a[i]. This is a contradiction.

Therefore, if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, and choosing t[i] as uppercase leads to a contradiction.

Hence, in this case, it's impossible to find such a template t.

Now, consider positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i]:

- I can choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i], and since c[i] != a[i], c does not match at this position.

- Alternatively, I can choose t[i] as uppercase, choose t[i] as any uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i], and c[i] != lowercase(t[i]), which contradicts the requirement that c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) for c to not match.

Wait, no: for t[i] uppercase, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]) for c to not match.

But I chose t[i] such that lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == a[i] (since a[i] == b[i] != c[i]), which is not the case here.

Wait, in this subcase, c[i] != a[i], so c[i] != a[i] == lowercase(t[i]) if I choose t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == a[i], but that's not allowed because t[i] uppercase requires lowercase(t[i]) != a[i].

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let's rephrase.

If a[i] == b[i] != c[i]:

- Option 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i]. Then, c[i] != t[i], so c does not match at this position.

- Option 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase, set t[i] to any uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i]. Then, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) would require c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), but lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] != a[i], so I can choose lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], which is possible since c[i] != a[i].

So, both options are possible in this case.

Now, positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- In this case, I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i], which would require a[i] == b[i], which is not true.

- Therefore, I must choose t[i] as uppercase.

- For t[i] uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

- Additionally, for c to not match, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

So, in this case, I need to choose t[i] uppercase such that:

- lowercase(t[i]) != a[i]

- lowercase(t[i]) != b[i]

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Therefore, lowercase(t[i]) must be equal to c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], because lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i].

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I need c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible to choose such a t[i].

Wait, no.

If a[i] != b[i], I must choose t[i] uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Therefore, c[i] must not be equal to a[i] or b[i], because lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], but c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Hence, for positions where a[i] != b[i], it's necessary that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, it's impossible to choose such a t[i].

Wait, but if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], but lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], which would be impossible if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i].

Hence, for positions where a[i] != b[i], it's required that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Otherwise, no template t can satisfy the conditions for this position.

So, in summary:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

  - If c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase or uppercase.

  - If c[i] == a[i], it's impossible to choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

  - Must choose t[i] as uppercase.

  - Must have lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i].

  - Must have c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

  - Therefore, c[i] must != a[i] and != b[i].

Hence, for the entire strings:

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], it must hold that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- For positions where a[i] == b[i], if c[i] == a[i], it's impossible.

- Additionally, there must be at least one position where c does not match t, as per the problem's definition.

Wait, but in the previous analysis, if for all positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i], and for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can construct t accordingly.

But I need to ensure that c does not match t, which requires that there exists at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in the case where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i], and c[i] != t[i], satisfying the mismatch condition.

Alternatively, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I can choose t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], which makes c not match t at that position.

Therefore, if for all positions where a[i] != b[i], c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and for positions where a[i] == b[i], c[i] != a[i], then it's possible to construct such a template t.

Wait, but I need to ensure that c does not match t, which requires that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

In the case where a and b are identical to c in all positions where a[i] == b[i], but c differs in positions where a[i] != b[i], I need to make sure that there's at least one position where c does not match t.

But in the analysis above, if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], choosing t[i] lowercase satisfies c[i] != t[i].

Similarly, in positions where a[i] != b[i], choosing t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i] ensures c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is the condition for c not matching t.

Wait, no.

Actually, when t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is the condition for c not matching t.

Wait, no, let's recall:

- For c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

  - If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

  - If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in positions where a[i] != b[i], and I choose t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then c does not match t at that position.

Similarly, in positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], choosing t[i] lowercase makes c not match t at that position.

Therefore, in both cases, I can ensure that c does not match t.

Hence, the condition for the existence of such a template t is:

- For all positions where a[i] != b[i], it must hold that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- For all positions where a[i] == b[i], it must hold that c[i] != a[i].

If these conditions are satisfied, then I can construct t accordingly.

Wait, but in the first case, where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i], and c[i] != t[i].

Alternatively, I can choose t[i] as uppercase, set t[i] to any uppercase letter whose lowercase is not a[i], and choose c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is possible since c[i] != a[i].

In the second case, where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I must choose t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], which is possible since c[i] != a[i] and != b[i].

Therefore, if these conditions hold for all positions, then such a template t exists.

Moreover, since the problem requires that c does not match t, and I can ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t, as in both cases, c does not match t at positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and != b[i].

Hence, the conditions are sufficient to ensure the existence of such a template t.

Now, let's consider the example inputs to verify this logic.

First test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Here, a[1] != b[1], so must have c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], which holds since c = "c" != "a" and != "b".

Hence, such a template exists. For example, t = "C", which is uppercase, so for a and b:

- a[1] = "a" != "c" (lowercase of t[1])

- b[1] = "b" != "c"

- c[1] = "c" == "c" (lowercase of t[1]), so c does not match t.

Hence, "YES" is correct.

Second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Here, for position 1: a[1] = "a", b[1] = "b" != a[1], so must have c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1]. But c[1] = "a" == a[1], which violates the condition.

Hence, no such template exists, "NO" is correct.

Third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Comparing position by position:

Positions where a[i] == b[i]: 'a' == 'l' ? No, 'm' == 'l' ? No, etc.

Wait, likely none of the positions have a[i] == b[i], since "mathforces" and "luckforces" differ in multiple positions.

And c = "adhoccoder" differs from both a and b in many positions.

But in some positions, c[i] might equal a[i] or b[i].

Need to check for each position:

- Where a[i] != b[i], ensure c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- Where a[i] == b[i], ensure c[i] != a[i].

But in this case, since a and b differ in many positions, need to check if c differs from both a and b in those positions.

Looking at the example output, it's "YES", so presumably, the conditions are satisfied.

Fourth test case:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Let's check position by position:

Position 1: a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'a'

Here, a[1] == b[1], but c[1] == a[1], which violates the condition.

Hence, no such template exists, "NO" is correct.

So, based on this analysis, the conditions I outlined seem to hold.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

tests = int(input())

for i in range(tests):

slength = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

no = True

if c == a or c == b:

no = False

print('NO')

else:

counter = 0

for x in c:

if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:

no = False

print('YES')

break

counter += 1

if no:

print('NO')

Let's see if this program correctly implements the logic.

First, it reads the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Reads n, a, b, c.

- Initializes no = True.

- Checks if c == a or c == b. If so, prints 'NO'.

- Else, iterates through each character in c, and checks if c[i] not in a[i] and c[i] not in b[i]. If so, sets no = False and prints 'YES'.

- If no is still True after the loop, prints 'NO'.

Wait, there are a few issues here.

First, checking if c == a or c == b and printing 'NO' is correct, because if c is exactly equal to a or b, then a and b match some template t, but c also matches the same template, which violates the condition that c does not match t.

However, the loop that follows seems flawed.

The loop iterates through each character in c, and checks if c[i] not in a[i] and c[i] not in b[i].

But a[i] and b[i] are single characters, so "x not in a[counter]" is equivalent to "x != a[counter]", since a[counter] is a single character.

Similarly for b[counter].

So, the condition is:

if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]:

no = False

print('YES')

break

This seems to correspond to the condition that for some position i, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

But, according to my earlier analysis, this is necessary only for positions where a[i] != b[i].

In positions where a[i] == b[i], it's sufficient that c[i] != a[i] to choose t[i] as lowercase and have c not match t.

But the program seems to be checking for positions where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which is only part of the condition.

Moreover, in the case where a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i], this program would not print 'YES' immediately, but it should, because you can choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i], and since c[i] != a[i], c does not match t at that position.

But according to the program, it would only print 'YES' if there exists a position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], which is not always the case when a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

Hence, this program is incorrect.

For example, consider n=1, a="a", b="a", c="b".

Here, a == b, and c != a.

According to my earlier analysis, choosing t as "A" (uppercase), would make a and b match t (since a[i] != 'a'), and c does not match t because c[i] == 'b' == lowercase(t[i]).

But in this program, c != a and c != b, so it would enter the else clause.

Then, for the loop:

for x in c:

if x != a[0] and x != b[0]:

no = False

print('YES')

break

Here, c[0] = 'b', a[0] = 'a', b[0] = 'a'.

So, 'b' != 'a' and 'b' != 'a' is True, so it would print 'YES', which is correct.

Another test case: n=2, a="ab", b="ab", c="ac".

Here, a == b, and c != a in one position.

So, choosing t as "A" for the first position and "B" for the second position.

For position 1: t[1] = "A" (uppercase), a[1] = "a" != "a", b[1] = "a" != "a", c[1] = "a" == "a", so c does not match t at position 1.

For position 2: t[2] = "B" (uppercase), a[2] = "b" != "b", b[2] = "b" != "b", c[2] = "c" != "b", so c matches t at position 2.

But since there is at least one position where c does not match t, it should be 'YES'.

According to the program:

c != a and c != b, so enter else clause.

For position 1: c[1] = 'a', a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a'. 'a' != 'a' is False, so condition not satisfied.

For position 2: c[2] = 'c', a[2] = 'b', b[2] = 'b'. 'c' != 'b' and 'c' != 'b' is True, so print 'YES'.

Which is correct.

But consider n=2, a="ab", b="ac", c="ad".

Here, position 1: a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'a'. a[1] == b[1], c[1] == a[1]. So, cannot choose t[1] as lowercase, and choosing uppercase leads to contradiction as earlier.

Hence, no such template exists.

According to the program:

c != a and c != b, so enter else clause.

For position 1: c[1] = 'a', a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a'. 'a' != 'a' and 'a' != 'a' is False.

For position 2: c[2] = 'd', a[2] = 'b', b[2] = 'c'. 'd' != 'b' and 'd' != 'c' is True, so print 'YES'.

But according to my earlier analysis, it should be 'NO' because in position 1, a[1] == b[1] != c[1], but in position 2, a[2] != b[2], and c[2] != a[2] and != b[2], but overall, it's impossible to choose t[1] in a way that c does not match t.

Wait, no. In position 1, a[1] == b[1] == 'a', c[1] == 'a'.

As per earlier analysis, if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] == a[i], it's impossible to choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t.

Hence, overall, no such template exists.

But according to the program, it would print 'YES' because there exists a position where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
