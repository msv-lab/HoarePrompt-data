Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of 'a' burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of 'b' burles. The goal is to find out the minimum amount of money Maxim needs to spend to get exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases, and for each test case, there are three integers: n, a, and b. 'n' is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, 'a' is the regular price per yogurt, and 'b' is the promotional price for two yogurts.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

So, for the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9. If he buys two yogurts using the promotion, it costs 9 burles, which is less than buying them individually for 5 each, which would cost 10 burles. So, the minimum cost is 9.

In the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9. If he buys one promotion (2 yogurts for 9) and one individual yogurt for 5, the total is 14 burles. Alternatively, buying three individually would cost 15 burles, which is more. So, 14 is the minimum.

Third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11. If he buys one promotion (2 yogurts for 11) and one individual yogurt for 5, the total is 16 burles. But the output is 15, which suggests that maybe buying all three individually would cost 15 burles, which is less than 16. Wait, but according to the note, it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5, which would be 16. So, apparently, in this case, buying individually is better.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the only options are to buy individual yogurts at price 'a' or two yogurts together at price 'b'. There's no mention of buying three yogurts together at a specific price. So, perhaps the output of 15 for the third test case is a mistake, or maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no. Looking back at the note: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5." But according to the problem, the only options are buying individually or buying two together at the promotional price. So, perhaps the note is just explaining that buying two at 11 and one at 5 would total 16, which is more than buying three individually at 5 each, totaling 15. So, in this case, buying all three individually is cheaper than using the promotion for two and buying one individually.

So, the key is to compare the cost per yogurt in the promotion versus the individual price and decide accordingly.

Let me think about how to generalize this.

For any number of yogurts n, I can buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price b, and then buy the remaining yogurt(s) individually at price a.

But, I need to consider that sometimes, buying individually might be cheaper than using the promotion.

So, I should calculate the cost per yogurt for the promotion, which is b / 2, and compare it to the individual price a.

If b / 2 is less than a, then it's cheaper to buy yogurts in pairs using the promotion.

Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy them individually.

But, since n might not be even, there might be one yogurt left over that has to be bought individually.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11, b / 2 = 5.5, which is more than a=5, so buying individually is cheaper. And indeed, buying three individually costs 15, which is less than buying two for 11 and one for 5, which would be 16.

In the fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11, b / 2 = 5.5, which is more than a=5, so buying individually is cheaper. Buying four individually costs 20, which is less than buying two pairs for 11 each, totaling 22.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the output is 20, which is buying four individually at 5 each, totaling 20, which is indeed less than buying two pairs at 11 each, which would be 22.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- Calculate how many pairs can be bought using the promotion, which is n // 2.

- Calculate the cost for these pairs: (n // 2) * b.

- If there's a remaining yogurt (n % 2 == 1), add the individual price a.

- Compare this total with the cost of buying all yogurts individually, which is n * a.

- Choose the minimum of these two options.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9:

- Buying one pair: 9

- Buying two individually: 10

- Minimum is 9.

In the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9:

- Buying one pair and one individual: 9 + 5 = 14

- Buying three individually: 15

- Minimum is 14.

In the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11:

- Buying one pair and one individual: 11 + 5 = 16

- Buying three individually: 15

- Minimum is 15.

In the fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11:

- Buying two pairs: 22

- Buying four individually: 20

- Minimum is 20.

So, this approach seems consistent with the example outputs.

Therefore, the correct way to compute the minimum cost is:

- Compute the cost using as many promotions as possible, plus individual items if needed.

- Compute the cost of buying all items individually.

- Choose the minimum of these two costs.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

d = c / 2

if a * b < a * d:

print(a * b)

else:

print(round(a * d))

Wait, there are some issues here.

First, in the function, the variables are named a, b, c, where c is the promotional price for two yogurts.

But in the problem statement, the variables are n, a, b, where n is the number of yogurts, a is the individual price, and b is the promotional price for two.

So, in the code, it seems that:

- a is n (number of yogurts)

- b is a (individual price)

- c is b (promotional price for two)

But the logic in the code doesn't seem to match the approach I outlined.

Let me try to map the variables correctly.

In the code:

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

Here, a is n, b is a, c is b.

Then, d = c / 2, which is the promotional price per yogurt.

Then, it checks if a * b < a * d, which translates to n * a < n * (c / 2), meaning is the individual price total less than the promotional price total if applied to all yogurts.

But this doesn't account for the fact that promotions can only be applied in pairs.

Moreover, it prints round(a * d), which would be rounding the total promotional price per yogurt times n, but again, promotions are only for pairs.

This seems incorrect.

The correct approach should be:

- Calculate the number of pairs that can be bought: n // 2

- Calculate the cost for these pairs: (n // 2) * b

- Calculate the cost for the remaining yogurt(s): if n % 2 == 1, then a

- Total cost using promotions: (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

- Cost without promotions: n * a

- Choose the minimum of these two.

So, the code should reflect this logic.

But in the given code, it's not doing that. It's comparing n * a with n * (b / 2), which doesn't make sense because promotions are only for pairs.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
