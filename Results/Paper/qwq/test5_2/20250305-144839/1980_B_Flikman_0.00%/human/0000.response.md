Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, indexed by f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and then arranges them in non-increasing order based on their values. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other can be anything.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

So, n=5 cubes, favorite is cube 2, and he removes the first 2 cubes after sorting.

The values are [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]. After sorting in non-increasing order, it could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]. If the favorite cube (initially at position 2 with value 3) ends up in position 2, it would be removed. Alternatively, if it ends up in position 3, it wouldn't be removed. So, it's possible for it to be removed or not, depending on how the same values are ordered. Hence, the answer is "MAYBE".

Another example:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

Here, n=5, favorite is cube 5, k=2.

Values: [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]. After sorting: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The favorite cube has value 3, which is in position 3. Since k=2, only the first 2 are removed, so the favorite is not removed. Hence, "NO".

Wait, but in this case, it's "NO", meaning it will never be removed, regardless of how same values are ordered. But in the first example, it's "MAYBE", because depending on the ordering of same values, it could be removed or not.

So, I need to figure out a way to determine, for any given input, whether the favorite cube will always be removed, never be removed, or it's possible for either scenario.

Let's think about how the sorting works. It's non-increasing order, so highest values first, and if values are equal, their relative order is arbitrary.

So, to determine the position of the favorite cube after sorting, I need to know how many cubes have values greater than or equal to the favorite's value.

Wait, no. In non-increasing order, cubes with higher values come first, so the position of the favorite cube depends on how many cubes have values strictly greater than its value.

Let me think carefully.

Suppose the favorite cube has value v. The number of cubes with value greater than v determines how high the favorite cube can be positioned after sorting.

Specifically, all cubes with value greater than v will come before the favorite cube in the sorted order.

The number of such cubes is the count of cubes with a_i > v.

Then, the favorite cube can be positioned right after these higher cubes.

But if there are multiple cubes with value v, their relative order is arbitrary.

So, the favorite cube can be in any position from (number of cubes with a_i > v) + 1 to (number of cubes with a_i >= v).

Because among the cubes with a_i >= v, the ones with a_i > v are before those with a_i == v, but the order among those with a_i == v is arbitrary.

Therefore, the favorite cube's position after sorting can be any position from P_min to P_max, where:

P_min = number of cubes with a_i > v + 1

P_max = number of cubes with a_i > v + number of cubes with a_i == v

Now, if all possible positions of the favorite cube are within the first k positions, then it will always be removed, so answer is "YES".

If none of its possible positions are within the first k positions, then it will never be removed, so answer is "NO".

Otherwise, it's "MAYBE", depending on the ordering of cubes with the same value as the favorite.

Let me formalize this:

Let v = a[f-1] (since indexing is from 0 in code)

Let greater_count = number of cubes with a_i > v

Let same_count = number of cubes with a_i == v

Then, P_min = greater_count + 1

P_max = greater_count + same_count

Now, if P_min > k, then the favorite cube is always after the first k cubes, so "NO"

If P_max <= k, then the favorite cube is always among the first k cubes, so "YES"

Else, it's "MAYBE"

Wait, let's verify this with the first example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4,3,3,2,3]

v = a[1] = 3

greater_count = number of a_i > 3, which is 1 (the 4)

same_count = number of a_i == 3, which is 3

So, P_min = 1 + 1 = 2

P_max = 1 + 3 = 4

k=2

Since P_min = 2 <= k=2 < P_max=4, so it's "MAYBE"

Yes, matches the example.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a = [5,2,4,1,3]

v = a[4] = 3

greater_count = number of a_i > 3, which are 5 and 4, so 2

same_count = number of a_i == 3, which is 1

P_min = 2 + 1 = 3

P_max = 2 + 1 = 3

k=2

Since P_max = 3 > k=2, so "NO"

Yes, matches the example.

Another one:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a = [1,2,5,4,3]

v = a[4] = 3

greater_count = number of a_i > 3, which are 5 and 4, so 2

same_count = number of a_i == 3, which is 1

P_min = 2 + 1 = 3

P_max = 2 + 1 = 3

k=5

Since P_max=3 <= k=5, so "YES"

Wait, but in the sample input, for this case, output is "YES", which matches.

Another sample:

n=1, f=1, k=1

a = [42]

v = a[0] = 42

greater_count = 0

same_count = 1

P_min = 0 + 1 = 1

P_max = 0 + 1 = 1

k=1

Since P_min=1 <= k=1, so "YES"

Yes, matches the sample.

Seems correct.

Now, in the code provided, let's see:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

favorite_value = a[f - 1]

same_value_count = 0

for value in a:

if value == favorite_value:

same_value_count += 1

greater_count = 0

for value in a:

if value > favorite_value:

greater_count += 1

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

So, it's calculating greater_count and same_value_count correctly.

Then, it's checking:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

Wait, is this correct?

Wait, greater_count is the number of cubes with a_i > v.

If greater_count >= k, that means there are at least k cubes with values greater than v, so the favorite cube, having value v, would be positioned at P_min = greater_count + 1, which is >= k + 1, meaning it's after the first k cubes, so it should be "NO", not "YES".

Wait, this seems incorrect.

Wait, no, if greater_count >= k, then P_min = greater_count + 1 >= k + 1, which is > k, so the favorite cube is always after the first k cubes, so it's not removed, so "NO".

But the code is printing "YES" in this case, which is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

In the code:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be "NO" in this case.

Let me check with the first sample:

n=5, f=2, k=2

greater_count=1, which is < k=2, so it doesn't enter this condition.

In the second sample:

n=5, f=5, k=2

greater_count=2, which >= k=2, so it would print "YES", but according to the sample, it should be "NO".

Hence, this is incorrect.

Wait, in my earlier manual reasoning, if greater_count >= k, then P_min = greater_count + 1 >= k + 1, which is > k, so the favorite cube is always not removed, hence "NO".

But the code is printing "YES", which is wrong.

So, this seems to be a mistake in the code.

Let me see the next condition:

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

Else:

print('MAYBE')

Wait, according to my earlier reasoning, if P_max <= k, which is greater_count + same_value_count <= k, then "YES", because the favorite cube is always among the first k cubes.

But in the code, it's printing "NO" in this case, which is again incorrect.

So, it seems the code has the conditions swapped.

It should be:

if greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + 1 > k:

print('NO')

Else:

print('MAYBE')

Wait, let's double-check.

From earlier:

If P_min > k, which is greater_count + 1 > k, then "NO"

If P_max <= k, which is greater_count + same_value_count <= k, then "YES"

Else, "MAYBE"

So, in code, it should be:

if greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + 1 > k:

print('NO')

Else:

print('MAYBE')

But in the given code, it's:

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

Else:

print('MAYBE')

Which is incorrect, because:

greater_count >= k should correspond to P_min = greater_count + 1 >= k + 1, which is > k, so "NO"

greater_count + same_value_count <= k corresponds to P_max = greater_count + same_value_count <= k, so "YES"

So, the code has the first two conditions swapped.

It should be:

if greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + 1 > k:

print('NO')

Else:

print('MAYBE')

Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, for the first case:

5 2 2

4 3 3 2 3

greater_count=1, same_value_count=3

1 + 3 = 4 <= 2? No, 4 > 2, so it should be "MAYBE"

In the code, greater_count=1 < k=2, so it goes to the else clause and prints "MAYBE", which is correct in this case, but only by coincidence.

In the second sample:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

greater_count=2, same_value_count=1

2 >= 2, so prints "YES", but according to correct reasoning, should be "NO"

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
