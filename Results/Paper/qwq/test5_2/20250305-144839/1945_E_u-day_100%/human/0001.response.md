Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the catch: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps on the permutation before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the permutation in such a way that after performing the binary search, the value at position l is equal to x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. Here, we're applying it to an unsorted array, which is unusual. The algorithm described is a bit different from the standard binary search. Let's see:

- Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

- While r - l != 1:

- Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

Finally, it checks if p_l == x.

Wait a second, in standard binary search, we have l = 0 and r = n-1, and we adjust m based on whether the middle element is less than or greater than the target. Here, l starts at 1 and r at n+1, which is a bit non-standard. Also, the condition to exit the loop is when r - l == 1, which makes sense because it's trying to converge l and r such that they are adjacent, and then p_l should be equal to x.

Given that the array is a permutation, all elements are unique. The problem states that it's possible to achieve the goal with at most two swaps, and I need to find such a sequence of swaps.

Looking at the provided code, it seems like it's trying to perform this task. Let's go through the code step by step.

The code starts with:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_3()

def func_1():

return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():

return list(func_1())

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n)

st = set()

while low + 1 < high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

So, in func_3(), which handles each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the permutation array arr.

- Find the position pos of k in arr.

- Initialize low = 0 and high = n.

- Use a while loop to simulate the binary search, updating low and high based on whether arr[mid] <= k or not.

- After the loop, check if arr[low] == k. If yes, print 0 (meaning no swaps are needed). Else, print 1 and then the positions (1-indexed) to swap: low + 1 and pos + 1.

Wait, this seems too simplistic. The problem allows up to two swaps, but this code only attempts one swap. However, the example in the problem suggests that sometimes two swaps are needed.

Looking back at the problem statement: "perform the following operation no more than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) and swap the elements at positions i and j."

So, I can perform up to two swaps to rearrange the array before running the binary search.

The code only performs one swap if necessary. Is this sufficient? The problem mentions that two operations are always sufficient, but perhaps in many cases, one swap is enough.

Let me think about when two swaps are needed.

Suppose the current position of x is such that after the binary search, p_l is not x, and swapping x to the position where p_l is would not make p_l equal to x. In that case, maybe one swap isn't enough, and I need a second swap to adjust another element.

But the provided code only performs one swap. Let's see if it works with the sample inputs.

Looking at the first sample input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

And the corresponding outputs:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

So, for the first test case, n=6, x=3, arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6]. The output is 0, meaning no swaps are needed, and indeed, the array is already sorted, so the binary search should find x=3 correctly.

Second test case: n=6, x=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]. Output is 1, swapping positions 3 and 4. So, swapping arr[3]=5 and arr[4]=2, resulting in arr=[3,1,6,2,5,4]. Then, performing the binary search.

Wait, but in 1-indexed, position 3 is 6 and position 4 is 5. Swapping them would make arr=[3,1,5,6,2,4]. Then, let's see how the binary search proceeds.

Initialize l=1, r=7.

First loop:

mid = floor((1+7)/2) = 4

arr[4]=6 >5, so high=4

Second loop:

low=1, high=4

mid=floor((1+4)/2)=2

arr[2]=1 <=5, so low=2

Now, low=2, high=4

Third loop:

mid=floor((2+4)/2)=3

arr[3]=5 <=5, so low=3

Now, low=3, high=4

Since r - l =1, exit loop.

Check arr[low]=arr[3]=5 == x=5. Correct.

So, with one swap, it worked.

Third test case: n=5, x=1, arr=[3,5,4,2,1]. Output is 2 swaps: 2 4 and 1 5.

First swap: positions 2 and 4, arr becomes [3,2,4,5,1]

Second swap: positions 1 and 5, arr becomes [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, perform binary search:

l=1, r=6

First loop:

mid=floor((1+6)/2)=3

arr[3]=4 >1, so high=3

Second loop:

low=1, high=3

mid=floor((1+3)/2)=2

arr[2]=2 >1, so high=2

Third loop:

low=1, high=2

mid=floor((1+2)/2)=1

arr[1]=1 <=1, so low=1

Now, low=1, high=2

Since r - l =1, exit loop.

Check arr[low]=arr[1]=1 == x=1. Correct.

So, two swaps were necessary in this case.

But looking back at the code, it only performs one swap if needed. So, how does it handle cases where two swaps are needed?

In the third test case, it outputs 2 swaps, but according to the code, it should only perform one swap. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code provided is incomplete or incorrect. Let's check.

Looking back at the code:

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

It only performs one swap. But in the sample output, for the third test case, it shows 2 swaps. So, either the code is different from what's provided, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the code is handling cases where one swap is sufficient, and for cases where two swaps are needed, it's not correctly handling them.

Looking back at the problem, it says "perform the following operation no more than 2 times... It can be shown that 2 operations are always sufficient."

So, in some cases, one swap might be enough, and in others, two swaps are needed.

The provided code only attempts one swap, but in the sample output, there are cases with two swaps.

This suggests that the provided code might not be correct, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how it's implemented.

Wait, perhaps the code is handling cases where one swap suffices, and for cases where two swaps are needed, it's outputting two swaps correctly.

But in the code provided, it only outputs at most one swap. So, there might be an error in the code.

Looking back, perhaps the code is different from what's provided, or maybe I misread it.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the code.

Looking back at the code:

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

This only performs one swap. But in the sample output, there are cases with two swaps.

So, perhaps the code is incomplete, and there's more to it.

Wait, perhaps the code handles both cases: one swap and two swaps.

But in the provided code, it only outputs one swap when needed.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, after performing one swap, the binary search works correctly, and in some cases, one swap is enough. In other cases, like the third test case, two swaps are needed.

But the code only attempts one swap. So, how does it handle cases where two swaps are required?

Maybe the code is incorrect, or perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the positions where the swaps should be performed.

Let me think about the binary search process.

Given that the binary search is applied to an unsorted array, and we can perform up to two swaps, I need to adjust the array so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

I need to understand how the binary search works in this context.

In standard binary search, the array is sorted, and we look for the target by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Here, the array is not sorted, and the binary search is performed as described, with l and r initialized to 1 and n+1, respectively.

I need to simulate the binary search to see where it ends up, and then figure out how to adjust the array so that it points to x.

Let me consider that the binary search will follow a path based on the values in the array, and I need to ensure that this path leads to x.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I need to see what impact these swaps can have on the search path.

Perhaps, by swapping certain elements, I can redirect the search path to reach x.

Alternatively, maybe I can bring x to a position where the search will naturally find it.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider where the binary search ends up after its execution, and see if swapping x to that position would make p_l equal to x.

But in some cases, that might not be sufficient, hence the need for up to two swaps.

Let me consider an example.

Take the third test case:

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

Performing the binary search:

l=1, r=6

mid=floor((1+6)/2)=3

arr[3]=4 >1, so high=3

Now, low=1, high=3

mid=floor((1+3)/2)=2

arr[2]=5 >1, so high=2

Now, low=1, high=2

mid=floor((1+2)/2)=1

arr[1]=3 >1, so high=1

Now, r - l =1-1=0, which is less than 1, so exit loop.

Check p_l = p[1]=3 !=1

So, need to perform swaps to make p_l =1.

The sample output suggests performing two swaps: first swap positions 2 and 4, then swap positions 1 and 5.

Let's see:

Original array: [3,5,4,2,1]

After swapping positions 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

After swapping positions 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, perform binary search:

l=1, r=6

mid=floor((1+6)/2)=3

arr[3]=4 >1, high=3

low=1, high=3

mid=floor((1+3)/2)=2

arr[2]=2 >1, high=2

low=1, high=2

mid=floor((1+2)/2)=1

arr[1]=1 <=1, low=1

Now, low=1, high=2, r - l =1, exit loop.

Check p_l = p[1]=1 == x=1.

It works.

So, with two swaps, it's possible to arrange the array so that the binary search finds x.

But the provided code only attempts one swap. So, it must be handling cases where one swap is sufficient, and for cases where two swaps are needed, it's doing something different.

Looking back at the code:

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

This only performs one swap: swapping x's position with the position where the binary search ends.

But in the sample output, there are cases with two swaps.

So, perhaps in some cases, one swap isn't enough, and two swaps are needed.

Wait, maybe the code is handling that internally, and sometimes outputs two swaps.

But in the provided code, it only outputs up to one swap.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the sample output, for some test cases, it outputs two swaps.

But in the code, it only outputs one swap when needed.

This suggests that the code might be incomplete or incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the code is handling cases where one swap is sufficient, and for cases where one swap isn't enough, it's outputting two swaps accordingly.

But in the provided code, it only outputs up to one swap.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

Maybe the code is designed to perform one swap and check if it's enough, and if not, perform a second swap.

But in the provided code, it only outputs one swap.

Wait, perhaps the code is different, or there's a misunderstanding.

Alternatively, maybe the code is handling the swaps correctly, and the second swap is handled implicitly.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider another approach.

Given that I can perform up to two swaps, I need to adjust the array such that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

I need to find a way to rearrange the array with at most two swaps to achieve this.

One way to think about it is to simulate the binary search and see what path it takes, then adjust the array so that the path leads to x.

However, this might be too involved.

An alternative approach is to note that with two swaps, I can place x in the desired position and adjust one other element if necessary.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the final position where the binary search ends up, and swap x to that position.

If that's not sufficient, perform a second swap to fix any discrepancies.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me look back at the sample input and output to understand the expected behavior.

First test case:

n=6, x=3, arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

Output: 0

Since the array is already sorted, and the binary search will find x=3 correctly, no swaps are needed.

Second test case:

n=6, x=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

Output: 1

Swap positions 3 and 4: swap 6 and 5.

New array: [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Perform binary search:

l=1, r=7

mid=floor((1+7)/2)=4

arr[4]=6 >5, high=4

low=1, high=4

mid=floor((1+4)/2)=2

arr[2]=1 <=5, low=2

low=2, high=4

mid=floor((2+4)/2)=3

arr[3]=5 <=5, low=3

low=3, high=4

r - l =1, exit loop.

Check arr[3]=5 == x=5.

So, one swap suffices.

Third test case:

n=5, x=1, arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

Output: 2

First swap: 2 and 4, arr becomes [3,2,4,5,1]

Second swap: 1 and 5, arr becomes [1,2,4,5,3]

Perform binary search as before, which finds x=1.

So, in this case, two swaps are needed.

But the provided code only attempts one swap.

This suggests that the code might be incorrect, as it doesn't handle cases where two swaps are needed.

Wait, perhaps there's more to the code, or perhaps I need to implement a way to handle both cases: one swap and two swaps.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to handle this with only one swap in some cases and two swaps in others.

But in the provided code, it only outputs up to one swap, which doesn't match the sample output where two swaps are performed.

Therefore, the provided code is incomplete or incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
