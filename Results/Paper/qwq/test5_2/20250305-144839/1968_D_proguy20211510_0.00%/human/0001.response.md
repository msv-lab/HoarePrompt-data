Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at certain positions in a permutation. They play a game for k turns, and in each turn, they can choose to stay in their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. Their score increases by the value of a corresponding array a at their current position each turn. The goal is to determine who wins the game based on their final scores after k turns, assuming both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case:

- n is the length of the permutation and the array a.

- k is the number of turns in the game.

- P_B and P_S are the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

- The permutation p is an array of n integers, each between 1 and n, with no duplicates.

- The array a is an array of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9.

The players make moves simultaneously in each turn, and each must choose to stay or move to p[x] in their current position x. The score increases by a[x] in each turn.

The problem is to determine who wins the game, given that both players play optimally to maximize their scores.

I need to figure out how to model this game and determine the optimal strategy for both players.

First, since the players make moves simultaneously and independently, their moves don't directly affect each other. Each player tries to maximize their own score by choosing to stay or move at each turn.

Given that, for each player, the problem reduces to choosing at each turn whether to stay or move to p[x], to maximize their cumulative score over k turns.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where for each player, I can compute the maximum score they can achieve starting from their initial position over k turns.

However, given the constraints (n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9), a standard DP approach with O(n*k) time complexity would be too slow. I need a smarter way to compute the maximum score for each player.

Let's think about the permutation p. Since p is a permutation, it forms a collection of cycles. The behavior of moving according to p will cycle through these cycles.

Given that, perhaps I can analyze the cycles in the permutation and determine the optimal path for each player based on the cycle structure.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Let's consider that in each turn, a player can choose to stay and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Wait, but they can choose independently each turn whether to stay or move. So it's not just following a path determined by p.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a way to compute the maximum possible score for each player independently.

Let me consider one player. The player starts at position x. Each turn, they can choose to stay at x and get a[x], or move to p[x] and get a[p[x]] in the next turn.

This sounds like a decision tree where at each turn, the player chooses to stay or move.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to choose at each turn whether to collect a[x] and stay, or to move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

But with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can model this as a recursive function with memoization, but again, with n up to 2*10^5, that might not be feasible.

Wait, maybe I can find a pattern or a loop in the permutation for each starting position.

Since p is a permutation, starting from any position x, repeatedly applying p will eventually lead back to x, forming a cycle.

So, for each player, their positions over k turns will eventually cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the maximum score by considering the cycle they are in and choosing to stay at the position with the maximum a value in that cycle.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn.

Wait, but they have to move according to p if they choose to move.

But since they can choose to stay or move each turn, they can effectively choose to stay at any position in the cycle at any time.

Wait, no. If they choose to move, they have to move to p[x], not choose any position.

So it's not that they can choose any position in the cycle at any time; they have to follow the permutation path.

But perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a value in their cycle, and then have them collect that value for the remaining turns after reaching that position.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

This sounds like a decision at each turn: collect a[x] now, or potentially collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

But since they can choose independently each turn, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the maximum value in the orbit of x under p.

For each starting position x, the player can eventually reach any position in the cycle containing x, and they can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a value in that cycle for the remaining turns.

If that's the case, then the optimal strategy is to reach the position with the maximum a value in their cycle as quickly as possible, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

So, for each player, I can find the cycle containing their starting position, find the maximum a value in that cycle, and then determine how many turns it takes to reach that position.

Then, the maximum score would be the sum of the a values along the path to the maximum position, plus the maximum a value times the remaining turns.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me try with the first example:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

Let's see the cycles:

Starting from 1: 1 -> p[1]=2 -> p[2]=1 -> cycle: 1-2

Starting from 3: 3 -> p[3]=2 -> p[2]=1 -> p[1]=2 -> cycle: 3-2-1

Wait, actually, p = [4,1,2,3], so:

Index 1: p[1]=4

Index 2: p[2]=1

Index 3: p[3]=2

Index 4: p[4]=3

So, cycles:

1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (cycle length 4)

So, a single cycle: 1-4-3-2

For Bodya starting at 3, the cycle is 1-4-3-2.

The a values are a1=7, a4=6, a3=5, a2=2.

The maximum a value in the cycle is a1=7.

So, Bodya wants to reach position 1 as quickly as possible and stay there.

In this case, starting at 3:

Turn 1: choose to move to p[3]=2

Turn 2: choose to move to p[2]=1

But wait, k=2, so only 2 turns.

In turn 1, Bodya is at 3, choose to stay and collect a3=5, or move to p[3]=2 and collect a2=2.

If he stays at 3, score +=5, position remains 3.

If he moves to 2, score +=2, position becomes 2.

In turn 2, if he stayed at 3 in turn 1:

Option 1: stay at 3 again, score +=5, total=10.

Option 2: move to p[3]=2, score +=2, total=7.

If he moved to 2 in turn 1:

Option 1: stay at 2, score +=2, total=4.

Option 2: move to p[2]=1, score +=7, total=9.

So, the maximum score for Bodya is 10, by staying at 3 for both turns.

But according to the explanation in the example, Bodya's score is 10, Sasha's is 9, so Bodya wins.

So, in this case, staying at 3 with a[3]=5 for both turns gives 10, which is better than moving to 2 and then to 1, which would give only 9.

Wait, but a[1]=7 is greater than a[3]=5, but moving to 1 would require two moves, which only gives 2 + 7 = 9, which is less than staying at 3 and getting 5 + 5 = 10.

So, in this case, staying at the position with a[3]=5 is better than moving to a[1]=7 via two moves.

So, my previous assumption that reaching the maximum a position is always better might not hold if the number of turns is limited.

Hence, I need a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

For each player, I can model their possible positions over k turns.

But that seems too complex.

An alternative approach is to realize that in each turn, the player can choose to stay and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

This sounds like a decision to either collect a[x] now or a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Given that, the optimal strategy would be to collect the maximum possible a value available in the current position or any future position reachable within the remaining turns.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay at any position in their cycle after some initial moves.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each player the maximum a value in their cycle, and then determine if they can reach that position within k turns.

But in the first example, even though the maximum a value in the cycle is 7, Bodya can get a higher score by staying at 5 for both turns.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the local maximum a value.

But I need a general approach.

Let me consider that for each player, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a value in their cycle, once reached.

To achieve that, the player should move towards that position as quickly as possible and then stay there.

But in the first example, moving to the position with a=7 would require two moves, resulting in a lower total score.

Hence, staying at a higher a value position might be better even if there's a higher a value elsewhere, if reaching it requires too many moves.

This is tricky.

Maybe I need to compute for each player the maximum possible score over k turns, considering their movement options.

Given time constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that for each player, I can simulate their movement up to the point where they enter a cycle, and then handle the cycling part efficiently.

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where each node is a position, and there's an edge from x to p[x].

Since p is a permutation, this graph consists of disjoint cycles.

Given that, for each player, their movement is constrained to their cycle.

Hence, I can consider only the cycle containing their starting position.

Then, in their cycle, they can choose to be at any position in the cycle in any turn, but with some constraints based on the cycle structure.

Wait, no. Actually, since they move according to p[x], they can only be at positions that are reachable by following p from their starting position.

But they can choose to stay at their current position, which adds flexibility.

This complicates things.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

Let me define for each player a sequence of positions x_1, x_2, ..., x_k, where x_1 is their starting position, and for each turn t from 1 to k-1, x_{t+1} is either x_t (if they stay) or p[x_t] (if they move).

Their total score is the sum of a[x_t] for t from 1 to k.

Given that, I need to maximize this sum for each player.

Given the constraints on n and k, I need an efficient way to compute this maximum for each player.

An idea: for each player, find the maximum a value in their cycle, and then decide how many times to collect that value.

But in the first example, collecting a[3]=5 twice is better than collecting a[1]=7 once and a[2]=2 once.

Hence, perhaps in some cases, it's better to collect a lower value multiple times than to move to a higher value.

Wait, but in the first example, collecting a[3]=5 twice gives 10, while moving to a[1]=7 once and a[2]=2 once gives 9, which is less.

Hence, in this case, staying at a lower value is better.

But in another scenario, moving to a higher value might be better.

Hence, I need a general way to compute the maximum possible score for each player.

Let me consider that for each player, their movement forms a directed tree where each node has out-degree 1, and the edges represent the move to p[x].

But since they can choose to stay or move each turn, it's more like a graph where from each position x, there are two options: stay at x or move to p[x].

This would lead to an exponential number of paths, which is not feasible for large k and n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for each player, their movement can be modeled as a Markov chain, where at each step, they choose to stay or move.

But again, this seems too slow for large n and k.

Wait, perhaps I can find that the optimal strategy for each player is to reach the position with the maximum a value in their cycle as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Then, the maximum score would be the sum of the a values on the path to that position, plus the maximum a value times the remaining turns.

In the first example, the maximum a value in the cycle is a[1]=7.

For Bodya starting at 3, the path to 1 is: 3 -> 2 -> 1, which takes 2 turns.

But in this case, k=2, so he can only reach position 1 in the second turn.

Hence, his score would be a[3]=5 in the first turn and a[1]=7 in the second turn, totaling 12.

But in the explanation, it says Bodya stays at 3 for both turns, getting 5+5=10.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Let me simulate Bodya's possible moves:

Turn 1:

- Stay at 3: score +=5, position remains 3.

- Move to p[3]=2: score +=2, position becomes 2.

Turn 2:

- If stayed at 3 in turn 1:

- Stay at 3: score +=5, total=10.

- Move to p[3]=2: score +=2, total=7.

- If moved to 2 in turn 1:

- Stay at 2: score +=2, total=4.

- Move to p[2]=1: score +=7, total=9.

Hence, the maximum score is 10 by staying at 3 for both turns.

But according to my earlier assumption, if Bodya moves to 1 in the second turn, he should have a total of 5 (first turn) + 7 (second turn) = 12.

But that seems inconsistent with the possible moves.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the movement.

Let's see:

Starting at 3.

Option 1: stay at 3 in turn 1, score +=5, position remains 3.

In turn 2: stay at 3, score +=5, total=10.

Or move to p[3]=2, score +=2, total=7.

Option 2: move to p[3]=2 in turn 1, score +=2, position becomes 2.

In turn 2: stay at 2, score +=2, total=4.

Or move to p[2]=1, score +=7, total=9.

Hence, the best is to stay at 3 for both turns, getting 10.

But according to my earlier assumption, moving to 1 would give 5 + 7 = 12, but that seems not possible within 2 turns because moving to 1 would require moving from 3 to 2 to 1, which would be turn 1: move to 2 (score 2), turn 2: move to 1 (score 7), total 9.

Wait, why is there a discrepancy?

Because if in turn 1, Bodya moves to 2, scoring a[2]=2, and in turn 2, he moves to p[2]=1, scoring a[1]=7, total 9.

Alternatively, in turn 1, move to 2 (score 2), turn 2, stay at 2 (score 2), total 4.

So indeed, the best is to stay at 3 for both turns, getting 10.

Hence, my initial assumption was incorrect.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is not always to move to the position with the maximum a value, but to balance between staying at a position with a good a value and moving towards a better one.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for each player, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a value reachable within the remaining turns.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

An alternative idea: since the players can choose to stay or move each turn, their movement is constrained by the permutation p.

Given that, perhaps I can compute for each player the maximum a value in their cycle and assume that they can achieve that value for all remaining turns, but only if they can reach that position within the available turns.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

This sounds like a decision to collect a[x] now or a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Hence, the optimal decision at each turn is to choose the maximum between a[x] and the optimal value for the next turn.

This sounds like a recursive decision that can be modeled using dynamic programming.

Define dp[t][x] as the maximum score achievable from turn t to turn k, starting at position x.

Then, dp[t][x] = max(a[x] + dp[t+1][x], a[p[x]] + dp[t+1][p[x]])

However, with n up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^9, this is not feasible to compute directly.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

An observation: since p is a permutation, the graph formed is a collection of cycles.

Hence, for each cycle, the movement eventually repeats every cycle length turns.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the maximum score within one cycle of the permutation and then handle the remaining turns accordingly.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that for each player, their movement can be represented as a sequence of positions: x, p[x], p[p[x]], etc.

Given that, in each turn, they can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the sequence.

Hence, their position at each turn can be represented as being at some position in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a position in the cycle and staying there for the remaining turns.

But again, I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that in the long run, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle for the remaining turns.

Hence, the optimal strategy would be to choose the position with the maximum a value in the cycle and stay there for as many turns as possible.

To maximize the score, the player should reach the position with the maximum a value as soon as possible and then stay there for the remaining turns.

Hence, for each player, I can find the maximum a value in their cycle, find the minimum number of moves required to reach that position, and then collect the maximum a value for the remaining turns.

In the first example:

For Bodya:

Cycle: 1-4-3-2

a values: a1=7, a4=6, a3=5, a2=2

Maximum a value in the cycle is a1=7.

Number of moves to reach position 1 from position 3: 2 moves (3->2->1).

Hence, score = a[3] (first move staying) + a[1] * (k - 1) = 5 + 7*(1) = 12.

But earlier, we saw that the maximum achievable is 10 by staying at 3 for both turns.

Hence, there is a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Let me recast this.

If Bodya moves to position 2 in the first turn, scoring a[2]=2, and then moves to position 1 in the second turn, scoring a[1]=7, total 9.

Or, stay at 3 in the first turn, scoring a[3]=5, and stay at 3 in the second turn, scoring another 5, total 10.

Hence, staying at 3 gives a higher score than moving to 1 via 2 and 1.

Hence, my earlier assumption that reaching the maximum a position and staying there is not always optimal, at least not in the given number of turns.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the local maximum a value.

In this case, a[3]=5 is greater than a[2]=2, so staying at 3 is better.

In general, for each player, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position x where a[x] is greater than or equal to a[p[x]], and collect a[x] in each turn.

If a[x] < a[p[x]], then it's better to move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]].

But in the first example, a[3]=5 > a[2]=2, so staying at 3 is better.

Similarly, for Sasha starting at 2, a[2]=2 < a[1]=7, so it's better to move to 1 and stay there.

Hence, for Bodya, staying at 3 for both turns gives 10, and for Sasha, moving to 1 in the first turn and staying at 1 in the second turn gives 2 + 7 = 9.

Hence, Bodya wins.

This seems to align with the example.

Hence, a general strategy is:

For each player, find the position x in their cycle where a[x] is maximum, and determine if they can reach it within k turns.

Then, the maximum score is the sum of a[x] for the path to the maximum position plus the maximum a value times the remaining turns.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me define for each player:

- Find the position x in their cycle with the maximum a[x].

- Find the minimum number of moves required to reach x from their starting position.

- If they can reach x within k turns, then their maximum score is a[x] * (k - moves) + sum of a values along the path to x.

- If not, they can't reach x in time, so they have to settle for lower a values.

But in the first example, Bodya can reach a[1]=7 in 2 moves, but staying at a[3]=5 for both turns gives a higher score.

Hence, perhaps it's better to stay at a local maximum rather than trying to reach a global maximum that requires too many moves.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a value in its own cycle, once reached.

Wait, but in the first example, a[1]=7 is the global maximum, but Bodya can't reach it in time to make it beneficial.

Hence, perhaps for each player, the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a value in the subcycle they can reach within k turns.

This seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to realize that in each turn, the player can choose to stay and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Hence, the decision at each turn is to collect a[x] now or a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Given that, the optimal decision is to collect a[x] if a[x] >= a[p[x]], or move to p[x] otherwise.

In other words, if a[x] >= a[p[x]], it's better to stay and collect a[x], otherwise, it's better to move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]] in the next turn.

Hence, for each player, in each turn, they should compare a[x] and a[p[x]], and choose accordingly.

Given that, for each player, their optimal path can be determined by deciding in each turn whether to stay or move based on this comparison.

But with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

An observation: once a player reaches a position where a[x] >= a[p[x]], they should stay there for the remaining turns.

Hence, their score would be a[x] * (k - t), where t is the number of turns required to reach that position.

Hence, for each player, I can find the minimal t such that a[x] >= a[p[x]], and then compute the score accordingly.

But in the first example, Bodya starts at 3 where a[3]=5 > a[2]=2, so he should stay at 3 for both turns, getting 10.

Sasha starts at 2 where a[2]=2 < a[1]=7, so he should move to 1 and stay there, getting 2 + 7 = 9.

Hence, Bodya wins.

This seems to align with the example.

Hence, a general strategy is:

For each player, starting from their initial position, while a[x] < a[p[x]], move to p[x].

Once a[x] >= a[p[x]], stay at x for the remaining turns.

Hence, for each player, find the position x that they reach where a[x] >= a[p[x]], and count the number of moves t required to reach x.

Then, their maximum score is sum of a[x_i] for i=1 to t, plus a[x] * (k - t), where x is the position where a[x] >= a[p[x]].

In the first example:

For Bodya:

Starting at 3: a[3]=5 >= a[2]=2, so stay at 3 for both turns, t=0, score = 5*2 =10.

Wait, but according to the strategy, since a[3] >= a[2], stay at 3.

Hence, t=0, score = 5*2=10.

For Sasha:

Starting at 2: a[2]=2 < a[1]=7, so move to 1, then stay at 1.

Hence, t=1, score = a[2] + a[1] = 2 + 7 =9.

Hence, Bodya wins.

This seems correct.

Hence, the general approach is:

For each player:

- Initialize position x = starting position.

- Initialize t = 0.

- While t < k and a[x] < a[p[x]]:

- x = p[x]

- t +=1

- Once a[x] >= a[p[x]], stay at x for the remaining k - t turns.

- Hence, score = sum of a[x_i] for i=1 to t + a[x] * (k - t)

Hence, for each player, I can simulate this process up to k turns or until a[x] >= a[p[x]].

This should be efficient enough since in the worst case, t can be up to n, which is 2*10^5, and with multiple test cases, it's manageable.

But considering that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to n, I need to optimize this.

Wait, but in practice, for each test case, I can process all players simultaneously.

But in this problem, there are only two players per test case.

Hence, for each test case, I can process Bodya and Sasha separately.

Hence, for each player, I can simulate their movement until they reach a position where a[x] >= a[p[x]], or until k turns are over.

Then, compute their maximum score accordingly.

Hence, in code, for each player, I can have a loop that simulates their movement until the condition is met or k turns are over.

Given that, I can implement this approach.

But I need to make sure that this approach is correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, k=1, positions:

p = [2,3,1]

a = [1,2,3]

Bodya starts at 1, Sasha starts at 2.

For Bodya:

Starting at 1: a[1]=1 < a[2]=2, so move to 2.

But k=1, so only one turn: score = a[2]=2.

Wait, but according to the strategy:

t=0, x=1, a[1]=1 < a[2]=2, so move to 2, t=1.

Since k=1, score = a[2]=2.

Alternatively, if Bodya stays at 1, score = a[1]=1.

Hence, moving to 2 gives a higher score of 2.

Hence, correct.

For Sasha:

Starting at 2: a[2]=2 < a[3]=3, so move to 3, score = a[3]=3.

Hence, Sasha's score =3.

Hence, Sasha wins.

This seems correct.

Another example:

n=2, k=1, p=[2,1], a=[1,1], starting positions 1 and 2.

For both players:

a[x]=1 == a[p[x]]=1, so they can choose to stay or move.

If they stay, score=1.

If they move, score=a[p[x]]=1.

Hence, both scores are 1, it's a draw.

Hence, the strategy holds.

Hence, I can proceed with this approach.

Hence, in code, for each player, I need to:

- Initialize x = starting position.

- Initialize t =0.

- Initialize score =0.

- While t <k and a[x] < a[p[x]]:

- x = p[x]

- t +=1

- score += a[x]

- If t <k:

- score += a[x] * (k - t)

Hence, this should compute the maximum score for each player.

Then, compare the scores to determine the winner.

Hence, in code, I need to implement this logic for each player in each test case.

Given that, I can proceed to code this.

But in the given code, it seems to have some issues.

Let me look at the given code.

Looking at the code:

It seems to have some mistakes.

In the code:

It checks if a[pb-1] == a[ps-1] == maxa, then Draw.

elif a[pb-1] == maxa, then Bodya.

elif a[ps-1] == maxa, then Sasha.

else, it proceeds to simulate the moves.

But in the first example, a[3]=5 and a[2]=2, neither is equal to maxa=7, so it proceeds to the else part.

In the else part, it initializes b and s as lists for Bodya and Sasha respectively.

Then, it has founds and foundb flags initialized to False.

Then, it loops for k turns:

if foundb and founds:

append (k - (i+1)) * maxa to b and s.

break

elif foundb:

append maxa to b

elif a[pb-1] == maxa:

foundb = True

append a[pb-1] to b

else:

append a[pb-1] to b

pb = p[pb-1]

Similarly for Sasha.

Then, it computes prefix sums for b and s.

Then, it computes all possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by choosing to switch to maxa at different points.

Then, it finds the maximum scores for Bodya and Sasha and compares them.

This seems overly complicated and may not correctly implement the strategy I outlined earlier.

Hence, I think the given code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played by two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their scores accumulated over a series of turns. The players can choose to stay in their current position or move to a position defined by a permutation array, aiming to maximize their scores.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Both players make decisions simultaneously and independently.
   - Each player tries to maximize their score by choosing to stay or move each turn.
   - The game lasts for a fixed number of turns (k).

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - For each player, the optimal strategy is to move to a position with a higher value in array `a` if possible, and then stay at the position with the highest possible `a` value.
   - Specifically, a player should keep moving to `p[x]` as long as `a[p[x]] > a[x]`, and then stay at the position where `a[x] >= a[p[x]]`.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - For each player, simulate their movement until they reach a position where `a[x] >= a[p[x]]` or until the turns are exhausted.
   - Calculate the score accumulated during the movement and the score from staying at the final position for the remaining turns.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Function to compute maximum score for a player
        def compute_score(start, k):
            x = start
            current = a[x - 1]
            t = 0
            score = 0
            # Move to higher a[x] until cannot or turns end
            while t < k and a[x - 1] < a[p[x - 1] - 1]:
                x = p[x - 1]
                score += a[x - 1]
                t += 1
            # Stay at the final x for remaining turns
            if t < k:
                score += a[x - 1] * (k - t)
            return score
        
        # Compute scores for both players
        score_bodya = compute_score(pb, k)
        score_sasha = compute_score(ps, k)
        
        # Determine the winner
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Optimal Movement and Staying:**
   - Each player should move to `p[x]` only if `a[p[x]] > a[x]`. Once `a[x] >= a[p[x]]`, they should stay at that position.
   - This ensures that the player accumulates the highest possible score over the given turns.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - Simulate the movement phase where the player moves to higher `a[x]` values.
   - Once the optimal position is reached, calculate the score for staying at that position for the remaining turns.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The simulation for each player takes O(n
