Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1's in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all these numbers in the sequence.

First, I need to understand what the bitwise OR of the sequence does. The bitwise OR of a set of numbers sets a bit in the result to 1 if any of the numbers in the sequence has that bit set to 1. So, to maximize the number of 1's in this OR result, I need to have as many bits set to 1 in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

Given that, my goal is to distribute the sum k among n numbers such that when I OR them together, the result has as many 1's in its binary representation as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to try to set the highest possible bits in different numbers to ensure that those bits are set in the OR result.

Wait, but since OR combines all the set bits from any of the numbers, maybe I should try to spread out the set bits across different numbers to maximize the total number of 1's in the OR result.

But I also need to make sure that the sum of all these numbers is k.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the second test case from the example:

n = 2, k = 3

Possible sequences:

- [1, 2]: sum is 3, and 1 | 2 = 3 (binary 11), which has two 1's.

- [0, 3]: sum is 3, and 0 | 3 = 3 (binary 11), same as above.

- [3, 0]: same as above.

- [1, 2]: same as first.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1's in the OR is 2.

Another example:

n = 1, k = 5

Sequence: [5], OR is 5 (binary 101), which has two 1's.

Another sequence with n=2, k=5:

[5,0]: OR is 5 (binary 101), two 1's.

[4,1]: OR is 5 (binary 101), same.

[3,2]: OR is 3 | 2 = 3 (binary 11), only two 1's.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=2, k=5, the output is [5,0], which has OR 5, which is binary 101, two 1's.

But in the fourth test case, n=6, k=51, the output is [3,1,1,32,2,12], and their OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 35 (binary 100011), which has three 1's. Wait, the note says it has five 1's. Let me check that.

Wait, 3 is 000011, 1 is 000001, 1 is 000001, 32 is 100000, 2 is 000010, 12 is 001100.

OR of all these: 100 | 11 | 1 | 100 | 10 | 1100.

Wait, binary:

3: 000011

1: 000001

1: 000001

32: 100000

2: 000010

12: 001100

OR: 100111, which is 39, with four 1's. But the note says five 1's. Maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 100111 is 1 in the 6th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st positions, so that's four 1's. Maybe the note has a mistake, or I miscounted.

Anyway, moving on.

I need to find a way to distribute k into n numbers such that the OR of these numbers has as many 1's as possible in its binary representation.

One approach could be to assign the largest possible numbers with unique high-order bits.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of binary digits.

Each bit position can be set in the OR if at least one number in the sequence has that bit set.

To maximize the number of 1's in the OR, I need to set as many unique bit positions as possible across the sequence.

Given that, perhaps I should aim to have each number in the sequence responsible for setting a unique set of bit positions.

But I also need to ensure that the sum of these numbers is k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider the maximum possible number of 1's in the OR.

The maximum possible number of 1's would be the number of bit positions in k, since higher bits beyond k's significance won't be set in any number.

Wait, no. Actually, since the numbers can be up to k, the OR can have bits set up to the highest bit in any of the numbers, which is up to the highest bit in k.

But I need to maximize the number of 1's in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I should find the minimal possible value for the OR, but maximizing the number of 1's.

Wait, no, I need to maximize the number of 1's in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I should aim to have as many bits set in the OR as possible.

Given that, I need to have as many bits set in at least one of the numbers.

So, to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, I need to have as many unique bit positions set across the sequence as possible.

Given that, perhaps I should distribute the bits across the numbers in such a way that each bit is set in at least one number.

But I also need to make sure that the sum is k.

This seems a bit involved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have n numbers, and I need their sum to be k.

I need to maximize the number of bits set in their OR.

One way to maximize the OR is to have each number contribute a unique set of bits.

For example, if I have n numbers, and each number has a unique highest set bit, then their OR would have those highest set bits plus any overlapping lower bits.

But I need to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, not necessarily the number of set bits in k.

Wait, actually, the number of 1's in the OR is equal to the number of bit positions that are set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

So, to maximize that, I need to have as many bit positions set to 1 in at least one of the numbers.

Given that, perhaps the best way is to have each number responsible for setting a unique set of bits.

But I need to minimize the overlap of set bits across numbers to maximize the total number of unique set bits in the OR.

Wait, but I also need to make sure that the sum is k.

This seems a bit conflicting.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=2, k=3.

Possible sequences:

- [1,2]: sum is 3, OR is 3 (binary 11), which has two 1's.

- [0,3]: sum is 3, OR is 3 (binary 11), same as above.

- [3,0]: same as above.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1's in the OR is 2.

Another example: n=1, k=5.

Sequence: [5], OR is 5 (binary 101), which has two 1's.

Another sequence: n=2, k=5.

Possible sequences:

- [5,0]: OR is 5 (binary 101), two 1's.

- [4,1]: OR is 5 (binary 101), two 1's.

- [3,2]: OR is 3 | 2 = 3 (binary 11), which has two 1's.

Wait, in this case, it seems that the maximum number of 1's in the OR is two.

But in the fourth test case, with n=6 and k=51, the output is [3,1,1,32,2,12], and their OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 35 (binary 100011), which has three 1's.

Wait, but according to the note, it has five 1's.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me see:

3 in binary: 000011

1: 000001

1: 000001

32: 100000

2: 000010

12: 001100

OR:

- Bit 0: 1 (from 1, 3)

- Bit 1: 1 (from 2, 3)

- Bit 2: 1 (from 12)

- Bit 3: 1 (from 32)

- Bit 4: 1 (from 3, 12)

- Bit 5: 0

So, binary: 100111, which is 35, and it has four 1's.

But the note says five 1's. Maybe a mistake in the note.

Anyway, moving on.

I need to find a way to distribute k into n numbers such that their OR has as many 1's as possible.

One strategy could be to assign the smallest possible numbers to as many numbers in the sequence as possible,预留 higher values for the remaining sum.

Wait, perhaps not.

Another approach is to assign 1 to as many numbers as possible, and then assign the remaining sum to the last number.

But that might not always maximize the number of 1's in the OR.

Wait, let's see.

If I assign 1 to n-1 numbers, and the remaining sum to the last number, then the OR would be the OR of 1 and the last number.

The OR of 1 and any number is just that number with the least significant bit set.

This might not maximize the number of 1's in the OR.

Wait, perhaps not the best approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I start by assigning the smallest possible numbers to the sequence, ensuring that each number contributes at least one new bit to the OR.

Start with 1, then 2, then 4, and so on, until I've assigned n numbers or exhausted the bits in k.

But I need to make sure that the sum is k.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal possible OR that sums to k.

Wait, no, I need to maximize the number of 1's in the OR.

Wait, maybe I should aim to have as many numbers as possible with unique highest set bits.

For example, assign 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., up to n numbers, and then adjust the last number to make the sum k.

But I need to ensure that the sum is k.

Let me try this approach with the example n=2, k=3.

Assign 1 and 2, sum is 3, OR is 3 (binary 11), which has two 1's.

Another example: n=6, k=51.

Assign 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, which sum to 63, which is more than 51.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I need to assign the smallest possible powers of 2 to the first n-1 numbers and assign the remaining sum to the last number.

Wait, but in the example, n=6, k=51.

Assign 1, 1, 2, 32, 2, 12, sum is 1+1+2+32+2+12=50, which is less than 51.

Wait, in the given output, it's [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 3+1+1+32+2+12=51.

Their OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 35 (binary 100011), which has three 1's, but according to the note, it's five 1's. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, 35 is 100011, which has three 1's: positions 0,1,5.

Wait, maybe the note is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the binary.

Let me check:

35 in binary is 100011, which is:

- Bit 0: 1

- Bit 1: 1

- Bit 2: 0

- Bit 3: 0

- Bit 4: 0

- Bit 5: 1

So, three 1's.

Maybe the note has a mistake.

Anyway, moving on.

Perhaps another approach is to find the minimal possible OR that sums to k, and then try to maximize the number of 1's in that OR.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that the OR of the sequence is at least the highest set bit in k, because to sum to k, at least one number must have that bit set.

But I need to maximize the number of 1's in the OR, so I need to set as many bits as possible in the OR.

Given that, perhaps I should aim to have the OR cover as many bit positions as possible.

One way to do this is to have each number in the sequence cover a unique bit position.

But again, ensuring the sum is k is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can start by assigning the smallest possible numbers with unique bit positions set.

For example, assign 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., up to n numbers, and then adjust the last number to make the sum k.

But if n is larger than the number of bits in k, this might not work.

Wait, in that case, I can assign 0 to some numbers, but since they don't contribute to the OR, it might not help.

Wait, 0 doesn't set any bits in the OR, so assigning 0 to some numbers doesn't increase the number of 1's in the OR.

So, only non-zero numbers contribute to the OR.

Therefore, to maximize the OR, I should assign non-zero numbers with unique bit positions set.

Given that, perhaps I should assign the first few numbers as 1, 2, 4, etc., up to the number of non-zero numbers I can have, and then assign the remaining sum to the last number.

But I need to ensure that the sum is k.

Let me try this with n=6, k=51.

Assign 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and then the remaining is 51 - (1+2+4+8+16) = 51 - 31 = 20.

So, assign 1,2,4,8,16,20.

Their OR is 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 20 = 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 16 | 4 = 20 | 16 | 4 | 2 | 1 = 20 in binary is 10100, 16 is 10000, 4 is 0100, 2 is 0010, 1 is 0001.

OR: 10111, which is 23, with four 1's.

But in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51, and OR is 100111, which is 35, with three 1's.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, assigning [1,2,4,8,16,20] gives OR 23, which has four 1's, which is better than three.

So perhaps their solution is not optimal.

But according to the note, it has five 1's, which seems incorrect.

Anyway, moving on.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to assign the first n-1 numbers as small as possible with unique bit positions set, and assign the remaining sum to the last number.

This way, the OR will have the bits set from the first n-1 numbers plus any bits set in the last number.

But I need to make sure that the first n-1 numbers have unique bit positions set.

Wait, but some bits might overlap if the last number has bits already set in the first n-1 numbers.

Perhaps it's better to assign the first n-1 numbers as powers of 2, starting from 1,2,4,8,..., and then assign the remaining sum to the last number.

This way, the OR will have at least the bits from 1 to 2^{n-1} - 1, plus any additional bits from the last number.

This might be a good approach.

Let me try it with n=6, k=51.

Assign 1,2,4,8,16, and then the remaining is 51 - 31 = 20.

So, sequence: [1,2,4,8,16,20].

Their OR is 1 | 2 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 20 = 10111 in binary, which is 23, with four 1's.

But in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sums to 51, and OR is 100111, which is 35, with three 1's.

So, my approach gives a better OR with four 1's.

Maybe their solution is not optimal.

But according to the note, it has five 1's, which seems incorrect.

Anyway, perhaps my approach is better.

Let me try another example.

Take n=2, k=5.

Assign 1 and 2, sum is 3, remaining is 2, so assign [1,4].

Sum is 1+4=5, OR is 1 | 4 = 5 (binary 101), which has two 1's.

Another option: [3,2], sum is 5, OR is 3 | 2 = 3 (binary 11), which has two 1's.

Same as above.

Another option: [5,0], sum is 5, OR is 5 | 0 = 5 (binary 101), two 1's.

So, in this case, all options give two 1's in the OR.

Seems consistent.

Another example: n=4, k=10.

Assign 1,2,4,3.

Sum is 1+2+4+3=10, OR is 1 | 2 | 4 | 3 = 7 (binary 111), which has three 1's.

Another option: [1,2,8, -1], wait, but numbers must be non-negative.

So, [1,2,8,-1] is invalid.

Wait, sum is 1+2+4+3=10.

Another option: [1,2,0,7], sum is 10, OR is 1 | 2 | 0 | 7 = 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Same as above.

Another option: [1,3,0,6], sum is 10, OR is 1 | 3 | 0 | 6 = 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Same again.

Seems like the maximum number of 1's in the OR is three.

Another way: [1,2,4,3], OR is 7, three 1's.

[1,2,0,7], OR is 7, three 1's.

[1,3,0,6], OR is 7, three 1's.

Seems consistent.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1's in the OR is three.

Now, let's see what my approach would do.

Assign 1,2,4, then remaining is 10 - 7 = 3.

So, sequence: [1,2,4,3], sum is 10, OR is 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Same as above.

Seems optimal.

Another example: n=3, k=7.

Assign 1,2,4, sum is 7, OR is 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Another option: [1,3,3], sum is 7, OR is 3 | 3 = 3 (binary 11), two 1's.

So, my approach gives a better OR.

Another option: [0,7,0], sum is 7, OR is 7 | 0 | 0 = 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Same as above.

So, seems optimal.

Another example: n=5, k=10.

Assign 1,2,4,8, then remaining is 10 - 15 = -5, which is invalid.

Wait, can't do that.

So, need to adjust.

In this case, since sum of 1+2+4+8=15 >10, I can't assign all powers of 2.

So, need to assign smaller numbers.

Perhaps assign 1,2,0,0,5.

Sum is 1+2+0+0+5=8, which is less than 10.

Wait, need to adjust.

Alternatively, assign 1,2,0,0,7], sum is 10, OR is 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 7 = 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Another option: [1,2,4,0,3], sum is 10, OR is 1 | 2 | 4 | 0 | 3 = 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Seems consistent.

Another option: [1,3,0,0,6], sum is 10, OR is 1 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 6 = 7 (binary 111), three 1's.

Same again.

So, in this case, the maximum number of 1's in the OR is three.

Hence, my approach seems to be working.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic.

The program defines a function func_1(n, k):

- It initializes a list nums of n zeros.

- Sets nums[0] to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

- Then subtracts this value from k.

- Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, assigns nums[i] to be the minimum of (nums[0] + 1, k), subtracts that from k.

- Finally, adds the remaining k to nums[0].

Wait, this seems different from what I was thinking.

Let me see what this does with n=2, k=3.

k.bit_length() -1 is 1 (since 3 in binary is 11, bit_length is 2).

So, 1 << 1 -1 = 1 << 0 = 1, then 1 -1 =0.

So, nums[0] =0.

k -=0, so k=3.

Then, for i=1:

nums[1] = min(0 +1, 3) =1, k -=1, k=2.

Then, add remaining k=2 to nums[0], so nums[0]=2.

So, sequence is [2,1], sum is 3, OR is 2 |1 =3 (binary 11), two 1's.

Which matches the example.

Another test: n=1, k=5.

nums=[0], nums[0]=(1<<0)-1=0, k-=0, k=5.

Then, no loop for i=1 to n-1 since n=1.

Then, add remaining k=5 to nums[0], so nums=[5], OR=5 (binary 101), two 1's.

Matches the example.

Another test: n=2, k=5.

nums=[0,0]

k.bit_length()-1=2-1=1.

1<<1-1=1<<0=1, then 1-1=0.

nums[0]=0, k=5-0=5.

Then, i=1:

nums[1]=min(0+1,5)=1, k-=1, k=4.

Then, add remaining k=4 to nums[0], so nums=[4,1], sum=5, OR=4|1=5 (binary 101), two 1's.

Matches the example.

Another test: n=6, k=51.

k.bit_length()-1=5-1=4.

1<<4=16, 16-1=15.

So, nums[0]=15, k=51-15=36.

Then, for i=1 to 5:

nums[1]=min(15+1=16,36)=16, k-=16, k=20.

nums[2]=min(16,20)=16, k-=16, k=4.

nums[3]=min(16,4)=4, k-=4, k=0.

nums[4]=min(16,0)=0, k-=0, k=0.

nums[5]=min(16,0)=0, k-=0, k=0.

Then, add remaining k=0 to nums[0], so nums=[15,16,16,4,0,0], sum=15+16+16+4=51, OR=15|16|16|4|0|0=16|15|4|0|0=16|15=16|15=16|15=31 (binary 11111), which has five 1's.

Wait, but in the example, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], OR=35 (binary 100011), which has three 1's, but according to this, [15,16,16,4,0,0] gives OR=31 (binary 11111), which has five 1's, which is better.

So, the program seems to be giving a better solution than the example.

Hence, it seems correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
