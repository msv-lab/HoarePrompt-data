Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n people in a programming contest chat, ordered by activity, but each person sees themselves at the top of the list. So, for example, if the actual order is [2, 3, 1, 4], then:

- User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4]

- User 2 sees [2, 3, 1, 4]

- User 3 sees [3, 2, 1, 4]

- User 4 sees [4, 2, 3, 1]

Got it. So, k people posted screenshots of the order they saw, and I need to determine if there's a single order that all these screenshots correspond to.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input starts with t, the number of test cases. For each test case, there are n (number of participants) and k (number of screenshots). Then, for each screenshot, there's a line starting with the user who took the screenshot, followed by the order they saw.

The problem says that all authors of the screenshots are different, which is helpful because it means no two screenshots are from the same user.

My task is to output "YES" if there exists an order that matches all the screenshots, and "NO" otherwise.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to find a consistent order of participants that explains all the screenshots. Each screenshot shows the order as seen by a particular user, with themselves at the top, followed by the rest in some order.

So, for a given screenshot from user a, the list should have a at position 0, followed by the other users in some order.

But, since each user sees themselves at the top, the actual order must be such that, when a user puts themselves at the top, the rest of the list follows a specific permutation.

I need to find if there's a single permutation of participants that, when each user puts themselves at the top, matches the order in their screenshot.

Let me consider a simple example.

Take n=3, k=2.

Suppose the actual order is [2, 1, 3].

Then:

- User 1 would see [1, 2, 3]

- User 2 would see [2, 1, 3]

- User 3 would see [3, 2, 1]

So, if I have screenshots from user 1: [1, 2, 3] and user 2: [2, 1, 3], they are consistent with the actual order [2, 1, 3].

But if user 1 shows [1, 2, 3] and user 2 shows [2, 3, 1], that would be inconsistent because user 2's screenshot implies that 3 comes before 1, but in user 1's screenshot, 2 comes before 1 and before 3.

Wait, in user 1's screenshot, it's [1, 2, 3], meaning 1 is top, then 2, then 3.

In user 2's screenshot, [2, 3, 1], meaning 2 is top, then 3, then 1.

So, is there an actual order that satisfies both?

Let's see.

If the actual order is [2, 1, 3], then:

- User 1 would see [1, 2, 3]

- User 2 would see [2, 1, 3]

But in this case, user 2's screenshot is [2, 3, 1], which doesn't match [2, 1, 3]. So, this is inconsistent.

What if the actual order is [2, 3, 1]?

Then:

- User 1 would see [1, 2, 3]

- User 2 would see [2, 3, 1]

Which matches the screenshots. So, it's consistent.

Wait, but user 1 sees [1, 2, 3], which implies that in the actual order, 1 comes after 2.

In [2, 3, 1], that's correct.

So, in this case, "YES".

Another example from the problem:

n=4, k=4

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,4]

2: [2,3,1,4]

3: [3,2,1,4]

4: [4,2,3,1]

Is there an actual order that satisfies all?

Let's try [2,3,1,4]

- User 1 would see [1,2,3,4]

- User 2: [2,3,1,4]

- User 3: [3,2,1,4]

- User 4: [4,2,3,1]

Yes, this order satisfies all screenshots.

So, output is "YES".

Another example:

n=6, k=2

Screenshots:

1: [1,3,5,2,4,6]

2: [2,3,5,1,4,6]

Is there an actual order where:

- User 1 sees [1,3,5,2,4,6]

- User 2 sees [2,3,5,1,4,6]

What would the actual order be?

If actual order is [3,5,1,2,4,6]

- User 1 would see [1,3,5,2,4,6]

- User 2 would see [2,3,5,1,4,6]

Yes, this matches. So, "YES".

Wait, but the sample output for this case is "YES", but in the problem statement, it's "NO". Wait, checking the sample input and output.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=6, k=2, the output is "YES", but later in n=5, k=2, output is "YES", n=3, k=3, "YES", n=10, k=2, "YES", n=1, k=1, "YES", n=5, k=2, "NO", n=3, k=3, "YES", n=5, k=4, "YES", n=3, k=3, "NO".

Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.

Wait, looking back, in the sample input, for n=6, k=2, output is "YES", but in n=5, k=2, output is "NO".

Wait, need to be careful.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

10

5 1

1 2 3 4 5

4 4

1 2 3 4

2 3 1 4

3 2 1 4

Sample Output:

YES

YES

YES

NO

So, for n=5, k=2, input is:

5 2

1 2 3 5 4

2 1 3 5 4

Output is "NO"

Wait, why is that "NO"? Let's see.

If the actual order is [2,1,3,5,4], then:

- User 1 would see [1,2,3,5,4]

- User 2 would see [2,1,3,5,4]

Which matches the screenshots. So, should be "YES". But the sample output is "NO". Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that the actual order must be consistent across all screenshots.

Wait, perhaps in this case, there is no consistent order.

Wait, if actual order is [2,1,3,5,4], then user 1 sees [1,2,3,5,4], and user 2 sees [2,1,3,5,4]. That matches the first two screenshots.

But maybe there are more constraints or something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the actual order should be such that, for any two users, their relative positions in the actual order are consistent across their screenshots.

I need a better approach.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the order in which they appear in the screenshots.

For example, if in one screenshot, a comes before b, then in the actual order, a should come before b, unless one of them is the author and places themselves at the top.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that if I have multiple permutations where each permutation corresponds to a different root (in this case, the user who took the screenshot), I need to find a universal ordering that can explain all these permutations.

This sounds similar to finding a consistent ordering in a directed graph where edges represent "comes before" relationships.

So, perhaps I can model this as a graph where there's an edge from a to b if in some screenshot, a comes before b, considering that each screenshot has the user placing themselves at the top.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of partial orders.

Each screenshot gives a partial order, and I need to see if these partial orders can be combined into a total order.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for inconsistencies in the relative positions of participants across different screenshots.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose there is an actual order: p1, p2, p3, ..., pn.

Each user pi sees their own view: pi, followed by the rest in some order.

But the rest should be in the same relative order as in the actual order, except pi is moved to the front.

Wait, no. From the example, it seems that the actual order is p1, p2, p3, ..., pn.

Then, user pj's view is pj, followed by p1, p2, ..., pn, with pj removed.

Wait, in the first example:

Actual order: p1, p2, p3, p4

User p1 sees p1, p2, p3, p4

User p2 sees p2, p1, p3, p4

User p3 sees p3, p2, p1, p4

User p4 sees p4, p2, p3, p1

Wait, in this case, the actual order seems to be p2, p3, p1, p4.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first example, actual order is [2,3,1,4]

User 1 sees [1,2,3,4]

User 2 sees [2,3,1,4]

User 3 sees [3,2,1,4]

User 4 sees [4,2,3,1]

So, the actual order is [2,3,1,4]

Then, user 1 moves themselves to the top, so [1,2,3,4]

User 2 keeps themselves at top, rest follow: [2,3,1,4]

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

So, in general, for any actual order, when a user moves themselves to the top, the rest of the list should be the actual order without the user.

So, to find the actual order, I need to see how the screenshots relate to each other.

I need a way to reconstruct the actual order from the screenshots.

Let me consider that I have k screenshots, each from a different user.

I need to find an order such that, for each screenshot, if I remove the user who took the screenshot from their position and place them at the top, the rest of the list matches the actual order.

Wait, more formally:

Let the actual order be L = [p1, p2, ..., pn]

Then, for each user pi, their screenshot should be [pi, p1, p2, ..., pn] with pi removed.

Wait, no. In the example, actual order is [2,3,1,4]

User 1's screenshot is [1,2,3,4]

User 2's screenshot is [2,3,1,4]

So, for user 1, they move themselves to the top, and the rest remain in the actual order.

Similarly, user 2 keeps their position at top, and the rest follow the actual order.

So, in general, for user pi, their screenshot should be [pi, followed by L without pi].

So, if I have k screenshots, I can try to reconstruct L by aligning the parts that are common across the screenshots.

Let me consider that.

If I have two screenshots:

- From user a: [a, followed by L without a]

- From user b: [b, followed by L without b]

Then, the part after a in the first screenshot should match the part after b in the second screenshot, excluding a and b respectively.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the intersection of the lists after removing the top element.

Let me try with two screenshots.

Suppose n=4, k=2

Screenshot 1: a, followed by L without a

Screenshot 2: b, followed by L without b

Then, L without a should match L without b, except that b is now at the front.

Wait, maybe I need to see the relative order of the elements excluding a and b.

Wait, this seems tricky.

Let me try with the earlier example where n=4, k=4, and output is "YES".

Actual order: [2,3,1,4]

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,4]

2: [2,3,1,4]

3: [3,2,1,4]

4: [4,2,3,1]

So, for user 1: [1,2,3,4]

User 2: [2,3,1,4]

User 3: [3,2,1,4]

User 4: [4,2,3,1]

All these correspond to the actual order [2,3,1,4]

Now, suppose n=5, k=2

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,5,4]

2: [2,1,3,5,4]

Output is "NO"

Wait, in this case, if the actual order is [2,1,3,5,4], then:

User 1 would see [1,2,3,5,4]

User 2 would see [2,1,3,5,4]

Which matches the screenshots, so why is the output "NO"?

Wait, maybe there's a conflict with the positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more than one possible actual order.

Wait, maybe there's a unique actual order that satisfies all screenshots.

Wait, perhaps in this case, there is no consistent actual order because the screenshots impose conflicting constraints.

Wait, maybe I need to look for cycles or inconsistencies in the ordering.

Let me consider modeling this as a graph where nodes are participants, and directed edges represent "comes before" relationships based on the screenshots.

For example, if in a screenshot, a comes before b, then in the graph, there's an edge from a to b.

But, since each user puts themselves at the top, I need to adjust for that.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each screenshot, the order of participants after the top user should be consistent across all screenshots.

Let me try that.

Suppose I have two screenshots:

- User a: [a, b, c, d]

- User b: [b, a, c, d]

Then, the part after a in the first screenshot is [b, c, d], and the part after b in the second screenshot is [a, c, d].

These two lists should be the same except that a and b are in different positions.

So, in general, for two screenshots, the tails (after the top user) should differ only by the position of the top user of the other screenshot.

Wait, perhaps I can try to align the tails of the screenshots.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose I have two screenshots:

- User a: [a, followed by L without a]

- User b: [b, followed by L without b]

Then, L without a should be equal to L without b, except that b is at the front.

So, if I take L without a and insert b at the front, I should get L without b.

Wait, no.

Wait, L without a is L \ {a}

L without b is L \ {b}

But in user a's screenshot, after a, it's L \ {a}

In user b's screenshot, after b, it's L \ {b}

So, L \ {a} should be equal to L \ {b} with b inserted at the front.

Wait, L \ {a} = [p1, p2, ..., pn-1], where p1, p2, ... are the participants excluding a.

Similarly, L \ {b} = [p1', p2', ..., pn-1'], excluding b.

But in user a's screenshot, after a, it's L \ {a}

In user b's screenshot, after b, it's L \ {b}

So, if I compare L \ {a} and L \ {b}, they should be the same sequence, but with b and a in different positions.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a and b differ in their tails.

Let me try with the sample input where n=5, k=2, output is "NO"

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,5,4]

2: [2,1,3,5,4]

So, L \ {1} = [2,3,5,4]

L \ {2} = [1,3,5,4]

Comparing [2,3,5,4] and [1,3,5,4], they differ at the first position.

So, in L, 2 comes before 1, because in L \ {1}, 2 is first.

Similarly, in L \ {2}, 1 is first, which would imply that 1 comes after 2 in L.

This is a contradiction.

Hence, "NO"

So, in general, for two screenshots, I need to check if the relative order of the participants, excluding the top user in each screenshot, is consistent.

In other words, the tails of the screenshots should be the same, except for the position of the top user of the other screenshot.

Wait, perhaps I can align the tails by shifting the position where the top users are inserted.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have two screenshots:

- User a: [a, b, c, d]

- User b: [b, a, c, d]

Then, the tails are:

- After a: [b, c, d]

- After b: [a, c, d]

So, [b, c, d] and [a, c, d] differ at the first position.

So, in the actual order, b comes before a.

Wait, in the actual order, if b comes before a, then when a moves to the top, b should come next, which matches [a, b, c, d]

Similarly, when b moves to the top, a should come next, which matches [b, a, c, d]

So, this is consistent.

But in the "NO" case:

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,5,4]

2: [2,1,3,5,4]

Tails:

L \ {1} = [2,3,5,4]

L \ {2} = [1,3,5,4]

So, [2,3,5,4] and [1,3,5,4] differ at the first position.

So, in the actual order, 2 comes before 1.

But in L \ {2}, 1 is first, which would imply that 1 comes after 2 in the actual order.

This is a contradiction.

Hence, "NO"

So, to generalize, for two screenshots, I need to find the position where the top users differ in the tails, and ensure that the relative order is consistent.

If there are multiple screenshots, I need to ensure that all of them are consistent with each other.

So, perhaps I can proceed as follows:

- Take the first two screenshots and find the relative order of their top users.

- Then, for each additional screenshot, check if it's consistent with the established order.

But this might not be sufficient for all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try to reconstruct the actual order by merging the tails of the screenshots.

Let me consider using a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the order in which they appear in the screenshots.

For example, if in one screenshot, a comes before b, then there's an edge from a to b.

But, since each user puts themselves at the top, I need to adjust for that.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each pair of users, their relative order should be consistent across all screenshots where both appear in the tail.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that this problem can be modeled as checking if the given permutations are consistent with a common underlying order.

In other words, it's similar to checking if the permutations can be derived from a single total order by moving the top user to the front.

So, perhaps I can find the intersections of the tails and see if they are consistent.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of partial orders and see if they can be extended to a total order.

But I need a more concrete algorithm.

Let me consider the following steps:

1. Choose one screenshot as the reference.

2. For each other screenshot, find the position where the top user of that screenshot would appear in the reference screenshot.

3. Adjust the reference screenshot accordingly to incorporate the new information.

4. Check for consistency at each step.

But I need to formalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can construct a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent "comes before" relationships based on the screenshots.

Then, if the graph has no cycles, it's consistent, and I can output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But I need to define how to create these edges.

Let me think about it.

For two screenshots:

- If in one screenshot, a comes before b, and in another, b comes before a, it's inconsistent, unless one of them is the top user in their respective screenshots.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for any two users, if neither is the top in both screenshots, their relative order should be the same in both tails.

Wait, perhaps I can ignore the top user in each screenshot and compare the tails.

Wait, no, because the top user affects the position of others.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have k screenshots, each showing a permutation where the top user is at the front.

I can try to find a permutation L such that for each screenshot, moving the top user to the front matches the screenshot.

Wait, perhaps I can fix one screenshot as the reference and try to map the others to it.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I take the first screenshot as the reference.

Let's say user a1's screenshot is [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]

Then, the actual order L should be [a2, a3, ..., an]

Wait, no.

Wait, in user a1's screenshot, a1 is at the front, followed by L without a1.

So, L without a1 should be [a2, a3, ..., an]

Similarly, in user a2's screenshot, a2 is at the front, followed by L without a2.

So, L without a2 should be [a1, a3, a4, ..., an]

So, in both tails, the relative order of a1 and a2 should be consistent.

Wait, perhaps I can try to align the tails by shifting the top users.

Let me consider merging the tails.

For example, take the first screenshot's tail: [a2, a3, a4, ..., an]

And the second screenshot's tail: [a1, a3, a4, ..., an]

I need to see how a1 and a2 relate in these tails.

In the first tail, a2 comes before a1 (since a1 is not in the first tail, assuming a1 is not in L without a1, which is not the case).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of indices.

Suppose I have two screenshots:

- User a1: [a1, b, c, d]

- User a2: [a2, a1, c, d]

Then, in the actual order L, L without a1 is [b, c, d]

And L without a2 is [a1, c, d]

So, L must be [a2, a1, c, d]

Because L without a1 is [a2, c, d]

And L without a2 is [a1, c, d]

Which matches the tails.

Wait, but in this case, L is [a2, a1, c, d]

Then, user a1's view would be [a1, a2, c, d]

But in the screenshot, it's [a1, b, c, d], where b is a2.

So, it matches.

Similarly, user a2's view is [a2, a1, c, d], which matches [a2, a1, c, d]

So, it's consistent.

Now, if I have a third screenshot, say user a3: [a3, a2, a1, d, c]

Wait, assuming n=5.

Wait, let's say n=5, k=3

Screenshots:

- User a1: [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]

- User a2: [a2, a1, a3, a4, a5]

- User a3: [a3, a2, a1, a4, a5]

Then, the actual order L should be [a2, a3, a1, a4, a5]

Because:

- L without a1: [a2, a3, a4, a5]

- L without a2: [a1, a3, a4, a5]

- L without a3: [a2, a1, a4, a5]

Which matches the tails in the screenshots.

So, in general, I can try to find such an L that satisfies all the tails.

But how to do this efficiently?

Let me consider that for each pair of screenshots, their tails should be consistent except for the top user.

So, for k screenshots, I can pairwise compare their tails and see if they can be aligned.

But this seems too time-consuming for n and k up to 2e5.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the actual order L is a permutation of 1 to n.

Each screenshot from user pi shows [pi, followed by L without pi]

So, for k screenshots, I can collect the tails (L without pi) and see if they can be reconciled into a single L.

Wait, perhaps I can collect all the tails and see if they are all the same except for the missing pi.

Then, L would be [pi, followed by the common tail]

But in reality, the tails differ by pi.

So, perhaps I can take the intersection of the tails and see if they match.

Wait, maybe I can use the first screenshot's tail as the base and adjust for other screenshots.

But I need a better plan.

Let me consider that for k screenshots, I have k different versions of L without pi.

So, I have k lists, each missing pi and with pi at the front.

I need to find an L such that for each pi, L without pi matches the tail in the screenshot.

So, L should be such that for each pi, L with pi at the front and the rest matching L without pi.

Wait, perhaps I can reconstruct L by merging the tails.

Let me try with two screenshots.

Suppose n=4, k=2

Screenshot 1: [1,2,3,4]

Screenshot 2: [2,1,3,4]

So, L without 1 is [2,3,4]

L without 2 is [1,3,4]

So, L should be [2,1,3,4]

Because L without 1 is [2,3,4]

And L without 2 is [1,3,4]

Which matches the tails.

Now, if I have a third screenshot, say user 3: [3,2,1,4]

Then, L without 3 should be [2,1,4]

But in the actual L [2,1,3,4], L without 3 is [2,1,4], which matches.

Similarly, user 4: [4,2,1,3]

L without 4 is [2,1,3], which matches.

So, it's consistent.

Now, for the "NO" case:

n=5, k=2

Screenshot 1: [1,2,3,5,4]

Screenshot 2: [2,1,3,5,4]

So, L without 1 is [2,3,5,4]

L without 2 is [1,3,5,4]

If I try to find an L that satisfies both:

L = [2,1,3,5,4]

Then L without 1 is [2,3,5,4]

L without 2 is [1,3,5,4]

Which matches the tails.

So, why is the output "NO"?

Wait, perhaps there's another constraint.

Wait, looking back at the sample input and output.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=5, k=2, the output is "NO"

But according to this, it should be "YES"

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=5, k=2, the screenshots are:

1 2 3 5 4

2 1 3 5 4

But according to this, L=[2,1,3,5,4] satisfies both.

So, perhaps the "NO" is for another case.

Wait, checking the sample input again.

Wait, in the sample input, the "NO" is for the second n=5, k=2 case.

Wait, no, in the sample input, there are multiple n=5, k=2 cases.

Wait, let's look carefully.

Sample Input:

Wait, but in the first n=5, k=2, the screenshots are:

And that's it, k=1, so output is "YES"

Then, n=4, k=4, output "YES"

n=6, k=2, output "YES"

n=3, k=3, output "YES"

n=10, k=2, output "YES"

n=1, k=1, output "YES"

n=5, k=2, output "NO"

n=3, k=3, output "YES"

n=5, k=4, output "YES"

n=3, k=3, output "NO"

Wait, so the "NO" cases are n=5, k=2 and n=3, k=3

Let's look at n=5, k=2, output "NO"

Input:

5 2

1 2 3 5 4

2 1 3 5 4

As I considered earlier, L=[2,1,3,5,4] satisfies both, so perhaps there's another constraint I'm missing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in some cases, the screenshots are from users who are not in the tails of each other's screenshots.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more than two screenshots.

Wait, in this case, k=2, so only two screenshots.

But according to my earlier logic, it should be "YES", but the sample output is "NO"

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the screenshots are taken within a short period of time, and the order hasn't changed, but I need to ensure that the order is consistent across all screenshots.

Wait, perhaps there's a unique actual order that satisfies all screenshots.

But in this case, L=[2,1,3,5,4] satisfies both screenshots.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the actual order is unique and consistent across all possible permutations.

Wait, perhaps there's a conflict with other users' positions.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the relative order of non-top users should be the same across all screenshots.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if all the tails are permutations of each other.

Wait, no, in the "YES" case, the tails are different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix one screenshot as the reference and try to map the others to it.

Let's say I take the first screenshot as the reference.

Let's say user a1's screenshot is [a1, b, c, d]

Then, in the actual order L, L without a1 is [b, c, d]

Similarly, for user b's screenshot [b, a1, c, d], L without b is [a1, c, d]

So, L should be [b, a1, c, d]

Which matches both screenshots.

Now, if I have a third screenshot from user c: [c, b, a1, d]

Then, L without c should be [b, a1, d]

Which matches.

So, L=[c, b, a1, d]

Wait, but earlier L was [b, a1, c, d]

Wait, there's a conflict.

Wait, in the first case, L was [b, a1, c, d], but in the second case, L=[c, b, a1, d]

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to merge the information.

Wait, perhaps I need to find an L that satisfies all the screenshots.

In this case, L cannot be both [b, a1, c, d] and [c, b, a1, d]

So, there's a conflict, hence "NO"

Wait, perhaps that's why in the sample input, for n=5, k=2, output is "NO"

Because there's a conflict in the positions.

Wait, but in the earlier example, L=[2,1,3,5,4] satisfies both screenshots.

Wait, maybe I need to check for more conflicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to check that for any two screenshots, their tails are consistent except for the top user.

Wait, perhaps I need to check that the tails differ only in the position of the top user of the other screenshot.

Wait, in the "NO" case:

Screenshot 1: [1,2,3,5,4]

Screenshot 2: [2,1,3,5,4]

So, tail of screenshot 1: [2,3,5,4]

Tail of screenshot 2: [1,3,5,4]

They differ at the first position: 2 vs 1

So, in L, 2 comes before 1.

But in the second tail, 1 comes before 2, which is inconsistent.

Hence, "NO"

So, in general, for two screenshots, their tails should differ only in the position of the top user of the other screenshot.

Wait, in other words, the tails should be the same except that the top user of the other screenshot is moved to a different position.

So, to generalize, for k screenshots, I need to ensure that all tails are consistent in this manner.

But how to implement this efficiently?

Let me consider that for k screenshots, I can take the first screenshot as the reference and align the other tails accordingly.

So, for example, take the first screenshot's tail and see how the other tails relate to it.

But I need a better plan.

Let me consider constructing a graph where nodes are participants, and edges represent the relative order between participants based on the screenshots.

For example, if in one screenshot, a comes before b, then there's an edge from a to b.

But I need to adjust for the fact that each user puts themselves at the top.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for any two participants, if they both appear in the tails of multiple screenshots, their relative order should be consistent.

Wait, perhaps I can extract the relative order between participants from the tails and build a graph.

Then, if there are no cycles in the graph, it's consistent, and I can output "YES"; otherwise, "NO"

But I need to define how to build the graph.

Let me try with the "YES" case.

n=4, k=4

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,4]

2: [2,3,1,4]

3: [3,2,1,4]

4: [4,2,3,1]

Tails:

- L without 1: [2,3,4]

- L without 2: [1,3,4]

- L without 3: [2,1,4]

- L without 4: [2,3,1]

So, the actual order L is [2,3,1,4]

Which matches all the tails.

Now, in this case, the relative order between participants is consistent.

Now, in the "NO" case:

n=5, k=2

Screenshots:

1: [1,2,3,5,4]

2: [2,1,3,5,4]

Tails:

- L without 1: [2,3,5,4]

- L without 2: [1,3,5,4]

So, in L, 2 comes before 1, but in L without 2, 1 comes before 3,5,4.

But in L without 1, 2 comes before 3,5,4.

So, L should be [2,1,3,5,4]

Which satisfies both tails.

But the sample output is "NO"

Wait, perhaps there's another constraint.

Wait, maybe there's a third screenshot in this test case that I'm not considering.

Wait, no, in this particular test case, k=2, so only two screenshots.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in some cases, the order of participants other than the top user is not consistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to check that the order of participants excluding the top user is the same across all screenshots.

But in this case, excluding the top user, both tails are [2,3,5,4] and [1,3,5,4], which differ only in the position of 1 and 2, which are the top users in the other screenshots.

So, perhaps it's acceptable.

Wait, maybe the "NO" is due to a different reason.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in some screenshots, the order of some participants is inverted.

Wait, perhaps I need to check that for any three participants, their relative order is consistent across all screenshots.

But that seems too involved.

Let me consider that for k screenshots, I can try to find a permutation L that matches all the tails.

So, I can collect all the tails and see if there's a way to arrange them consistently.

But I need a better algorithm.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that this problem can be modeled as finding a topological order that satisfies all the partial orders given by the screenshots.

Each screenshot provides a partial order where the top user is before all others in their screenshot.

But since each user puts themselves at the top, I need to adjust for that.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for any two users, if one appears before the other in multiple screenshots, I can establish a "comes before" relationship.

But I need to formalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the intersection of the tails to find the common order.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of differences between permutations.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for k screenshots, I can try to align them by shifting the top users.

So, for example, for two screenshots:

- [a, b, c, d]

- [b, a, c, d]

I can shift the first screenshot by one position to align with the second:

- [b, c, d, a]

Now, compare [b, c, d, a] with [b, a, c, d]

They differ in the position of a and c.

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Let me consider that for k screenshots, I can try to find a permutation L such that for each screenshot, moving the top user to the front matches
