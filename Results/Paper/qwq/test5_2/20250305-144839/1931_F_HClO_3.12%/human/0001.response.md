Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are n people in a programming contest chat, ordered by their activity, but each person sees themselves at the top of the list. So, for example, if the actual order is [2, 3, 1, 4], then:

- User 1 sees [1, 2, 3, 4]

- User 2 sees [2, 3, 1, 4]

- User 3 sees [3, 2, 1, 4]

- User 4 sees [4, 2, 3, 1]

Got it. So, k people posted screenshots of the order they saw, and I need to determine if there's a single order of participants that could correspond to all these screenshots.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. There are multiple test cases, each starting with n and k, followed by k lines, each containing n integers representing the order seen by a participant.

The key point is that each participant sees themselves at the top, followed by the rest of the list in their actual order.

So, for a given screenshot, the first element is the participant who took the screenshot, and the rest of the list should match the actual order, but with the screenshot taker moved to the front.

My task is to check if there exists an actual order such that all the provided screenshots are consistent with it.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to try to reconstruct the actual order based on the screenshots and then verify if all screenshots are consistent with that order.

But with multiple screenshots, I need to find a way to reconcile them.

Let me consider the first test case in the example:

Input:

10

5 1

1 2 3 4 5

4 4

1 2 3 4

2 3 1 4

3 2 1 4

4 2 3 1

6 2

1 3 5 2 4 6

6 3 5 2 1 4

3 3

1 2 3

2 3 1

3 2 1

10 2

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

1 1

1

5 2

1 2 3 5 4

2 1 3 5 4

3 3

3 1 2

2 3 1

1 3 2

5 4

3 5 1 4 2

2 5 1 4 3

1 5 4 3 2

5 1 4 3 2

3 3

1 3 2

2 1 3

3 2 1

Output:

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

YES

YES

YES

YES

NO

Looking at the first test case: n=5, k=1, with screenshot [1,2,3,4,5]. Since there's only one screenshot, it's trivially consistent. So, output is YES.

Second test case: n=4, k=4, with four screenshots corresponding to each user. Seems like they are consistent with the order [2,3,1,4]. So, output is YES.

Third test case: n=6, k=2, with two screenshots. Need to check if there's an order that matches both.

Fourth test case: n=3, k=3, with three screenshots. Seems consistent.

Fifth test case: n=10, k=2, with two screenshots that are reverses of each other. Probably inconsistent, hence NO.

Sixth test case: n=1, k=1, with screenshot [1]. Trivially YES.

Seventh test case: n=5, k=2, with two screenshots. Need to check consistency.

Eighth test case: n=3, k=3, with three screenshots. Need to check.

Ninth test case: n=5, k=4, with four screenshots. Need to check.

Tenth test case: n=3, k=3, with three screenshots. Output is NO.

From these examples, I need to find a general approach.

Let me think about how to model this.

Each screenshot provides a permutation where the first element is the participant who took the screenshot, and the rest are in the actual order, but without the taker.

So, for each screenshot, if I remove the first element (the taker), the remaining list should be a subsequence of the actual order, maintaining the relative order.

Wait, actually, it's stronger than that. The remaining elements should be in the actual order, in the same sequence.

So, for each screenshot, the order of elements after the taker should match the actual order.

But, since each taker sees themselves at the top, followed by the actual order, with themselves removed.

So, for example, if the actual order is [2,3,1,4], then:

- User 1 sees [1,2,3,4]

- User 2 sees [2,3,1,4]

- User 3 sees [3,2,1,4]

- User 4 sees [4,2,3,1]

Now, if I have multiple screenshots, I need to find an actual order that is consistent with all of them.

One way to approach this is to model the relationships between users based on their positions in the screenshots.

I need to find if there's a total order that satisfies all the constraints imposed by the screenshots.

This sounds like a topological sorting problem, where each screenshot imposes certain ordering constraints.

Let me think about it in terms of constraints.

For each screenshot, the taker is at the top, followed by the rest in the actual order.

So, for each screenshot, the taker is before all the other users in their screenshot, but the relative order of the other users should match the actual order.

Wait, but in the example, user 1 sees [1,2,3,4], which implies that in the actual order, 2 comes before 3 before 1 before 4, but that's not correct.

Wait, no. In the actual order [2,3,1,4], user 1 sees [1,2,3,4], which is user 1 at the top, followed by the actual order without user 1.

Wait, no. Wait, in the actual order [2,3,1,4], user 1 sees [1,2,3,4], which means user 1 moves themselves to the top, and the rest remain in the actual order.

Similarly, user 2 sees [2,3,1,4], which is user 2 at the top, and the rest in the actual order.

Wait, but in the actual order [2,3,1,4], user 3 sees [3,2,1,4], which is user 3 at the top, followed by the actual order without user 3.

Similarly, user 4 sees [4,2,3,1], which is user 4 at the top, followed by the actual order without user 4.

So, given multiple screenshots, I need to find an actual order such that for each screenshot, the taker is at the top, followed by the actual order without the taker.

So, to find if there's a consistent actual order that matches all the provided screenshots.

One way to approach this is to consider the positions of the users in the screenshots and see if they can be aligned to a single order.

Let me consider that each screenshot provides a partial order: the taker is before all others in their screenshot, and the relative order of the others should match the actual order.

So, for two screenshots, I can compare their sequences and see if they are consistent.

Let me consider the second test case:

n=4, k=4

Screenshot 1: [1,2,3,4] (taker=1, actual order without 1: [2,3,4])

Screenshot 2: [2,3,1,4] (taker=2, actual order without 2: [3,1,4])

Screenshot 3: [3,2,1,4] (taker=3, actual order without 3: [2,1,4])

Screenshot 4: [4,2,3,1] (taker=4, actual order without 4: [2,3,1])

I need to find an actual order [2,3,1,4] that matches all these.

From screenshot 1: taker=1, actual order without 1: [2,3,4]

From screenshot 2: taker=2, actual order without 2: [3,1,4]

From screenshot 3: taker=3, actual order without 3: [2,1,4]

From screenshot 4: taker=4, actual order without 4: [2,3,1]

Now, if I look at the actual order [2,3,1,4], it matches all these.

So, in this case, it's consistent.

Now, consider n=6, k=2:

Screenshot 1: [1,3,5,2,4,6] (taker=1, actual order without 1: [3,5,2,4,6])

Screenshot 2: [6,3,5,2,1,4] (taker=6, actual order without 6: [3,5,2,1,4])

I need to find an actual order that matches both.

Looking at the actual orders:

From screenshot 1: [3,5,2,4,6]

From screenshot 2: [3,5,2,1,4]

Wait, in the first, after [3,5,2], it's 4,6

In the second, after [3,5,2], it's 1,4

So, the positions of 1 and 6 differ.

This seems inconsistent.

But in reality, in the actual order, 1 should be before 6 if 1 appears before 6 in the actual order.

Wait, but in screenshot 1, without 1, it's [3,5,2,4,6]

In screenshot 2, without 6, it's [3,5,2,1,4]

So, in the actual order, it should be [3,5,2,1,4,6] or something like that.

Wait, but in screenshot 1, without 1, it's [3,5,2,4,6], which implies that in the actual order, it's [3,5,2,4,6]

In screenshot 2, without 6, it's [3,5,2,1,4], which implies that in the actual order, it's [3,5,2,1,4,6]

Wait, but [3,5,2,1,4,6] matches both:

- Without 1: [3,5,2,4,6]

- Without 6: [3,5,2,1,4]

So, it's consistent.

Wait, but in the example, the output is YES for this case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's YES.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the problem statement, for n=6, k=2, with screenshots [1,3,5,2,4,6] and [6,3,5,2,1,4], the output is YES.

So, it is consistent with [3,5,2,1,4,6].

Okay, so I need a way to find such an actual order that satisfies all the screenshots.

Let me think about a general approach.

I can consider that the actual order is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

Each screenshot provides a partial view of this permutation, with the taker moved to the front.

So, to check consistency, I need to ensure that the relative order of the non-taker elements in each screenshot matches the actual order.

One way to do this is to construct a graph where nodes are the participants, and edges represent the order constraints imposed by the screenshots.

For example, if in one screenshot, a comes before b, and in another, b comes before c, etc., I can model these as directed edges in a graph.

Then, I can check if the graph has a valid topological order that matches the actual order.

But constructing such a graph for large n and k might be inefficient, given the constraints.

Wait, but n and k can be up to 2e5, and n*k up to 2e5, so I need an efficient solution.

Let me think differently.

If I have multiple screenshots, I can compare them pairwise to find inconsistencies.

But with large k, this might not be efficient.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that the actual order is a permutation P = [p1, p2, ..., pn].

Each screenshot corresponds to a participant a, who sees [a, p1, p2, ..., pn] with a moved to the front, and a removed from the rest.

So, for each screenshot, I can get the actual order without a.

Then, I need to find P such that for each screenshot, the actual order without a matches the provided screenshot without a.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the intersection of all these orders.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the actual order is the order seen by a particular participant, and see if it matches with others.

But I need a more systematic approach.

Let me consider that the first screenshot gives me a candidate actual order, and then I verify if all other screenshots are consistent with that order.

But if k is large, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can reconstruct the actual order step by step.

Let me consider that I take the first screenshot and assume that the rest of the list (excluding the taker) is the actual order.

Then, I check if all other screenshots are consistent with that actual order.

But if there are multiple screenshots, I need to handle conflicts.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the screenshots and try to merge them.

Let me consider merging two screenshots.

Suppose I have two screenshots:

- S1: [a, b, c, d, e]

- S2: [b, c, a, d, e]

So, in S1, a is the taker, and the actual order without a is [b,c,d,e]

In S2, b is the taker, and the actual order without b is [c,a,d,e]

So, the actual order should be [b,c,a,d,e], which matches both S1 and S2.

So, in this case, I can merge S1 and S2 to get the actual order.

Now, if I have a third screenshot, S3: [c, b, a, d, e], which corresponds to taker c and actual order without c: [b,a,d,e]

This matches the previous actual order [b,c,a,d,e], since without c, it's [b,a,d,e].

So, it's consistent.

If I have a fourth screenshot, S4: [d, b, c, a, e], which corresponds to taker d and actual order without d: [b,c,a,e]

This also matches [b,c,a,d,e].

So, all are consistent.

But if I have a fifth screenshot that doesn't match, then it's inconsistent.

So, perhaps I can take the first screenshot and assume its actual order, then check if all other screenshots are consistent with that order.

But wait, in the second screenshot, the actual order without the taker should match the overall actual order without the taker.

So, perhaps I can reconstruct the actual order by merging the information from multiple screenshots.

Let me think about how to do this efficiently.

I need an algorithm that can handle up to 2e5 elements efficiently.

One idea is to use a list and insert elements according to the positions specified in the screenshots.

But inserting elements in a list can be expensive if done naively.

Wait, perhaps I can use a heap or some priority queue to manage the order.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each screenshot, I know the position of the taker and the relative order of the rest.

So, perhaps I can find the position of each user across multiple screenshots and find a consistent ordering.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the provided program and see how it approaches the problem.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if m == 1:

input()

print('yes')

continue

(a1, *l1) = map(int, input().split())

(a2, *l2) = map(int, input().split())

l11 = [i for i in l1 if i != a2]

l22 = [i for i in l2 if i != a1]

if l11 != l22:

for _ in range(m - 2):

input()

print('no')

continue

idx1 = idx2 = -1

p1 = p2 = 0

for i in range(n - 1):

if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:

break

if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:

if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:

idx1 = idx2 = i

break

else:

if l1[i + p1] == a2:

idx1 = i

p1 = 1

else:

idx2 = i

p2 = 1

if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:

break

val = []

if idx1 < idx2:

l2.insert(idx1, a2)

l = l2

elif idx1 > idx2:

l1.insert(idx2, a1)

l = l1

else:

if m == 2:

print('yes')

continue

(a3, *l3) = map(int, input().split())

if l3.index(a1) < l3.index(a2):

l1.insert(idx2, a1)

l = l1

else:

l2.insert(idx1, a2)

l = l2

val.append((a3, l3))

m -= 1

for _ in range(m - 2):

(a3, *l3) = map(int, input().split())

val.append((a3, l3))

for (a3, l3) in val:

if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:

print('no')

break

else:

print('yes')

This code seems to handle the merging of the first two screenshots to find a consistent actual order, and then verifies the remaining screenshots against this order.

Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

For each test case:

- Read n and m (n: number of participants, m: number of screenshots)

- If m == 1, it directly prints 'yes' since there's only one screenshot.

- Otherwise, it reads the first two screenshots.

- For the first two screenshots, it removes the taker from the other's list and compares the remaining lists.

- If the remaining lists don't match after removal, it prints 'no'.

- If they match, it tries to find the positions where the takers appear in each other's lists.

- Depending on the positions, it inserts the takers back into the list to reconstruct the actual order.

- Then, it reads the remaining m-2 screenshots and checks if they are consistent with the reconstructed actual order.

This seems like a reasonable approach, but it's a bit convoluted.

Let me see if I can simplify it.

An alternative approach:

1. Choose one screenshot as the reference and assume its actual order.

2. For each other screenshot, verify if the provided order matches the reference actual order with the taker moved to the front.

But this might not be efficient for large m and n.

Wait, but in the code above, it seems to merge the first two screenshots to find a consistent actual order, and then checks the remaining screenshots against that order.

This makes sense.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

Step 1: Read t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

Step 2: Read n and m.

Step 3: If m == 1, print 'yes' immediately.

Step 4: Otherwise, read the first two screenshots.

Step 5: For the first two screenshots, remove the taker from the other's list and check if the remaining lists are equal.

- If not, print 'no'.

Step 6: If the remaining lists are equal, find the positions where the takers would be inserted to reconstruct the actual order.

Step 7: Insert the takers back into the list at their correct positions to get the actual order.

Step 8: Read the remaining m-2 screenshots and verify if they are consistent with the reconstructed actual order.

- If any screenshot is inconsistent, print 'no'.

- If all are consistent, print 'yes'.

This seems logical.

Let me try to apply this to the second test case:

n=4, m=4

Screenshots:

[1,2,3,4]

[2,3,1,4]

[3,2,1,4]

[4,2,3,1]

Take the first two:

[1,2,3,4] and [2,3,1,4]

Remove a2=2 from the first: [1,3,4]

Remove a1=1 from the second: [2,3,4]

These remaining lists are [3,4] and [3,4], which match.

So, l11 = [3,4]

l22 = [3,4]

They are equal.

Now, find idx1 and idx2 where the takers differ.

In l1: [2,3,4]

In l2: [3,1,4]

So, l1[0]=2, l2[0]=3 -> differ

So, idx1=0, p1=1 (since l1[0]=2 == a2=2)

idx2=0, p2=1 (since l2[0]=3 == a1=1)

So, idx1 = idx2 = 0

Since idx1 == idx2, and m > 2, read the third screenshot.

Third screenshot: [3,2,1,4]

l3 = [2,1,4]

Check l3.index(a1=1) = 1

l3.index(a2=2) = 0

Since l3.index(a1) > l3.index(a2), insert a1=1 at idx2=0 in l1

So, l1 becomes [1,2,3,4]

Then, set l = l1

Now, val = [(3,[2,1,4))]

Then, read the fourth screenshot: [4,2,3,1]

Add to val: (4,[2,3,1])

Now, for each (a3,l3) in val:

Check if l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

For a3=3, l3=[2,1,4]

l = [1,2,3,4]

[i for i in l if i != 3] = [1,2,4]

Which matches l3=[2,1,4] -> No, not the same order.

Wait, [1,2,4] != [2,1,4]

So, it should print 'no'

But in the example, it's 'yes'

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the code, it's checking l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3], it breaks and prints 'no'

Else, continues.

In this case, for a3=3, l3=[2,1,4]

[i for i in l if i != 3] = [1,2,4]

Which is not equal to [2,1,4]

So, it should print 'no'

But in the example, it's 'yes'

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the comparison should be regardless of the order, but actually, the order matters.

Wait, no, the order should match exactly.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps in the code, l is the reconstructed actual order, and for each a3, l3 should be equal to l without a3.

But in this case, l = [1,2,3,4]

l without a3=3 should be [1,2,4], but l3=[2,1,4], which is not equal to [1,2,4]

So, it should print 'no'

But in the example, it's 'yes'

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the comparison should be that l3 is equal to l without a3, but considering that l3 is the order seen by a3, which is a3 at the top, followed by the actual order without a3.

Wait, no, in the code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is the actual order without a3.

But in reality, l3 is the order seen by a3, which is a3 at the top, followed by the actual order without a3.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, no, in the code, it's assuming that l is the actual order, and l3 should be equal to l without a3.

But in reality, l3 is a3's view, which is a3 at the top, followed by the actual order without a3.

So, l3 should be [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3]

But in the code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but in the example, it's giving the correct output.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the code, after inserting the takers back, l is supposed to be the actual order.

Then, for each a3, it should check if l3 == [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3]

But in the code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is flawed.

Wait, but in the example, it's giving the correct output.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

Wait, maybe the code is actually correct because in the specific cases it's handling, the error doesn't show up.

But in general, it seems flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that l is the actual order, and for each a3, l3 should be equal to [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, to check consistency, for each a3, l3 should be equal to [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3]

Therefore, l3[1:] should be equal to [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, perhaps in the code, it should be checking l3[1:] == [i for i in l if i != a3]

But in the code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is equivalent to checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

But l3 is [i for i in l if i != a3], without a3 at the top.

Wait, no, l3 is [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, l3 without a3 should be equal to [i for i in l if i != a3]

But that's what l3[1:] would be.

So, perhaps it should be checking l3[1:] == [i for i in l if i != a3]

But in the code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

But in the example, it's giving the correct output.

Wait, perhaps in the specific cases, it's working, but in general, it's flawed.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that l is the actual order, and for each a3, l3 should be equal to [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, to check if l3 is consistent with l, I need to check if l3[1:] == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Therefore, the correct check should be l3[1:] == [i for i in l if i != a3]

But in the code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is equivalent to l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

But l3 is [a3] + [i for i in l if i != a3], so l3[0] should be a3, and l3[1:] should be [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, the correct check should be l3[1:] == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is flawed.

But in the example, it's giving the correct output.

Wait, maybe in the specific cases, it's working, but in general, it's incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to fix the code.

Let me try to fix it.

Instead of checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3], it should check l3[1:] == [i for i in l if i != a3]

So, modify the code accordingly.

But in the existing code, it's checking l3 == [i for i in l if i != a3]

Which is incorrect, but in the example, it's giving the correct output.

Wait, perhaps in the example, this incorrect check doesn't affect the correctness because of the specific inputs.

But in general, it's a mistake.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem states that the code should output the correct answer for all valid inputs.

Therefore, if there exists at least one input where this check fails, then the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
