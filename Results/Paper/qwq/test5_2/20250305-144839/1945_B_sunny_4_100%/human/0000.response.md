Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the timings work. Let's think about the launch times. The first installation launches at times a, 2a, 3a, and so on. Similarly, the second installation launches at times b, 2b, 3b, etc. Each firework is visible from the launch time up to m minutes after the launch time, inclusive.

So, for any given time t, the fireworks that could be visible are those whose launch times l satisfy t - m <= l <= t. Because they stay visible from l to l + m.

I need to find a time t where the number of launch times from both installations that fall into [t - m, t] is maximized.

This seems like a problem involving overlapping intervals. Each firework's visibility can be seen as an interval [l, l + m], and I need to find a time t where the number of intervals that include t is maximized.

One way to approach this is to consider all possible launch times and see how their visibility intervals overlap.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through all possible times.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I fix a time t. Then, the number of fireworks visible at t is the number of launch times from the first installation that are in [t - m, t], plus the number from the second installation in the same interval.

So, for the first installation, the number of launches in [t - m, t] is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a). Similarly for the second installation.

Therefore, for any t, the number of visible fireworks is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

But since t can be up to infinity in theory, I need to find a smart way to determine the maximum possible value of this expression.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the number of visible fireworks can change. These points are at the launch times and at t - m shifts of the launch times.

Specifically, the number of visible fireworks can change at times that are multiples of a or b, or m units before those multiples.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the maximum possible number of fireworks visible at any time t.

First, consider that fireworks from the first installation are launched every a minutes, and each is visible for m + 1 minutes.

Similarly for the second installation, launching every b minutes, each visible for m + 1 minutes.

I need to find a time t where the overlap of these visibility intervals is maximized.

One important observation is that if a and b are co-prime, meaning they have no common divisors except 1, then the launch times of the two installations never coincide.

But in general, if a and b have a common divisor, their launch times can coincide at multiples of the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Let me consider small examples to get an intuition.

Take the first example from the problem:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, fireworks from the first installation are launched at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc., and each is visible for 5 minutes (from t to t + 4).

Similarly, the second installation launches at 7, 14, 21, 28, etc., each visible for 5 minutes.

Let's see at t = 7:

- Fireworks launched at 6 are visible from 6 to 10

- Firework launched at 7 is visible from 7 to 11

- No other fireworks are launched before 12 and 14, which are after t = 7.

So, at t = 7, we have two fireworks visible: the one launched at 6 and the one at 7.

The problem states that the maximum is 2 in this case.

Another example:

t = 3, b = 4, m = 10

Launch times:

First installation: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ...

Second installation: 4, 8, 12, 16, ...

Visibility:

First installation: [3-10, 3] = [-7, 13], [6-10,6] = [-4,16], etc.

Second installation: [4-10,4] = [-6,14], [8-10,8] = [-2,18], etc.

Wait, negative times don't make sense. Probably, we should consider t >= 0, and m minutes after launch.

So, for launch time l, visibility is from l to l + m.

In this case, for t >= 0, the visible fireworks are those with l <= t <= l + m, where l is a launch time.

In the second example, t=3, b=4, m=10.

Possible visible fireworks at t=12:

First installation: launches at 3,6,9,12,...

Fireworks launched at 3: visible from 3 to 13

At 6: 6 to 16

At 9: 9 to 19

At 12: 12 to 22

Second installation: 4,8,12,16,...

Fireworks launched at 4: 4 to 14

At 8: 8 to 18

At 12: 12 to 22

So, at t=12, we have fireworks launched at 3,6,9,12 from the first installation, and at 4,8,12 from the second installation.

But wait, is t - m = 12 - 10 = 2.

So, any launch time l where l >= 2 and l <= 12.

From first installation: l = 3,6,9,12

From second installation: l=4,8,12

Total visible at t=12: 7 fireworks.

The output for this case is 7, which matches.

Another example:

a=7, b=8, m=56

Launch times:

First: 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,...

Second:8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,...

Visibility:

First: [7-56,7], [14-56,14], ..., which is [0,63], [0,70], etc.

Wait, 14 - 56 = -42, but probably we should consider t >=0.

At t=56:

First installation: launches at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,...

Fireworks visible from:

7 to 63

14 to 70

21 to 77

28 to 84

35 to 91

42 to 98

49 to 105

56 to 112

Second installation: 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,...

Fireworks visible from:

8 to 64

16 to 72

24 to 80

32 to 88

40 to 96

48 to 104

56 to 112

64 to 120

At t=56:

From first installation: fireworks launched at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56 are visible.

From second installation: 8,16,24,32,40,48,56 are visible.

Total: 8 + 7 = 15, but the output is 17. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that m is 56, so t - m = 56 - 56 = 0.

So, any launch time l where l >= 0 and l <= 56.

First installation: l = 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56

Second installation: l=8,16,24,32,40,48,56

Total: 8 + 7 = 15, but the output is 17. Maybe there's an overlap or something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps there are more launch times within [0,56].

Wait, 7*8=56, and 8*7=56, so at t=56, both have a launch, but I still only count 15 fireworks.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Looking back, the note says:

"In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112 minutes:

* 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112];

* 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112]."

Wait, t=112, m=56, so t - m = 56.

So, fireworks launched from t=56 to t=112.

First installation: launches at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112

But only those launched from 56 to 112 are visible at t=112.

Similarly, second installation: 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112

Only those launched from 56 to 112 are visible at t=112.

So, first installation: launches at 56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112 -> 9 fireworks

Second installation: 56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112 -> 8 fireworks

Total: 9 + 8 = 17, which matches the output.

So, in general, for a given t, the number of visible fireworks is the number of launch times from each installation that fall within [t - m, t].

So, for installation 1: number of l in [t - m, t], where l is a multiple of a.

Similarly for installation 2.

So, for installation 1: floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2: floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

The total is the sum of these two.

To maximize this sum, I need to choose t such that this sum is maximized.

But since t can be up to infinity, I need to find a way to maximize this expression efficiently.

Let me consider that floor(t / a) is the number of multiples of a up to t, which is t // a.

Similarly, floor((t - m - 1)/a) is (t - m - 1) // a

Therefore, the number of launch times from installation 1 visible at t is (t // a) - ((t - m - 1) // a)

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks at t is:

(t // a - (t - m - 1) // a) + (t // b - (t - m - 1) // b)

I need to maximize this expression over t.

But since t can be large, I need a smarter way to find the maximum value without iterating through all possible t.

Let me consider that as t increases, t // a increases every time t reaches a multiple of a, and similarly for b.

But this seems complicated to handle directly.

Another approach could be to find the time t where the number of launches from both installations in the interval [t - m, t] is maximized.

This sounds like a sliding window problem, where the window size is m + 1 minutes.

I need to find a time t where the number of launch times from both installations in [t - m, t] is maximized.

To do this efficiently, I can think of merging the launch times from both installations and then sliding a window of size m + 1 to find the maximum number of launches within any window.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating through all possible launch times.

An alternative approach is to consider the launch rates of the two installations.

Installation 1 launches every a minutes, and each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes.

So, the number of fireworks visible from installation 1 at any time t is ceil(m / a) + 1, but I need to be careful with this.

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Suppose I fix t, then the number of visible fireworks from installation 1 is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

But I need to maximize the sum of these two.

Let me consider that for large t, t // a is approximately t / a, and similarly for b.

But I need an exact integer value.

Maybe I can consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, and see how the launches align within one LCM period.

But with a and b up to 10^18, computing LCM might not be feasible in terms of time.

Another idea: since both installations launch at regular intervals, the pattern of visible fireworks repeats every LCM(a, b) minutes.

Therefore, within one LCM period, I can find the maximum number of visible fireworks.

But again, with a and b up to 10^18, LCM can be up to 10^36, which is not practical to iterate through.

I need a smarter mathematical approach.

Let me consider that the number of launches from installation 1 in any interval of length m + 1 is floor(m / a) + 1, because launches are every a minutes.

Similarly, for installation 2, it's floor(m / b) + 1.

If the launch times from the two installations don't overlap, then the maximum number of visible fireworks would be floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But if the launch times do overlap, meaning that there are times when both installations launch at the same time, then the overlapping launches should not be double-counted.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that "if one firework was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one minute."

So, even if launches coincide, their visibility intervals overlap by m minutes.

But in terms of counting the number of visible fireworks at a specific time t, if two fireworks are launched at the same time, they are both visible at t, provided t is within their visibility intervals.

But according to the problem, each firework is visible from l to l + m, inclusive.

So, if two fireworks are launched at the same time l, then at time t = l + k where 0 <= k <= m, both fireworks are visible.

Therefore, they are both counted in the total visible fireworks at time t.

So, even if launches coincide, their fireworks are both visible during their visibility periods.

Therefore, the maximum number of visible fireworks is simply floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1, without subtracting any overlaps, because overlapping launches still contribute two visible fireworks during their visibility periods.

Wait, but in the first example, a=6, b=7, m=4, and the output is 2.

According to this formula, floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, which matches the first output.

In the second example, a=3, b=4, m=10, floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7, which matches the second output.

In the third example, a=7, b=8, m=56, floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, so 8 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 17, which matches the third output.

Similarly, for a=1, b=1, m=1, floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, which matches the fourth output.

And for a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1 + 1000000000000000000 + 1 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sixth output.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 gives the correct maximum number of visible fireworks.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

It reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads a, b, m, and computes floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2, and prints the result.

This matches the formula I derived.

Hence, the program is correct.
