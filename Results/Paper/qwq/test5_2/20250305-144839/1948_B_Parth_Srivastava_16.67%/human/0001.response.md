Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that is at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element (45), it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether, after performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero), I can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. So, I need to check if there's a sequence of operations that results in an array where each element is less than or equal to the next one.

First, I need to understand the operation thoroughly. When I choose an element that is at least 10, I can replace it with its digits in the same order. So, for example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, 45 becomes 4 and 5, and 10 becomes 1 and 0. This operation can be applied any number of times, including zero times.

Now, I need to think about how this operation affects the array and how I can use it to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

One important observation is that this operation only allows me to split numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits. Numbers less than 10 are already digits and cannot be split further. So, in the final array, all elements will be single digits, but only if I choose to split all numbers that are >=10.

However, I don't have to split all of them. I can choose which ones to split and which ones to leave as is. This means that in the final array, I might have a mix of single digits and two-digit numbers (those that were not split).

Wait a minute, but actually, if I choose to split a number >=10, it's replaced by its digits, which are single digits. So, in the final array, after any number of operations, all elements will be single digits, because I can always choose to split any number >=10 into its digits.

But, I can also choose not to split some numbers, meaning that in the final array, some elements could remain as two-digit numbers if I choose not to split them. However, since the operation allows me to split any number >=10 any number of times, I can choose to split them as much as I want, but I have to consider the impact on the overall ordering.

Wait, but if I split a number, I'm replacing it with its digits, which are smaller, so it might help in making the array sorted. But sometimes, not splitting might be better, depending on the context.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's think differently. Maybe I can model this problem in a way that allows me to check if there's a possible sequence of operations leading to a sorted array.

One approach could be to consider all possible ways of splitting the numbers and check if any of those resulting arrays are sorted. However, this seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 50, and each element can be up to 99, meaning that splitting all elements would lead to a large number of possible arrays.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this. Let's consider that each element in the array can be either kept as is (if it's less than 10 or if we choose not to split it), or split into its digits if it's >=10.

So, for each element, I have a choice: if it's >=10, I can choose to split it into its digits or keep it as is. If it's less than 10, I have no choice but to keep it as is.

Therefore, for each element that is >=10, I have two options: keep it as is or split it into digits. For elements <10, there's only one option: keep them as is.

My goal is to choose, for each applicable element, whether to split it or not, in such a way that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

This sounds like a decision problem where I need to make choices for each element and see if any of those choices lead to a sorted array.

Given that n can be up to 50, and for each element that is >=10, I have two choices, the number of possible combinations could be up to 2^n, which for n=50 is too large to handle practically. So, I need a more efficient way to determine if a sorted array is achievable.

Let me think about the properties of the array after operations.

Suppose I have the array [12, 3, 45, 67]. If I split 12 into 1 and 2, and split 45 into 4 and 5, and keep 3 and 67 as is, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. This is sorted in non-decreasing order. So, in this case, the answer is YES.

In another example, [12, 28, 5]. If I split 12 into 1 and 2, and split 28 into 2 and 8, and keep 5 as is, the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted. If I don't split 12 and split 28, I get [12, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted. If I split 12 and don't split 28, I get [1, 2, 28, 5], which is not sorted. If I don't split anything, I have [12, 28, 5], which is not sorted. If I split both, I get [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], still not sorted. So, in this case, the answer is NO.

In the third example, [0, 0]. It's already sorted, so no need for any operations, and the answer is YES.

From these examples, it seems that I need to consider all possible ways of splitting the numbers and check if any of them result in a sorted array.

But, as I thought earlier, with n up to 50, checking all possible combinations is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the array as a sequence and see how the operations can affect the ordering.

Suppose I have two adjacent elements in the array. If I can ensure that after operations, the left element is less than or equal to the right element, then the array is sorted.

So, for each pair of adjacent elements, I need to ensure that after operations, the right element is not less than the left element.

Now, for each element, I have choices about whether to split it or not, and I need to make sure that whatever choice I make for one element is compatible with the choices for adjacent elements.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the state of the array as I process each element, considering the choices for splitting or not splitting.

But maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 allows me to insert its digits in place, which are smaller than the original number. So, splitting can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are placed in a way that maintains or improves the ordering.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum value allowed at each position to have a sorted array.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I iterate through the array from left to right, and for each position, I keep track of the maximum value that can be placed there, given the choices made for previous elements.

Wait, but this seems a bit vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the array after all possible operations have been performed, meaning that some elements have been split into their digits, and others have been kept as is.

In the final array, each original element is either kept as is (if it was <10 or if I chose not to split it), or it's replaced by its digits.

Now, to have the array sorted in non-decreasing order, for each position, the element there should be greater than or equal to the previous element.

So, I need to choose, for each element that can be split, whether to split it or not, such that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a graph where each node represents the choice of splitting or not splitting an element, and I need to find a path that results in a sorted array.

But this seems too complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of the possible values that each position can take, given the choices.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem, where each element has possible values (either itself if not split, or its digits if split), and I need to choose one possibility for each element such that the entire array is sorted.

This seems promising.

In constraint satisfaction, I can have variables for each position, with domains equal to the possible values that position can take (either the number itself or its digits, depending on whether it's split or not).

Then, I can have constraints between consecutive variables ensuring that the left variable is less than or equal to the right variable.

Then, the problem reduces to checking if there's an assignment of values to variables that satisfies all these constraints.

But again, with n up to 50, this might not be efficient enough.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 always results in digits that are smaller than or equal to the original number.

For example, splitting 12 gives 1 and 2, both of which are less than 12.

Similarly, splitting 45 gives 4 and 5, both less than 45.

Splitting 10 gives 1 and 0, both less than or equal to 10.

So, splitting can only decrease the value of the element at that position.

Moreover, splitting allows me to insert multiple elements in place of one, but each of these new elements is a digit, i.e., <=9.

Wait, but 0 is also allowed, as a is >=0.

So, by splitting, I can replace a number >=10 with its digits, which are <=9.

If I don't split, I keep the number as is, which could be >=10.

So, in the final array, I can have a mix of single digits and two-digit numbers.

But my goal is to have the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now, to maximize flexibility, I might want to split numbers that are >=10 to their digits, as digits are smaller and can be arranged more easily to form a sorted array.

But, in some cases, keeping a number as is might be necessary to achieve the sorting.

For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], and I split 12 into 1 and 2, and split 45 into 4 and 5, I get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. This is sorted.

Alternatively, if I don't split 67, I might still have a sorted array.

But in practice, splitting helps in making the array sorted.

In the second example, [12, 28, 5], splitting 12 into 1 and 2, and splitting 28 into 2 and 8, gives [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is not sorted.

Even if I don't split some of them, I still can't get a sorted array.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

So, the key is to find a way to choose which numbers to split and which to keep, such that the resulting array is sorted.

Now, to make this efficient, perhaps I can think in terms of the cumulative maximum.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I process the array from left to right.

At each position, I have to decide whether to split the element or not, based on the previous choices.

Wait, but this still seems like a dynamic programming problem.

Let me try to define the state.

Let's say that after processing the first i elements, the last element in the current array is some value.

Then, for the (i+1)-th element, I have to decide whether to split it or not, and ensure that if I split it, all the new elements are >= the previous last element.

This seems manageable.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array, keeping track of the minimum value that the next element should be to maintain the sorted order.

Wait, that sounds promising.

Let me formalize this.

I'll iterate through the array, maintaining a current minimum value that the next element should be.

At each step, for the current element, if it's >=10, I have two choices: split it or keep it.

If I keep it, it must be >= the current minimum.

If I split it, each of its digits must be >= the current minimum.

Moreover, after choosing to split or not, I update the current minimum for the next element.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the last element in the current partial array.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array, and for each element, consider all possible choices (split or not), and keep track of the maximum value in the current partial array.

Then, for the next element, I ensure that the first element resulting from its splitting is >= the previous maximum.

But this might not be sufficient, because splitting can insert multiple elements, and I need to ensure that the sequence remains sorted.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the array after all operations as a flattened list of digits or original numbers, and check if there's a way to arrange them in order.

But arranging them in order is equivalent to sorting them, which is what we're trying to achieve.

Wait, but the problem is to check if, after any number of operations, the array is sorted.

So, perhaps I can consider the array as a stream of digits, where each number >=10 is a sequence of digits, and I can choose to either keep it as is or split it into digits.

Then, the question is whether there's a way to choose which numbers to split such that the resulting sequence is sorted.

This seems similar to choosing how to split numbers to form a sorted sequence.

Now, to make this efficient, perhaps I can think in terms of the cumulative maximum.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array, and for each element, decide whether to split it based on the previous element.

Wait, maybe I can keep track of the maximum value so far, and ensure that the next element, whether split or not, is >= that maximum.

But I need to consider that splitting introduces multiple elements, each of which needs to be >= the previous one.

This is getting a bit tangled.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I consider the array as a whole and try to build the sorted array by choosing for each original element whether to split it or not.

I can try to build the array step by step, ensuring that at each step, the sequence remains sorted.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I consider that splitting a number >=10 into its digits is like replacing it with a sequence of digits that are smaller than or equal to the original number.

So, splitting can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are placed in a way that maintains or improves the ordering.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and allow splitting only when it helps in maintaining the sorted order.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the array and keep track of the minimum value that the next element should be, based on the previous element.

Then, for each element, I can check if splitting it would allow me to achieve that minimum value.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize a current minimum (prev) to -1.

Iterate through each element in the array:

- If the element is <10:

- If prev <= a[i], set prev = a[i]

- Else, check if splitting a[i] would help.

Wait, but a[i] is <10, so it can't be split.

So, if a[i] < prev, then it's impossible to sort.

- If the element is >=10:

- Option 1: Keep it as is.

- If a[i] >= prev, set prev = a[i]

- Option 2: Split it into digits.

- For each digit, ensure that it's >= prev, and update prev accordingly.

- Choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted.

This seems like a dynamic programming approach, where I have to choose the best action at each step based on the previous choice.

But implementing this directly might be too slow for n=50.

I need a way to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum value in the split form.

For example, if I split a number, the maximum value among its digits is the highest value that needs to be considered for the sorted order.

Wait, but I need to consider the sequence of digits, not just the maximum.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about the constraints.

Each a[i] is between 0 and 99, inclusive.

n is between 2 and 50.

t is up to 10^3, so I need an efficient solution for each test case.

Perhaps I can precompute the possible splits for each element and then check if there's a path that leads to a sorted array.

But again, with n=50, this might be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a choice for an element (split or not), and edges represent compatibility between choices.

Then, finding a path through this graph would correspond to a valid sequence of operations leading to a sorted array.

But implementing this seems too involved for the time constraints.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits can only help in making the array sorted, as digits are smaller and can be arranged more flexibly.

So, in the best case, I can split all numbers >=10 into their digits, and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

But in some cases, splitting all numbers might not lead to a sorted array, as in the second example.

So, I need to decide which numbers to split and which to keep.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the minimal possible value for each position by choosing whether to split or not.

Then, I can check if there's a way to choose splits such that the minimal possible values are non-decreasing.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that takes the current position and the previous value, and returns whether it's possible to reach the end with a sorted array.

At each step, for each element, if it's >=10, try both options: keep it or split it.

If it's <10, only keep it.

Check if the chosen value is >= the previous one, and recurse.

But with n=50, this might still be too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Perhaps I can use memoization to cache the results of subproblems.

Define a state as (current position, previous value).

Then, with n=50 and a[i] up to 99, the state space is manageable.

But with t=10^3, this might still be too slow in practice.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits allows me to insert multiple elements in place of one, but each of these elements is a digit, i.e., <=9.

So, in the final array, after all operations, all elements are <=9.

Wait, but if I choose not to split some numbers >=10, then those numbers remain >=10 in the final array.

So, in the final array, I can have a mix of elements <=9 and elements >=10.

But my goal is to have the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, I need to ensure that the sequence of elements, whether split or not, forms a non-decreasing sequence.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for each element, if it's >=10, I can choose to split it into its digits, which are <=9, or keep it as is, with value >=10.

Then, in the final array, I have a sequence of elements where some are <=9 and some are >=10.

But to have a sorted array, I need to ensure that for any two consecutive elements, the left one is <= the right one.

So, if I have an element >=10 followed by an element <=9, it's only allowed if the element >=10 is less than or equal to the element <=9.

But since all elements >=10 are at least 10, and elements <=9 are at most 9, this is impossible.

Wait, no. Wait, elements <=9 can be 0 to 9, and elements >=10 are 10 to 99.

So, if I have an element >=10 followed by an element <=9, it can only be sorted if the element >=10 is less than or equal to the element <=9.

But since 10 > 9, this is impossible.

Therefore, in a sorted array, an element >=10 cannot be followed by an element <=9.

This is an important observation.

So, in the final array, if there is any element >=10, all elements after it must also be >=10.

In other words, in the final array, all elements <=9 must appear before any element >=10.

This is similar to partitioning the array into two parts: all elements <=9 first, followed by elements >=10.

But wait, no. Actually, it's more restrictive.

Because even among elements <=9, they need to be sorted among themselves, and similarly for elements >=10.

But the key point is that there cannot be an element >=10 followed by an element <=9 in the final array.

Therefore, in the final array, all elements <=9 must appear before any element >=10.

This gives me a strategy to build the array.

I can iterate through the array and for each element, decide whether to split it or not, with the constraint that once I choose to have an element >=10 in the array, all subsequent elements must also be >=10.

So, I can try to find a point in the array where I stop splitting elements into digits (which are <=9) and start keeping elements as is (which are >=10).

But this might not cover all cases, because I can choose to split some elements >=10 and keep others as is, as long as the sequence remains sorted.

Wait, but given the earlier observation, it's only possible to have a sequence of elements <=9 followed by elements >=10, with no element >=10 followed by an element <=9.

So, perhaps I can build the array by choosing a split point where before that point, I split elements into digits (<=9), and after that point, I keep elements as is (>=10).

But I need to ensure that the sequence is sorted within these constraints.

Wait, but this might not be entirely accurate, because I can choose to keep some elements >=10 before elements <=9, as long as the kept elements are in sorted order.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I split all elements >=10 into their digits, resulting in an array of single digits.

Then, I can check if this array of digits is sorted.

If it is, then certainly, I can achieve a sorted array by splitting all necessary elements.

But in the examples, sometimes splitting all elements doesn't lead to a sorted array, as in the second example.

So, splitting all elements is not always the solution.

Therefore, I need to be more selective about which elements to split.

Let me consider that splitting an element >=10 into digits allows me to insert multiple elements in its place, which can help in achieving the sorted order.

But I need to ensure that the sequence of these inserted digits is sorted with respect to the previous and next elements.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of the cumulative maximum.

Initialize prev = -1

For each element in the array:

if a[i] < prev:

# cannot be sorted

return NO

else:

prev = a[i]

But this is just checking if the array is already sorted.

But in our case, we can perform operations to split elements, so we have more flexibility.

So, perhaps I need to adjust prev based on whether I choose to split a[i] or not.

Wait, maybe I can set prev to the smallest possible value that a[i] can take after operations.

Then, for each a[i], I can choose to split it or not, and set prev to the appropriate value.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and maintain the maximum value seen so far.

But I need to consider that splitting a number into digits allows me to have smaller values.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value that the current position should be >=.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize prev = -1

For each element a[i]:

if a[i] <10:

if a[i] >= prev:

prev = a[i]

else:

return NO

elif a[i] >=10:

# Option 1: split a[i] into digits

digits = [a[i] // 10, a[i] % 10]

for d in digits:

if d >= prev:

prev = d

else:

return NO

# Option 2: keep a[i] as is

if a[i] >= prev:

prev = a[i]

else:

return NO

# Choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted

But this seems incomplete because I need to choose the best option at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can consider both options and see if either leads to a sorted array.

So, for each element, I have two choices (if a[i] >=10): split or keep.

I need to choose the one that allows the array to remain sorted.

So, I can try both options and see if at least one of them leads to a sorted array.

But with n=50, this would be too slow.

I need a way to make this efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize splitting elements to get smaller values, which might make it easier to maintain the sorted order.

But I need to ensure that splitting doesn't disrupt the order.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and for each element, choose to split it only if it helps in maintaining the sorted order.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize prev = -1

For each element a[i]:

if a[i] <10:

if a[i] >= prev:

prev = a[i]

else:

return NO

elif a[i] >=10:

# Option 1: split a[i]

digits = [a[i] // 10, a[i] % 10]

if all(d >= prev for d in digits):

for d in digits:

if d >= prev:

prev = d

else:

return NO

# Option 2: keep a[i] as is

if a[i] >= prev:

prev = a[i]

else:

return NO

# If either option succeeds, continue

else:

return NO

return YES

This seems like a reasonable approach.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

[12, 3, 45, 67]

Initialize prev = -1

First element: 12 >=10

Option 1: split 12 into 1 and 2

Check if 1 >= -1 and 2 >=1: yes

Set prev =2

Option 2: keep 12, check if 12 >= -1: yes, set prev=12

Choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted.

In this case, both options are possible, so I can choose the one that leads to a sorted array.

Proceeding with Option 1: prev=2

Second element: 3 <10

3 >=2: yes, set prev=3

Third element:45 >=10

Option 1: split 45 into4 and5

Check if4 >=3 and5 >=4: yes, set prev=5

Option 2: keep45, check if45 >=3: yes, set prev=45

Choose Option 1: prev=5

Fourth element:67 >=10

Option 1: split67 into6 and7

Check if6 >=5 and7 >=6: yes, set prev=7

Option 2: keep67, check if67 >=5: yes, set prev=67

Choose Option 1: prev=7

End of array, return YES

This matches the first example.

Now, the second example:

[12, 28,5]

Initialize prev=-1

First element:12 >=10

Option 1: split12 into1 and2

Check if1 >=-1 and2 >=1: yes, set prev=2

Option 2: keep12, check if12 >=-1: yes, set prev=12

Choose Option 1: prev=2

Second element:28 >=10

Option 1: split28 into2 and8

Check if2 >=2 and8 >=2: yes, set prev=8

Option 2: keep28, check if28 >=2: yes, set prev=28

Choose Option 1: prev=8

Third element:5 <10

5 >=8: no

Return NO

This matches the second example.

Third example:

[0,0]

Initialize prev=-1

First element:0 <10

0 >=-1: yes, set prev=0

Second element:0 <10

0 >=0: yes, set prev=0

End of array, return YES

Perfect, this works.

So, the approach is:

- Initialize prev=-1

- Iterate through each element:

- If a[i]<10:

- If a[i] >= prev:

- Set prev = a[i]

- Else:

- Return NO

- Else (a[i]>=10):

- Option 1: split a[i] into digits

- Check if all digits >= prev

- If yes, set prev to the last digit

- Option 2: keep a[i] as is

- Check if a[i] >= prev

- If yes, set prev = a[i]

- If either option succeeds, continue

- Else, return NO

- At the end, return YES

This seems efficient and works within the time constraints, as it's O(n) per test case.

Now, looking back at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

k = int(input())

a = input()

a = list(map(int, a.split()))

x = 0

y = 0

n = 0

c = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:

x = int(a[i] % 10)

y = int(a[i] / 10)

if y >= c[n - 1]:

if y <= x:

c.append(y)

c.append(x)

n = n + 2

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:

x = int(a[i] % 10)

y = int(a[i] / 10)

if y <= x:

c.append(y)

c.append(x)

n = n + 2

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

d = sorted(c)

if c == d:

b.append(1)

else:

b.append(0)

This seems to be attempting to split numbers >10 into their digits and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

But it doesn't seem to be following the logic I described earlier.

In particular, it doesn't handle the choices of splitting or not splitting for each element >=10, and it doesn't maintain a "prev" value to ensure that each element or its splits are >= the previous element.

Instead, it seems to be splitting numbers >10 into their digits unconditionally, and then checking if the resulting array is sorted.

But in the first example, splitting all elements >10 into digits gives [1,2,3,4,5,67], which is sorted, so it would correctly return YES.

In the second example, splitting all elements >10 into digits gives [1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted, so it would correctly return NO.

In the third example, no splitting is needed, and [0,0] is already sorted, so it would correctly return YES.

So, in these cases, it seems to work.

But let's consider another test case to see if this approach is correct.

Consider the array [15, 2, 30].

If we split all elements >10 into digits, we get [1,5,2,3,0].

This array is [1,5,2,3,0], which is not sorted.

But, if we choose to split only 15 into 1 and 5, and keep 30 as is, we get [1,5,2,30].

This is not sorted because 5 >2.

Alternatively, if we don't split 15 and split 30 into 3 and 0, we get [15,2,3,0], which is not sorted.

If we split both, we get [1,5,2,3,0], not sorted.

If we don't split anything, we have [15,2,30], which is not sorted.

So, in this case, it's impossible to sort the array.

The given program would split all elements >10 into digits, getting [1,5,2,3,0], which is not sorted, so it would correctly return NO.

Another test case: [20, 1, 21].

If we split 20 into 2 and 0, and split 21 into 2 and 1, we get [2,0,2,1], which is not sorted.

If we split only 20 into 2 and 0, and keep 21 as is, we get [2,0,21], which is not sorted.

If we keep 20 as is and split 21 into 2 and 1, we get [20,1,2,1], which is not sorted.

If we don't split anything, we have [20,1,21], which is not sorted.

So, in this case, it's impossible to sort the array.

The given program would split all elements >10 into digits, getting [2,0,1,2,1], which is not sorted, so it would correctly return NO.

Another test case: [10,11,12].

If we split 10 into 1 and 0, and split 11 into 1 and 1, and split 12 into 1 and 2, we get [1,0,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted.

If we split only 10 into 1 and 0, and keep 11 and 12 as is, we get [1,0,11,12], which is not sorted because 0 <11, but 1 <0 is not allowed.

If we keep 10 as is and split 11 and 12, we get [10,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted because 1 <10 is not allowed.

If we keep all as is, [10,11,12] is sorted.

So, in this case, it's possible to have a sorted array by not splitting any elements.

The given program would split all elements >10 into digits, getting [1,0,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted, but since keeping all elements as is results in a sorted array [10,11,12], it should return YES.

But according to the program, it would check if [1,0,1,1,1,2] is sorted, which is not, so it would return NO, which is incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can make a given array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows us to delete any element that is at least 10 and insert its digits in the same position.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with a variable `prev` set to -1 to keep track of the maximum value seen so far.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - If the element is less than 10:
       - If it is greater than or equal to `prev`, update `prev` to this element.
       - Otherwise, return "NO".
     - If the element is 10 or greater:
       - **Option 1**: Split the element into its digits.
         - Check if all digits are greater than or equal to `prev`.
         - If so, update `prev` to the last digit.
       - **Option 2**: Keep the element as is.
         - Check if the element is greater than or equal to `prev`.
         - If so, update `prev` to this element.
       - If neither option allows the array to remain sorted, return "NO".

3. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without returning "NO", return "YES".

### Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        prev = -1
        possible = True
        for num in a:
            if num < 10:
                if num >= prev:
                    prev = num
                else:
                    possible = False
                    break
            else:
                # Option 1: Split the number
                x = num // 10
                y = num % 10
                if x >= prev and y >= x:
                    prev = y
                # Option 2: Keep the number as is
                elif num >= prev:
                    prev = num
                else:
                    possible = False
                    break
        results.append("YES" if possible else "NO")
    return results

results = can_be_sorted()
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases and process each test case one by one.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - Read the array size and the array elements.
  - Initialize `prev` to -1.
  - Iterate through each element in the array:
    - For elements less than 10, ensure they are not less than `prev`.
    - For elements 10 or greater, consider both options (splitting or keeping as is) and choose the one that maintains the sorted order.
    - Update `prev` accordingly based on the chosen option.
    - If at any point neither option maintains the sorted order, mark as "NO" and break.

- **Output**:
  - Collect results for all test cases and print them.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted with the given operations, adhering to the constraints and requirements specified in the problem.
