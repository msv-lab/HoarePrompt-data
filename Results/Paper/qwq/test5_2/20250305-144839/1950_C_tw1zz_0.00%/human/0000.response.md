Alright, I've got this problem to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The program provided seems to do that, but I need to make sure it's correct for all cases. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem states that the input is a string in the format "hh:mm", where hh is the hour from 00 to 23, and mm is the minute from 00 to 59. The output should be in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", following the 12-hour format rules.

The program starts by reading the number of test cases, t, which is a single integer. Then, for each test case, it reads the time string, splits it into hour and minute parts, and based on the hour, it determines whether it's AM or PM and adjusts the hour accordingly.

Looking at the code, it maps the 24-hour format to 12-hour format using a series of if-elif statements. For hours from '01' to '12', it assigns 'AM', and for hours from '13' to '23', it assigns 'PM' after adjusting the hour by subtracting 12. Also, it handles '00' by setting it to '12 PM', which seems a bit off because '00:00' in 24-hour format is midnight, which should be '12:00 AM'.

Let me check the example provided:

Input:

11

09:41

18:06

12:14

00:59

00:00

14:34

01:01

19:07

11:59

12:00

21:37

Output:

09:41 AM

06:06 PM

12:14 PM

12:59 AM

12:00 AM

02:34 PM

01:01 AM

07:07 PM

11:59 AM

12:00 PM

09:37 PM

Comparing this with what the program does:

- '09:41' should be '09:41 AM' – correct.

- '18:06' is '06:06 PM' – correct.

- '12:14' is '12:14 PM' – correct.

- '00:59' is '12:59 AM' – correct.

- '00:00' is '12:00 AM' – correct.

- '14:34' is '02:34 PM' – correct.

- '01:01' is '01:01 AM' – correct.

- '19:07' is '07:07 PM' – correct.

- '11:59' is '11:59 AM' – correct.

- '12:00' is '12:00 PM' – correct.

- '21:37' is '09:37 PM' – correct.

So, based on the example, it seems correct. But I need to verify the logic thoroughly.

Let's consider how 24-hour format maps to 12-hour format:

- 00:00 to 11:59 is AM.

- 12:00 to 12:59 is PM.

- 13:00 to 23:59 is PM, with hours adjusted by subtracting 12.

Wait a minute, in 12-hour format, '00:00' in 24-hour format is '12:00 AM', and '12:00' in 24-hour format is '12:00 PM'. But in the program, '12:00' is correctly mapped to '12:00 PM', and '00:00' is mapped to '12:00 AM'.

Looking back at the code, for '00', it sets h1 to '12' and time to 'PM', but according to standard 12-hour format, '00:00' should be '12:00 AM'. So, is this a mistake?

Wait, no. In the code, for '00', it sets h1 to '12' and time to 'PM', but in the example, '00:00' is output as '12:00 AM'. Hmm, that's inconsistent with the code logic as per my earlier understanding.

Let me check the code again:

```python

if h == '01':

    h1 = '01'

    time = 'AM'

elif h == '02':

    h1 = '02'

    time = 'AM'

...

elif h == '12':

    h1 = '12'

    time = 'AM'

elif h == '13':

    h1 = '01'

    time = 'PM'

...

elif h == '23':

    h1 = '11'

    time = 'PM'

elif h == '00':

    h1 = '12'

    time = 'PM'

```

Wait, for '00', it sets h1 to '12' and time to 'PM', but in the example, it's outputting '12:00 AM' for '00:00'. How is that possible?

Looking at the output for '00:00': '12:00 AM', but according to the code, it should be '12:00 PM'. There's a discrepancy here.

Ah, perhaps the code is correct, and my understanding is wrong. Let me check the logic again.

Wait, maybe I need to see the actual code execution for '00:00'.

Given '00:00', h = '00', m = '00'.

It sets h1 = '12' and time = 'PM', so it should print '12:00 PM', but in the example, it's '12:00 AM'. That means the code is incorrect for this case.

Similarly, for '12:00', it sets h1 = '12' and time = 'AM', but in the example, it's '12:00 PM'. Wait, no, in the example, '12:00' is '12:00 PM', which matches the code's assignment of 'AM'?

Wait, no, in the code, for h == '12', it sets time = 'AM', but in the example, '12:00' is '12:00 PM'. That's inconsistent.

So, there's a mistake in the code's logic for handling '00:00' and '12:00'.

Let me refer back to the problem description.

Problem states:

- In 12-hour format, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, ..., 11.

- Each half is AM or PM.

- Specifically, first half is AM, second half is PM.

- 00:00 in 24-hour format is midnight, which should be 12:00 AM in 12-hour format.

- 12:00 in 24-hour format is noon, which should be 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

So, the code should map:

- '00:00' to '12:00 AM'

- '12:00' to '12:00 PM'

- '24:00' (which is same as '00:00') to '12:00 AM'

But in the code, for h == '00', it sets h1 = '12' and time = 'PM', which would output '12:00 PM' for '00:00', which is incorrect; it should be '12:00 AM'.

Similarly, for h == '12', it sets time = 'AM', which would output '12:00 AM' for '12:00', but it should be '12:00 PM'.

In the example, however, '00:00' is correctly shown as '12:00 AM', but according to the code, it should be '12:00 PM'. So, perhaps there's a mistake in my interpretation.

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the code or in my understanding.

Let me check the code again:

For h == '00':

h1 = '12'

time = 'PM'

So, '00:00' should be '12:00 PM', but in the example, it's '12:00 AM'. So, the code is incorrect here.

For h == '12':

h1 = '12'

time = 'AM'

So, '12:00' should be '12:00 AM', but in the example, it's '12:00 PM'. Again, inconsistency.

Wait, but in the example, '12:00' is '12:00 PM', which contradicts the code's logic.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to convert times from the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format accurately. The initial approach in the provided code has some logical errors, particularly with handling the hours '00' and '12'. We need to ensure that '00:00' is correctly converted to '12:00 AM' and '12:00' is converted to '12:00 PM'.

### Approach

1. **Read Input:** Read the number of test cases and the time strings.
2. **Parse Hours and Minutes:** Split each time string into hours and minutes.
3. **Convert to 12-Hour Format:**
   - For hours from '01' to '11', append 'AM'.
   - For hours '12', append 'PM'.
   - For hours from '13' to '23', subtract 12 from the hour and append 'PM'.
   - For hour '00', set hour to '12' and append 'AM'.
4. **Output the Converted Time:** Print the converted time in the specified format.

### Solution Code

```python
def convert_to_12_hour():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        h, m = input().split(':')
        if h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        elif h > '12':
            h1 = str(int(h) - 12)
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h
            time = 'AM'
        print(f"{h1.zfill(2)}:{m} {time}")

convert_to_12_hour()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the time string and split it into hour `h` and minute `m`.

2. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `h` is '00', set `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'AM' (midnight).
   - If `h` is '12', set `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'PM' (noon).

3. **Converting Hours:**
   - If `h` is greater than '12', subtract 12 from `h` to get `h1` and set `time` to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, keep `h1` as `h` and set `time` to 'AM'.

4. **Formatting and Printing:**
   - Ensure that `h1` is zero-padded to two digits using `zfill(2)`.
   - Print the formatted time in the "hh:mm AM/PM" format.

This approach ensures that all times are correctly converted from 24-hour to 12-hour format, handling the special cases for midnight and noon appropriately.
