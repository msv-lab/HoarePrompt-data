Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange these numbers to maximize something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to think about how rearranging the array can affect this sum. Let's look at an example to get some intuition.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 3

a = [2, 1, 3]

If I arrange it as [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Another arrangement, say [3, 1, 2], beauty would be (1 - 3) + (2 - 1) = (-2) + 1 = -1.

And [2, 1, 3], beauty is (1 - 2) + (3 - 1) = (-1) + 2 = 1.

So, the maximum beauty in this case is 2.

From this, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order gives the maximum beauty. Let's check another example.

Second example:

n = 3

a = [69, 69, 69]

No matter how I arrange them, the differences will always be 0, so beauty is 0.

Third example:

n = 5

a = [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]

If I sort it: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]

Beauty: (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57.

If I arrange it differently, say [100, 43, 54, 80, 90], beauty: (43-100) + (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) = (-57) + 11 + 26 + 10 = 0.

So, sorting gives a higher beauty.

Fourth example:

n = 4

a = [3, 4, 3, 3]

Sorted: [3, 3, 3, 4]

Beauty: (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

Another arrangement: [4, 3, 3, 3], beauty: (3-4) + (3-3) + (3-3) = (-1) + 0 + 0 = -1.

So again, sorting gives the maximum beauty.

Fifth example:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Sorted: [1, 2]

Beauty: (2 - 1) = 1.

Unsorted: [2, 1], beauty: (1 - 2) = -1.

Again, sorting is better.

From these examples, it seems that sorting the array in ascending order maximizes the beauty. Let's see why.

Mathematically, the beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n.

This simplifies to a_n - a_1.

Because when you expand the sum:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where a1 is the first element and an is the last element in the arranged array.

Therefore, to maximize beauty, we need to minimize a1 and maximize an.

In other words, set a1 to the smallest element in the array and an to the largest element.

But in the arrangement, since it's a sequence, the smallest should be at the beginning and the largest at the end.

So, sorting the array in ascending order achieves this.

Hence, the maximum beauty is the largest element minus the smallest element.

Wait a minute, in the first example, largest is 3, smallest is 1, difference is 2, which matches the example.

In the second example, all are 69, so difference is 0.

In the third example, largest is 100, smallest is 43, difference is 57, which matches.

In the fourth example, largest is 4, smallest is 3, difference is 1.

In the fifth example, largest is 2, smallest is 1, difference is 1.

So, it seems that the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it's doing.

The program reads input for multiple test cases, reads n and the array for each test case, and then calls func_1 on each array to compute the beauty.

In func_1, it sorts the array in ascending order and then computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, since the beauty simplifies to an - a1, why are we summing up absolute differences?

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, I thought that the beauty is an - a1, but looking back, in the first example, sum of (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) = a3 - a1 = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches.

But in the program, it's using abs(array[i] - array[i-1]), which is unnecessary if the array is sorted in ascending order, because the differences will be positive.

So, in that case, summing up (array[i] - array[i-1]) without abs would give the same result as an - a1.

But using abs doesn't harm in this case since the differences are positive when sorted ascendingly.

So, the program is sorting the array and then summing up the differences, which is correct.

Alternatively, we could simply compute the difference between the last and first elements after sorting.

But both approaches are correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
