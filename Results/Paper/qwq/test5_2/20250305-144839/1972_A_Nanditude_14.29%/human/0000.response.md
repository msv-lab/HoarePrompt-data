Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n problems in a contest, each with a difficulty a_i, and each expected difficulty is at most b_i. Both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Sometimes, the actual difficulty a_i might be more than the expected b_i, right? So, I need to fix that by proposing new problems with certain difficulties, and then replacing the most difficult existing problem with this new one.

Each time I propose a new problem with difficulty w, I insert w into array a, sort a in non-decreasing order, and then remove the last (i.e., the largest) element.

My goal is to find the minimum number of such operations needed so that for every i, a_i ≤ b_i.

Let's look at the example to understand better.

In the first test case:

n = 6

a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]

b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]

They say that by proposing two problems with w=800 and w=1800, a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000], which satisfies a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

Wait, let's verify that:

After first proposal w=800:

a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] after sorting and removing the last element (2700).

Then, propose w=1800:

a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] after sorting and removing the last element (2200).

Now, check a_i ≤ b_i:

800 ≤ 800: yes

1000 ≤ 1200: yes

1400 ≤ 1500: yes

1800 ≤ 1800: yes

2000 ≤ 2200: yes

2000 ≤ 3000: yes

Perfect.

They also mention it's impossible to do it with fewer than 2 proposals, meaning 1 proposal isn't enough.

Let's see why.

If I propose only one w, say w=1800:

a becomes [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,1800] -> sorted: [1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200] -> remove the last one: [1000,1400,1800,2000,2000,2200]

Now, check a_i ≤ b_i:

1000 ≤ 800: no

1400 ≤ 1200: no

1800 ≤ 1500: no

2000 ≤ 1800: no

2000 ≤ 2200: yes

2200 ≤ 3000: yes

So, multiple a_i > b_i still.

Similarly, if I propose w=800:

a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] -> remove 2700

Then, check a_i ≤ b_i:

800 ≤ 800: yes

1000 ≤ 1200: yes

1400 ≤ 1500: yes

2000 ≤ 1800: no

2000 ≤ 2200: yes

2200 ≤ 3000: yes

Still, 2000 > 1800, so need another proposal.

Hence, two proposals are necessary.

In the second test case:

n=6

a=[4,5,6,7,8,9]

b=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

They propose w=1, w=2, w=3, and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6], which matches b.

Let's see if three proposals are necessary.

If I propose only two ws, say w=1 and w=2:

a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] after first proposal w=1

Then, [1,2,4,5,6,7] -> propose w=2: insert 2, sort: [1,2,2,4,5,6], remove the last one: [1,2,2,4,5,6]

Now, check a_i ≤ b_i:

1 ≤ 1: yes

2 ≤ 2: yes

2 ≤ 3: yes

4 ≤ 4: yes

5 ≤ 5: yes

6 ≤ 6: yes

Wait, seems like two proposals are enough in this case, but the example says it needs three.

Wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, if I propose w=1 and w=2:

First proposal w=1:

a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] -> sort: [1,4,5,6,7,8] -> remove the last one: [1,4,5,6,7,8]

Second proposal w=2:

a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] -> sort: [1,2,4,5,6,7] -> remove the last one: [1,2,4,5,6,7]

Now, check a_i ≤ b_i:

1 ≤ 1: yes

2 ≤ 2: yes

4 ≤ 3: no

5 ≤ 4: no

6 ≤ 5: no

7 ≤ 6: no

So, not good.

Wait, maybe I need to choose different ws.

If I propose w=1 and w=3:

First proposal w=1:

a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] -> sort: [1,4,5,6,7,8] -> remove the last one: [1,4,5,6,7,8]

Second proposal w=3:

a becomes [1,3,4,5,6,7] -> sort: [1,3,4,5,6,7] -> remove the last one: [1,3,4,5,6,7]

Check a_i ≤ b_i:

1 ≤ 1: yes

3 ≤ 2: no

4 ≤ 3: no

5 ≤ 4: no

6 ≤ 5: no

7 ≤ 6: no

Still not good.

Maybe proposing w=1, w=2, w=3 is necessary:

First w=1: a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] -> sort: [1,4,5,6,7,8] -> remove last: [1,4,5,6,7,8]

Second w=2: a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] -> sort: [1,2,4,5,6,7] -> remove last: [1,2,4,5,6,7]

Third w=3: a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> sort: [1,2,3,4,5,6] -> remove last: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Now, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

So, three proposals are needed.

Hence, the answer is 3.

Alright, now I need to find a general way to compute the minimum number of proposals needed.

Let me think about the problem.

Given that a and b are both sorted in non-decreasing order, I need to ensure that for each i, a_i ≤ b_i.

If a_i > b_i, I need to reduce a_i to be ≤ b_i.

But I can't directly change a_i; instead, I can propose new problems with difficulties w, insert them into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

Each proposal allows me to effectively replace the largest element in a with w.

So, each proposal lets me replace the largest element in a with w, and then the array is sorted again.

I need to choose ws in such a way that after all these operations, a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

I need to minimize the number of such operations.

Let me think about what happens with each proposal.

Each time I propose a problem with difficulty w, I insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element.

This means that the largest element in a after this operation will be the second-largest before the operation, assuming w ≤ the second-largest.

But it's a bit tricky to track.

Maybe I can think differently.

Since a and b are sorted, I can use a two-pointer approach.

Let's initialize two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning of a and b.

I'll iterate through a and b simultaneously.

If a[i] > b[j], I need to replace some element in a to make a[i] ≤ b[j].

But since I can only replace the largest element in a with w, and then sort a, it's not straightforward.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the largest elements.

Since I can replace the largest element in a with w, and then the array is sorted, perhaps I should focus on ensuring that the k largest elements in a are ≤ the k largest elements in b.

Because b is sorted in non-decreasing order, the k-th largest in b is b[n-k].

Wait, b is sorted in non-decreasing order, so b[n-1] is the largest.

Wait, in zero-based indexing, b[n-1] is the largest.

So, to ensure that the k-th largest in a is ≤ the k-th largest in b, for all k from 1 to n.

This seems like a way to frame the problem.

In other words, for all k, the k-th largest in a ≤ the k-th largest in b.

This is equivalent to saying that a is dominated by b in terms of their ordered elements.

This is similar to the concept of majorization in mathematics.

Given that, I need to perform operations that reduce the largest elements in a, by replacing them with smaller ws, and then removing the new largest element.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the difference between a and b.

Let's consider the differences between corresponding elements.

But since a and b are sorted, I need to find where a sticks out above b.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from the end.

Let's consider the largest elements.

If the largest a_i is greater than the largest b_j, I need to replace it.

Wait, specifically, if a[n-1] > b[n-1], I need to reduce a[n-1] to be ≤ b[n-1].

But I can only do this by proposing a w, inserting it into a, sorting, and removing the new largest element.

Wait, when I insert w into a, sort a, and remove the largest element, effectively I'm replacing the largest element in a with w, but only if w is less than or equal to the second largest element in a.

Wait, not necessarily.

Let me think carefully.

Suppose a is sorted in non-decreasing order.

After inserting w, the new array is sorted, and then the largest element is removed.

So, the new a will have the original a[0] to a[n-2], possibly with w inserted somewhere, and the largest element removed.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the multiset of elements.

Each operation allows me to add w to a, sort, and remove the largest element.

This is equivalent to replacing the largest element in the original a with w, but only if w is less than or equal to the second largest element.

Wait, no.

Let me consider.

Suppose a = [1,2,3], n=3.

Propose w=0.

Insert 0, a becomes [0,1,2,3], sort: [0,1,2,3], remove the largest: [0,1,2].

So, effectively, the largest element 3 is replaced with w=0.

Similarly, if w=2, a becomes [1,2,2], after sorting: [1,2,2], remove the largest: [1,2,2].

Wait, but in this case, the largest element was 2, which was not changed.

Wait, no, the largest was 2, and it was removed after inserting another 2.

Wait, it's a bit confusing.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, to minimize the number of operations, I should target the largest possible ws that are still less than or equal to the corresponding b_i.

Wait, maybe I should look for the first position where a[i] > b[i], and fix that by proposing a w that is ≤ b[i], and repeat.

But I need to be careful because proposing a w affects the entire array.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach would work.

I can iterate through the array from the end (the largest elements), and whenever a[i] > b[i], propose a w that is ≤ b[i], insert it, sort, and remove the largest element.

But I need to ensure that this operation reduces a[i] to be ≤ b[i].

Wait, perhaps I can always choose w = b[i] when a[i] > b[i].

Let's try that with the first example.

n=6

a=[1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b=[800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Start from i=5:

a[5]=2700 > b[5]=3000: propose w=3000

But b[i] is 3000, which is greater than a[5]=2700. Wait, but the condition is a_i ≤ b_i, which is already satisfied here, since 2700 ≤ 3000.

Wait, no, in the first test case, after some operations, they had to propose w=800 and w=1800.

Wait, maybe I need to find the positions where a_i > b_i, and fix them.

Let me iterate through a and b:

Compare a[0]=1000 and b[0]=800: 1000 > 800 → need to fix

a[1]=1400 > b[1]=1200 → 1400 > 1200 → need to fix

a[2]=2000 > b[2]=1500 → need to fix

a[3]=2000 > b[3]=1800 → need to fix

a[4]=2200 > b[4]=2200 → 2200 ≤ 2200 → okay

a[5]=2700 > b[5]=3000 → 2700 ≤ 3000 → okay

So, positions 0,1,2,3 need fixing.

But in the example, they only proposed two problems, not four.

So, proposing a w affects multiple a_i.

Hence, I need a more strategic way to choose ws.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the minimal number of ws such that after proposing them, the a array, after sorting and removing the largest elements accordingly, satisfies a_i ≤ b_i for all i.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many a_i are greater than b_i, and propose ws accordingly.

But in the first example, four a_i's are greater than b_i, but only two proposals are needed.

So, proposing one w can fix multiple a_i's.

Hence, I need to choose ws in such a way that each proposal fixes as many a_i's as possible.

Let me consider that each time I propose a w, I can effectively reduce the largest a_i to w, and then the array is sorted again.

Wait, but it's not exactly replacing the largest a_i with w; it's inserting w and then removing the new largest element.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the operation allows me to set the largest a_i to w, but only if w is less than or equal to the second largest a_i.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand their approach.

The reference solution uses two pointers, i and j, starting from the beginning of a and b.

It initializes cnt=0.

Then, it iterates while both i and j are less than n.

If b[j] < a[i], it means that b[j] is smaller than a[i], so a[i] needs to be reduced.

So, it pops the last element from a (the largest one), inserts b[j] into a, sorts a, and increments cnt.

Then, j is incremented.

Else, both i and j are incremented.

Finally, it prints cnt.

Wait, in the first test case:

a = [1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700]

b = [800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

Initially, i=0, j=0, cnt=0

Check b[j]=800 < a[i]=1000 → pop last a: remove 2700, insert 800, sort a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200], cnt=1, j=1

Now, i=0, j=1

b[j]=1200 < a[i]=800? No, since 1200 > 800 → i=1, j=1

Next iteration:

b[j]=1200 < a[i]=1000? No → i=2, j=1

Next:

b[j]=1200 < a[i]=1400? No → i=3, j=1

Next:

b[j]=1200 < a[i]=2000? Yes → pop last a: remove 2200, insert 1200, sort a: [800,1000,1200,1400,2000,2000], cnt=2, j=2

Now, i=3, j=2

b[j]=1500 < a[i]=1400? No → i=4, j=2

Next:

b[j]=1500 < a[i]=2000? Yes → pop last a: remove 2000, insert 1500, sort a: [800,1000,1200,1400,1500,2000], cnt=3, j=3

Now, i=4, j=3

b[j]=1800 < a[i]=1500? No → i=5, j=3

Next:

b[j]=1800 < a[i]=2000? Yes → pop last a: remove 2000, insert 1800, sort a: [800,1000,1200,1400,1500,1800], cnt=4, j=4

Now, i=5, j=4

b[j]=2200 < a[i]=1800? No → i=6 (out of bounds), stop.

Final cnt=4, but in the example, cnt=2.

Wait, this doesn't match the example's cnt=2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Wait, in the example, they proposed w=800 and w=1800, resulting in cnt=2.

But according to this code, cnt=4.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the operations.

Wait, in the code, whenever b[j] < a[i], it pops the last element from a, inserts b[j], sorts a, and increments cnt and j.

Else, it increments both i and j.

In the first iteration:

b[0]=800 < a[0]=1000 → pop 2700, insert 800, sort a: [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200], cnt=1, j=1

Now, b[1]=1200 < a[1]=1000? 1200 > 1000 → no, so i=1, j=1

Next, b[1]=1200 < a[1]=1000? Still no.

Wait, b[1]=1200 < a[1]=1000? 1200 > 1000, so no, increment both i and j: i=2, j=2

Now, b[2]=1500 < a[2]=1400? 1500 > 1400 → no, i=3, j=2

Next, b[2]=1500 < a[3]=2000? Yes → pop 2200, insert 1500, sort a: [800,1000,1400,1500,2000,2000], cnt=2, j=3

Now, i=3, j=3

b[3]=1800 < a[3]=1500? 1800 > 1500 → no, i=4, j=3

Next, b[3]=1800 < a[4]=2000? Yes → pop 2000, insert 1800, sort a: [800,1000,1400,1500,1800,2000], cnt=3, j=4

Now, i=4, j=4

b[4]=2200 < a[4]=1800? 2200 > 1800 → no, i=5, j=4

Next, b[4]=2200 < a[5]=2000? Yes → pop 2000, insert 2200, sort a: [800,1000,1400,1500,1800,2000], cnt=4, j=5

Now, i=5, j=5

b[5]=3000 < a[5]=2000? 3000 > 2000 → no, i=6, stop.

Final cnt=4.

But in the example, they said cnt=2.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the example, they proposed w=800 and w=1800, resulting in a=[800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000], which satisfies a_i ≤ b_i.

But according to the code, cnt=4.

So, perhaps the code is not optimal.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Let me see another test case.

Second test case:

n=6

a=[4,5,6,7,8,9]

b=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

According to the code:

i=0, j=0, cnt=0

b[0]=1 < a[0]=4? Yes → pop 9, insert 1, sort a: [1,4,5,6,7,8], cnt=1, j=1

i=0, j=1

b[1]=2 < a[0]=1? 2 > 1 → no, i=1, j=1

b[1]=2 < a[1]=4? Yes → pop 8, insert 2, sort a: [1,2,4,5,6,7], cnt=2, j=2

i=1, j=2

b[2]=3 < a[1]=2? 3 > 2 → no, i=2, j=2

b[2]=3 < a[2]=5? Yes → pop 7, insert 3, sort a: [1,2,3,4,5,6], cnt=3, j=3

i=2, j=3

b[3]=4 < a[2]=3? 4 > 3 → no, i=3, j=3

b[3]=4 < a[3]=4? 4 == 4 → no, i=4, j=3

b[3]=4 < a[4]=5? Yes → pop 6, insert 4, sort a: [1,2,3,4,4,5], cnt=4, j=4

i=4, j=4

b[4]=5 < a[4]=4? 5 > 4 → no, i=5, j=4

b[4]=5 < a[5]=5? 5 == 5 → no, i=6, stop.

Final cnt=4.

But in the example, cnt=3.

So, again, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps in the code, when inserting b[j], it's not necessarily choosing the minimal number of operations.

Maybe it's possible to choose ws more optimally.

Wait, perhaps instead of inserting b[j] each time, I should choose the minimal w that can fix multiple a_i's.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a priority queue or a sorted list of a.

Each time, I find the largest a_i that is greater than any remaining b_j, and propose a w to fix it.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that each proposal allows me to reduce the largest a_i to w, and w can be chosen optimally.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that b is sorted, and find how many a_i's are greater than b_i, and then group them in some way to minimize the number of ws needed.

This seems similar to covering inequalities with the minimal number of operations.

Wait, maybe it's about finding the minimal number of ws such that after proposing them, the a array, after sorting, is less than or equal to b.

Another way to think about it is to sort a and b, and then find the number of a_i's that are greater than b_i, considering the worst ones.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of a_i's that are greater than b_i, but considering that proposing a w can affect multiple a_i's.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of a_i's where a_i > b_i, but adjusted for the fact that one w can fix multiple a_i's.

This is getting too vague.

Let me think about what each proposal achieves.

Each proposal allows me to insert w, sort a, and remove the largest element.

This effectively replaces the largest element in a with w, but only if w is less than or equal to the second largest element in a.

Wait, not necessarily.

Let me consider:

Suppose a = [1,2,3], n=3.

Propose w=0:

Insert 0, sort: [0,1,2,3], remove the largest: [0,1,2].

So, a becomes [0,1,2].

The largest element was 3, which was replaced with 0.

Similarly, if a = [1,2,3], propose w=2:

Insert 2, sort: [1,2,2,3], remove the largest: [1,2,2].

So, the largest element was 3, replaced with 2.

Similarly, if a = [1,2,3], propose w=1:

Insert 1, sort: [1,1,2,3], remove the largest: [1,1,2].

So, the largest element was 3, replaced with 1.

Hence, each proposal allows me to replace the largest element in a with w.

Wait, but in reality, it's not exactly replacing with w; it's inserting w and removing the new largest element, which could be w itself if w is larger than the original a.

Wait, let's think carefully.

If w ≤ the second largest element in a, then the largest element is removed, and w is inserted, so effectively, the largest element is replaced with w.

But if w > the second largest element, then w becomes the new largest element, and when you remove the largest, you remove w, and the array remains the same.

Wait, let's see:

Suppose a = [1,2,3], n=3.

Propose w=4:

Insert 4, sort: [1,2,3,4], remove the largest: 4, so a becomes [1,2,3].

So, no change.

Hence, proposing w >= the current largest element in a is useless, because w becomes the new largest, and is immediately removed, leaving a unchanged.

Hence, only proposing w < the current largest element in a has an effect, which is replacing the largest element with w.

Therefore, each proposal allows me to replace the largest element in a with any w less than the current largest element.

Moreover, since w can be chosen freely as long as it's less than the current largest element, I can choose w to be as large as possible, up to b[j], to fix as many a_i's as possible.

Wait, but w has to be <= b[j], where j is the current index in b.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose w to be as small as possible to maximize the number of a_i's fixed.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a multiset of a's, and I can replace the largest element with any value less than its current value.

I need to make sure that after some operations, a_i <= b_i for all i.

Given that a and b are sorted, perhaps I can iterate from the end, and ensure that a[n-1] <= b[n-1], a[n-2] <= b[n-2], and so on.

Each operation allows me to decrease the largest element in a to any value less than its current value.

Hence, to minimize the number of operations, I should try to fix as many a_i's as possible with each operation.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

So, in each operation, I should choose w to be the smallest possible b_j that can fix the largest a_i that needs fixing.

Wait, perhaps I should find the largest a_i that needs fixing, and fix it with the smallest possible w that makes it <= the corresponding b_j.

But I need to be careful with the indices.

Wait, maybe I should iterate through b in increasing order, and for each b_j, find the a_i that needs to be <= b_j, and fix it if necessary.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider the difference between a and b.

Since both are sorted, I can find the number of a_i's that are greater than b_i.

But in reality, it's more nuanced, because one operation can affect multiple a_i's.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to finding the number of a_i's that are strictly greater than b_i, considering the array is sorted.

Wait, in standard assignment problems, for sorted arrays, the minimal number of operations is often equal to the number of a_i's where a_i > b_i, but in this case, one operation can affect multiple a_i's.

Hence, it's not directly applicable.

Let me consider the minimal number of operations as the number of times a's largest element needs to be reduced to satisfy a_i <= b_i for all i.

Each operation allows me to reduce the largest element to any value less than its current value.

Hence, the minimal number of operations is equal to the number of a_i's that are strictly greater than b_i.

Wait, no, because one operation can reduce multiple a_i's.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of a_i's where a_i > b_i, minus the number of sequences where a_i > b_i but a_i can be fixed by reducing a_j where j > i.

This seems too complicated.

Let me think in terms of the number of a_i's that are greater than b_i.

In the first test case, a=[1000,1400,2000,2000,2200,2700], b=[800,1200,1500,1800,2200,3000]

a_i > b_i for i=0,1,2,3

Hence, 4 positions need fixing, but only 2 operations are needed.

Hence, each operation can fix multiple positions.

In the second test case, a=[4,5,6,7,8,9], b=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

a_i > b_i for i=0,1,2,3,4,5

But in the example, cnt=3, meaning three operations are needed.

So, perhaps the minimal number of operations is equal to the minimal number of groups of a_i's that need fixing, where
