Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob where they have some coins in their wallets and they take turns making moves according to certain rules. The goal is to determine who will win if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. Alice and Bob start with a certain number of coins in their wallets, let's say a and b respectively. They take turns, with Alice going first. In each turn, the player can choose to either exchange wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet. After that, they must remove one coin from their current wallet, and the wallet can't have zero coins before removing.

The player who can't make a valid move loses. So, if a player is in a situation where their wallet is empty and they can't remove a coin, they lose.

I need to determine, for given values of a and b, who will win the game if both play optimally.

Looking at the sample input and output, there are multiple test cases, each with different values of a and b, and for each, it's determined whether Alice or Bob wins.

I need to think about the game and find a pattern or a formula that can help me determine the winner based on a and b.

Let me consider some small values of a and b to see if I can find a pattern.

Let's start with the first sample input: 1 1

According to the sample output, Bob wins.

In this case:

- Alice has 1 coin, Bob has 1 coin.

- Alice's move:

- She can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, she gets Bob's wallet with 1 coin, and removes 1 coin, so now both have 0 coins.

- If she doesn't swap, she removes 1 coin from her wallet, so now a=0, b=1.

- Let's see both options:

Option 1: Alice swaps.

- After swap: a=0, b=0.

- Now it's Bob's turn, but both wallets are empty, so he can't make a move. Therefore, Bob loses.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Bob wins. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the note, it describes a different sequence of moves where Alice doesn't swap initially, and then Bob makes moves, etc.

Let me read the note again.

In the first test case, it says:

- Alice chooses not to swap wallets. So a=1, b=1.

- Alice removes 1 coin from her wallet: a=0, b=1.

- Now it's Bob's turn.

- Bob's wallet is not empty, so he can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap, he removes 1 coin from his wallet: a=0, b=0.

- Now it's Alice's turn again, but both wallets are empty, so she can't make a move. Hence, Bob wins.

Okay, so in this scenario, Alice chooses not to swap, and that leads to Bob winning.

But if Alice chooses to swap in her first move:

- Swap: a=1, b=1 (same as before).

- Then Bob has to make a move with a=1, b=0.

Wait, no, if Alice swaps, then a=1, b=1.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to think recursively or in terms of game theory.

This seems like an impartial game, where both players have the same moves available to them at each step.

I recall that in such games, the concept of Nimbers or mex can be applied.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the total number of coins: a + b.

In each turn, a player removes one coin from their wallet, and may choose to swap wallets before doing so.

The game ends when a player cannot remove a coin, which happens when their current wallet has zero coins.

I need to see if there's a pattern based on the total number of coins or something else.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

1. 1 1 → Bob

2. 1 4 → Alice

3. 5 3 → Bob

4. 4 5 → Alice

5. 11 9 → Bob

6. 83 91 → Bob

7. 1032 9307 → Alice

8. 839204 7281 → Alice

9. 1000000000 1000000000 → Bob

10. 53110 2024 → Bob

Looking at these, it seems that when a + b is even, Bob wins, otherwise Alice wins.

Wait, let's check:

1. 1 + 1 = 2 (even) → Bob

2. 1 + 4 = 5 (odd) → Alice

3. 5 + 3 = 8 (even) → Bob

4. 4 + 5 = 9 (odd) → Alice

5. 11 + 9 = 20 (even) → Bob

6. 83 + 91 = 174 (even) → Bob

7. 1032 + 9307 = 1032 + 9307 = 1032 is even, 9307 is odd, so sum is odd → Alice

Wait, but sample output is Alice, which matches odd sum.

8. 839204 + 7281 = 839204 is even, 7281 is odd, so sum is odd → Alice

9. 1000000000 + 1000000000 = even + even = even → Bob

10. 53110 + 2024 = even + even = even → Bob

So, in all sample inputs, when a + b is even, Bob wins, and when a + b is odd, Alice wins.

This seems to be a pattern.

Is this always true?

Let me try to see if this makes sense.

If a + b is even, then the total number of moves that can be made is a + b, since each move removes one coin.

But the game doesn't end when all coins are removed; it ends when a player cannot make a move because their current wallet is empty.

So, I need to think differently.

Perhaps I can model this game in terms of Nim or some other impartial game.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the parity of a and b.

Wait, let's consider that each player can choose to swap or not, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.

This seems similar to a game where players can choose to modify one of two heaps in a certain way.

In standard Nim, the XOR of the heap sizes determines the winner, but here the moves are different.

I need to find the winning strategy based on a and b.

Let me consider the base cases.

Base case 1: a = 0, b = 0.

- Alice cannot make a move, since both wallets are empty. So, Bob wins.

Wait, no: if both wallets are empty, and it's Alice's turn, she can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Base case 2: a = 0, b = 1.

- Alice has to choose not to swap, because if she swaps, she gets b=1, but she has to remove 1 coin, so a=0 remains, b=0.

- Then Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the earlier pattern, a + b = 1 (odd), so Alice wins.

Yes, matches.

Base case 3: a = 1, b = 0.

- Similar to above, Alice chooses not to swap, removes 1 coin from her wallet, so a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Base case 4: a = 1, b = 1.

- As in the sample, Alice chooses not to swap, a=0, b=1.

- Bob chooses not to swap, a=0, b=0.

- Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

- a + b = 2 (even), Bob wins.

Seems consistent.

Another test: a = 2, b = 2.

a + b = 4 (even), so Bob wins.

Let's see:

- Alice can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=2, b=2.

- Then Bob can choose to swap or not.

- If he swaps, a=2, b=2.

- Alice removes 1 coin, a=1, b=2.

- Bob can choose to swap or not.

- If he chooses not to swap, removes 1 from his wallet, a=1, b=1.

- Alice can choose to swap or not.

- If she swaps, a=1, b=1.

- Bob removes 1 coin, a=0, b=1.

- Alice can choose to swap, a=0, b=0.

- Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the pattern, a + b = 4 (even), Bob should win, but in this sequence, Alice wins.

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sequence.

Let's try again.

Starting with a=2, b=2.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, in both options, Bob wins.

Another sequence:

Alice's move:

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=2, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=2.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=1.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, in all sequences, Bob wins.

Thus, when a + b is even, Bob wins.

Another test: a=1, b=4.

a + b = 5 (odd), so Alice should win.

Let's see:

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=4, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=3, b=1.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=3.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=3.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=3, b=0.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=0.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=2.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Another sequence:

Alice's move:

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=1, b=4.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=4.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=4, b=0.

- Remove 1 from a: a=3, b=0.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=3.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=0.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=0.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So, in both cases, Alice wins when a + b is odd.

This seems consistent with the pattern I observed earlier.

Therefore, it appears that the winner can be determined solely by the parity of the sum of a and b.

If a + b is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

This seems too straightforward. Is there any exception to this rule?

Let me check with a=3, b=3.

a + b = 6 (even), so Bob should win.

Let's see:

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=3, b=3.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=3.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=3, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=2.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Another sequence:

Alice's move:

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=3, b=3.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=3.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=3, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=2.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

So, again, Bob wins when a + b is even.

Another test: a=2, b=3.

a + b = 5 (odd), so Alice should win.

Let's see:

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=3, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=2.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=1.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Another sequence:

Alice's move:

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=2, b=3.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=3.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=3, b=1.

- Remove 1 from a: a=2, b=1.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=1, b=2.

- Remove 1 from a: a=0, b=2.

Bob's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=2, b=0.

- Remove 1 from a: a=1, b=0.

Alice's move:

Option 1: Swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Option 2: Not swap.

- a=0, b=1.

- Remove 1 from b: a=0, b=0.

Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

So, again, Alice wins when a + b is odd.

This seems consistent.

Let me try another test: a=0, b=1.

a + b = 1 (odd), so Alice should win.

As in the base case, Alice chooses not to swap, removes 1 coin, a=0, b=0, Bob can't make a move, so Alice wins.

Another test: a=0, b=0.

a + b = 0 (even), so Bob should win.

As in the base case, Alice can't make a move, so Bob wins.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, it appears that the sum of a and b determines the winner: if even, Bob wins; if odd, Alice wins.

This seems to be a simple and consistent rule based on the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets, given that both play optimally.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - Alice and Bob take turns with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet, then remove one coin from their chosen wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Insight**:
   - By analyzing the game for different values of `a` and `b`, we observe that the sum of coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The parity (even or odd) of the sum of coins decides the winner because it affects the number of moves and the possible strategies each player can employ.

## Solution Code

```python
def determine_winner():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

determine_winner()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read the input line and split it into integers `a` and `b`.

- **Logic**:
  - Check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
  - If `(a + b)` is even, print "Bob".
  - If `(a + b)` is odd, print "Alice".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for each given pair of `a` and `b`.

   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet, then remove one coin from their chosen wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Insight**:
   - By analyzing the game for different values of `a` and `b`, we observe that the sum of coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The parity (even or odd) of the sum of coins decides the winner because it affects the number of moves and the possible strategies each player can employ.

## Solution Code

```python
def determine_winner():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

determine_winner()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read the input line and split it into integers `a` and `b`.

- **Logic**:
  - Check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
  - If `(a + b)` is even, print "Bob".
  - If `(a + b)` is odd, print "Alice".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for each given pair of `a` and `b`.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets, given that both play optimally.
