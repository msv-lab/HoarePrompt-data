Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations I can perform and how they affect the array. The operation allows me to split any number that is at least 10 into its individual digits at the same position in the array. So, essentially, I can break down any number greater than or equal to 10 into its digits repeatedly until all remaining numbers are less than 10.

Wait, but the operation is to delete the element and insert its digits in the same position. So, for example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67], and I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. If I apply it to 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. If I apply it to 67, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

So, essentially, I can break down the array into an array of single digits and the remaining numbers that are less than 10. But, I don't have to break down all numbers; I can choose which ones to break down.

The goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. So, I need to check if, after performing any number of these operations, the array becomes sorted.

Let me look at the examples to understand better.

First test case:

4

12 3 45 67

The solution says YES, and in the note, it says that by splitting the first element, 12, into 1 and 2, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

Second test case:

3

12 28 5

The solution is NO, meaning there's no way to make it sorted by splitting any of the numbers.

Third test case:

2

0 0

It's already sorted, so YES.

So, I need to find a way to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting numbers as described.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider all possible ways of splitting the numbers and check if any of those resulting arrays are sorted. However, since the array can have up to 50 elements, and each element can be up to 99, which means splitting it into at most two digits, the number of possible combinations could be large, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, 50 elements, each can be split or not, so 2^50 possibilities, which is too much. That's not feasible to check all possibilities directly.

So, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider what happens when I split a number. For example, if I have [a, b], and a >= 10, and b < 10, and a > b, should I split a?

If I split a into its digits, and those digits are all less than or equal to b, then maybe it helps in sorting.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the relative order of the elements.

Let me consider the array as a sequence, and see where the sorted order is broken, and see if splitting any number in those positions can fix the issue.

So, I can iterate through the array and check where a[i] > a[i+1]. If I find such a pair, I need to see if splitting a[i] or a[i+1] can make a[i] <= a[i+1], or perhaps splitting both.

But it's not straightforward because splitting a number can affect the surrounding elements as well.

Maybe I need to consider the possible splits for each number and see how they can be arranged to make the array sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can flatten the array by splitting all numbers that are >=10 into their digits, and then check if the flattened array is sorted.

But that might not be sufficient because I don't have to split all numbers; I can choose which ones to split.

So, maybe there's a way to selectively split numbers to achieve the sorted order.

Let me consider that each number can be either kept as is or split into its digits, and I need to choose for each number which option to take to achieve a sorted array.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the maximum value so far, and decide for each element whether to split it or keep it.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that after splitting some numbers, the array consists of a sequence of digits and numbers less than 10.

Wait, actually, when you split a number, you insert its digits in place, so the array will end up consisting only of single-digit numbers, since any number >=10 can be split into its digits, which are single digits.

So, if I split all numbers >=10, the array will consist only of single digits, and I can check if that array is sorted.

But the problem allows me to choose which numbers to split, so I might not need to split all of them.

For example, in the first test case, splitting only the first number, 12, into 1 and 2, and keeping the rest as is, results in [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

So, in this case, not all numbers >=10 are split.

So, I need to find a selection of numbers to split such that the resulting array is sorted.

This seems complicated to implement directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the array, and whenever I find a[i] > a[i+1], I check if splitting a[i] or a[i+1] can resolve the issue.

If I split a[i], I need to consider its digits and see if they are <= a[i+1].

Similarly, if I split a[i+1], I need to see if its digits are >= a[i].

Wait, no.

Let's say I have a[i] and a[i+1], and a[i] > a[i+1].

If I split a[i], it becomes its digits, which are all <=9, and I need to ensure that the last digit of a[i] <= a[i+1].

Similarly, if I split a[i+1], it becomes its digits, and I need to ensure that the first digit of a[i+1] >= a[i].

But this seems too simplistic.

Maybe I need to consider more cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each number is a node, and I have edges based on whether one number can be placed before another after splitting.

But that might be overcomplicating things.

Let me look at the constraints again.

n can be up to 50, and a[i] can be up to 99.

So, the array can be reasonably small, and a[i] is at most two digits.

Given that, perhaps I can model the array as a sequence where each element can be either kept as is (if <10 or >=10 but not split), or split into its digits.

So, for each element, I have two choices: keep it as is (if <10 or choose not to split), or split it into its digits.

Wait, but if it's >=10, I can choose to split it or keep it.

If it's <10, I have to keep it as is.

So, for each a[i], if a[i] >=10, I have two options: keep it as is or split it into its digits.

If a[i] <10, I have only one option: keep it as is.

So, I can think of it as building a sequence where, for each a[i], I either keep it (if <10 or choose to keep it), or replace it with its digits.

Then, I need to check if there exists such a sequence that is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to track the possible maximum values up to each position.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's define dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the original array, and j is the maximum value in the modified array up to position i.

But j could be up to 99, and i up to 50, so that might not be efficient enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the possible maximum values up to each position.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the array and maintain a set of possible current values.

But that might be too slow.

Let me think of another approach.

Since n is small (n <=50), and a[i] <=99, maybe I can model this as a backtracking problem, where I try to build the sequence step by step, choosing for each a[i] whether to split it or keep it, and check if the resulting sequence is sorted.

But n=50 is too large for backtracking (2^50 possibilities).

So, I need a better way.

Let me consider that splitting a number a[i] into its digits will always result in digits <=9, whereas keeping it as is could be >=10.

So, in the modified array, there can be numbers >=10 only if I choose to keep some a[i] as is, provided that a[i] <10 or I choose to keep it.

Wait, if a[i] <10, I have to keep it as is; I can't split it.

If a[i] >=10, I can choose to split it into its digits or keep it as is.

In the final array, the elements can be either the original a[i] (if kept as is and a[i] <10 or chosen to keep it), or the digits of a[i] if split.

Now, to have the final array sorted in non-decreasing order, for any two consecutive elements, the earlier one should be <= the next one.

So, I need to choose for each a[i] whether to split it or keep it, such that the resulting sequence is sorted.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where I track the last value in the sequence and whether it's possible to reach that value.

Let me try to think of it in terms of dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the original array, and j is the last value in the modified sequence up to position i.

The state would be dp[i][j], which is true if it's possible to reach position i with the last value being j.

The answer would be whether there exists some j such that dp[n][j] is true and the sequence is sorted up to n.

But j can be up to 99, and n up to 50, so the state space is manageable.

Let me try to formalize the transitions.

Initialize dp[0][a[0]] = true, if a[0] <10 or choose to keep it.

If a[0] >=10, I can choose to split it into its digits, so dp[0][digit] = true for each digit in a[0].

Then, for each subsequent position i from 1 to n-1:

For each possible last value in dp[i-1][j]:

If a[i] <10, I must keep it, so I set dp[i][a[i]] = true if a[i] >= j.

If a[i] >=10, I can choose to keep it or split it.

If I keep it, set dp[i][a[i]] = true if a[i] >= j.

If I split it, set dp[i][digit] = true for each digit in a[i] if digit >= j.

This seems feasible.

At the end, I check if there exists some sequence where dp[n][last_value] is true for some last_value.

But implementing this might be a bit involved, and I need to manage a large state space.

Given the time constraints, perhaps there's a simpler way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that the operation allows me to replace any number >=10 with its digits, which are all <=9.

So, in the final array, any number >=10 must be kept as is, and any number that was >=10 but was split will be replaced by its digits, which are <=9.

Therefore, in the final array, numbers >=10 must be kept in their original positions and not split, and only numbers <10 can be present if they were originally <10 or if a number >=10 was split into its digits.

Wait, but if a number >=10 is split, it's replaced by its digits, which are <=9.

So, in the final array, any number >=10 must have been kept as is, and must be >= the previous number in the array.

But the previous number could be <=9, so I need to ensure that if I keep a number >=10, it's >= the previous number in the array.

Alternatively, if I split a number >=10, it's replaced by its digits, which are <=9, so the digits must be >= the previous number.

This seems a bit tangled.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Perhaps I can model the array as a sequence of possible insertions.

Starting with an empty array, I can consider each a[i] and decide whether to insert it as is (if <10 or choose to keep it), or split it into its digits and insert them.

I need to maintain the sorted order as I build the array.

But this seems similar to the dynamic programming approach I thought earlier.

Let me consider that any number >=10 can be split into its digits, which are <=9, or kept as is, if >=10.

So, in the final array, numbers >=10 must be kept as is, and numbers <=9 can be either original numbers <10 or digits from split numbers.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum value so far.

If I encounter a number that is >=10, I have a choice: keep it as is or split it.

If I keep it as is, it must be >= the maximum so far.

If I split it, its digits must be >= the maximum so far.

Wait, no. If I split it, its digits are inserted in place, and each digit must be >= the maximum so far.

But digits are <=9, so if the maximum so far is <=9, splitting is always possible, as digits are <=9.

Wait, no, to maintain sorted order, the digits must be >= the last element in the array so far.

So, if the maximum so far is <=9, and I split a number >=10, its digits must be >= the maximum so far.

If I keep the number >=10, it must be >= the maximum so far.

Similarly, if the maximum so far is >=10, and I choose to split a number >=10, its digits must be >= the maximum so far, which is >=10, but digits are <=9, so it's impossible unless the maximum so far is <=9.

Wait, but digits are <=9, so if the maximum so far is >9, I can't split a number >=10 because its digits are <=9, which are <10, so they wouldn't satisfy the sorted order.

Therefore, in such cases, I must keep the number >=10 as is, provided it's >= the maximum so far.

This seems like a key insight.

So, here's a plan:

- Iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum value so far.

- For each element:

- If it's <10:

- It must be >= the maximum so far.

- If it's >=10:

- Option 1: Keep it as is. In this case, it must be >= the maximum so far.

- Option 2: Split it into its digits. Each digit must be >= the maximum so far.

- But since digits are <=9, this is only possible if the maximum so far is <=9.

So, for each element:

- If a[i] <10:

- If a[i] >= current_max, proceed; else, it's impossible.

- If a[i] >=10:

- Option 1: Keep it as is. If a[i] >= current_max, it's valid.

- Option 2: Split it into digits. Each digit must be >= current_max, and digits are <=9.

- So, splitting is only possible if current_max <=9 and all digits of a[i] >= current_max.

- Choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

Initialize current_max = -infinity.

Iterate through the array:

- If a[i] <10:

- If a[i] >= current_max, set current_max = a[i]; else, it's impossible.

- If a[i] >=10:

- Option 1: Keep it as is.

- If a[i] >= current_max, then keep it, set current_max = a[i].

- Option 2: Split it into digits.

- If current_max <=9 and all digits of a[i] >= current_max, then split it, and set current_max = last digit of a[i].

- Choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted.

- If neither option is possible, it's impossible.

This seems like a viable approach.

Let me test this logic with the first test case:

n=4

a = [12, 3, 45, 67]

Initialize current_max = -infinity.

i=0, a[0]=12 >=10

Option 1: Keep it as is. 12 >= -infinity, so set current_max=12.

Option 2: Split it into 1 and 2. current_max <=9 is true (since -infinity <=9), and digits 1 and 2 >= -infinity. So, set current_max=2.

So, choose the option that leads to the smallest current_max, which is splitting to get current_max=2.

Proceed with current_max=2.

i=1, a[1]=3 <10

3 >=2, set current_max=3.

i=2, a[2]=45 >=10

Option 1: Keep it as is. 45 >=3, set current_max=45.

Option 2: Split into 4 and 5. current_max=3 <=9, and 4>=3 and 5>=3. So, set current_max=5.

Choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted. Since 5 <45, splitting leads to a smaller current_max, which might be better for future elements.

Proceed with current_max=5.

i=3, a[3]=67 >=10

Option 1: Keep it as is. 67 >=5, set current_max=67.

Option 2: Split into 6 and 7. current_max=5 <=9, and 6>=5 and 7>=5. Set current_max=7.

Again, choose the option that allows the array to remain sorted. Since both options are possible, choose the one that leads to the smallest current_max, which is splitting to get current_max=7.

Proceed with current_max=7.

End of array, so it's possible. Output YES.

This matches the first test case.

Now, second test case:

n=3

a=[12,28,5]

Initialize current_max=-infinity.

i=0, a[0]=12 >=10

Option 1: Keep it as is. 12 >= -infinity, set current_max=12.

Option 2: Split into 1 and 2. current_max=-infinity <=9, and 1>=-infinity and 2>=-infinity. Set current_max=2.

Choose splitting to get current_max=2.

Proceed with current_max=2.

i=1, a[1]=28 >=10

Option 1: Keep it as is. 28 >=2, set current_max=28.

Option 2: Split into 2 and 8. current_max=2 <=9, and 2>=2 and 8>=2. Set current_max=8.

Choose splitting to get current_max=8.

Proceed with current_max=8.

i=2, a[2]=5 <10

5 >=8 is false. Impossible.

So, output NO.

This matches the second test case.

Third test case:

n=2

a=[0,0]

Initialize current_max=-infinity.

i=0, a[0]=0 <10

0 >= -infinity, set current_max=0.

i=1, a[1]=0 <10

0 >=0, set current_max=0.

Possible. Output YES.

Matches the third test case.

Seems like this logic works.

Now, let's see the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

for p in range(1, len(list1)):

if not func_1(list1):

if list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] >10:

a = list1[p-1]

list1.pop(p-1)

list1.insert(p-1, a//10)

list1.insert(p, a%10)

if func_1(list1):

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

def func_1(lst):

sorted_lst = sorted(lst)

return lst == sorted_lst

So, the program reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and the array list1.

Then, it iterates from p=1 to len(list1)-1.

At each step, it checks if the current array is sorted using func_1.

If not, it checks if list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] >10.

If both conditions are true, it splits list1[p-1] into its digits by popping it and inserting a//10 and a%10 at positions p-1 and p.

Then, it checks again if the array is sorted using func_1 and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Wait, there are a few issues here.

First, the program only attempts to split list1[p-1] if list1[p-1] > list1[p] and list1[p-1] >10.

It does this for each p from 1 to len(list1)-1, but it doesn't ensure that the array is fully sorted in the end.

Moreover, it only attempts to split once and then checks if the array is sorted.

But according to the problem, you can perform the operation any number of times.

So, this program doesn't account for multiple splits.

Additionally, splitting a number into its digits might require multiple insertions if the number has more than one digit.

For example, splitting 45 should insert 4 and 5.

But in the code, it inserts a//10 and a%10, which for 45 would be 4 and 5, which is correct.

However, for numbers like 10, it would insert 1 and 0, which is also correct.

But the main issue is that it only attempts to split once and then checks if the array is sorted.

This might not be sufficient because multiple splits might be needed.

For example, consider [12, 3, 45, 67].

First, it checks p=1 (list1[0]=12, list1[1]=3).

12 > 3 and 12 >10, so it splits 12 into 1 and 2.

Now, list1 becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

So, it's correct in this case.

In the second test case, [12, 28, 5].

First, p=1: list1[0]=12, list1[1]=28.

12 <28, so no split.

p=2: list1[1]=28, list1[2]=5.

28 >5 and 28 >10, so split 28 into 2 and 8.

Now, list1 becomes [12, 2, 8, 5].

Is this sorted? No, because 12 >2.

So, it would print 'No', which is correct.

In the third test case, [0,0].

It's already sorted, so no splits needed, and it prints 'Yes'.

Seems correct.

But let's consider another test case to see if this logic holds.

Test case:

n=3

a=[15, 2, 30]

Initial array: [15, 2, 30]

Check p=1: 15 >2 and 15>10, so split 15 into 1 and 5.

Now, array is [1, 5, 2, 30]

Check if sorted: 1 <=5 <=2? No, because 5 >2.

So, it would print 'No'.

But is there a way to make it sorted?

If we split 15 into 1 and 5, and split 30 into 3 and 0, we get [1, 5, 2, 3, 0].

This is not sorted.

Alternatively, if we split only 15 into 1 and 5, and keep 30 as is, we get [1, 5, 30], which is sorted.

So, the program would print 'No' in this case, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is flawed.

It doesn't consider multiple splits or different combinations of splits.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation allows us to split any number that is at least 10 into its individual digits.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Operation**: For any number >= 10, we can choose to split it into its digits or keep it as is. Numbers less than 10 must be kept as is.
2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We need to track the maximum value up to each step and decide whether to split or keep the number based on this maximum value.
3. **Iterative Check**: Iterate through the array while maintaining the current maximum value. For each element, decide whether to split it or keep it based on the current maximum.

### Solution Code

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    n = len(a)
    i = 0
    current_max = -1
    while i < n:
        if a[i] < 10:
            if a[i] >= current_max:
                current_max = a[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                return False
        else:
            # Option 1: Keep as is
            if a[i] >= current_max:
                current_max = a[i]
                i += 1
                continue
            # Option 2: Split into digits
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
            if all(d >= current_max for d in digits):
                for d in digits:
                    if d >= current_max:
                        current_max = d
                    else:
                        return False
                i += 1
                continue
            # If neither option works
            return False
    return True

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with `current_max` set to -1.
2. **Iteration Through Array**:
   - For each element in the array:
     - If the element is less than 10, check if it is greater than or equal to `current_max`. If yes, update `current_max`; else, return False.
     - If the element is greater than or equal to 10:
       - **Option 1**: Keep the number as is. Check if it is greater than or equal to `current_max`. If yes, update `current_max` and proceed.
       - **Option 2**: Split the number into its digits. Check if all digits are greater than or equal to `current_max`. If yes, iterate through the digits, updating `current_max` for each digit.
       - If neither option allows the array to remain sorted, return False.
3. **Completion**: If the entire array is processed without issues, return True.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to split numbers to achieve a sorted array efficiently.
