Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower by adding or removing one cube at a time in a series of moves. The question is, after a certain number of moves, can he end up with exactly m cubes in the tower?

First, I need to understand the operations he can perform. In each move, he can either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. That means the tower's height can increase or decrease by one with each move.

I need to figure out if, after n moves, the tower can have exactly m cubes. Let's think about this step by step.

Starting from zero cubes, if he adds a cube in the first move, the tower has one cube. If he adds another cube, it has two, and so on. If he removes a cube instead, the height decreases by one, but since he starts with zero, removing a cube from an empty tower doesn't make sense. So, perhaps there's an implicit condition that he can't remove a cube if the tower is empty.

Wait, the problem says he removes exactly one cube from the top of the tower, assuming there is one there. So, he can't remove a cube if the tower is empty.

Okay, so he has to manage the sequence of adds and removes in such a way that, after n moves, the tower has m cubes.

Let's consider some examples to get a feel for this.

Example 1:

n = 3, m = 3

One possible sequence:

Add: 1

Add: 2

Add: 3

So, after three adds, the tower has three cubes. That works.

Is there any other sequence that could lead to three cubes?

Add, add, add: yes, as above.

Add, add, remove: 1, 2, 1 (ends with one cube)

Add, remove, add: 1, 0, 1

Add, remove, remove: 1, 0, -1 (but can't have negative cubes, so perhaps invalid)

Wait, but removing from an empty tower isn't allowed, so the last sequence isn't possible.

So, the only way to end up with three cubes is to add three times.

Example 2:

n = 2, m = 4

Let's see:

Starting with zero.

First move: add, now 1.

Second move: add, now 2.

Alternatively:

Add, add: 2

Add, remove: 1

Remove, add: invalid (can't remove from empty)

Remove, remove: invalid

So, possible tower heights after two moves: 2 or 1.

Cannot get to 4. So, "No".

Example 3:

n = 5, m = 3

Possible sequences:

Add five times: 1,2,3,4,5

Then, remove two times: 4,3

Wait, but in five moves, if I add four times and remove once:

Add, add, add, add, remove: 1,2,3,4,3

That's five moves resulting in three cubes.

Alternatively:

Add, add, add, remove, add: 1,2,3,2,3

Also ends with three cubes.

So, "Yes".

From these examples, it seems that as long as n >= m, it's possible to achieve m cubes by adding m times and then removing and adding as necessary.

Wait, but in the second example, n=2 and m=4, which would require n < m, and it's not possible.

So, perhaps the general rule is that if n >= m, then it's possible.

But let's think about another case.

Suppose n=1 and m=0.

Sequence:

Remove one cube. But starting from zero, remove is invalid.

Alternatively:

Add one cube, then remove one cube: but that's two moves, which is more than n=1.

So, only option is to add one cube, ending with one cube.

But m=0, so "No".

Wait, but according to n >= m, 1 >= 0, which would suggest "Yes", but actually "No".

Hmm, so there's an exception.

Another case: n=0, m=0.

No moves, tower has zero cubes: "Yes".

But n=0 is not allowed since n >=1 according to the constraints.

Wait, no, n can be 1 or more, up to 100.

Wait, looking back at the problem, it says 1 <= n, m <=100.

So, n cannot be zero.

Wait, no, the constraints are 1 <= n, m <=100.

So, n is at least 1.

In the earlier example, n=1, m=0: "No".

n=1, m=1: "Yes" (just add one cube).

n=2, m=1: "Yes" (add, add, remove; but wait, that's three moves.

Wait, no, with n=2:

Add, add: ends with two cubes.

Add, remove: ends with one cube.

Remove, add: invalid (can't remove from empty).

Remove, remove: invalid.

So, possible to end with one cube.

Wait, but in the earlier example, n=2, m=4: "No".

Wait, but according to n >= m, 2 >=1, which suggests "Yes", which matches.

But earlier I thought n >= m is the condition, but the n=2, m=4 is not possible.

So, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, maybe it's that n - m is even.

Because in the first example, n=3, m=3: n-m=0, which is even.

Second example, n=2, m=4: n-m=-2, which is even.

But in that case, it's "No".

Wait, but in the second example, n=2, m=4, n-m=-2, which is even, but it's not possible.

Wait, but if n-m is even, and n >= m, then "Yes".

In the first example, n=3, m=3: n-m=0, even, and n >= m: "Yes".

Second example, n=2, m=4: n-m=-2, even, but n < m: "No".

Third example, n=5, m=3: n-m=2, even, n >= m: "Yes".

Another example, n=1, m=0: n-m=1, odd, n >= m: "No".

Wait, but m=0 is not allowed since m >=1.

Wait, m can be 0 according to the constraints.

Wait, no, m >=1.

Wait, looking back, the problem says 1 <= n, m <=100.

So, m cannot be zero.

Wait, no, the note says m and n are at least 1.

But in the initial description, it says m is at least 1.

So, m >=1.

Therefore, in the earlier example with m=0, it's not allowed.

Wait, but in the sample input, m=0 is not present.

Wait, the constraints are t=1 to 100, n and m from 1 to 100.

So, m is at least 1.

Okay, so m >=1.

Back to the condition.

It seems that if n >= m and (n - m) is even, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, let's test this hypothesis.

First sample: n=3, m=3: n-m=0, even, n >= m: "Yes".

Second sample: n=2, m=4: n-m=-2, even, but n < m: "No".

Third sample: n=5, m=3: n-m=2, even, n >= m: "Yes".

Another test: n=4, m=2: n-m=2, even, n >= m: "Yes".

Another test: n=3, m=2: n-m=1, odd: "No".

Wait, but n=3, m=2:

Possible sequence:

Add, add, remove: 1,2,1

Add, remove, add: 1,0 invalid

Add, add, add: 1,2,3

So, possible heights: 1 or 3.

Cannot get to 2.

So, "No".

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

So, the correct condition is that n >= m and (n - m) is even.

Therefore, in the code, we need to check if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.

If both conditions are satisfied, then "Yes", else "No".

Looking at the given code:

kreker = int(input())

for i in range(kreker):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if n >= m:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

This code only checks if n >= m, and if so, prints "Yes", else "No".

But according to our reasoning, we need to check both n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0.

The given code doesn't check the parity of (n - m).

Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

For example, in the second sample input: n=2, m=4.

Here, n < m, so it correctly prints "No".

But for n=3, m=2, according to the code, n >= m, so it would print "Yes".

But as we saw, it's not possible to have m=2 with n=3 moves, because (n - m) is odd.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
