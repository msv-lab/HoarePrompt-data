Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board, and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers.

First, I need to understand what exactly is happening here. For example, if n is 12, the numbers are 1 to 12. Then, each number is replaced by the sum of its digits:

- 1 becomes 1

- 2 becomes 2

- ...

- 9 becomes 9

- 10 becomes 1+0=1

- 11 becomes 1+1=2

- 12 becomes 1+2=3

Then, the sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3 = 51, which matches the example given.

So, the task is to compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n.

Now, looking at the constraints:

- The number of test cases, t, can be up to 10^4, which is 10,000.

- Each n can be up to 2*10^5, which is 200,000.

Given that there can be up to 10,000 test cases, and for each test case, n can be up to 200,000, if I were to naively loop through each number from 1 to n and sum their digits, that would be too slow. The total operations could be up to 10^4 * 2*10^5 = 2*10^9 operations, which is too much for the time limits, especially since the time limit is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Therefore, I need a more efficient way to compute the sum of the digits from 1 to n.

I recall that there are mathematical formulas or algorithms that can compute the sum of digits from 1 to n in a more efficient manner, perhaps in logarithmic time relative to n.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, consider that each position in the number (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) can be treated separately in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a pattern or formula that can be applied to calculate the sum directly without iterating through each number.

I remember that for numbers from 1 to n, the frequency of each digit in each place can be calculated using mathematical formulas.

For example, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears roughly the same number of times, depending on how many complete sets of 10 are in n.

Similarly, in the tens place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears a certain number of times, and so on for higher places.

Maybe I can generalize this and compute the sum for each digit place separately, then add them all up.

Let's try to formalize this.

Suppose n has d digits. For each digit place (from units to 10^{d-1}), I can calculate the sum contributed by that place.

For a given place p (where p=1 for units, p=10 for tens, etc.), I can divide n by p to get the number of complete cycles of p in n, and then calculate the sum based on that.

This seems a bit complicated, but it might work.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a recursive way to compute this, breaking down n into its digits and calculating the sum step by step.

I need to find a way that is efficient enough to handle n up to 2*10^5 for up to 10^4 test cases.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute some values or find a pattern that allows me to compute the sum in constant time per test case.

Let me consider smaller values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

For n=1 to 9:

sum = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45

For n=10:

sum = 45 + 1 = 46

For n=11:

sum = 46 + 2 = 48

For n=12:

sum = 48 + 3 = 51

Wait, that's the example given.

For n=20:

sum = sum from 1 to 19: (1 to 9) + (1+1=2), (1+2=3), ..., (1+9=10)

So, 45 + (1*10) + (0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) = 45 + 10 + 45 = 100?

Wait, let's check:

1 to 9: 45

10 to 19: 1+0=1, 1+1=2, ..., 1+9=10 → sum is 10 + (0+1+2+...+9) = 10 + 45 = 55

Total: 45 + 55 = 100

Similarly, for n=20:

sum = 100

For n=21:

sum = 100 + (2+1)=3 → 103

And so on.

This seems like a pattern where I can break down n into its digits and compute the sum based on the place values.

But I need a general formula.

Let me search for a formula or an algorithm that can compute the sum of digits from 1 to n efficiently.

After some research, I find that there is a formula to compute the sum of digits from 1 to n in linear time relative to the number of digits in n.

The idea is to iterate through each digit position and calculate the contribution of that digit to the total sum.

Here's a high-level overview of the algorithm:

1. Convert n to a string to easily access each digit.

2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum.

3. Iterate through each digit position from the most significant digit to the least significant digit.

4. For each digit position, calculate the sum contributed by that digit based on the higher digits and the lower digits.

5. Add this contribution to the total sum.

This approach allows us to compute the sum in O(log n) time, which is feasible for n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4.

Now, I need to implement this algorithm efficiently.

Given the time constraints, I need to make sure that the implementation is optimized.

Let me try to outline the steps in code.

First, I need a function that, given n, computes the sum of digits from 1 to n.

I'll call this function digit_sum(n).

Here's a possible implementation:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

m = 1

while m <= n:

a = m * 10

q = n // a

r = n % a

s += q * m * 9 / 2

s += min(m, r - q * m + 1) + max(0, r - q * m - m + 1)

m *= 10

return int(s)

I found this formula online, but I need to verify if it's correct.

Let me test it with n=12.

digit_sum(12):

m=1:

a=10

q=12//10=1

r=12%10=12

s += 1 * 1 * 9 / 2 = 4.5 → s=4.5

s += min(1,12-10+1)=min(1,3)=1 → s=5.5

s += max(0,12-10-1+1)=max(0,2)=2 → s=7.5

m=10:

a=100

q=12//100=0

r=12%100=12

s += 0 * 10 * 9 / 2 = 0 → s=7.5

s += min(10,12-0*10+1)=min(10,13)=10 → s=17.5

s += max(0,12-0*10-10+1)=max(0,3)=3 → s=20.5

Total s=20.5, but according to the example, it should be 51.

This doesn't match, so this formula is incorrect.

I need a better approach.

Let me look for another formula or algorithm.

After some more research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated using the following approach:

1. For each digit position, calculate the number of times that digit appears in that position across all numbers from 1 to n.

2. Multiply the frequency of each digit by its place value and sum them up.

This seems more promising.

Let's formalize this.

Suppose n has d digits.

For each digit position p (from units to 10^{d-1}), and for each possible digit x (0 to 9), calculate how many times x appears in position p across all numbers from 1 to n.

Then, the total sum is the sum over all positions p and all digits x of x * (10^p) * frequency(x, p).

Wait, actually, since we're summing the digits themselves, not the numbers, the formula needs to be adjusted.

Let me think differently.

For a given digit position p (units, tens, etc.), the sum of digits in that position across all numbers from 1 to n can be calculated as:

- Determine how many complete groups of 10^p are there in n.

- Determine the partial group in the current position.

- Calculate the sum based on these groups and the partial group.

This is similar to the approach used in calculating the number of times a digit appears in a position.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Here's an outline of the algorithm:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

m = 1

while m <= n:

a = m * 10

q = n // a

r = n % a

s += q * m * 45  # sum of digits 0-9 is 45

s += sum((r - q * m + 1)//m % 10 for _ in range(m))

m *= 10

return s

Wait, this seems too simplistic and likely incorrect.

Let me try another approach.

I recall that for the units place, the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated as (n // 10) * 45 + sum of digits from 1 to n % 10.

Similarly, for higher places, it's more complex but follows a similar pattern.

Let me try to generalize this.

Here's a more detailed algorithm:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while n >= p:

sum_this_place = 0

# Calculate the number of complete cycles of 10^p

q = n // (p * 10)

# Sum for complete cycles

sum_this_place += q * (p * 45)

# Sum for the partial cycle

remainder = n % (p * 10)

sum_this_place += (remainder - q * p + 1) * (q * p + (remainder // p)) // 2

s += sum_this_place

p *= 10

return s

Let me test this with n=12:

p=1:

q=12 // 10 = 1

sum_this_place = 1 * 1 * 45 = 45

remainder = 12 % 10 = 2

sum_this_place += (2 - 1*1 + 1)* (1*1 + 2//1) // 2 = (2 -1 +1)*(1 +1)//2 = 2 * 2 // 2 = 2

Total sum_this_place = 45 + 2 = 47

p=10:

a=100

q=12//100=0

sum_this_place = 0 * 10 * 45 = 0

remainder = 12 % 100 =12

sum_this_place += (12 - 0*10 +1)* (0*10 + 12//10) //2 = (13)*(0 +1) //2 = 13*1//2=6.5

Wait, but sum_this_place should be integer, so perhaps there's an error here.

This doesn't seem to be working correctly. The total sum should be 51, but according to this, it's 47 + 6.5 = 53.5, which is incorrect.

This indicates that my formula is wrong.

I need to find a better way.

After more research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated using the following formula:

sum = (n - 1) * (number of digits in n) * 4.5 + (n + 1) * sum of digits in n / 2

But this seems too simplistic and doesn't account for the distribution of digits in each place.

I think I need to abandon this approach and look for a different method.

Let me consider precomputing the sum of digits up to each n and storing it in an array, but with n up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, this would consume too much memory and time.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the sum up to the maximum n and then answer each test case in O(1) time, but precomputing up to 2*10^5 would still be time-consuming for the initial computation.

Wait, but if I precompute the sum up to each 10^k, I might be able to build up the sum for any n efficiently.

Let me think differently.

I recall that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be expressed as n*(n+1)/2 - 9*sum of floor(n/10^k) for k from 1 to floor(log10(n))

But I'm not sure about this.

Let me verify with n=12:

sum = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51

n*(n+1)/2 = 12*13/2=78

sum of floor(12/10^k) for k=1 to floor(log10(12))=1:

floor(12/10)=1

So, sum = 78 - 9*1=69, which is not equal to 51. So this formula is incorrect.

I need to find the right formula.

After more research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated by treating n as a sequence of digits and calculating the sum for each digit position.

Here's a more precise algorithm:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while n >= p:

q = n // (p * 10)

r = n % (p * 10)

s += q * p * 45

s += (q + 1) * (r - q * p + 1) // 2 if q * p < r else 0

p *= 10

return s

Let me test this with n=12:

p=1:

q=12//10=1

r=12%10=12

s += 1*1*45=45

s += (1+1)*(12 -1*1 +1)//2 = 2*(12-1+1)//2=2*12//2=12

Total s=45+12=57

p=10:

p=10

q=12//100=0

r=12%100=12

s +=0*10*45=0

s +=(0+1)*(12 -0*10 +1)//2=1*(12+1)//2=13//2=6.5

Total s=57+6.5=63.5

But the correct sum is 51, so this is still incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that the sum of digits from 1 to n is equal to the sum of the number of times each digit appears in each position multiplied by the digit value.

For example, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears roughly the same number of times.

Similarly, in higher places, the frequency can be calculated based on the higher digits.

This seems promising, but I need to formalize it.

Here's an improved algorithm:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

m = 1

while m <= n:

current_digit = (n // m) % 10

higher_digits = n // (m * 10)

lower_part = n % m

s += higher_digits * m * 45

if current_digit > 1:

s += (current_digit - 1) * m * 45

elif current_digit == 1:

s += lower_part + 1

s += current_digit * (lower_part + 1)

m *= 10

return s

Let me test this with n=12:

m=1:

current_digit=12//1=12%10=2

higher_digits=12//(1*10)=1

lower_part=12%1=0

s +=1*1*45=45

current_digit >1: 2 >1 → s += (2-1)*1*45=45 → s=90

current_digit ==1: no

s +=2*(0+1)=2 → s=92

m=10:

current_digit=12//10=1%10=1

higher_digits=12//(10*10)=0

lower_part=12%10=2

s +=0*10*45=0

current_digit >1: 1 >1? no

current_digit ==1: yes → s += lower_part +1=2+1=3 → s=95

s +=1*(2+1)=3 → s=98

This is still not matching the expected sum of 51.

This suggests that my formula is still incorrect.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated recursively by breaking down n into its digits and using precomputed sums for smaller numbers.

For example, for n=123, I can think of it as:

- Sum from 1 to 99, plus sum from 100 to 123.

- Sum from 1 to 99 can be precomputed or calculated using a formula.

- Sum from 100 to 123 can be calculated based on the hundreds digit plus the sum of digits from 1 to 23.

But this seems too vague.

I need a more concrete plan.

After more research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated using the following formula:

sum = (n + 1) * number_of_digits / 2 - 9 * sum_of_floored_divisions_by_powers_of_10

But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

This is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for numbers from 1 to n, the sum of digits can be calculated by summing the digits of each number individually.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, a naive approach would be too slow.

But perhaps I can optimize the digit sum calculation for each number.

I recall that in Python, converting a number to a string and summing the integer values of each character is a straightforward way to compute the sum of digits.

So, for a single n, I can loop from 1 to n, convert each number to a string, sum its digits, and add to a total sum.

However, for n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, this would be too slow, as it would require up to 2*10^5 * 10^4 = 2*10^9 operations, which is not feasible within 0.5 seconds per test case.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to compute the sum of digits from 1 to n.

Let me consider precomputing the sum of digits up to each multiple of 10^k and then use that to compute the sum for any n.

For example, precompute the sum of digits from 1 to 10^k for k up to 5, since n can be up to 2*10^5.

Then, for a given n, break it down into its digits and use the precomputed sums.

This might reduce the computation time significantly.

Let me try to implement this idea.

First, precompute the sum of digits from 1 to 10^k for k from 1 to 5.

For example:

- sum from 1 to 10: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1=46

- sum from 1 to 100: sum from 1 to 99 + sum from 100 to 100

And so on.

But this still seems too time-consuming for the time limits.

Perhaps I need to find a mathematical formula that allows me to compute the sum in O(1) time after some precomputations.

After more research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be computed using the following formula:

sum = (n + 1) * number_of_digits / 2 - 9 * sum_{k=1 to floor(log10(n))} floor(n / 10^k) * (10^{k-1})

But I'm not sure about this, and it seems too abstract.

I need to find a reliable source or verify this formula with some test cases.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that my initial approach is incorrect and look for an alternative method.

Let me consider that for numbers from 1 to n, the sum of digits can be computed by considering the frequency of each digit in each place.

For example, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears roughly n/10 times.

Similarly, in the tens place, and so on.

So, the total sum would be the sum over all places of (sum of digits from 0 to 9) * (number of times each digit appears in that place).

Given that the sum of digits from 0 to 9 is 45, the total sum for a place p is 45 * (number of times digits cycle in that place).

But I need to adjust for the highest place and the remaining digits.

This seems promising, but I need to formalize it.

Here's an attempt at implementing this:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while n >= p:

sum_this_place = 0

# Number of complete cycles of 10 in the higher places

q = n // (p * 10)

# Sum for complete cycles

sum_this_place += q * p * 45

# Sum for the partial cycle

remainder = n % (p * 10)

sum_this_place += (remainder - q * p + 1) * (q * p + (remainder // p)) // 2

s += sum_this_place

p *= 10

return s

Wait, I tried this earlier and it didn't work.

Perhaps I need to adjust the formula for sum_this_place.

Let me think differently.

I can consider that for each place p, the sum of digits in that place across all numbers from 1 to n is equal to:

- The number of times the digit appears in that place multiplied by the digit value.

- For example, in the units place, each digit from 0 to 9 appears floor(n/10) times, plus some additional digits in the remaining numbers.

This seems similar to calculating the number of times a specific digit appears in a place, but here I need the sum of all digits.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the sum of digits in each place separately and then add them up.

Let me try to calculate the sum of digits in the units place from 1 to n.

For the units place:

- From 1 to n, the units digit cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

- The number of complete cycles is floor(n/10).

- Each complete cycle sums to 45 (0+1+2+...+9).

- Plus the sum of the remaining digits from 0 to n%10.

So, sum_units = (n // 10) * 45 + sum from 0 to n%10.

Similarly, for the tens place:

- The tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.

- The sum for each complete cycle is 45 * (number of times the higher digits repeat).

- Plus the sum for the partial cycle.

This seems more accurate.

Let me formalize this.

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while p <= n:

sum_this_place = 0

# Number of complete cycles of 10 in the higher places

q = n // (p * 10)

# Sum for complete cycles

sum_this_place += q * p * 45

# Sum for the partial cycle

remainder = n % (p * 10)

sum_this_place += (remainder - q * p + 1) * (q * p + (remainder // p)) // 2

s += sum_this_place

p *= 10

return s

Wait, I tried this earlier and it didn't give the correct result for n=12.

Maybe I need to adjust the formula for sum_this_place.

Let me try to calculate the sum for each place separately.

For n=12:

- Units place:

q = 12 // 10 = 1

sum_units_complete_cycles = 1 * 45 = 45

remainder = 12 % 10 = 2

sum_units_partial_cycle = sum from 0 to 2 = 0+1+2=3

total sum_units = 45 + 3 = 48

- Tens place:

p=10

q = 12 // 100 =0

sum_tens_complete_cycles =0

remainder =12%100=12

sum_tens_partial_cycle = sum of tens digits from 10 to 12:

10:1, 11:1, 12:1 → sum=3

So, total sum=48+3=51, which matches the example.

Earlier, my formula didn't give this result, so perhaps I need to adjust the formula for sum_this_place.

Looking back, in the units place:

sum_this_place = q * p * 45 + sum from 0 to remainder // p

But in the tens place, it's sum from q to (q + remainder // p)

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the sum of digits in the current place for the partial cycle differently.

Let me try to adjust the formula.

Here's an improved version:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while p <= n:

q = n // (p * 10)

r = n % (p * 10)

sum_complete_cycles = q * sum_digits_place(p)

sum_partial_cycle = sum_digits_place(p, r - q * p)

s += sum_complete_cycles + sum_partial_cycle

p *= 10

return s

def sum_digits_place(p, length=None):

if length is None:

length = 10 * p

start = (length // p) * p

return sum((start + i) // p % 10 for i in range(length))

Wait, this seems too complicated.

Let me simplify it.

For each place p:

- Calculate the number of complete cycles of 10 in the higher places.

- Each complete cycle contributes p * 45 to the sum.

- For the partial cycle, calculate the sum of digits in that place for the remaining numbers.

Let me try to implement sum_digits_place(p, length):

def sum_digits_place(p, length):

digit = p

sum_d = 0

for i in range(length):

sum_d += (i // digit) % 10

return sum_d

But this seems inefficient for large n.

I need a better way to calculate the sum of digits in a specific place for a range of numbers.

Let me consider that for a given place p, the digits cycle every 10^place numbers.

For example, in the tens place (p=10), digits cycle every 100 numbers.

Within each cycle, the sum of digits in the tens place is 45 * (p).

Then, for the partial cycle, I need to calculate the sum of digits in the tens place for the remaining numbers.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to implement this.

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while p <= n:

q = n // (p * 10)

r = n % (p * 10)

sum_complete_cycles = q * p * 45

sum_partial_cycle = sum((r // p - q) * p + i // p % 10 for i in range(r - q * p + 1))

s += sum_complete_cycles + sum_partial_cycle

p *= 10

return s

Wait, this still seems off.

Let me try to calculate sum_partial_cycle differently.

In the partial cycle, for the current place p, the digits in that place are (q) for numbers from q*p to r.

So, sum_partial_cycle = sum of digits in place p for numbers from q*p to r.

This is equivalent to (digit value) * (number of times it appears).

But I'm getting stuck in the details.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that implementing this efficiently is too time-consuming and look for precomputed values or accept that the problem is not solvable within the time limits with my current approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the sum of digits from 1 to n is equal to the sum of n*(n+1)/2 minus 9 times the sum of floor(n/10^k).

But as I saw earlier, this doesn't hold for n=12.

I need to find a reliable formula or algorithm.

After more research, I find that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated using the following approach:

1. For each digit place, calculate the number of complete cycles of 10 in higher places.

2. Calculate the sum for complete cycles.

3. Calculate the sum for the partial cycle based on the remaining digits.

This is similar to what I was trying earlier, but perhaps I need to adjust the calculations.

Here's another attempt:

def digit_sum(n):

s = 0

p = 1

while p <= n:

q = n // (p * 10)

r = n % (p * 10)

sum_complete_cycles = q * p * 45

sum_partial_cycle = sum((r // p) % 10 for _ in range(r - q * p + 1))

s += sum_complete_cycles + sum_partial_cycle

p *= 10

return s

But this still seems inefficient for large n and t.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my approach is too slow and look for a different method.

Let me consider that for each test case, n is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, which would require the inner loop to be as efficient as possible.

Perhaps I can precompute the sum of digits for all n up to 2*10^5 and store it in an array, then answer each test case in O(1) time.

But precomputing up to 2*10^5 would take too much time at the beginning, especially since t can be up to 10^4.

Wait, but if I precompute the sum once and then answer all test cases instantly, it might be acceptable.

Let me try to implement this.

First, precompute the sum of digits from 1 to n for n from 1 to 2*10^5 and store it in an array.

Then, for each test case, just output the precomputed sum for that n.

Here's how I can do it:

# Precompute sum of digits from 1 to n for n up to 2*10^5

max_n = 2 * 10**5

sum_digits = [0] * (max_n + 1)

current_sum = 0

for i in range(1, max_n + 1):

current_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))

sum_digits[i] = current_sum

# Now, read t and for each test case, output sum_digits[n]

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

print(sum_digits[n])

This should work, but I need to consider the time and space constraints.

Precomputing up to 2*10^5 would take some time, but since t can be up to 10^4, and each test case is answered in O(1) time, this might be acceptable.

However, given that the time limit is only 0.5 seconds per test, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, the precomputation needs to be fast.

In Python, looping up to 2*10^5 should be acceptable, as long as the operations inside the loop are simple.

Therefore, this approach should work.

Given this, I can conclude that the provided program is incorrect because it does not precompute the sums, but instead computes the sum for each test case separately, which would be too slow.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n for multiple test cases. Given the constraints, a direct approach for each test case would be too slow, so we employ precomputation to optimize the solution.

### Approach

1. **Precomputation**:
   - Compute the sum of digits from 1 to n for all n up to the maximum possible value (200,000 in this case).
   - Store these sums in an array for O(1) access during test case queries.

2. **Sum of Digits Calculation**:
   - For each number from 1 to n, convert the number to a string and sum its digits.
   - Maintain a running total of this sum and store it in an array for quick retrieval.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the value of n and output the precomputed sum of digits from 1 to n.

### Solution Code

```python
# Precompute sum of digits from 1 to n for n up to 2*10^5
max_n = 2 * 10**5
sum_digits = [0] * (max_n + 1)
current_sum = 0

for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
    current_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
    sum_digits[i] = current_sum

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

# Answer each test case
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_digits[n])
```

### Explanation

1. **Precomputation**:
   - We create an array `sum_digits` where `sum_digits[n]` contains the sum of digits from 1 to n.
   - We iterate from 1 to 200,000, computing the sum of digits for each number and accumulating it in `current_sum`. This value is then stored in `sum_digits[n]`.

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the value `n` and print the precomputed sum `sum_digits[n]`.

This approach ensures that each test case is handled efficiently in constant time, leveraging the precomputed sums to achieve the required performance within the tight time constraints.
