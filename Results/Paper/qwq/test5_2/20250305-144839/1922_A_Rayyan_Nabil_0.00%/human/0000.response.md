Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t, which is also a string of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template, meaning that there should be at least one position where it doesn't satisfy the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to ensure that:

1. For each position i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

2. If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Actually, for c to not match the template, there should be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

But for a and b to match the template, they must satisfy the conditions for matching for all positions.

So, I need to choose t in such a way that:

- For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, no. For t[i] being uppercase, the conditions are:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Because for c to not match, it must fail at least one position. So, for the positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i], which violates the condition for matching.

But actually, for c to not match the template, it's sufficient if there's at least one position where it fails, even if in other positions it matches.

But to ensure that c does not match, I need to make sure that there is at least one position where c fails to match, while a and b match at all positions.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think in terms of choosing t[i] for each position i independently, based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me consider each position independently.

For each position i, I have to choose whether t[i] should be lowercase or uppercase, and what specific letter it should be.

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase.

- Then, t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be different from t[i].

- So, t[i] = a[i] = b[i], and c[i] != a[i].

- Therefore, for this choice to be possible, a[i] must be equal to b[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i].

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase.

- Then, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- Since t[i] is uppercase, lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i].

- So, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- This implies that lowercase(t[i]) must be different from a[i] and b[i], and equal to c[i].

- Therefore, t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase of t[i].

- We need a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- So, lowercase(t[i]) must be equal to c[i], and a[i] and b[i] must be different from c[i].

- Therefore, t[i] can be any uppercase letter corresponding to c[i], i.e., t[i] = c[i].upper(), provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Wait, but a[i] and b[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]), which is c[i].

So, for this choice to be possible:

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

In summary, for each position i, I have two options:

1. Choose t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i] (which must equal b[i]), and c[i] != a[i].

2. Choose t[i] as uppercase equal to c[i].upper(), provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Moreover, for the template to be valid, all positions must be chosen in such a way that a and b match the template, and c does not match it.

But c must not match the template, which means that there must be at least one position where c fails to match the template.

However, in the first case, where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], that position already causes c to not match.

In the second case, where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), that position also causes c to not match.

So, if I choose t[i] in either of these ways for all positions, c will not match the template at those positions.

But the problem requires that c does not match the template, which is already satisfied by the choices above.

Therefore, the template exists if and only if, for each position i, at least one of the two options is possible.

That is:

- For each position i:

- Either a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], allowing t[i] to be lowercase equal to a[i].

- Or a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], allowing t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) equal to c[i].

If both conditions fail for any position i, then it's impossible to choose t[i] in a way that satisfies the requirements, and hence the answer is "NO".

Otherwise, if for every position i at least one of the two conditions holds, then the answer is "YES".

Wait, but in the second case, t[i] being uppercase requires that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

So, to rephrase:

For each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then we can choose t[i] as lowercase equal to a[i].

- Else, if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then we can choose t[i] as uppercase equal to c[i].upper().

- If neither of these is true, then it's impossible to choose t[i] appropriately, and the answer is "NO".

Therefore, to determine if such a template exists, we need to check, for each position i, whether at least one of these two conditions holds:

1. a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

If for all positions i, at least one of these conditions holds, then the answer is "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Let me test this logic with the example provided.

Example 1:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Check position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? "a" == "b"? No.

- c[1] != a[1]? "c" != "a"? Yes.

- So, check if a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1]: "a" != "c" and "b" != "c"? Yes.

- Therefore, can choose t[1] as uppercase "C".

- Hence, "YES".

Example 2:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? "a" == "b"? No.

- c[1] != a[1]? "a" != "a"? No.

- a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1]? "a" != "a" (No) and "b" != "a" (Yes). Since both need to be true, it's No.

- So, cannot choose t[1] in any valid way.

Therefore, "NO".

Wait, but according to the example output, it's "NO".

Example 3:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

I need to check for each position i from 1 to 10:

For each position, see if either:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- or a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

If for any position, neither condition holds, then "NO"; else, "YES".

Looking at the example output, it's "YES", so presumably, for all positions, at least one of the conditions holds.

Example 4:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Check each position:

Position 1:

- a[1] == b[1]? "a" == "a"? Yes.

- c[1] != a[1]? "a" != "a"? No.

- a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1]? "a" != "a" (No) and "a" != "a" (No). Both are false.

- So, neither condition holds for position 1.

Therefore, "NO".

Which matches the example output.

So, my logic seems consistent with the examples.

Now, to implement this, I need to iterate through each position i from 0 to n-1, and check for each position if at least one of the two conditions holds.

If for all positions, at least one condition holds, then "YES"; else, "NO".

In the code provided, it seems to be attempting something similar, but I need to verify.

Looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

l = 'YES'

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

l = 'YES'

else:

l = 'NO'

print(l)

This seems incorrect.

In this code, for each test case, it initializes l to 'YES'.

Then, for each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], it sets l to 'YES'.

- Else, it sets l to 'NO'.

- Then, it prints l immediately.

This seems wrong because:

- It should check for all positions before deciding 'YES' or 'NO'.

- Currently, it's printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each position, which is not desired.

- It should check for each position and only if all positions satisfy at least one of the conditions, then print 'YES'; else, 'NO'.

So, the given code is incorrect.

The correct approach should be:

- For each test case:

- Read n, a, b, c.

- Initialize a flag to True.

- For each position i from 0 to n-1:

- If neither of the two conditions holds:

- a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- Then set flag to False and break.

- After checking all positions, if flag is True, print 'YES'; else, 'NO'.

Wait, but actually, for "YES", we need that for all positions, at least one of the two conditions holds.

So, I need to check if for all positions i, at least one of the two conditions holds.

In other words, for any position i, if both conditions fail, then it's "NO"; otherwise, "YES".

So, in code, I can iterate through all positions, and if I find any position where both conditions fail, then set the answer to 'NO'.

Otherwise, it's 'YES'.

That's a better way to implement it.

Let me think about it step by step.

For each position i:

- Condition 1: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Condition 2: a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- If neither condition holds, then it's impossible to choose t[i] appropriately, so answer is 'NO'

- Else, continue to the next position.

If all positions satisfy at least one condition, then 'YES'.

So, in code:

for each test case:

flag = True

for each position i:

if not ( (a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]) or (a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]) ):

flag = False

break

if flag:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

This seems correct.

Now, comparing this to the given code:

def func():

t = int(input())

l = 'YES'

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

l = 'YES'

else:

l = 'NO'

print(l)

This is incorrect because:

- It's printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each position, which is not what we want.

- We need to check all positions and then decide 'YES' or 'NO' based on all of them.

- Also, it's using a single variable l to store the result, but it's being overwritten in each iteration.

- So, it will only consider the last position's result, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
