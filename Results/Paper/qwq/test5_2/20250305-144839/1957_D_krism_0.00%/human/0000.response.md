Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the number of tuples (x, y, z) where 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n, and f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) is greater than f(x, z). Here, f(l, r) is the XOR of all elements from a_l to a_r.

First, I need to understand what f(x, y) represents. It's the XOR of elements from a_x to a_y. Similarly, f(y, z) is the XOR from a_y to a_z, and f(x, z) is the XOR from a_x to a_z.

So, the condition is f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z).

I recall that XOR has some properties that might be useful here. For instance, XOR is associative and commutative, which could help in simplifying the expression.

Let me try to simplify f(x, y) XOR f(y, z). Since f(x, y) is a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y, and f(y, z) is a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z, then f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) would be:

(a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

Since XOR is associative and commutative, and XORing a value with itself cancels out, this simplifies to:

a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

Wait a minute, that's exactly f(x, z). So f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = f(x, z).

But according to the problem, the condition is f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) > f(x, z), which based on this simplification would be f(x, z) > f(x, z). That can only be true if f(x, z) > f(x, z), which is impossible because they are equal.

Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the XOR expression.

Let me double-check:

f(x, y) = a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y

f(y, z) = a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

So, f(x, y) XOR f(y, z) = (a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

When I XOR these two, the a_y terms should cancel out, right? So, it should be a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let's consider an example.

Suppose x=1, y=2, z=3, and the array is [6,2,4].

Then, f(1,2) = 6 XOR 2 = 4

f(2,3) = 2 XOR 4 = 6

f(1,3) = 6 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 0

So, f(1,2) XOR f(2,3) = 4 XOR 6 = 2, which is greater than f(1,3) = 0. So, 2 > 0 is true.

In this case, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) is not equal to f(x,z), as per my earlier simplification. So, my simplification must be wrong.

Let me try to re-express f(x,y) XOR f(y,z):

f(x,y) = a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y

f(y,z) = a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

So, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = (a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y) XOR (a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z)

Using the property that XOR is associative and commutative, and that A XOR A = 0, the a_y terms should cancel out if y > x.

Wait, in the example above, y=2, and x=1, so y > x, and indeed, a_y appears in both f(x,y) and f(y,z), so it should cancel out.

So, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

Which is effectively f(x,z) XOR a_y.

Wait, because f(x,z) = a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

So, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = f(x,z) XOR a_y

Is that correct?

Let me verify with the example:

f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = 4 XOR 6 = 2

f(x,z) XOR a_y = 0 XOR 2 = 2

Yes, that matches.

So, the condition becomes f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

So, f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

I need to find the number of tuples (x,y,z) where x ≤ y ≤ z, and f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

Now, f(x,z) is the XOR of elements from x to z, and a_y is one of those elements.

I need to find when f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

Let me think about what f(x,z) XOR a_y represents.

f(x,z) = a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

f(x,z) XOR a_y = (a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z) XOR a_y

Since XOR is associative and commutative, and a_y XOR a_y = 0, this simplifies to:

a_x XOR a_{x+1} XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

Which is f(x,z) without a_y.

So, f(x,z) XOR a_y = f(x,y-1) XOR f(y+1,z)

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of binary representation.

Let me consider the binary representation of f(x,z) and f(x,z) XOR a_y.

f(x,z) XOR a_y can be seen as flipping the bits of f(x,z) where a_y has 1s.

So, f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z) when the highest bit where f(x,z) XOR a_y and f(x,z) differ is set to 1 in f(x,z) XOR a_y.

This is similar to the concept in binary numbers where flipping a bit from 0 to 1 increases the value, while flipping from 1 to 0 decreases it.

So, for f(x,z) XOR a_y to be greater than f(x,z), there must be a position k (starting from the most significant bit) where:

- In f(x,z), the k-th bit is 0

- In f(x,z) XOR a_y, the k-th bit is 1

- All higher bits are equal

In other words, the k-th bit is the first bit from the left where f(x,z) and f(x,z) XOR a_y differ, and in f(x,z) XOR a_y, that bit is 1.

Given that f(x,z) XOR a_y is obtained by flipping the bits of f(x,z) where a_y has 1s, this means that for the k-th bit to change from 0 to 1 in f(x,z) XOR a_y, a_y must have a 1 in that position, and f(x,z) must have a 0 there.

Moreover, for all higher bits, a_y must have 0s, or the bits must be such that they don't cause flipping in those positions.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

I need to count the number of triples (x,y,z) with x ≤ y ≤ z such that f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

Let me fix y and see how I can compute the number of valid (x,z) pairs for each y.

For a fixed y, I need to count the number of x ≤ y and y ≤ z such that f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

Given that f(x,z) = f(x,y-1) XOR f(y,z), but I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute prefix XORs to compute f(x,z) efficiently.

Let me define prefix[X] where prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

Similarly, a_y can be obtained directly from the array.

So, for each y, I can iterate over z ≥ y and compute f(x,z) as prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], and compare it with f(x,z) XOR a_y.

But this seems inefficient for large n, as n can be up to 10^5 per test case, and T can be up to 10^4, but the total n across all test cases is 10^5.

So, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Maybe I can think in terms of the binary representation and count the number of tuples based on the bit positions where f(x,z) XOR a_y differs from f(x,z).

Let me consider the binary representation of f(x,z) and f(x,z) XOR a_y.

As mentioned earlier, f(x,z) XOR a_y flips the bits of f(x,z) where a_y has 1s.

So, to have f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z), there must be at least one bit position where f(x,z) has 0 and f(x,z) XOR a_y has 1, and all higher bits are equal.

This is similar to the condition for one number being greater than another in binary representation.

But this seems a bit too low-level. Maybe there's a higher-level approach.

Let me consider that f(x,z) XOR a_y is equal to f(x,y-1) XOR f(y+1,z), assuming y is between x and z.

Wait, perhaps not directly helpful.

Another idea: since XOR is involved, maybe I can look for patterns or properties of XOR that can help in counting the number of tuples.

Let me think about the example provided:

For n=3, arr=[6,2,4]

The tuples are:

(1,2,2): f(1,2)=6 XOR 2=4, f(2,2)=2, f(1,2)=4 → 4 XOR 2=6 >4 (True)

(1,1,3): f(1,1)=6, f(1,3)=6 XOR 2 XOR 4=0 → 6 XOR 6=0 >0 (False, but in the explanation it says True? Wait, maybe I miscalculated)

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

(1,1,3): (a1) XOR (a1 XOR a2 XOR a3)=6 XOR 0=6 >0 (True)

Wait, perhaps I miscomputed f(x,z). Let's see:

f(1,1)=6

f(1,3)=6 XOR 2 XOR 4=0

So, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z)=f(1,1) XOR f(1,3)=6 XOR 0=6 >0 (True)

Ok, got it.

Another tuple: (1,2,3): f(1,2)=4, f(2,3)=2 XOR 4=6, 4 XOR 6=2 >0 (True)

And (1,3,3): f(1,3)=0, f(3,3)=4, 0 XOR 4=4 >0 (True)

So, there are 4 such tuples in the first test case.

In the second test case with n=1, arr=[3], there's only one tuple (1,1,1):

f(1,1)=3, f(1,1)=3, 3 XOR 3=0 >3? 0>3 is False, so no tuples.

In the third test case, n=5, arr=[7,3,7,2,1], and it says there are 16 such tuples.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to think of a way to count the number of tuples where f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

I need to iterate over all possible y from 1 to n, and for each y, iterate over x from 1 to y and z from y to n, and check if f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

But this would be O(n^3), which is too slow for n up to 10^5.

I need a better approach.

Let me see if I can precompute prefix XORs to make f(x,z) computation O(1).

Define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, for given x and z, f(x,z) can be computed in O(1) time.

Similarly, a_y is directly accessible.

So, for each y, I need to count the number of x ≤ y and z ≥ y such that (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a_y) > (prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1])

Let me denote c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

Then, the condition is c XOR a_y > c

So, for each y, I need to count the number of pairs (x,z) where x ≤ y and z ≥ y such that c XOR a_y > c, where c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

This still seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me fix y and a_y, and consider c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] = f(x,z)

I need to count the number of c where c XOR a_y > c

Let me think about the condition c XOR a_y > c

This condition depends on the binary representation of c and a_y.

Specifically, the XOR will flip the bits of c where a_y has 1s.

So, for c XOR a_y to be greater than c, there must be at least one bit position where a_y has a 1 and c has a 0, and no higher bit position where a_y has a 1 and c has a 1.

Wait, more carefully:

In binary numbers, flipping a bit from 0 to 1 increases the value, while flipping from 1 to 0 decreases it.

So, for c XOR a_y to be greater than c, the highest bit where c and c XOR a_y differ must be set to 1 in c XOR a_y.

This means that in the binary representation, starting from the most significant bit, the first bit where a_y has a 1 and c has a 0.

All higher bits must be equal in c and c XOR a_y, meaning that a_y has 0s in those positions.

So, a_y must have a single 1 bit, and c must have 0 in that position.

But a_y can have multiple 1 bits.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the bit positions where a_y has 1s and c has 0s.

Actually, for c XOR a_y > c, it's sufficient that the highest set bit in a_y where c has a 0 is higher than any bit where c has a 1 and a_y has a 1.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can iterate over the bit positions and count for each bit whether flipping it would result in c XOR a_y > c.

But this seems too slow for the constraints.

Let me think about another approach.

I recall that XOR has some properties related to linear algebra over GF(2), but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the binary representation of a_y and c.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion or some mathematical formula can be derived.

Let me consider that for a fixed y and a_y, I need to count the number of c where c XOR a_y > c.

This is equivalent to counting the number of c where c XOR a_y - c > 0, which simplifies to c & a_y < a_y.

Wait, not sure about that.

Alternatively, c XOR a_y > c is equivalent to c XOR a_y - c > 0.

But c XOR a_y - c is equal to c XOR a_y + (~c) +1, which might not be straightforward.

This seems too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that c XOR a_y > c is equivalent to c < c XOR a_y.

So, I need to count the number of c where c < c XOR a_y.

Given that c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], and prefix is a prefix XOR array, I can think of c as all possible XORs of subarrays.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I can consider that c can be any possible XOR of subarrays from the array, and for each y, I need to count how many such c satisfy c < c XOR a_y.

But again, this doesn't directly help.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to find the number of tuples (x,y,z) with x ≤ y ≤ z such that f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) > f(x,z)

But earlier, I thought that f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = f(x,z) XOR a_y

Wait, perhaps I can use this equality to reformulate the condition.

So, f(x,y) XOR f(y,z) = f(x,z) XOR a_y

Therefore, the condition is f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

So, I need to count the number of (x,y,z) with x ≤ y ≤ z where f(x,z) XOR a_y > f(x,z)

Given that f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], and a_y is known, perhaps I can group by f(x,z) and a_y.

But this still seems unclear.

Let me consider fixing y and a_y, and then considering all possible x and z such that x ≤ y and z ≥ y.

Then, c = f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

So, for a fixed y and a_y, I need to count the number of c where c XOR a_y > c

This seems similar to counting the number of c where c < c XOR a_y

I need a way to count how many c satisfy this condition for each y.

But directly iterating over all possible x and z for each y would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider precomputing all possible c for a fixed y, that is, all possible prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] for x ≤ y and z ≥ y.

Wait, x ≤ y and z ≥ y.

So, x can range from 1 to y, and z can range from y to n.

So, prefix[x-1] can be any prefix from prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and prefix[z] can be any prefix from prefix[y] to prefix[n].

Therefore, c can be any XOR of subarrays where the subarray starts before y and ends after y.

Wait, not exactly.

Actually, c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], where x ≤ y and z ≥ y.

So, prefix[x-1] is from the prefix up to x-1, which is before y, and prefix[z] is from y to z.

So, c is effectively the XOR from x-1 to z.

Wait, no.

c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] is the XOR from x to z.

Wait, but x ≤ y ≤ z.

So, c = f(x,z) is the XOR from x to z, which includes y.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, and a_y is known.

Then, for x ≤ y and z ≥ y, c = f(x,z) = f(x,y-1) XOR a_y XOR f(y+1,z)

Because f(x,z) = f(x,y-1) XOR a_y XOR f(y+1,z)

Wait, is that correct?

Let me see:

f(x,z) = a_x XOR ... XOR a_{y-1} XOR a_y XOR a_{y+1} XOR ... XOR a_z

Which is f(x,y-1) XOR a_y XOR f(y+1,z)

Yes, that's correct.

So, c = f(x,z) = f(x,y-1) XOR a_y XOR f(y+1,z)

Now, f(x,y-1) depends on x, and f(y+1,z) depends on z.

Since x ≤ y and z ≥ y, f(x,y-1) can be any prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[y-1], and f(y+1,z) can be any prefix[z] XOR prefix[y]

Wait, perhaps I need to redefine the prefixes.

Let me define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, f(x,y-1) = prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[x-1]

And f(y+1,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[y]

So, c = f(x,y-1) XOR a_y XOR f(y+1,z) = (prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[x-1]) XOR a_y XOR (prefix[z] XOR prefix[y])

Simplifying this:

= prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a_y XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y]

But prefix[y] = prefix[y-1] XOR a_y

So, prefix[y] = prefix[y-1] XOR a_y

Therefore, c = prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a_y XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y]

Substituting prefix[y] = prefix[y-1] XOR a_y:

c = prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a_y XOR prefix[z] XOR (prefix[y-1] XOR a_y)

Simplify:

c = prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a_y XOR prefix[z] XOR prefix[y-1] XOR a_y

Now, prefix[y-1] XOR prefix[y-1] = 0

a_y XOR a_y = 0

So, c = prefix[x-1] XOR prefix[z]

Wait, that's interesting.

So, c = f(x,z) = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

Which is consistent with the initial definition.

So, going back, for a fixed y, I need to count the number of (x,z) with x ≤ y and z ≥ y such that prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] XOR a_y > prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1]

Let me denote p = prefix[x-1], q = prefix[z]

Then, q XOR p XOR a_y > q XOR p

This seems similar to before.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that p and q are independent, and I can iterate over y, and for each y, iterate over p in the range prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and q in the range prefix[y] to prefix[n]

Then, for each y, I can consider p and q independently.

But this might still be too slow.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how it affects the comparison.

I need to find a way to count the number of (p,q) pairs where q XOR p XOR a_y > q XOR p

Is there a way to count such pairs efficiently?

Let me consider that q XOR p is a value, and I need to see if XORing it with a_y increases its value.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over the bits of a_y and determine the impact on q XOR p.

Let me consider the highest set bit in a_y.

Let’s say the highest set bit in a_y is at position k (0-indexed from the least significant bit).

Then, for q XOR p XOR a_y to be greater than q XOR p, the bit at position k must be flipped from 0 to 1 in q XOR p XOR a_y, and all higher bits must remain the same.

Wait, actually, in binary numbers, the first bit from the left that differs determines which number is larger.

So, for q XOR p XOR a_y to be greater than q XOR p, the first bit from the left where q XOR p XOR a_y differs from q XOR p must be set to 1 in q XOR p XOR a_y.

This bit must be set in a_y, and in q XOR p, it must be 0.

Moreover, for all higher bits, q XOR p and q XOR p XOR a_y must be equal, meaning that a_y has 0s in those bits.

So, effectively, the highest set bit in a_y must be a bit where q XOR p has 0.

This seems complex to implement directly.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that q XOR p is some value c.

Then, c XOR a_y > c if and only if the leading bit that is different between c and c XOR a_y is set to 1 in c XOR a_y.

This is equivalent to saying that the highest bit where a_y has a 1 and c has a 0 is higher than any bit where a_y has a 1 and c has a 1.

This seems too involved for a straightforward implementation.

Maybe I need to look for a different way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that for a fixed y, and a_y, I need to count the number of c where c XOR a_y > c.

This is equivalent to counting c where c < c XOR a_y.

I need to count the number of c where c < c XOR a_y.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

Suppose a_y has its highest set bit at position k.

Then, for c XOR a_y to be greater than c, c must have a 0 at position k, and no higher bit should be affected in a way that decreases the value.

Wait, in binary numbers, if you flip a bit at position k from 0 to 1, and all higher bits are unchanged, then c XOR a_y will be greater than c.

Similarly, if you flip a bit at position k from 1 to 0, c XOR a_y will be less than c.

But in this case, a_y can have multiple bits set, so it's not just flipping one bit.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think about the number of c where c XOR a_y > c.

This seems similar to the number of c where c < c XOR a_y.

Perhaps I can iterate over the bits of a_y and count the number of c that satisfy this condition based on the bits of a_y.

Let me consider that a_y has some bits set, and for each set bit, I can determine how it affects c.

This seems promising.

Let me consider that a_y has bit k set.

Then, for c XOR a_y to be greater than c, c must have bit k unset (0), and for all higher bits set in a_y, c must have them unset as well.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the bits in order from the most significant to the least significant.

Let me try to iterate over the bits from high to low.

Find the highest set bit in a_y, say bit k.

Then, for c XOR a_y to be greater than c, c must have bit k unset (0), and for all bits higher than k, c must be equal in c and c XOR a_y, meaning that a_y has 0s in those bits.

Wait, but k is the highest set bit in a_y, so there are no higher bits set in a_y.

Therefore, for c XOR a_y to be greater than c, c must have bit k unset (0).

Then, the number of such c is equal to the number of c where bit k is 0.

Given that, for a fixed y and a_y, I can find the highest set bit in a_y, say bit k, and count the number of c where c's bit k is 0.

This seems manageable.

So, for each y, I can find the highest set bit in a_y, say k, and then count the number of c where c's bit k is 0.

Given that c = prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1], and x ≤ y and z ≥ y, I need to count the number of pairs (x,z) where prefix[z] XOR prefix[x-1] has bit k unset (0).

Wait, but prefix[x-1] ranges over x from 1 to y, and prefix[z] ranges over z from y to n.

So, for a fixed y and k, I need to count the number of pairs (p,q) where p is in prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and q is in prefix[y] to prefix[n], such that q XOR p has bit k unset (0).

Wait, but I need q XOR p to have bit k as 0 for c = q XOR p to satisfy c XOR a_y > c, which requires that bit k is 0 in c.

So, I need to count the number of (p,q) pairs where (q XOR p) & (1 << k) == 0.

This seems manageable.

Let me denote that (q XOR p) & (1 << k) == 0.

This is equivalent to (q XOR p XOR mask) == mask, where mask = (1 << k) - 1.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the k-th bit.

I need q XOR p to have the k-th bit as 0.

Which means that q and p must have the same value in the k-th bit.

Because q XOR p has bit k as 0 only if q and p have the same bit value in bit k.

So, q and p must have the same value in bit k.

Therefore, for each y and k (the highest set bit in a_y), I need to count the number of pairs (p,q) where p and q have the same value in bit k, where p is in prefix[0..y-1] and q is in prefix[y..n].

This can be computed by counting, for each possible value of bit k in p and q.

Let me define:

- Let pre[k][0] be the number of p where p's bit k is 0.

- pre[k][1] be the number of p where p's bit k is 1.

- Similarly, suf[k][0] be the number of q where q's bit k is 0.

- suf[k][1] be the number of q where q's bit k is 1.

Then, the number of pairs (p,q) where p and q have the same bit k is:

pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]

So, for each y and k, the number of valid (p,q) pairs is pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], where k is the highest set bit in a_y.

Wait, but pre[k][0] and suf[k][0] need to be computed for each y.

But in reality, p and q are prefix values, and they can overlap if y is not fixed properly.

Wait, no, p is prefix[x-1] for x from 1 to y, which are prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and q is prefix[z] for z from y to n, which are prefix[y] to prefix[n].

So, for a fixed y, p comes from prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and q comes from prefix[y] to prefix[n].

So, for each y, I can compute pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for p in prefix[0..y-1], and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for q in prefix[y..n].

Then, for each y, and for k being the highest set bit in a_y, the number of valid (p,q) is pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]

Finally, sum over all y of this value should give the total number of tuples.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to compute pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for each y, and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for each y.

I can precompute suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for all y by iterating from n to 1, and pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for all y by iterating from 1 to n.

Then, for each y, I can get pre[k][0] and suf[k][0], and pre[k][1] and suf[k][1], and compute the product.

Wait, but k depends on y, specifically on a_y.

So, for each y, I need to find the highest set bit in a_y, which is k, and then use pre[k][0], pre[k][1], suf[k][0], suf[k][1] for that k.

This seems manageable.

I need to make sure that for each y, I can find k quickly.

I can precompute k for each y by finding the highest set bit in a_y.

In code, I can use a_y.bit_length() - 1 to find k.

Wait, but bit_length() returns the position of the highest set bit, starting from 0.

So, k = (a_y.bit_length() - 1) if a_y > 0 else 0.

I need to handle a_y = 0 carefully, but in this problem, a_i >=1, so a_y >=1.

Wait, no, a_i >=1 is not specified. In the problem statement, a_i >=1 is given.

So, a_y >=1, so k is always >=0.

Ok, proceed.

So, in summary, the plan is:

1. Compute prefix[0..n], where prefix[0] = 0, prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] XOR a_i.

2. For each bit position k from 0 to 31 (since a_i can be up to 10^9), compute:

- pre[k][0]: number of p in prefix[0..y-1] where p's k-th bit is 0.

- pre[k][1]: number of p in prefix[0..y-1] where p's k-th bit is 1.

- suf[k][0]: number of q in prefix[y..n] where q's k-th bit is 0.

- suf[k][1]: number of q in prefix[y..n] where q's k-th bit is 1.

3. For each y from 1 to n:

- Find k = highest set bit in a_y.

- Add pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] to the answer.

4. Output the total answer for each test case.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to compute pre[k][0], pre[k][1], suf[k][0], suf[k][1] for all y efficiently.

I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1:

- p is only prefix[0] = 0, so for k from 0 to 31, prefix[0] has 0 in all bits, so pre[k][0] =1, pre[k][1]=0 for all k.

Then, for y from 1 to n:

- For each y, p is prefix[0] to prefix[y-1].

- q is prefix[y] to prefix[n].

- For each y, I need to update pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] by including prefix[y-1].

- Similarly, update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by excluding prefix[y].

But this seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, I can precompute suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y from 1 to n by first initializing suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1, where p is prefix[0] to prefix[0], and q is prefix[1] to prefix[n].

Wait, perhaps it's better to precompute suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for all y from 1 to n by iterating from y=n downto 1.

Similarly, pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y from 1 to n by iterating from y=1 to n.

Let me try to outline the steps in code-like pseudocode:

Initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1:

for k in 0 to 31:

if prefix[0] & (1<<k):

pre[k][1] +=1

else:

pre[k][0] +=1

Then, for y from 2 to n:

for k in 0 to 31:

if prefix[y-1] & (1<<k):

pre[k][1] +=1

else:

pre[k][0] +=1

Similarly, initialize suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1:

for k in 0 to 31:

for z in y to n:

if prefix[z] & (1<<k):

suf[k][1] +=1

else:

suf[k][0] +=1

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

Wait, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can initialize suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1 by considering all q from prefix[y] to prefix[n].

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, no, I can precompute suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1, which includes all q from prefix[1] to prefix[n].

Then, as y increases, I can update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by removing prefix[y].

Similarly, pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] can be built by adding prefix[y-1] as y increases.

Wait, perhaps I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1, where p is only prefix[0].

Then, for y from 2 to n, I add prefix[y-1] to pre[k][0] or pre[k][1], depending on its k-th bit.

Similarly, initialize suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1, which includes q from prefix[1] to prefix[n].

Then, for y from 2 to n, I remove prefix[y-1] from suf[k][0] or suf[k][1], depending on its k-th bit.

This way, for each y, pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] include p from prefix[0] to prefix[y-1], and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] include q from prefix[y] to prefix[n].

This seems efficient, as it's O(n * 32) per test case, which is acceptable since n <=1e5 and T <=1e4, but total n across all test cases is 1e5.

So, in code, I can do:

for each test case:

read n, read a[1..n]

compute prefix[0..n]

initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1:

for k in 0 to 31:

if prefix[0] & (1<<k):

pre[k][1] +=1

else:

pre[k][0] +=1

initialize suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1:

for k in 0 to 31:

for z in y to n:

if prefix[z] & (1<<k):

suf[k][1] +=1

else:

suf[k][0] +=1

Then, for y from 1 to n:

k = highest set bit in a_y

ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]

Then, for y from 2 to n:

update pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] by adding prefix[y-1]

update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by removing prefix[y-1]

Wait, but in the above, for y from 1 to n, I need pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for p in prefix[0..y-1], and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for q in prefix[y..n].

So, for y=1, p is prefix[0], q is prefix[1] to prefix[n].

For y=2, p is prefix[0] to prefix[1], q is prefix[2] to prefix[n].

...

For y=n, p is prefix[0] to prefix[n-1], q is prefix[n] to prefix[n] (only prefix[n]).

So, I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1, which is only prefix[0].

Then, for y from 2 to n, I add prefix[y-1] to pre[k][0] or pre[k][1], and remove prefix[y-1] from suf[k][0] or suf[k][1].

Wait, no, for y from 2 to n:

- pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] need to include prefix[y-1]

- suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] need to exclude prefix[y-1]

So, I can loop y from 1 to n:

compute ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], where k is the highest set bit in a_y

then, for y from 2 to n:

update pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] by adding prefix[y-1]

update suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] by removing prefix[y-1]

Wait, but in this way, for y=1, pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] are for p=prefix[0], and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] are for q=prefix[1] to prefix[n].

Then, for y=2, pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] are for p=prefix[0] to prefix[1], and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] are for q=prefix[2] to prefix[n].

And so on.

This seems correct.

In code, I can initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1, then for each y from 1 to n, compute the contribution, and then update pre and suf for y+1.

Wait, but I need to update pre and suf before moving to the next y.

Wait, perhaps it's better to initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1, and suf[k][0] and suf[k][1] for y=1 (q from prefix[1] to prefix[n]).

Then, for y from 1 to n:

k = highest set bit in a_y

ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]

then, for y from 2 to n:

add prefix[y-1] to pre[k][0] or pre[k][1]

remove prefix[y-1] from suf[k][0] or suf[k][1]

This way, for y from 1 to n, I have the correct pre and suf for each y.

Wait, but in this way, when y increases, I need to add prefix[y-1] to pre and remove it from suf.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in code, I can do:

for test_case in range(T):

read n

read a[1..n]

compute prefix[0..n]

initialize pre[k][0] and pre[k][1] for y=1:

for k in 0 to 31:

if prefix[0] & (1<<k):

pre[k][1] +=1

else:

pre[k][0]
