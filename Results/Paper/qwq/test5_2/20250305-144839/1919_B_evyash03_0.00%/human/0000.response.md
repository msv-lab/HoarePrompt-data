Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in a way that minimizes the total penalty. The penalty for each substring is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

First, I need to understand how the array 'a' is constructed from the string 's'. It says that each "+" in the string corresponds to a 1 in the array, and each "-" corresponds to a -1. So, for example, if s is "++-", then a would be [1, 1, -1].

The task is to split this array 'a' into non-empty subarrays, and for each subarray, calculate its penalty, which is |sum of the subarray| multiplied by its length. Then, sum up all these penalties, and I need to find the minimum possible total penalty by choosing the optimal way to split the array.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

Only one possible split: [1]

Penalty = |1| * 1 = 1

In the second test case:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

One possible split: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])

Each penalty is | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty = 5

Another possible split: ([-1, -1, -1, -1, -1])

Penalty = | -5 | * 5 = 25, which is worse.

So, the minimal penalty is 5.

In the third test case:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+ -"

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

One possible split: ([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])

Let's calculate the penalties:

First subarray: [1, -1, 1, -1] sum = 0, |0| * 4 = 0

Second subarray: [1, -1] sum = 0, |0| * 2 = 0

Total penalty = 0 + 0 = 0

This seems optimal.

So, the goal is to split the array in such a way that the sum of the penalties is minimized.

I need to find a general approach to minimize the total penalty.

Let me think about the properties of the sum and the length.

The penalty for a subarray is |sum| * length.

I need to minimize the sum over all subarrays of |sum| * length.

One idea is to make the sum of each subarray as close to zero as possible, since the absolute value of the sum is being multiplied by the length.

In particular, if a subarray has a sum of zero, its penalty is zero, which is ideal.

So, I should try to split the array into subarrays where each subarray has a sum of zero, if possible.

However, depending on the sequence of + and -, this might not always be possible.

In the third test case, it was possible to split into subarrays with sum zero.

In the second test case, all elements are -1, so any subarray will have a negative sum, and the best is to split into single-element subarrays.

In the first test case, only one element, so no choice.

I need to find a way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

Maybe I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum total penalty for the subarray a[0 to i-1].

Then, dp[0] = 0 (empty subarray)

For dp[i], I can consider all possible splits where the last subarray ends at index i-1.

So, for each j from 0 to i-1, consider splitting at j, meaning the last subarray is a[j to i-1].

Compute the penalty for a[j to i-1], which is |sum(a[j to i-1])| * (i - j)

Then, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |sum(a[j to i-1])| * (i - j))

Finally, the answer is dp[n]

This seems correct, but it's O(n^2), which for n=5000 would be too slow since n^2=25,000,000 operations.

I need a faster approach.

Let me see if I can find a way to compute this more efficiently.

First, let's think about the sum of a subarray a[j to i-1].

Define prefix sums:

prefix[i] = sum of a[0 to i-1]

Then, sum(a[j to i-1]) = prefix[i] - prefix[j]

So, the penalty is |prefix[i] - prefix[j]| * (i - j)

Therefore, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |prefix[i] - prefix[j]| * (i - j))

This seems similar to some dynamic programming problems involving prefix sums.

But O(n^2) is too slow for n=5000.

I need to find a way to optimize this DP.

Let me consider the structure of the DP transition.

For each i, I need to choose j that minimizes dp[j] + |prefix[i] - prefix[j]| * (i - j)

Letâ€™s denote l = i - j

So, j = i - l

Then, the penalty is |prefix[i] - prefix[j]| * l + dp[j]

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Another approach: try to group the + and - in a way that the sum of each group is as close to zero as possible.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to group them.

Let me consider that each + is +1 and each - is -1.

So, the sum of a subarray is the number of + minus the number of - in that subarray.

The penalty is the absolute value of this sum multiplied by the length of the subarray.

I need to minimize the total penalty.

Perhaps I can think in terms of balancing the number of + and - in each subarray.

If I can make the number of + equal to the number of - in a subarray, the sum is zero, and the penalty is zero.

So, the ideal situation is to have subarrays where the number of + equals the number of -.

But this may not always be possible, especially if the total number of + and - are not equal.

In such cases, I need to minimize the imbalance, i.e., minimize the absolute difference between the number of + and - in each subarray, multiplied by the length of the subarray.

Let me consider the entire array.

Suppose I have k '+' and m '-' in the array.

The total sum is k - m.

I need to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of penalties is minimized.

I need to find a way to group the elements to minimize the total penalty.

Another idea: try to maximize the number of subarrays with sum zero.

But again, I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

n=1

s="+"

a=[1]

Only one subarray: [1]

Penalty: |1| * 1 = 1

Total penalty: 1

Example 2:

n=5

s="-----"

a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]

Possible splits:

- Five subarrays of one element each: penalty 1*5=5

- One subarray: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1], sum=-5, length=5, penalty=25

- Two subarrays: e.g., [-1,-1,-1], [-1,-1], penalties: | -3 | * 3 + | -2 | * 2 = 9 + 4 = 13

The minimal is 5.

Example 3:

n=6

s="+-+-+ -"

a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1]

Split into [1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1], both with sum zero, total penalty zero.

Another split: [1,-1],[1,-1],[1,-1], same total penalty zero.

Example 4:

n=10

s="--+++++++ -"

a=[-1,-1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,-1]

Let's see:

One possible split: [--], [+++++++], [-], penalties:

|--| * 2 = 2*2=4

|+++++++| * 7 = 7*7=49

| - | * 1 = 1*1=1

Total: 4 + 49 + 1 = 54

Another split: [--+++++++], [-], penalties:

Sum of [--+++++++]: -1 -1 +1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = -2 +7 = 5, length=9, penalty=5*9=45

Sum of [-]: -1, length=1, penalty=1*1=1

Total: 45 + 1 = 46

Another split: [--+++++++] and [-], same as above.

But the example output is 4, so there must be a better way to split.

Wait, perhaps split into [--+++++++] and [-], but that gives 45 + 1 = 46, which is worse than 54.

Wait, maybe split differently.

Wait, perhaps split into [--], [++++++], [+ -], penalties:

|--| * 2 = 2

|++++++| * 6 = 6

|+ -| * 2 = 0

Total: 2 + 6 + 0 = 8

Still not 4.

Wait, perhaps another split: [--++], [++++], [+ -], penalties:

Wait, maybe I'm missing a better split.

Let me look back at the example output: 4

How can I get a total penalty of 4?

Perhaps split into two subarrays: [--++++++ -]

Sum: -1 -1 +1+1+1+1+1+1+1 -1 = -2 + 7 -1 = 4, penalty=4*9=36

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is achieved when the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.

In other words, minimize the absolute sum multiplied by the length.

I need to find a way to split the array such that the sum of each subarray is either minimized or zero if possible.

But in the third example, it was possible to have sum zero for each subarray.

In the second example, since all are "-", the minimal penalty is achieved by splitting into single elements.

In the fourth example, it's not clear how to achieve a penalty of 4.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let me look back at the fourth test case:

n=10

s="--+++++++ -"

So, s = ['-', '-', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '+', '-']

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Total sum: -1 -1 +7 -1 = 4

To achieve a total penalty of 4, perhaps there's a way to split the array such that the sum of penalties is 4.

Wait, maybe split into two parts: [--+++++++] and [-], with penalties:

[--+++++++]: sum=-1 -1 +7=5, penalty=5*9=45

Wait, that's not 4.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the minimal penalty is achieved by splitting into subarrays where the sum is minimized in some specific way.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to group the pluses and minuses.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that each '+' contributes +1 to the sum, and each '-' contributes -1.

So, the sum of a subarray is the number of '+' minus the number of '-' in that subarray.

The penalty is the absolute value of this sum multiplied by the length of the subarray.

I need to minimize the total penalty.

Let me consider that in a subarray, if the number of '+' is equal to the number of '-', the sum is zero, and the penalty is zero.

So, ideally, I would like to split the array into subarrays where the number of '+' equals the number of '-'.

However, this may not always be possible, especially if the total number of '+' and '-' are not equal.

In such cases, I need to minimize the imbalance, i.e., minimize |'+' - '-'| * length for each subarray.

Let me think about dynamic programming again.

Define dp[i] as the minimal total penalty for the first i characters.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible j < i and compute dp[j] + penalty for the subarray from j to i.

The penalty for the subarray from j to i is |sum from j to i| * (i - j)

sum from j to i is the number of '+' minus the number of '-' from j to i.

Let me define prefix_plus[i] as the number of '+' in the first i characters.

Similarly, prefix_minus[i] as the number of '-' in the first i characters.

Then, sum from j to i is (prefix_plus[i] - prefix_plus[j]) - (prefix_minus[i] - prefix_minus[j]) = (prefix_plus[i] - prefix_minus[i]) - (prefix_plus[j] - prefix_minus[j])

Let me define prefix_diff[i] = prefix_plus[i] - prefix_minus[i]

Then, sum from j to i is prefix_diff[i] - prefix_diff[j]

So, penalty from j to i is |prefix_diff[i] - prefix_diff[j]| * (i - j)

Therefore, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |prefix_diff[i] - prefix_diff[j]| * (i - j))

This is similar to the original DP formulation.

But n=5000, and n^2 is too slow.

I need to optimize this.

Let me see if I can find a way to compute dp[i] without iterating over all j < i.

Is there a way to group j's based on prefix_diff[j]?

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a fixed prefix_diff[j], the term |prefix_diff[i] - prefix_diff[j]| * (i - j) + dp[j] needs to be minimized.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for each possible difference value, I can keep track of the minimal dp[j] + adjustment terms.

This sounds like it might be amenable to a convex hull optimization or some kind of slope trick.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that it's optimal to split the array at positions where prefix_diff changes in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I can look for positions where prefix_diff is the same, because then the sum of the subarray between those positions would be zero.

So, if I can group the array into segments where the prefix_diff is the same at the start and end, then the sum of that segment is zero, and the penalty is zero.

But, prefix_diff can be different at different positions.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of positions where prefix_diff is the same, and split between those positions.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have positions where prefix_diff is equal to some value k.

Between two such positions, the sum of the subarray is zero, so the penalty is zero.

So, if I can group the array into such segments where between two positions with the same prefix_diff, the sum is zero.

However, this may not cover all possible optimal splits, because there might be subarrays with non-zero sum that are better to include in a larger subarray.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have positions where prefix_diff is the same.

Then, the sum of the subarray between those positions is zero, so the penalty is zero.

So, I can group the array into such segments and have zero penalty for those segments.

But, if prefix_diff doesn't repeat, then I need to handle those parts differently.

Wait, but in reality, prefix_diff can be any integer between -n and +n, so it's possible to have multiple positions with the same prefix_diff.

Let me consider an example.

Take the fourth test case:

s = "--+++++++ -"

prefix_diff:

Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

s: _ - - + + + + + + + + -

prefix_diff: 0 -1 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 4

So, prefix_diff values:

Positions where prefix_diff is -2: position 2

Positions where prefix_diff is -1: positions 1 and 3

Positions where prefix_diff is 0: positions 0, 4

Positions where prefix_diff is 1: position 5

Positions where prefix_diff is 2: position 6

Positions where prefix_diff is 3: position 7

Positions where prefix_diff is 4: positions 8 and 10

Positions where prefix_diff is 5: position 9

So, positions with prefix_diff=-2: 2

prefix_diff=-1: 1,3

prefix_diff=0: 0,4

prefix_diff=1:5

prefix_diff=2:6

prefix_diff=3:7

prefix_diff=4:8,10

prefix_diff=5:9

So, between positions 0 and 4, prefix_diff is 0, so sum is zero.

Between positions 8 and 10, prefix_diff is 4, so sum is zero.

But positions 4 to 8 have prefix_diff from 0 to 4, which is a sum of 4.

Position 10 to end has prefix_diff from 4 to 4, sum is zero.

Wait, but position 10 is the end.

Wait, perhaps I can split at positions where prefix_diff repeats.

So, split at positions 0 and 4, and positions 8 and 10.

So, subarrays:

- [0 to 3]: sum is prefix_diff[4] - prefix_diff[0] = 0 - 0 = 0, penalty 0*4=0

- [4 to 7]: sum is prefix_diff[8] - prefix_diff[4] = 4 - 0 = 4, penalty 4*4=16

- [8 to 9]: sum is prefix_diff[10] - prefix_diff[8] = 4 - 4 = 0, penalty 0*2=0

Total penalty: 0 + 16 + 0 = 16

But the example output is 4, which is less than 16.

So, this approach is not optimal.

Wait, maybe I need to consider overlapping or different groupings.

Wait, perhaps I can split at positions where prefix_diff is the same, but in a different way.

Let me consider splitting into subarrays where the sum is as close to zero as possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal possible penalty.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the minimal penalty is achieved by having subarrays with minimal |sum| * length.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a subarray with a given sum, the minimal penalty is achieved when the subarray is as short as possible.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a subarray with a certain sum, the penalty is |sum| * length.

If I can split the subarray into smaller parts, the sum would be distributed, but it might not necessarily minimize the total penalty.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for a subarray with sum S and length L, splitting it into two parts with sums A and B, the total penalty would be |A| * L1 + |B| * L2, where L1 + L2 = L.

I need to see if |A| * L1 + |B| * L2 < |S| * L.

This depends on the values of A, B, L1, L2.

It's not clear.

Perhaps it's better to consider that if S = A + B, and L = L1 + L2, then |A| * L1 + |B| * L2 vs |A + B| * (L1 + L2)

It's not obvious which one is smaller.

In some cases, splitting can reduce the total penalty, in others, it can increase it.

So, I need a way to decide where to split.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about another approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is achieved when the sum of each subarray is either 0 or as small as possible.

So, I should try to make each subarray's sum as close to zero as possible.

In the third test case, it was possible to have sum zero for each subarray.

In the second test case, all elements are '-', so the minimal penalty is achieved by having single-element subarrays with sum -1 and penalty 1 each.

In the first test case, only one element, so penalty 1.

In the fourth test case, the example output is 4, but I'm getting higher penalties.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of '-' in the string.

Wait, in the second test case, all '-' so penalty is 5.

In the first test case, one '+', penalty is 1.

In the third test case, three '+' and three '-', penalty is 0.

In the fourth test case, 7 '+' and 3 '-', penalty is 4.

Wait, 3 '-'.

Wait, but 3 '-' would suggest penalty 3, but the example output is 4.

Wait, n=10, s="--+++++++ -", which is 7 '+' and 3 '-', but output is 4.

Wait, 7 '+' and 3 '-', so '+' - '-' = 7 - 3 = 4, which matches the output.

Similarly, in the second test case, 0 '+' and 5 '-', so 0 - 5 = -5, absolute value is 5.

In the first test case, 1 '+' and 0 '-', so 1 - 0 = 1.

In the third test case, 3 '+' and 3 '-', so 3 - 3 = 0.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-', multiplied by something.

But in the fourth test case, it's 7 '+' and 3 '-', difference is 4, and the output is 4.

In the second test case, difference is 5, output is 5.

In the first test case, difference is 1, output is 1.

In the third test case, difference is 0, output is 0.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-', and no need to split at all.

But in the fourth test case, splitting into subarrays can reduce the penalty below the total difference.

Wait, in the fourth test case, total difference is 4, and the output is 4.

But earlier, when I tried splitting, I couldn't get below 16.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-', and no splitting is needed.

But in the third test case, difference is 0, and penalty is 0.

In the second test case, difference is 5, penalty is 5.

In the first test case, difference is 1, penalty is 1.

In the fourth test case, difference is 4, penalty is 4.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-', regardless of splitting.

But in the second test case, splitting into single elements gives penalty equal to the number of '-', which is 5, same as the difference.

In the third test case, difference is 0, and penalty is 0.

In the first test case, difference is 1, penalty is 1.

In the fourth test
