Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have t test cases, and for each test case, we're given n sticks with lengths that are powers of 2, specifically 2 raised to the power of a_i for each stick i. We need to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle has an area greater than 0, which means the three sides must satisfy the triangle inequality: the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

So, the task is to count how many ways we can choose such triples of sticks for each test case.

First, I need to understand the input and what constraints there are. Each test case starts with an integer n, which is the number of sticks, and then a list of n integers a_i, where each a_i is between 0 and n inclusive. The actual lengths of the sticks are 2^{a_i}, which means all lengths are powers of 2.

Important points:

- t can be up to 10^4, which is 10,000.

- n can be up to 3*10^5 per test case, but the total sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3*10^5.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution because n can be quite large.

First, I need to recall the properties of powers of 2 and how they behave under addition.

Since all lengths are powers of 2, let's think about how these lengths compare to each other.

Property of powers of 2:

For any two distinct powers of 2, say 2^i and 2^j where i < j, we have 2^i + 2^j = 2^i (1 + 2^{j-i}) = 2^i * (1 + 2^{j-i}).

But more importantly, for powers of 2, the sum of two smaller powers is always less than or equal to the next higher power.

For example:

2^0 = 1

2^1 = 2

2^2 = 4

2^3 = 8

Here, 1 + 1 = 2, which equals the next power.

1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 4.

2 + 2 = 4, which equals the next power.

2 + 4 = 6, which is less than 8.

So, in general, for any i < j, 2^i + 2^j <= 2^{j+1}.

This suggests that for three sticks with lengths 2^a, 2^b, and 2^c where a <= b <= c, the triangle inequality 2^a + 2^b > 2^c must hold.

If a < b < c, then 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{b+1}. For 2^a + 2^b > 2^c to hold, we need 2^{b+1} > 2^c, which implies b+1 > c, or c < b+1.

But since b < c, and c must be less than b+1, this would require c <= b, which contradicts b < c. Therefore, no such triples exist where a < b < c and c < b+1. So, in this case, no triangles can be formed if all a, b, c are distinct and increasing.

Wait, that seems off. Let's think again.

Wait, if a < b < c, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^a (1 + 2^{b-a}) < 2^b (since 1 + 2^{b-a} < 2^{b-a+1} if b-a > 0). But 2^b < 2^c, so 2^a + 2^b < 2^c. Therefore, the triangle inequality fails.

Hence, no triangle can be formed if all three exponents are distinct.

So, perhaps the only way to form a triangle is if at least two sticks have the same length.

Wait, but in the first test case of the example, all a_i are 1, so all sticks have length 2^1 = 2. Choosing any three of them, 2+2 > 2, so it's a valid triangle.

In the second test case, a = [3,2,1,3], so lengths are [8,4,2,8]. Possible triangles are (2,4,4), but wait, there's only one 4, so (2,4,8) is invalid because 2+4=6 < 8. And (8,8,2): 8+8 > 2, 8+2 > 8, and 8+2 > 8, so this is valid. Also (8,8,4): 8+8 > 4, 8+4 > 8, 8+4 > 8, so this is also valid. So, two valid triangles.

In the third test case, a = [1,2,3], lengths [2,4,8], as above, no valid triangles.

In the fourth test case, a = [1], only one stick, can't form a triangle.

So, from this, it seems that triangles can be formed if there are at least two sticks of the same length, and possibly a third stick that satisfies the triangle inequality.

Let me think about the general case.

Given that all lengths are powers of 2, which are distinct except when a_i are equal.

Case 1: All three sticks have the same length. Say, 2^k, 2^k, 2^k. Then, 2^k + 2^k > 2^k => 2*(2^k) > 2^k => 2^{k+1} > 2^k, which is always true.

Case 2: Two sticks have the same length, and the third is different.

Subcase 2.1: Third stick is smaller than the two equal sticks.

For example, 2^k, 2^k, 2^m with m < k.

Then, 2^m + 2^k > 2^k => 2^m > 0, which is always true.

2^k + 2^k > 2^m => 2^{k+1} > 2^m, which is true since k+1 > m.

2^k + 2^m > 2^k => 2^m > 0, always true.

So, this is always a valid triangle.

Subcase 2.2: Third stick is larger than the two equal sticks.

2^k, 2^k, 2^m with m > k.

Then, 2^k + 2^k > 2^m => 2^{k+1} > 2^m => k+1 > m.

So, this is valid only if m < k+1, i.e., m <= k.

But m > k, so only if m = k+1.

Wait, m > k, but m must be less than or equal to k+1.

So, m can be k or k+1.

But m > k, so m = k+1.

So, only if m = k+1.

Wait, but m > k, and m <= k+1, so m = k+1.

So, in this subcase, it's only valid if m = k+1.

Wait, but m > k, and m <= k+1, so m = k+1.

So, for two sticks of length 2^k and one stick of length 2^{k+1}, we have:

2^k + 2^k = 2^{k+1}, which is equal to the third side, so 2^{k+1} > 2^{k+1} is not true.

Wait, 2^k + 2^k = 2^{k+1}, which is equal to the third side, but the triangle inequality requires strict inequality: sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

So, 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+1}, which does not satisfy the strict inequality.

Therefore, this is not a valid triangle.

Hence, in subcase 2.2, no valid triangles are formed when m > k.

Wait, but earlier I thought m can be k+1, but now seeing that it's invalid.

So, only subcase 2.1 is valid: two sticks of equal length and the third stick is smaller than them.

Case 3: All three sticks have distinct lengths.

From earlier analysis, this is invalid because the sum of the two smaller sticks is less than or equal to the largest stick, violating the triangle inequality.

Hence, the only valid triangles are those where at least two sticks have the same length, and the third stick is smaller than the two equal sticks.

Wait, but in subcase 2.2, when m = k+1, it's invalid.

Wait, but m can be up to n, which is up to 3*10^5, but in practice, since a_i <= n, the exponents can be large, but the lengths are still powers of 2.

So, to summarize:

- Triangles where all three sticks have the same length: valid.

- Triangles where two sticks have the same length and the third is smaller: valid.

- Triangles where all three sticks have distinct lengths: invalid.

- Triangles where two sticks have the same length and the third is larger: invalid, unless the third is exactly one power higher, but as per earlier analysis, it's invalid.

Hence, only the first two subcases are valid.

Now, I need to count the number of such triples for each test case efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

First, I should count the frequency of each a_i, since the lengths are 2^{a_i}, and 2^{a_i} are unique for different a_i.

So, let's group the sticks by their a_i value.

Let freq[a] be the number of sticks with length 2^a.

Then:

- The number of triples where all three sticks have the same length a is C(freq[a], 3), where C(n, k) is the combination "n choose k".

- The number of triples where two sticks have the same length a, and the third stick has a length less than 2^a.

For the second case, for each a, the number of ways is C(freq[a], 2) * (sum of freq[b] for all b < a).

So, overall, the total number of valid triples is the sum over all a of C(freq[a], 3) plus the sum over all a of C(freq[a], 2) * (sum over b < a of freq[b]).

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to:

1. Read t test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n.

b. Read the list of a_i.

c. Count the frequency of each a_i.

d. Sort the unique a_i in ascending order.

e. Compute the prefix sum of freq[a] for a in sorted order.

f. For each a, compute C(freq[a], 3), and C(freq[a], 2) * prefix_sum[a-1], and sum them all.

Here, prefix_sum[a] is the sum of freq[b] for all b < a.

Implementing C(n, 3) efficiently: C(n, 3) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6.

Similarly, C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2.

I need to make sure to handle cases where freq[a] is less than 2 or 3 appropriately, i.e., C(n, k) = 0 if n < k.

Edge cases to consider:

- n < 3: in this case, no triangles can be formed.

- All a_i are the same: then only C(freq[a], 3) is non-zero.

- All a_i are distinct: then no triangles can be formed.

- freq[a] == 2 for some a, and there are some b < a with freq[b] > 0.

Implementing this in code:

I need to read t test cases, and for each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the list of a_i.

- Create a frequency dictionary for a_i.

- Sort the unique a_i in ascending order.

- Compute the prefix sum of freq[a] for a in sorted order.

- For each a, add C(freq[a], 3) to the result.

- For each a, add C(freq[a], 2) * prefix_sum[a-1] to the result.

- Print the result.

Implementing combinations efficiently is crucial, as n can be up to 3*10^5.

Also, since t can be up to 10^4, but the total sum of n is up to 3*10^5, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough.

In Python, reading input efficiently is important. Using sys.stdin.readline() might be necessary for faster input.

Also, precomputing factorials or using math.comb() for combinations is an option, but math.comb() is available in Python 3.10 and above. If using an older version, I need to implement combinations manually.

Implementing combinations manually:

def comb(n, k):

if k > n:

return 0

if k == 0:

return 1

if k == 1:

return n

return n * (n-1) * (n-2) // 6 for k=3

Similarly, for k=2: n*(n-1)//2

I need to make sure to use integer division.

Now, looking at the given program:

import math

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

num_of_lens = {}

nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

for x in nums:

num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1

res = 0

for cnt in num_of_lens.values():

if cnt >= 3:

res += math.comb(cnt, 3)

if cnt >= 2:

total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))

res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum

print(res)

This seems similar to what I thought, but there might be a mistake.

Wait, in the code, for the second part, it's sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)).

But in my reasoning, it should be the sum of freq[b] for all b < a.

But in the code, it's sum of freq[b] for all b != a.

This is different.

In my reasoning, for each a, the sum should be over b < a.

But in the code, it's sum over b != a.

This is incorrect.

Because, as per my earlier reasoning, for each a, the sum should be over b < a, not over all b != a.

For example, consider a=3, with freq[1], freq[2], freq[3].

For a=3, the sum should be freq[1] + freq[2].

But in the code, it's sum of freq[1], freq[2], and freq[3], but since i != cnt, it excludes freq[3], so it's sum of freq[1] and freq[2], which is correct in this case.

Wait, but in the code, it's sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)), which sums over all frequencies except the current cnt.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, for each a, it should be sum of freq[b] for b < a.

But in the code, it's sum of freq[b] for all b != a.

Wait, but in the first test case, all a_i are 1, so num_of_lens = {1:7}.

Then, for cnt=7, sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)) is sum(()), which is 0.

So, res += comb(7,3) + comb(7,2)*0 = 35 + 0 = 35, which matches the first output.

In the second test case, a = [3,2,1,3], so num_of_lens = {1:1, 2:1, 3:2}.

For a=1, cnt=1: since cnt < 2, skip.

For a=2, cnt=1: since cnt < 2, skip.

For a=3, cnt=2: sum over b != 3 is b=1 and b=2, sum=1+1=2.

So, res += comb(2,3)=0 + comb(2,2)*2 = 1*2 = 2.

Total res=2, which matches the second output.

In the third test case, a = [1,2,3], num_of_lens = {1:1,2:1,3:1}.

For each a, cnt=1, sum over b != a is sum of other two, but cnt < 3, so only adds 0.

Total res=0, matches the third output.

In the fourth test case, a = [1], num_of_lens = {1:1}.

Only cnt=1, which is less than 2, so res=0, matches the fourth output.

So, in these examples, it seems correct.

But is it generally correct?

Wait, in the second test case, for a=3, cnt=2, sum over b < a (b=1 and b=2), which sums to 1+1=2, which is correct.

But in general, sum over b != a is sum over b < a and b > a.

But in this case, since b > a would be frequencies of higher a_i, which, as per earlier analysis, shouldn't be included.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, for two sticks of length a, and one stick of length b < a, it's valid.

So, sum should be over b < a.

But in the code, it's sum over all b != a.

Wait, why does it work in the second test case? Because for a=3, sum over b !=3 is b=1 and b=2, which are both less than 3.

So, in this case, it's correct.

But consider a case where there are a_i with b > a.

Wait, for a=3, sum over b < a is b=1 and b=2.

Sum over b != a is also b=1 and b=2.

So, in this case, it's the same.

But is this always the case?

Wait, suppose we have a_i = [1,2,3,4], and we're considering a=4.

Then, sum over b < a is b=1,2,3.

Sum over b != a is b=1,2,3.

So, in this case, it's the same.

Wait, but according to my earlier analysis, only b < a should be considered.

But in the code, it's sum over b != a, which includes b > a.

But in practice, for the triangle to be valid, only b < a matters.

So, why does sum over b != a work?

Because in the case where b > a, those frequencies are not needed, but in the examples, it worked because b > a doesn't contribute to valid triangles.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, when b > a, it's invalid.

So, including frequencies where b > a in the sum would be incorrect.

But in the second test case, it worked because all b < a.

Wait, but in the second test case, a=3, and b=1,2 are both less than 3.

So, sum over b != a is sum over b < a.

But if there were b > a, those frequencies would be included incorrectly.

Wait, but according to the triangle inequality, only b < a should be considered.

So, the code seems to be incorrect in general.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=4, a=[1,2,3,4].

Then, frequencies: freq[1]=1, freq[2]=1, freq[3]=1, freq[4]=1.

According to the code:

For a=1, cnt=1: skip.

For a=2, cnt=1: skip.

For a=3, cnt=1: skip.

For a=4, cnt=1: skip.

Total res=0, which is correct because no valid triangles.

But, if n=4, a=[1,2,2,4], freq[1]=1, freq[2]=2, freq[4]=1.

For a=1, cnt=1: skip.

For a=2, cnt=2: sum over b !=2 is b=1 and b=4, sum=1+1=2.

res += comb(2,3)=0 + comb(2,2)*2 = 1*2 = 2.

For a=4, cnt=1: skip.

Total res=2.

But, in reality, possible triangles are:

- (2,2,1): 2+2>1, 2+1>2, 2+1>2: valid.

- (2,2,4): 2+2=4, which is not greater than 4: invalid.

So, only one valid triangle, but the code outputs 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

It overcounts the number of valid triangles.

So, the code is incorrect because it includes b > a in the sum, whereas it should only include b < a.

Hence, Correctness: False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from given sticks with lengths being powers of 2, such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. The key is to efficiently count combinations where the triangle inequality holds.

### Approach

1. **Triangle Inequality for Powers of Two**:
   - For lengths being powers of two, the only valid triangles are those where at least two sticks have the same length, and the third stick is smaller than the two equal sticks.
   
2. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Count the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
   
3. **Calculate Combinations**:
   - Calculate combinations where all three sticks are the same.
   - Calculate combinations where two sticks are the same and the third is smaller.

4. **Efficient Summation**:
   - Use sorted unique lengths and prefix sums to efficiently compute the sum of frequencies of smaller lengths.

### Solution Code

    if k > n:
        return 0
    if k == 0:
        return 1
    if k == 1:
        return n
    if k == 2:
        return n * (n - 1) // 2
    if k == 3:
        return n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6
    return 0  # For higher k not considered in this problem

def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    res = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        unique_a = sorted(num_of_lens.keys())
        prefix_sum = [0] * len(unique_a)
        prefix_sum[0] = num_of_lens[unique_a[0]]
        for i in range(1, len(unique_a)):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + num_of_lens[unique_a[i]]
        total = 0
        for i, a in enumerate(unique_a):
            cnt = num_of_lens[a]
            if cnt >= 3:
                total += comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                if i == 0:
                    sum_smaller = 0
                else:
                    sum_smaller = prefix_sum[i - 1]
                total += comb(cnt, 2) * sum_smaller
        res.append(str(total))
    print('\n'.join(res))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
