Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for the elements to "match" after rearrangement. I think it means that there are at least k elements in the subsegment that are also in array b, regardless of their positions. But wait, it says "match the elements of array b," so perhaps it's more specific. Maybe it means that at least k elements in the subsegment are exactly the same as k elements in b, considering multiplicity.

Let me look at the example to clarify:

In the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

The subsegments of a of length 4 are:

[4,1,2,3] -> can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b exactly, so at least 2 match.

[1,2,3,4] -> same as above.

[2,3,4,5] -> can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has [2,3,4] matching b's [1,2,3,4], so at least 3 match.

[3,4,5,6] -> can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has [3,4] matching b's [1,2,3,4], so at least 2 match.

So, all four subsegments are good.

In the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

[4,1,2,3] -> matches at least 3 elements in b.

[1,2,3,4] -> matches all 4.

[2,3,4,5] -> matches 3.

[3,4,5,6] -> matches 2, which is less than k=3, so not good.

So, three good subsegments.

In the third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

[4,1,2,3] -> matches 4.

[1,2,3,4] -> matches 4.

[2,3,4,5] -> matches 3, which is less than k=4, so not good.

[3,4,5,6] -> matches 2, not good.

So, two good subsegments.

From these examples, it seems that for a subsegment to be good, the number of elements in the subsegment that are also in b, considering their frequencies, should be at least k.

So, I need to count, for each subsegment of a of length m, the number of elements that are in b with at least the same frequency, and check if this number is at least k.

Wait, no. Actually, it's about rearranging the subsegment to match at least k elements of b.

I think it's about having at least k elements in common between the subsegment and b, considering multiplicity.

In other words, the number of overlapping elements between the subsegment and b should be at least k.

To formalize it, if I take the subsegment c of a of length m, and b, both can be represented as multisets. The intersection of these multisets (i.e., the minimum frequency of each element in both c and b) should have at least k elements.

So, the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in c and b should be at least k.

That makes sense.

Now, how to efficiently compute this for all subsegments of a of length m.

Given that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t (number of test cases) is up to 1e4, but with the sum of n and m across all test cases not exceeding 2e5, it's manageable.

I need an efficient way to compute, for each subsegment of a of length m, the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in that subsegment and in b.

Then, check if this sum is at least k.

A sliding window approach seems suitable here.

First, for a given test case, I can precompute the frequency of each element in b.

Then, I can iterate through a with a sliding window of size m, maintaining the frequency of elements in the current window.

For each window, I can compute the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in the window and in b.

If this sum is >= k, then it's a good subsegment.

To optimize, I need to avoid recomputing the frequency sum from scratch for each window.

I can use a sliding window technique where I add the new element entering the window and remove the element leaving the window, updating the frequency counts and the sum accordingly.

Let's think about implementing this.

First, I need to read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read array a of n integers

- Read array b of m integers

Then, for each test case, perform the sliding window operation.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases is <= 2e5, and similarly for m, the total time should be acceptable.

Now, in the code provided, there's a function func_1 that seems to implement this logic.

Let's look at it step by step.

The function func_1 takes parameters a, b, k, n, m.

It initializes good_subarrays to 0.

Then, it creates a frequency counter for b using collections.Counter.

It also creates a frequency counter for the first window of size m in a.

Then, it computes matches as the sum of the minimum of frequencies in the window and in b for elements that are in both.

Then, it slides the window from left to right:

- For each position i from 0 to n-m-1:

- If matches >= k, increment good_subarrays

- Remove the element leaving the window (a[i]):

- If a[i] is in b_freq, subtract its frequency in the window from matches

- Update the window frequency for a[i]

- Add the new element entering the window (a[i+m]):

- If a[i+m] is in b_freq, add the minimum of its new frequency in the window and b_freq to matches

- Update the window frequency for a[i+m]

- After the loop, check the last window

- Return good_subarrays

This seems correct at first glance.

But let's verify it with the first test case.

First test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

b_freq = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3]

window_freq = {4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

matches = min(4,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) = 1+1+1+1=4 >=2, so good

Next window: [1,2,3,4]

window_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

matches = same as above, 4 >=2, good

Next window: [2,3,4,5]

window_freq = {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) =1+1+1+0=3 >=2, good

Next window: [3,4,5,6]

window_freq = {3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,0)=1+1+0+0=2 >=2, good

So, all 4 subarrays are good, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

b_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3], matches=4 >=3, good

Second window: [1,2,3,4], matches=4 >=3, good

Third window: [2,3,4,5], matches=3 >=3, good

Fourth window: [3,4,5,6], matches=2 <3, not good

So, 3 good subarrays, matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

Same a and b.

b_freq = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

First window: [4,1,2,3], matches=4 >=4, good

Second window: [1,2,3,4], matches=4 >=4, good

Third window: [2,3,4,5], matches=3 <4, not good

Fourth window: [3,4,5,6], matches=2 <4, not good

So, 2 good subarrays, matches the third output.

Seems correct so far.

Let's look at the fourth test case in the example:

n=11, m=5, k=3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

b_freq = {6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1}

Subsegments of a of length 5:

[9,9,2,2,10]: frequencies {9:2,2:2,10:1}

matches = min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) =1+0+0+0+1=2 <3, not good

[9,2,2,10,9]: {9:2,2:2,10:1}

matches = min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1)=1+0+0+0+1=2 <3, not good

[2,2,10,9,7]: {2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1}

matches = min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1)=0+0+1+1+1=3 >=3, good

[2,10,9,7,6]: {2:1,10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1}

matches = min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1)=0+1+1+1+1=4 >=3, good

[10,9,7,6,3]: {10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1)=1+1+1+0+1=4 >=3, good

[9,7,6,3,6]: {9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1}

matches = min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1)=1+0+1+0+0=2 <3, not good

[7,6,3,6,3]: {7:1,6:2,3:2}

matches = min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1)=0+0+1+0+0=1 <3, not good

So, only three subsegments are good, but the output is 4. Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, n=11, m=5, so number of subsegments is 11-5+1=7.

From above, subsegments starting at positions 3,4,5 are good (indexes starting at 1).

But output is 4, which contradicts my calculation. Maybe I missed one.

Wait, let's list them again:

Positions:

1: [9,9,2,2,10] -> matches=2 <3

2: [9,2,2,10,9] -> matches=2 <3

3: [2,2,10,9,7] -> matches=3 >=3

4: [2,10,9,7,6] -> matches=4 >=3

5: [10,9,7,6,3] -> matches=4 >=3

6: [9,7,6,3,6] -> matches=2 <3

7: [7,6,3,6,3] -> matches=1 <3

So, positions 3,4,5 are good -> 3 good subarrays, but output is 4. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated one of them.

Let's check position 2: [9,2,2,10,9]

 frequencies: 9:2, 2:2, 10:1

matches: min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) =1+0+0+0+1=2 <3, not good.

Position 3: [2,2,10,9,7] -> frequencies: 2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1

matches: min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1)=0+0+1+1+1=3 >=3, good.

Position 4: [2,10,9,7,6] -> frequencies: 2:1,10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1

matches: min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1)=0+1+1+1+1=4 >=3, good.

Position 5: [10,9,7,6,3] -> frequencies: 10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1

matches: min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1)=1+1+1+0+0=3 >=3, good.

Position 6: [9,7,6,3,6] -> frequencies: 9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1

matches: min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1)=1+0+1+0+0=2 <3, not good.

Position 7: [7,6,3,6,3] -> frequencies: 7:1,6:2,3:2

matches: min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1)=0+0+1+0+0=1 <3, not good.

So, positions 3,4,5 are good -> 3 good subarrays.

But the output is 4. So, perhaps I missed one.

Wait, maybe position 1 is good.

Position 1: [9,9,2,2,10]

frequencies: 9:2,2:2,10:1

matches: min(2,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(0,1) + min(1,1)=1+0+0+0+1=2 >=3? No, 2 <3.

Wait, output is 4, but according to this, it should be 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.

Let's check position 4: [2,10,9,7,6]

frequencies: 2:1,10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1

matches: min(0,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)=0+1+1+1+1=4 >=3, good.

Position 5: [10,9,7,6,3]

frequencies: 10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1

matches: min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)=1+1+1+0+0=3 >=3, good.

Position 3: [2,2,10,9,7]

frequencies: 2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1

matches: min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)=0+0+1+1+1=3 >=3, good.

Position 6: [9,7,6,3,6]

frequencies: 9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1

matches: min(1,1)+min(0,1)+min(1,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)=1+0+1+0+0=2 <3, not good.

Position 7: [7,6,3,6,3]

frequencies: 7:1,6:2,3:2

matches: min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(1,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)=0+0+1+0+0=1 <3, not good.

So, positions 3,4,5 are good -> 3 good subarrays.

But the output is 4. Maybe I missed one.

Wait, perhaps position 2 is good.

Position 2: [9,2,2,10,9]

frequencies: 9:2,2:2,10:1

matches: min(2,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(1,1)=1+0+0+0+1=2 >=3? No, 2 <3.

Still, only 3 good subarrays, but output is 4.

Wait, maybe I have an off-by-one error.

Let's check n=11, m=5, so positions 1 through 7.

Wait, perhaps position 2 is good.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated matches for position 2.

Position 2: [9,2,2,10,9]

frequencies: 9:2,2:2,10:1

b_freq: 6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1

matches:

- 9: min(2,1)=1

- 2: min(2,0)=0 (since 2 not in b)

- 10: min(1,1)=1

- 6: min(0,1)=0

- 7: min(0,1)=0

Total matches: 1+0+1+0+0=2 <3, not good.

Still only 3 good subarrays, but output is 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or my understanding.

Looking back at the problem, it says:

"the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

Perhaps "match" means exactly equal, considering the frequency.

Wait, in the explanation, it says:

"the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

I think it means that after rearranging c, at least k elements in c are equal to the corresponding elements in b.

Wait, but the example suggests that it's about having at least k elements in common, considering frequency.

But perhaps it's about permutation matching.

Let me think differently.

Suppose b is sorted, and c is sorted, and we check if at least k elements match.

But the problem doesn't mention sorting.

Wait, perhaps it's about the intersection of multisets.

Given that, the sum of the minimum frequencies for each element in c and b should be at least k.

That's what I implemented.

But according to the output, it should be 4 for the fourth test case, but according to my calculation, it's 3.

Wait, maybe I missed a subarray.

Let me check position 1 again.

Position 1: [9,9,2,2,10]

frequencies: 9:2,2:2,10:1

b_freq: 6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1

matches: min(2,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(0,1)+min(1,1)=1+0+0+0+1=2 <3, not good.

Position 2: [9,2,2,10,9] -> same as above, matches=2 <3, not good.

Position 3: [2,2,10,9,7] -> matches=3 >=3, good.

Position 4: [2,10,9,7,6] -> matches=4 >=3, good.

Position 5: [10,9,7,6,3] -> matches=3 >=3, good.

Position 6: [9,7,6,3,6] -> matches=2 <3, not good.

Position 7: [7,6,3,6,3] -> matches=1 <3, not good.

Total good subarrays: 3, but output is 4. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that b can have duplicate elements, and I need to match the frequencies accordingly.

Wait, in this particular test case, b has all unique elements, so frequency is 1 for each.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the frequency in b as well.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I assumed b_freq has frequency 1 for each element in b, which is correct.

But according to my calculation, only positions 3,4,5 are good, which is 3, but output is 4.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement or the example.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps "match" means that after rearranging c, at least k elements are equal to the corresponding elements in b.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of matching elements in the same positions after rearrangement.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, after rearranging c, at least k elements in c should be equal to the elements in b at the same positions.

Wait, that makes more sense.

So, it's not about the intersection of frequencies, but about permutation matching.

In other words, after sorting both c and b, at least k elements are equal.

Wait, or perhaps it's about the number of agreements in the permutation.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of elements in c that are equal to the corresponding elements in b after some permutation.

This is getting confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose c is a subsegment of a of length m.

We can rearrange c in any order.

After rearranging, at least k elements in c should be equal to the elements in b at the same positions.

So, for example, if c is [2,3,4,5], and b is [1,2,3,4], if we rearrange c to [2,3,4,5], then the first element 2 matches b's first element 1? No.

Wait, 2 !=1, so no match.

Second element 3 ==2? No.

Third element 4==3? No.

Fourth element 5==4? No.

So, no matches.

But according to the earlier understanding, the sum of minimum frequencies would be min(1,0)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)=0+1+1+1=3 >=k=3, which is good.

But according to this new understanding, no matches.

There's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m ≤ n).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

"In other words, find the number of positions 1 ≤ l ≤ n−m+1 such that the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array."

So, for each subsegment c of length m, we can rearrange c, and check if at least k elements in c are equal to the corresponding elements in b.

So, it's about permutation of c such that at least k elements are equal to b's elements at the same positions.

So, it's not about the frequency intersection, but about the number of agreements in position after permutation.

This changes things significantly.

So, I need to find, for each subsegment c of length m, the maximum number of positions where c (after rearrangement) matches b.

This is equivalent to finding the maximum number of elements in c that are also in b, regardless of positions, because by rearranging c, I can match as many elements as possible that are common between c and b.

So, the number of matches is the minimum of the frequencies of each element in c and b, summed up.

Wait, this brings me back to the earlier understanding.

So, perhaps my initial approach is correct.

But according to the fourth test case, my calculation shows 3 good subarrays, but the output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating one of the subarrays.

Let's re-examine position 2: [9,2,2,10,9]

frequencies: 9:2, 2:2, 10:1

b_freq: 6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1

matches: min(2,1) + min(2,0) + min(1,1) =1 +0 +1=2 <3, not good.

Wait, but b has elements 6,9,7,8,10.

So, for element 2 in c, since 2 is not in b, its frequency in b is 0, so min(2,0)=0.

So, matches=1 (for 9) +0 (for 2) +1 (for 10) =2 <3, not good.

Position 3: [2,2,10,9,7]

frequencies: 2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1

matches: min(2,0)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)=0+1+1+1=3 >=3, good.

Position 4: [2,10,9,7,6]

frequencies: 2:1,10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1

matches: min(1,0)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)=0+1+1+1+1=4 >=3, good.

Position 5: [10,9,7,6,3]

frequencies: 10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1

matches: min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(1,0)=1+1+1+1+0=4 >=3, good.

Position 6: [9,7,6,3,6]

frequencies: 9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1

matches: min(1,1)+min(1,1)+min(2,1)+min(1,0)=1+1+1+0=3 >=3, good.

Wait, earlier I thought position 6 was matches=2, but actually it's matches=3.

So, position 6 is good.

Position 7: [7,6,3,6,3]

frequencies: 7:1,6:2,3:2

matches: min(1,1)+min(2,1)+min(2,0)=1+1+0=2 <3, not good.

So, positions 3,4,5,6 are good -> 4 good subarrays, matching the output of 4.

Earlier, I mistakenly calculated position 6 as matches=2, but it's actually matches=3.

So, the approach is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many subsegments of a given array `a` of length `m` are "good" based on the elements of another array `b` and a threshold `k`. A subsegment is considered good if, after rearrangement, at least `k` of its elements match those in array `b`.

### Approach
1. **Frequency Counting**: Use frequency counters for array `b` and sliding windows of array `a`.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Maintain a sliding window of size `m` over array `a` to compute the frequency of elements in the current window.
3. **Matching Elements**: Calculate the number of matching elements between the current window and array `b` by taking the sum of the minimum frequencies of each element in both counters.
4. **Check Condition**: If the number of matches is at least `k`, consider the window as a good subsegment.

### Solution Code
```python
from collections import Counter

def count_good_subarrays(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    # Initial window frequency count
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    # Initial matches calculation
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in b_freq)
    if matches >= k:
        good_subarrays += 1
    # Slide the window from left to right
    for i in range(n - m):
        left_element = a[i]
        right_element = a[i + m]
        # Update frequency of the element going out of the window
        if left_element in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[left_element], b_freq[left_element])
            window_freq[left_element] -= 1
            if window_freq[left_element] == 0:
                del window_freq[left_element]
            matches += min(window_freq[left_element], b_freq[left_element])
        # Update frequency of the new element coming into the window
        if right_element in b_freq:
            prev_freq = window_freq.get(right_element, 0)
            window_freq[right_element] += 1
            matches += min(window_freq[right_element], b_freq[right_element]) - min(prev_freq, b_freq[right_element])
        # Check if current window is good
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
    return good_subarrays

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(count_good_subarrays(a, b, k, n, m))
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Frequency Count**: We use `Counter` to count frequencies of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a`.
2. **Matches Calculation**: We calculate the initial number of matches by summing the minimum frequencies of common elements.
3. **Sliding Window Operation**:
   - For each slide, we adjust the frequency counts for the element leaving the window and the element entering the window.
   - We update the matches count based on these frequency changes.
   - If the matches count is at least `k`, we increment the count of good subarrays.
4. **Output**: For each test case, we output the number of good subarrays found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check each window with a time complexity of O(n), leveraging the sliding window technique to avoid recomputing frequencies from scratch for each window.
