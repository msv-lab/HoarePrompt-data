Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is maximized.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

1

2 3

Output:

2

So, n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. I have to choose two numbers, take the smaller one, and that's my score. So, pairing 2 and 3, min(2,3)=2, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

2

1 1 2 1

Output:

2

Here, n=2, and the numbers are 1,1,2,1. I need to perform two moves.

One way is to pair 1 and 1 first, get min(1,1)=1, then pair the remaining 1 and 2, get min(1,2)=1, total score=2.

Another way could be pairing 1 and 2 first, get min(1,2)=1, then pair the remaining 1 and 1, get min(1,1)=1, total score still 2.

Seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score. But the problem says to find the maximum possible score.

Let me check another test case:

Input:

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

3

Here, n=3, numbers are all 1s. So, pairing any two will give min=1 each time, total score=3.

Alright, seems straightforward in this case.

Wait a minute, is there a general strategy here?

Let me think about sorting the numbers.

If I sort the numbers in ascending order, maybe there's a pattern.

Take the second test case: 1,1,2,1. Sorted: 1,1,1,2.

If I pair the smallest with the next smallest each time, I get:

Pair 1 and 1: min=1

Pair 1 and 2: min=1

Total score=2

Is there a better way? Let's see.

If I pair 1 and 2 first: min=1

Then pair 1 and 1: min=1

Total still 2.

Alternatively, pair 1 and 1 first: min=1

Then pair 1 and 2: min=1

Again, 2.

Seems like 2 is the maximum possible.

Is there a way to get more than 2? Let's see.

If I pair 1 and 2, get 1, then pair 1 and 1, get 1: total 2.

Alternatively, if I pair 1 and 1, get 1, then pair 1 and 2, get 1: total 2.

No other combinations seem to give a higher score.

So, in this case, 2 is the maximum.

Now, in the third test case, all numbers are 1, so pairing any way gives 1 each time, total 3.

Seems like when there are multiple identical numbers, pairing them together is optimal.

But in the second test case, pairing two 1's together and then the remaining 1 and 2 also gives the same result.

So, maybe the general strategy is to sort the numbers in ascending order and pair them accordingly.

Wait, but I need to maximize the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the array in ascending order.

Then, the smallest numbers should be paired in a way that maximizes the minimum in each pair.

Wait, that sounds contradictory.

Let me think again.

If I sort the array in ascending order, the smallest numbers are at the beginning.

If I pair the smallest with the next smallest, then in each pair, the smaller number is as large as possible.

Wait, but since I'm taking the minimum in each pair, pairing the smallest with the next smallest should give me the smallest possible min for that pair.

But I want to maximize the sum of these mins.

So, perhaps pairing the smallest with the next smallest ensures that the min in each pair is as large as possible for that pair.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I sort the array in ascending order.

Then, the smallest number should be paired with the largest possible number to maximize its min value.

But wait, if I pair the smallest with the largest, then the min is the smallest number.

But in the second test case, if I pair 1 with 2, min is 1.

Then, the next pair is 1 and 1, min is 1.

Total is 2.

Same as pairing 1 with 1 and then 1 with 2.

So, in this case, it doesn't make a difference.

Is there a scenario where pairing the smallest with the largest gives a better score?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose the numbers are 1,2,3,4.

So, n=2.

If I pair 1 with 2 and 3 with 4:

min(1,2)=1 + min(3,4)=3 → total=4

If I pair 1 with 3 and 2 with 4:

min(1,3)=1 + min(2,4)=2 → total=3

If I pair 1 with 4 and 2 with 3:

min(1,4)=1 + min(2,3)=2 → total=3

So, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the highest total of 4.

Similarly, in the previous test case, it didn't matter.

So, maybe pairing the smallest with the next smallest generally gives the best result.

Wait, but in this new example, it does.

Let me see another example.

Suppose numbers are 1,1,2,3.

n=2.

Pair 1 with 1 and 2 with 3:

min(1,1)=1 + min(2,3)=2 → total=3

Pair 1 with 2 and 1 with 3:

min(1,2)=1 + min(1,3)=1 → total=2

Pair 1 with 3 and 1 with 2:

min(1,3)=1 + min(1,2)=1 → total=2

So, pairing the two 1's together gives a better total.

So, in this case, pairing the smallest with the next smallest is better.

Another example: numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

n=3.

Pair 1 with 2, 3 with 4, 5 with 6:

min(1,2)=1 + min(3,4)=3 + min(5,6)=5 → total=9

Pair 1 with 3, 2 with 4, 5 with 6:

min(1,3)=1 + min(2,4)=2 + min(5,6)=5 → total=8

Pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5, 3 with 6:

min(1,4)=1 + min(2,5)=2 + min(3,6)=3 → total=6

So, again, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the highest total.

Wait, but in the first test case, it was the same.

So, perhaps pairing the smallest with the next smallest consistently gives the maximum sum of mins.

Let me see if there's a pattern here.

It seems that sorting the array in ascending order and then pairing each two consecutive numbers gives the optimal sum.

In the first test case: 2,3 sorted to 2,3 → pair 2 and 3 → min=2 → total=2

Second test case: 1,1,2,1 sorted to 1,1,1,2 → pair 1 and 1, then 1 and 2 → min=1+1=2

Third test case: all 1's → pair any two → min=1 each time → total=3

And in the example I made: 1,2,3,4 → sorted to 1,2,3,4 → pair 1 and 2 → min=1, pair 3 and 4 → min=3 → total=4

Another example: 1,1,2,3 → sorted to 1,1,2,3 → pair 1 and 1 → min=1, pair 2 and 3 → min=2 → total=3

And if I pair 1 and 2, 1 and 3 → min=1+1=2, which is less than pairing 1 and 1, 2 and 3.

So, it seems that sorting and pairing consecutive numbers gives the optimal sum.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Yes, this seems to be a classic problem where you sort the array and then sum up the minimum of each pair when pairs are formed from consecutive elements.

The reason this works is that by sorting, you ensure that the smallest possible min for each pair is as large as it can be.

In other words, by pairing the smallest available number with the next smallest, you're maximizing the min for that pair.

Summing these up gives the maximum possible total score.

So, in the program provided, it seems to be implementing this approach.

Let's look at the code:

def func():

num = input()

out = []

for numbers in range(int(num)):

list2 = []

list1 = []

a = input()

a = int(a)

b = input('')

list1 = b.split()

list1.sort()

for i in range(a):

list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))

out.append(sum(list2))

del list1[:]

del list2[:]

for outputs in out:

print(outputs)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case:

- Reads n

- Reads the 2n numbers

- Sorts them

- Pairs them by taking every two consecutive numbers, and appends the first one (which is the smaller one after sorting) to list2

- Sums up list2 and appends to out

- Finally, prints each output in out

Wait, but in the code, it's list1.sort(), then for i in range(a): list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))

So, list1 is sorted in ascending order, and then it's taking every second element starting from the first (i.e., the smallest ones).

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, we pair the smallest with the next smallest, and take the min, which should be the first one in the sorted list.

But in the code, it's list1.sort(), then list2.append(int(list1[2 * i])), which means for i from 0 to a-1, it's taking list1[0], list1[2], list1[4], etc.

Wait, is this correct?

Let's see with an example.

Take n=2, numbers: 1,1,2,1

Sorted: [1,1,1,2]

Then, for i in range(2):

i=0: list2.append(list1[0]) = 1

i=1: list2.append(list1[2]) = 1

Sum(list2) = 1+1=2, which matches the expected output.

Another example: n=3, numbers:1,1,1,1,1,1

Sorted: [1,1,1,1,1,1]

list2: list1[0], list1[2], list1[4] → 1,1,1 → sum=3, which is correct.

Another example: n=1, numbers:2,3

Sorted: [2,3]

list2: list1[0] = 2 → sum=2, which is correct.

Wait, but in our earlier example with n=2, numbers=1,2,3,4:

Sorted: [1,2,3,4]

list2: list1[0]=1, list1[2]=3 → sum=4, which is correct.

So, seems like it's working.

But wait, in this approach, it's not actually pairing the numbers, it's just taking every second element after sorting.

But in our earlier reasoning, pairing the smallest with the next smallest, and taking the min, which is the smaller one in each pair.

But in this code, it's simply taking the first element of each pair when the list is sorted.

Wait, but in the sorted list, the first element of each consecutive pair is the min of that pair.

So, yes, it's effectively summing up the min of each pair when pairs are formed from consecutive elements in the sorted list.

And as we saw in our examples, this gives the correct maximum sum.

Is there a case where this approach fails?

Let me think.

Suppose n=2, numbers:1,2,3,6

Sorted: [1,2,3,6]

Pairing 1 and 2 (min=1), and 3 and 6 (min=3), sum=4

Alternatively, pairing 1 and 3 (min=1), and 2 and 6 (min=2), sum=3

Or pairing 1 and 6 (min=1), and 2 and 3 (min=2), sum=3

So, the first approach gives the highest sum.

Another example: n=3, numbers:1,2,3,4,5,6

Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Pairing 1 and 2 (1), 3 and 4 (3), 5 and 6 (5), sum=9

Alternative pairing: 1 and 3 (1), 2 and 4 (2), 5 and 6 (5), sum=8

Or 1 and 4 (1), 2 and 5 (2), 3 and 6 (3), sum=6

So, again, the sorted pairing gives the highest sum.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, I conclude that the approach in the code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
