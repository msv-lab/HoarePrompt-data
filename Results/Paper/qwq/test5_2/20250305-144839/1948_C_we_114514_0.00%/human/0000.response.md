Alright, I have this problem to solve. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1) and needs to reach cell (2,n). Every second, two things happen: the robot moves in one direction (left, right, down, or up), and then it moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

First, I need to understand the movement rules clearly. The robot has a choice to move left, right, up, or down initially, but it can't move outside the grid. After that move, it must move according to the arrow in the cell it's in. So, essentially, it's a two-step process each second.

Given that, I need to find out if there's a sequence of moves that can lead the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Looking at the provided program, it seems like there's a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases, each consisting of n and the two rows of arrows. It then computes whether it's possible to reach cell (2,n) for each test case.

Let me try to understand the logic in `func_1`.

It initializes two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`. `reachable_first_row` is set to True, meaning we start at row 1. `reachable_second_row` is set to False initially.

Then, for each column j from 0 to n-1, it checks if the robot can be in row 1 or row 2 at that column.

If `reachable_first_row` is True, it checks the arrow in row1 at column j.

- If the arrow is '>', it means the robot would move to the right within row1. If j is n-1, it's the last column, so moving right would stay in place or perhaps try to move out, but since no arrow points outside, it should stay in place. The code seems to set `reachable_second_row` to True in this case, which might not be accurate.

- If the arrow is '<', it sets `reachable_first_row` to False, meaning the robot can't stay in row1, and checks if it can move to row2 via an arrow '>' in row2 at column j.

Similarly, if `reachable_second_row` is True, it checks the arrow in row2 at column j.

- If the arrow is '>', and it's the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to True.

I'm a bit confused here. It seems like the code is trying to track whether the robot can reach the second row in the last column, but I'm not sure if it's handling the movements correctly.

Let me think about this differently. Since the grid has only two rows, movements are limited to up and down between the two rows, and left and right within each row.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each cell is a node, and there are edges based on possible moves.

But that might be too time-consuming for large n. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the problem mentions that n is even, and there are no arrows pointing outside the grid. Also, the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which suggests that the solution should be efficient, probably O(n) per test case.

Looking back at the code, it seems to iterate through each column once per row, which is efficient enough.

But I need to verify if the logic is correct.

Let me consider the first test case from the example:

n=4

row1: >><<

row2: >>><

According to the explanation, one possible path is (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

Let's see how the code handles this.

Initialize:

reachable_first_row = True

reachable_second_row = False

j=0:

In row1, arrow is '>', so since j != n-1, it doesn't set reachable_second_row.

But wait, in the code, it says:

if row1[j] == '>':

if j == n - 1:

reachable_second_row = True

else:

# perhaps set reachable_first_row to stay True?

But in the code provided, it seems like it only sets reachable_second_row if j == n-1 and row1[j] == '>', which might not cover all cases.

Wait, in the first iteration, j=0, row1[j] == '>', but j != n-1, so it doesn't set reachable_second_row. It keeps reachable_first_row = True.

Then, j=1, row1[j] == '<', so reachable_first_row = False. If j < n-1 and row2[j] == '>', which is row2[1] == '>', so set reachable_second_row = True.

Then, j=2, row1[j] == '<', but reachable_first_row is False, so it doesn't do anything for row1.

Since reachable_second_row is True, and row2[j] == '>', and j != n-1, it doesn't set reachable_second_row again.

Then, j=3, row1[j] == '<', reachable_first_row is False, so nothing.

reachable_second_row is still True, and row2[j] == '<', so it might not set reachable_second_row.

Wait, in the code, for reachable_second_row, it only sets it to True if row2[j] == '>' and j == n-1.

But in this case, j=3, row2[j] == '<', so it doesn't set it.

So, reachable_second_row remains True, which is correct for this test case.

But is this always accurate?

Let me consider another test case:

n=2

row1: ><

row2: ><

According to the example, the output is YES.

Possible path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

Let's see how the code handles this.

Initialize:

reachable_first_row = True

reachable_second_row = False

j=0:

In row1, arrow is '>', so j != n-1, so doesn't set reachable_second_row.

But wait, in this case, the robot can choose to move down to row2 at column1.

But in the code, it seems like it only considers moving according to the arrow after the initial move.

This is where I think the code might be flawed.

It doesn't seem to account for the fact that the robot can choose to move up or down initially, and then follow the arrow.

In the first step, the robot is at (1,1). It can choose to move right, left, down, or up.

- If it moves right, it goes to (1,2), then follows the arrow there.

- If it moves down, it goes to (2,1), then follows the arrow there.

- It can't move left or up from (1,1).

So, in this test case, to reach (2,2), it can move down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), following the arrow.

But in the code, it seems like it's only tracking whether it can reach row2 in the last column, but not considering the sequence of moves properly.

I think the code might be incomplete or incorrect in handling all possible moves.

Let me consider another test case where the answer is NO.

n=4

row1: >>><

row2: >><<

According to the example, it's impossible to reach (2,4).

Let's see how the code handles this.

Initialize:

reachable_first_row = True

reachable_second_row = False

j=0:

row1[j] == '>', j != n-1, so reachable_second_row remains False.

j=1:

row1[j] == '>', j != n-1, so reachable_second_row remains False.

j=2:

row1[j] == '<', so reachable_first_row = False.

If j < n-1 and row2[j] == '<', so doesn't set reachable_second_row.

j=3:

row1[j] == '<', reachable_first_row is False, so nothing.

reachable_second_row is still False, so output NO.

Which matches the example.

But I'm still not fully confident about the correctness.

Let me consider the fourth test case:

n=6

row1: >><<><

row2: ><>>><

According to the example, output is YES.

Possible path: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4) -> (2,5) -> (2,6)

But in the code, it might not handle this correctly because it seems to only track whether it can reach row2 in each column, but not the interaction between rows properly.

I think a better approach would be to use BFS or DFS to traverse all possible positions the robot can reach, considering both its initial move and the subsequent move according to the arrow.

However, given the constraints (sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5), we need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Maybe we can model the movement as a graph where each node is a cell, and edges represent possible moves, considering both the initial move and the arrow move.

But implementing that efficiently might be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can iterate through the grid column by column, keeping track of which rows in the current column are reachable.

At each column, based on the arrows and possible moves, update the reachability for the next column.

This seems similar to dynamic programming, where we maintain a state for each column representing which rows are reachable.

Given that there are only two rows, the state can be represented by two boolean variables: whether row1 and row2 are reachable in the current column.

Then, for each column, update the reachability for the next column based on the arrows and possible moves.

This might work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define:

- dp[i][0]: can reach row1 in column i

- dp[i][1]: can reach row2 in column i

Initialize:

dp[0][0] = True

dp[0][1] = False

Then, for each column i from 0 to n-2:

Update dp[i+1][0] and dp[i+1][1] based on dp[i][0] and dp[i][1], considering the arrows and possible moves.

Finally, check dp[n-1][1].

But we need to define the transition correctly.

Let's consider the possible moves:

From row1, column j:

- Move left: to row1, column j-1, then follow arrow in row1, column j-1.

- Move right: to row1, column j+1, then follow arrow in row1, column j+1.

- Move down: to row2, column j, then follow arrow in row2, column j.

From row2, column j:

- Move left: to row2, column j-1, then follow arrow in row2, column j-1.

- Move right: to row2, column j+1, then follow arrow in row2, column j+1.

- Move up: to row1, column j, then follow arrow in row1, column j.

Additionally, the arrow move is deterministic based on the arrow in the current cell.

Wait, no. After the initial move, the robot moves according to the arrow in the current cell.

Wait, re-reading the problem statement:

"Every second, the following two actions happen one after another:

1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move);

2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move)."

So, the sequence is:

- Choose a direction (left, right, up, down), move to the new cell.

- Then, move according to the arrow in that new cell.

So, effectively, two moves per second.

Given that, we need to model this carefully.

Let me consider the possible sequences.

From (r,c), the robot chooses a direction d1, moves to (r',c'), then moves to (r'',c'') according to the arrow in (r',c').

We need to consider all possible d1 for each step.

This seems complex to handle directly.

Perhaps the provided code's approach is too simplistic and doesn't capture all possible move sequences.

An alternative idea is to model the grid as a graph where edges represent possible transitions per second, and then check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

Given the constraints, this needs to be efficient.

Another idea: since there are only two rows, we can represent the state as the current row and column, and use BFS to explore all possible positions.

But with n up to 2e5, BFS might be too slow if not implemented carefully.

Wait, perhaps we can iterate column by column and keep track of reachable rows in each column, considering the possible moves from the previous column.

Given that, perhaps we can define for each column, which rows are reachable, and update this information as we move to the next column.

Let me try to define the transitions.

Let's define that for column j, we have:

- reachable_rows[j] = set of rows that can be reached in column j.

Initialize reachable_rows[0] = {1}

Then, for each j from 0 to n-2:

For each reachable row in reachable_rows[j]:

From row r in column j, consider all possible initial moves:

- Left: to row r, column j-1, then follow arrow in that cell to next position.

- Right: to row r, column j+1, then follow arrow in that cell to next position.

- Up: to row 1, column j (if r=2), then follow arrow in that cell.

- Down: to row 2, column j (if r=1), then follow arrow in that cell.

Update reachable_rows[j+1] based on these moves.

But need to make sure that we don't go out of bounds and handle the arrows correctly.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define reachable_rows[j] as a set containing rows that can be reached in column j.

Initialize reachable_rows[0] = {1}

Then, for j from 0 to n-2:

for each r in reachable_rows[j]:

- If move left is possible (j-1 >= 0):

Move to (r, j-1), then follow arrow in (r, j-1):

If arrow is '<', move to (r, j-2) if j-2 >= 0, else stay.

If arrow is '>', move to (r, j)

- If move right is possible (j+1 < n):

Move to (r, j+1), then follow arrow in (r, j+1):

If arrow is '<', move to (r, j)

If arrow is '>', move to (r, j+2) if j+2 < n, else stay.

- If move up is possible (r=2):

Move to (1, j), then follow arrow in (1, j):

If arrow is '<', move to (1, j-1) if j-1 >=0, else stay.

If arrow is '>', move to (1, j+1) if j+1 < n, else stay.

- If move down is possible (r=1):

Move to (2, j), then follow arrow in (2, j):

If arrow is '<', move to (2, j-1) if j-1 >=0, else stay.

If arrow is '>', move to (2, j+1) if j+1 < n, else stay.

Update reachable_rows[j+1] with the final positions from above.

Finally, check if 2 is in reachable_rows[n-1]

This seems correct, but a bit complicated to implement efficiently.

I need to find a way to implement this in O(n) time per test case.

Perhaps I can optimize this by recognizing that with only two rows, I can track the reachability for each row in each column without excessive computation.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or property that can be exploited due to the arrows only pointing left or right, and the grid having only two rows.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I consider the grid as a finite automaton, where columns are states, and transitions are determined by the moves.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to have a simpler approach, tracking whether row1 or row2 is reachable in the current column, and updating based on the arrows.

But from my earlier analysis, it seems incomplete because it doesn't account for all possible move sequences.

Therefore, I suspect that the provided program is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible movement options the robot has.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
