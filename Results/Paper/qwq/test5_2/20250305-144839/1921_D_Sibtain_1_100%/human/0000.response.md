Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a given list of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya can choose any n integers from the list of m and arrange them in any order to form his array c. The goal is to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of Petya's array a and Vasya's array c.

Okay, so the problem is to maximize D = sum(|a_i - c_i|) for i from 1 to n.

First, I need to understand what makes D as large as possible. The absolute difference |a_i - c_i| is maximized when c_i is as far away as possible from a_i. So, for each a_i, I should pair it with the c_j that is as far away as possible from it.

But there's a catch: I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them in a specific order to pair with a_i's. Also, m can be larger than n, so I need to select which n elements to use from the m available.

Hmm. The constraints are that t, the number of test cases, is up to 100, and for each test case, n and m can be up to 2*10^5, but the sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(m log m) per test case or better.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One idea is to sort both arrays and pair the elements in a way that maximizes the sum of absolute differences. Since we can arrange c in any order, the order of c doesn't matter except how it's paired with a.

I recall that to maximize the sum of products of two arrays, we can pair the largest elements of one array with the smallest elements of the other array. Maybe something similar applies here.

Wait, but we're dealing with absolute differences, not products.

Let me consider sorting both arrays.

Let's sort array a in ascending order and array c in descending order. Then, for each i, |a_i - c_i| would be maximized because we're pairing the smallest a's with the largest c's.

Is this always optimal?

Let me test this with an example.

Take the first example from the input:

n=4, m=6

a = [6,1,2,4]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

Sort a in ascending order: [1,2,4,6]

Sort c in descending order: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pair them as:

|1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13

But in the sample output, it's 16. So, my approach is not giving the correct maximum.

Wait, perhaps I need to select only n elements from c, not all m.

In this case, m=6 and n=4, so I need to choose 4 elements from c.

If I choose [1,2,3,7], sort a as [1,2,4,6], sort c as [7,3,2,1], then pair:

|1-7| + |2-3| + |4-2| + |6-1| = 6 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 14, which is still less than 16.

Wait, in the explanation, they chose (1,5,7,2), which gives |6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

So, their selection is different. They chose c = [1,5,7,2], which is not the largest elements, and paired them in a specific way.

Hmm, so my initial approach of sorting a ascending and c descending and pairing in order isn't giving the maximum.

I need a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

For each a_i, I want to pair it with a c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|.

But since I have to pair each a_i with a unique c_j (since c_j are used only once), this becomes an assignment problem.

The standard assignment problem is to minimize the sum, but here we want to maximize it.

I know that the Hungarian algorithm can be used for assignment problems to minimize the sum, but I'm not sure if it can be directly applied for maximization.

Also, given the constraints, it might be too slow since m and n can be up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the following:

To maximize the sum of |a_i - c_i|, I need to pair each a_i with a c_j that is as far away as possible.

One way to think about this is to consider the maximum and minimum values in c.

For each a_i, if c has both small and large values, I can pair a_i with either the smallest or largest available c_j, depending on which gives the larger difference.

This sounds similar to a greedy approach where I always pick the c_j that gives the maximum difference for the current a_i.

But I need to ensure that each c_j is used only once.

Let me consider sorting a in ascending order and c in ascending order.

Then, for each a_i, I can choose either the smallest available c_j or the largest available c_j, whichever gives a larger difference.

But I need to keep track of which c_j are used.

This might be complicated.

Wait, maybe I can use two pointers or something similar.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I sort a in ascending order and c in descending order.

Then, I can have two pointers, one at the start of c (largest) and one at the end of c (smallest).

For each a_i, I choose the c_j that gives the larger difference: either the largest remaining or the smallest remaining.

Then, I use that c_j and move the corresponding pointer.

This seems promising.

Let me try it with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6] (sorted ascending)

c = [7,5,3,3,2,1] (sorted descending)

Initialize pointers: left at 0 (c[left]=7), right at 5 (c[right]=1)

For a[0]=1:

Choose max(|1-7|=6, |1-1|=0) → choose 7

Add 6 to D, set c[left]=7 used, move left to 1 (c[left]=5)

For a[1]=2:

Choose max(|2-5|=3, |2-1|=1) → choose 5

Add 3 to D, set c[left]=5 used, move left to 2 (c[left]=3)

For a[2]=4:

Choose max(|4-3|=1, |4-1|=3) → choose 1

Add 3 to D, set c[right]=1 used, move right to 4 (c[right]=2)

For a[3]=6:

Choose max(|6-3|=3, |6-2|=4) → choose 2

Add 4 to D, set c[right]=2 used, move right to 3 (c[right]=3)

Total D = 6 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 16, which matches the sample.

Great, this seems to work.

Let me try another example.

Third example:

n=5, m=5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

c = [1,2,3,4,5]

Sort a ascending: [1,2,3,4,5]

Sort c descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Initialize left=0 (c[left]=5), right=4 (c[right]=1)

For a[0]=1:

max(|1-5|=4, |1-1|=0) → choose 5

Add 4 to D, move left to 1 (c[left]=4)

For a[1]=2:

max(|2-4|=2, |2-1|=1) → choose 4

Add 2 to D, move left to 2 (c[left]=3)

For a[2]=3:

max(|3-3|=0, |3-1|=2) → choose 1

Add 2 to D, move right to 3 (c[right]=2)

For a[3]=4:

max(|4-3|=1, |4-2|=2) → choose 2

Add 2 to D, move right to 2 (c[right]=3)

For a[4]=5:

max(|5-3|=2, |5-3|=2) → choose either

Add 2 to D

Total D = 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12, which matches the sample.

Another example:

Second example:

n=3, m=4

a = [1,1,1]

c = [1,1,1,1]

Sort a: [1,1,1]

Sort c descending: [1,1,1,1]

Initialize left=0 (c[left]=1), right=3 (c[right]=1)

For a[0]=1:

max(|1-1|=0, |1-1|=0) → choose either

Add 0 to D, move left to 1 (c[left]=1)

For a[1]=1:

max(|1-1|=0, |1-1|=0) → choose either

Add 0 to D, move left to 2 (c[left]=1)

For a[2]=1:

max(|1-1|=0, |1-1|=0) → choose either

Add 0 to D

Total D = 0, matches the sample.

Looks good.

Let me try another one.

Fourth example:

n=2, m=6

a = [5,8]

c = [8,7,5,8,2,10]

Sort a: [5,8]

Sort c descending: [10,8,8,7,5,2]

Initialize left=0 (c[left]=10), right=5 (c[right]=2)

For a[0]=5:

max(|5-10|=5, |5-2|=3) → choose 10

Add 5 to D, move left to 1 (c[left]=8)

For a[1]=8:

max(|8-8|=0, |8-2|=6) → choose 2

Add 6 to D, move right to 4 (c[right]=5)

Total D = 5 + 6 = 11, matches the sample.

Seems correct.

Let me see the code provided.

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

c = list(map(int, input().split()))

if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):

print(0)

continue

a.sort()

c.sort(reverse=True)

if len(a) == 1:

print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))

continue

(i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])

if t2 > t1:

j += 1

else:

i += 1

ans += max(t1, t2)

print(ans)

So, in the code, they sort a in ascending order and c in descending order.

Then, they initialize i=0 and j=1.

Then, for each k in range(n), they compute t1 = |a[i] - c[i]| and t2 = |a[len(a)-j] - c[len(c)-j]|.

If t2 > t1, increment j, else increment i.

Add max(t1, t2) to ans.

Wait, this seems a bit different from what I thought.

In my approach, for each a_i, I choose the c_j that gives the maximum difference, either the current largest or smallest available.

But in this code, for each k, they're computing t1 and t2 based on i and j, and choosing the maximum between t1 and t2, then incrementing i or j based on which one is larger.

I'm not sure if this achieves the same thing as my approach.

Let me try to understand this code with the first example.

a = [1,2,4,6]

c = [7,5,3,3,2,1] (sorted descending)

i=0, j=1, ans=0

k=0:

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]| = |1-7|=6

t2 = |a[4-1]-c[6-1]| but len(a)=4, so a[3]=6, c[5-1]=c[4]=2

t2 = |6-2|=4

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 1

ans += 6 → ans=6

k=1:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]| = |2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-1]-c[6-1]| wait, len(a)-j=4-1=3, c[len(c)-j]=c[6-1]=c[5]=1

t2 = |6-1|=5

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 2

ans +=5 → ans=11

k=2:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]|=|2-5|=3

t2 = |a[4-2]=a[2]=4 - c[6-2]=c[4]=2|=2

Since t2 < t1, increment i to 2

ans +=3 → ans=14

k=3:

t1 = |a[2]-c[2]|=|4-3|=1

t2 = |a[4-2]=a[2]=4 - c[6-2]=c[4]=2|=2

Since t2 > t1, increment j to 3

ans +=2 → ans=16

So, final ans=16, which matches the sample.

Okay, so in this code, it seems like they are accumulating the maximum of t1 and t2 at each step, and moving the pointer that gives the larger value.

This seems to be achieving the same result as my approach, but in a slightly different way.

In my approach, for each a_i, I choose the c_j that gives the larger difference, either the current largest or smallest.

In their code, they are iterating through k from 0 to n-1, and at each step, choosing the maximum between t1 and t2, and moving the corresponding pointer.

t1 is |a[i]-c[i]|, which is like pairing a[i] with c[i], and t2 is |a[len(a)-j]-c[len(c)-j]|, which is like pairing a[len(a)-j] with c[len(c)-j].

Wait, this seems a bit confusing.

In my approach, for each a_i, I choose the best c_j available, either the largest or smallest remaining.

In their code, for each step, they compute t1 and t2 based on current i and j, choose the maximum, add it to ans, and move the pointer.

But in my earlier manual calculation, it gave the correct answer, so perhaps it's equivalent.

Let me try another example to verify.

Third example:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

c = [5,4,3,2,1] (sorted descending: [5,4,3,2,1])

i=0, j=1, ans=0

k=0:

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]|=|1-5|=4

t2 = |a[5-1]=a[4]=5 - c[5-1]=c[4]=1|=4

Since t2 == t1, choose to increment i or j? The code says if t2 > t1, increment j, else increment i.

Since t2 == t1, it will increment i to 1

ans +=4 → ans=4

k=1:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]|=|2-4|=2

t2 = |a[5-1=4]-c[5-1=4]|=|5-1|=4

t2 > t1, so increment j to 2

ans +=4 → ans=8

k=2:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]|=|2-4|=2

t2 = |a[5-2=3]-c[5-2=3]|=|4-2|=2

t2 == t1, so increment i to 2

ans +=2 → ans=10

k=3:

t1 = |a[2]-c[2]|=|3-3|=0

t2 = |a[5-2=3]-c[5-2=3]|=|4-2|=2

t2 > t1, so increment j to 3

ans +=2 → ans=12

k=4:

t1 = |a[2]-c[2]|=|3-3|=0

t2 = |a[5-3=2]-c[5-3=2]|=|3-3|=0

t2 == t1, so increment i to 3

ans +=0 → ans=12

Which matches the sample.

Another example:

Second example:

a = [1,1,1]

c = [1,1,1,1] (sorted descending: [1,1,1,1])

i=0, j=1, ans=0

k=0:

t1 = |a[0]-c[0]|=|1-1|=0

t2 = |a[3-1=2]-c[4-1=3]|=|1-1|=0

t2 == t1, increment i to 1

ans +=0 → ans=0

k=1:

t1 = |a[1]-c[1]|=|1-1|=0

t2 = |a[3-2=1]-c[4-2=2]|=|1-1|=0

t2 == t1, increment i to 2

ans +=0 → ans=0

k=2:

t1 = |a[2]-c[2]|=|1-1|=0

t2 = |a[3-3=0]-c[4-3=1]|=|1-1|=0

t2 == t1, increment i to 3

ans +=0 → ans=0

Which matches the sample.

Seems correct.

Let me check the time complexity.

Sorting a takes O(n log n), sorting c takes O(m log m).

Then, the for loop runs in O(n) time.

Given that t is up to 100 and sum of m over all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Now, looking back at the code, there's a special case when all elements in a and c are equal.

if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):

print(0)

continue

This is to handle the case where all a_i and c_j are equal, in which case D will always be 0, so no need to proceed further.

Another special case is when n=1.

if len(a) == 1:

print(max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c))))

continue

This makes sense because if n=1, the maximum difference is simply the maximum of the difference between a[0] and the smallest c_j, and a[0] and the largest c_j.

In the general case, the code uses i and j as pointers.

(i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])

if t2 > t1:

j += 1

else:

i += 1

ans += max(t1, t2)

print(ans)

This seems to be a way to simulate choosing the best available c_j for each a_i.

By maintaining two pointers, i for the start and j for the end, it's effectively choosing between the largest and smallest available c_j at each step.

Given that c is sorted in descending order, c[i] is the largest available, and c[len(c)-j] is the smallest available.

So, t1 is the difference if we pair a[i] with c[i] (largest available), and t2 is the difference if we pair a[len(a)-j] with c[len(c)-j] (smallest available).

Then, choose the larger one and proceed.

This seems to be a correct implementation of the greedy approach I thought of earlier.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
