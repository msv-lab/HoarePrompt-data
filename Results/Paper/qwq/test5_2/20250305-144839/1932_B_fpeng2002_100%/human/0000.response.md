Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign appears every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign appears, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But the tribe waits for each sign to occur strictly after the previous one. So, if the first sign occurs in year x, they start waiting for the second sign from year x+1 onwards.

My task is to find out in which year the nth sign will occur, given that all signs must occur in this sequential manner.

Let me look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 6

a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]

And the output is 36.

Let's see how this works:

- The first sign occurs every 3 years (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...)

- The second sign occurs every 2 years (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ...)

- The third sign occurs every 4 years (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, ...)

- The fourth sign occurs every 5 years (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...)

- The fifth sign occurs every 9 years (9, 18, 27, 36, ...)

- The sixth sign occurs every 18 years (18, 36, 54, ...)

Now, the tribe waits for the first sign. The first sign occurs in year 3.

Then, starting from year 4, they wait for the second sign. The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 4 is a multiple of 2).

Next, starting from year 5, they wait for the third sign. The third sign occurs in year 8.

Then, starting from year 9, they wait for the fourth sign, which occurs in year 10.

Then, starting from year 11, they wait for the fifth sign, which occurs in year 18.

Finally, starting from year 19, they wait for the sixth sign, which occurs in year 36.

So, the nth sign, which is the sixth sign, occurs in year 36.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, I need to generalize this for any n and any list of a_i.

So, the approach should be:

1. Start from year 0.

2. For each sign from the first to the nth:

a. Find the smallest year that is greater than the current year and is a multiple of a_i.

b. Set this year as the new current year.

3. The year when the nth sign occurs is the answer.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I can iterate through the list of a_i, and for each a_i, calculate the smallest multiple that is greater than the current year.

Let's define current_year starting at 0.

For each a_i:

next_occurrence = ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i

if next_occurrence <= current_year:

next_occurrence += a_i

current_year = next_occurrence

Wait, but ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i should already be greater than current_year, unless current_year is a multiple of a_i.

Actually, in Python, I can use math.ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i to get the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than or equal to current_year.

If it's equal, then I need to add one more a_i to make it strictly greater.

So, if current_year is a multiple of a_i, then next_occurrence = current_year + a_i

Else, next_occurrence = ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i

Wait, actually, ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i will give the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than or equal to current_year.

If current_year is a multiple of a_i, then ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i = current_year.

But since we need to wait strictly after the previous sign, if current_year is a multiple of a_i, we should take the next multiple, which is current_year + a_i.

So, the correct way is:

next_occurrence = ceil(current_year / a_i) * a_i

If next_occurrence == current_year, then next_occurrence += a_i

Alternatively, I can write it as:

next_occurrence = (current_year // a_i + 1) * a_i

This way, it always takes the next multiple, ensuring it's strictly greater than current_year if current_year is a multiple of a_i.

Yes, that seems efficient.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

n = 6

a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]

Start with current_year = 0

First sign (a=3):

next_occurrence = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

current_year = 3

Second sign (a=2):

next_occurrence = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4

current_year = 4

Third sign (a=4):

next_occurrence = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 8

current_year = 8

Fourth sign (a=5):

next_occurrence = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 10

current_year = 10

Fifth sign (a=9):

next_occurrence = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 18

current_year = 18

Sixth sign (a=18):

next_occurrence = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = (1 + 1) * 18 = 36

current_year = 36

So, the answer is 36, which matches the example.

Let's check another example:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Start with current_year = 0

First sign (a=1):

next_occurrence = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (0 + 1) * 1 = 1

current_year = 1

Second sign (a=2):

next_occurrence = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (0 + 1) * 2 = 2

current_year = 2

Third sign (a=3):

next_occurrence = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

current_year = 3

Fourth sign (a=4):

next_occurrence = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (0 + 1) * 4 = 4

current_year = 4

Fifth sign (a=5):

next_occurrence = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (0 + 1) * 5 = 5

current_year = 5

So, the answer is 5, which matches the example.

Another example:

n = 5

a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Start with current_year = 0

First sign (a=1):

next_occurrence = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1

current_year = 1

Second sign (a=1):

next_occurrence = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (1 + 1) * 1 = 2

current_year = 2

Third sign (a=1):

next_occurrence = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (2 + 1) * 1 = 3

current_year = 3

Fourth sign (a=1):

next_occurrence = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (3 + 1) * 1 = 4

current_year = 4

Fifth sign (a=1):

next_occurrence = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (4 + 1) * 1 = 5

current_year = 5

Again, the answer is 5, which matches the example.

Last example:

n = 6

a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]

Start with current_year = 0

First sign (a=50):

next_occurrence = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50

current_year = 50

Second sign (a=30):

next_occurrence = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = (1 + 1) * 30 = 60

current_year = 60

Third sign (a=711):

next_occurrence = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = (0 + 1) * 711 = 711

current_year = 711

Fourth sign (a=200):

next_occurrence = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = (3 + 1) * 200 = 800

current_year = 800

Fifth sign (a=503):

next_occurrence = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = (1 + 1) * 503 = 1006

current_year = 1006

Sixth sign (a=1006):

next_occurrence = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = (1 + 1) * 1006 = 2012

current_year = 2012

So, the answer is 2012, which matches the example.

Seems like the logic is sound.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

Given that t can be up to 1000 and n up to 100, and a_i up to 10^6, efficiency shouldn't be a major concern here, as the operations are straightforward and not nested.

I need to read t, then for each test case, read n and then the list of a_i.

Initialize current_year to 0, then iterate through the list of a_i, updating current_year each time as described.

Finally, print the current_year for each test case.

I should also make sure to handle the input correctly, especially handling multiple test cases.

Let me think about edge cases:

- n = 1: Only one sign, so the year is a_1.

- a_i = 1: Signs occur every year, so the nth sign occurs in year n.

- a_i varies, including cases where a_i divides a_j for some j.

- a_i = same values: For example, all a_i are the same.

Let me test with n=1, a=[5]: The answer should be 5.

n=1

a=[5]

current_year = 0

First sign (a=5):

next_occurrence = (0 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5

current_year = 5

So, output 5. Correct.

Another edge case: n=2, a=[2, 3]

Start with current_year = 0

First sign (a=2):

next_occurrence = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2

current_year = 2

Second sign (a=3):

next_occurrence = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

current_year = 3

So, output 3.

Another edge case: n=3, a=[4, 2, 6]

Start with current_year = 0

First sign (a=4):

next_occurrence = (0 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4

current_year = 4

Second sign (a=2):

next_occurrence = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 6

current_year = 6

Third sign (a=6):

next_occurrence = (6 // 6 + 1) * 6 = (1 + 1) * 6 = 12

current_year = 12

So, output 12.

Seems consistent.

I think this approach is correct.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the year in which the nth sign occurs, given that each sign occurs at periodic intervals and must occur sequentially after the previous sign.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each sign i occurs every a_i years.
   - We need to wait for each sign to occur strictly after the previous one.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Start from year 0.
   - For each sign from the first to the nth:
     - Calculate the smallest year that is greater than the current year and is a multiple of a_i.
     - Update the current year to this new year.
   - The year when the nth sign occurs is the answer.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Use integer division and ceiling operations to find the next occurrence year for each sign.
   - Ensure that for each sign, we start waiting from the year immediately after the previous sign occurred.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        start_year = 0
        for a in nums:
            next_occurrence = (start_year // a + 1) * a
            if next_occurrence <= start_year:
                next_occurrence += a
            start_year = next_occurrence
        print(start_year)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling:**
  - Read the input in one go and split it into a list for easier access.
  - Parse the number of test cases (t).
  - For each test case, read the number of signs (n) and the list of their periodicities (a_i).

- **Calculating Next Occurrence:**
  - For each sign, calculate the next occurrence year using the formula `(start_year // a + 1) * a` which gives the smallest multiple of `a` greater than `start_year`.
  - Update the start year to this next occurrence year.

- **Output:**
  - Print the year in which the nth sign occurs for each test case.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the year of the nth sign's occurrence by sequentially waiting for each sign to happen after the previous one.
