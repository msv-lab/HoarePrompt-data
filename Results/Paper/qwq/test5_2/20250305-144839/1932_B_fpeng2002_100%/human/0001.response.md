Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign occurs every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on.

First, I need to understand how the signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But according to the problem, the tribe waits for each sign to occur one after another, in sequence.

So, for example, if n=3 and a=[2,3,4], here's how it should work:

1. Wait for the first sign to occur. It occurs in years 2, 4, 6, etc. So the first occurrence is in year 2.

2. After the first sign occurs in year 2, we start waiting for the second sign from year 3 onwards.

3. The second sign occurs in years 3, 6, 9, etc. So the first occurrence after year 2 is in year 3.

4. After the second sign occurs in year 3, we start waiting for the third sign from year 4 onwards.

5. The third sign occurs in years 4, 8, 12, etc. So the first occurrence after year 3 is in year 4.

Therefore, the third sign occurs in year 4, and that's when the apocalypse happens.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, for n=6 and a=[3,2,4,5,9,18], the answer is 36. Let's see how that works.

1. First sign occurs in years 3,6,9,...

2. Let's say it occurs in year 3.

3. Then we wait for the second sign starting from year 4.

4. The second sign occurs in years 2,4,6,...

5. So the first occurrence after year 3 is in year 4.

6. Then we wait for the third sign starting from year 5.

7. The third sign occurs in years 4,8,12,...

8. The first occurrence after year 4 is in year 8.

9. Then we wait for the fourth sign starting from year 9.

10. The fourth sign occurs in years 5,10,15,...

11. The first occurrence after year 8 is in year 10.

12. Then we wait for the fifth sign starting from year 11.

13. The fifth sign occurs in years 9,18,27,...

14. The first occurrence after year 10 is in year 18.

15. Then we wait for the sixth sign starting from year 19.

16. The sixth sign occurs in years 18,36,54,...

17. The first occurrence after year 18 is in year 36.

So, the sixth sign occurs in year 36, which matches the example.

Now, I need to generalize this process. For each sign, we need to find the earliest year it occurs after the previous sign has occurred.

So, for each sign i from 1 to n:

- Find the smallest year y such that y is greater than the year the previous sign occurred, and y is a multiple of a_i.

- Set the year for sign i to be y.

- Proceed to the next sign, starting the search from y + 1.

But implementing this directly might be inefficient for large n or large a_i, since n can be up to 100 and a_i up to 10^6. So, I need a smarter way.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I have the year when the k-th sign occurs, and I need to find the year when the (k+1)-th sign occurs.

Given that the k-th sign occurs in year y_k, I need to find the smallest y_{k+1} such that:

- y_{k+1} > y_k

- y_{k+1} is a multiple of a_{k+1}

So, y_{k+1} is the smallest multiple of a_{k+1} that is greater than y_k.

How do I find the smallest multiple of a_{k+1} greater than y_k?

Well, if y_k is already a multiple of a_{k+1}, then y_{k+1} = y_k + a_{k+1}.

Otherwise, y_{k+1} = (y_k // a_{k+1} + 1) * a_{k+1}

In Python, using integer division, this would be:

y_{k+1} = (y_k // a_{k+1} + 1) * a_{k+1}

This formula works whether y_k is a multiple of a_{k+1} or not.

So, starting from y=0, for each sign, calculate the next y using this formula, and finally return the year when the n-th sign occurs.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Start with y=0

1. For sign 1 (a=3):

- y = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

2. For sign 2 (a=2):

- y = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4

3. For sign 3 (a=4):

- y = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 8

4. For sign 4 (a=5):

- y = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (1 + 1) * 5 = 10

5. For sign 5 (a=9):

- y = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = (1 + 1) * 9 = 18

6. For sign 6 (a=18):

- y = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = (1 + 1) * 18 = 36

Yes, this matches the example.

Let's check another example:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Start with y=0

1. For sign 1 (a=1):

- y = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = (0 + 1) * 1 = 1

2. For sign 2 (a=2):

- y = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (0 + 1) * 2 = 2

3. For sign 3 (a=3):

- y = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = (0 + 1) * 3 = 3

4. For sign 4 (a=4):

- y = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (0 + 1) * 4 = 4

5. For sign 5 (a=5):

- y = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = (0 + 1) * 5 = 5

So, the answer is 5, which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Start with y=0

1. For sign 1 (a=1):

- y = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1

2. For sign 2 (a=1):

- y = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2

3. For sign 3 (a=1):

- y = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3

4. For sign 4 (a=1):

- y = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4

5. For sign 5 (a=1):

- y = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5

Again, the answer is 5, matching the sample output.

Last example:

n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

Start with y=0

1. For sign 1 (a=50):

- y = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50

2. For sign 2 (a=30):

- y = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = (1 + 1) * 30 = 60

3. For sign 3 (a=711):

- y = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = (0 + 1) * 711 = 711

4. For sign 4 (a=200):

- y = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = (3 + 1) * 200 = 800

5. For sign 5 (a=503):

- y = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = (1 + 1) * 503 = 1006

6. For sign 6 (a=1006):

- y = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = (1 + 1) * 1006 = 2012

Which matches the sample output.

So, this formula seems to work for all the sample inputs.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

num_tests = int(input())

while num_tests > 0:

num_tests -= 1

n = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

start_year = 0

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

print(start_year)

This seems to match the logic I derived. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list of a_i's. It initializes start_year to 0, then iteratively computes the next year for each sign using the formula (start_year // a_i + 1) * a_i, and finally prints the year when the n-th sign occurs.

I don't see any errors in this implementation. It seems to correctly capture the logic needed to solve the problem.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
