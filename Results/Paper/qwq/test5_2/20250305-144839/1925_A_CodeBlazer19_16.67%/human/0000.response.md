Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N seems to represent the length of the strings that I need to form using the first K lowercase English alphabets. And I need to create a string S such that all possible strings of length N from those K alphabets are subsequences of S. Moreover, I need the smallest possible S, and if there are multiple, any one of them is acceptable.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Given that, I need to make sure that every possible combination of length N from the first K alphabets is a subsequence of S.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

Input: 1 2

Output: ab

Possible strings of length 1 using 'a' and 'b': "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab" as subsequences.

Second test case:

Input: 2 1

Output: aa

Possible strings: only "aa" since K=1, and it's present in "aa".

Third test case:

Input: 2 2

Output: baab

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All of these are supposed to be subsequences of "baab", as explained in the note.

Fourth test case:

Input: 2 3

Output: abcbac

Possible strings: all combinations of two letters from 'a', 'b', 'c', which are 9 in total, and they are all supposed to be subsequences of "abcbac".

Okay, so the goal is to construct S in such a way that it contains all possible combinations of length N from the first K alphabets as subsequences, and I need the smallest such S.

I need to think about how to minimize the length of S while ensuring that all these combinations are subsequences.

Let me consider the brute-force approach first. If I were to list all possible combinations of length N from the K alphabets and concatenate them together, that would certainly include all of them as subsequences, but that would not be minimal, especially since there could be overlaps between the combinations.

For example, in the third test case, instead of writing "ba" and "ab" separately as "baab", which is shorter than "baab" but seems already optimized.

Wait, "baab" is already quite short. Let's see:

- "baab" has "ba" and "ab" as subsequences, and also "aa" and "bb" as subsequences.

So, it's including all four possible combinations of length 2 from 'a' and 'b'.

I need to find a general way to construct S for any N and K.

Let me think about the structure of S.

One idea is to construct a de Bruijn sequence. A de Bruijn sequence for an alphabet of size K and subsequences of length N is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length N appears exactly once.

However, in this problem, we're dealing with subsequences, not substrings. So, it's a bit different from the standard de Bruijn sequence, which deals with substrings.

Wait, the problem is about subsequences, not substrings. So, the standard de Bruijn sequence might not directly apply here.

Let me think differently.

If I have to include all possible combinations of length N from K letters as subsequences, I need to ensure that for each combination, the characters appear in S in the correct order, possibly with other characters in between.

One way to ensure this is to generate a string that contains all permutations of the K letters in some order, but that might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a greedy approach, where I try to maximize the number of combinations covered with each addition to S.

But that might be too time-consuming, especially since T can be up to 676, and N and K can be up to 26.

Wait, T is up to 676, which is 26*26, so possibly covering all combinations of N and K up to 26.

I need an efficient way to generate S for any N and K.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula that can generate S based on N and K.

Looking back at the examples:

- For N=1, K=2: "ab"

- For N=1, K=1: "a"

- For N=2, K=1: "aa"

- For N=2, K=2: "baab"

- For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

I need to see if there's a pattern here.

Wait, for N=1, it's just the sequence of the first K letters.

For N=2, K=1, it's "aa".

For N=2, K=2, it's "baab".

For N=2, K=3, it's "abcbac".

I need to see how these are constructed.

Let me consider that for N=1, S is just the first K letters.

For N=2, maybe it's a repetition of some pattern involving these letters.

Wait, perhaps for N=2, it's a concatenation of all possible pairs, but optimized to minimize the length by overlapping where possible.

Wait, but that sounds similar to a de Bruijn sequence, but again, for subsequences, not substrings.

Maybe I need to think in terms of graph theory, where each state represents the progress towards forming a particular subsequence, and I need to find the shortest path that covers all required states.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the number of possible sequences of length N from K letters. There are K^N such sequences since it's with replacement and order matters.

I need to have all of these K^N sequences as subsequences of S.

I need to minimize the length of S.

I recall that for strings, the minimal superstring that contains all possible combinations of a certain length can be found using de Bruijn sequences, but again, that's for substrings, not subsequences.

This seems different.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node represents a partial sequence, and edges represent the addition of a character.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have a string S that contains all sequences of length N-1 as subsequences. Then, to make it contain all sequences of length N, I need to add characters in such a way that combined with the existing subsequences of length N-1, I get all possible length N subsequences.

This seems vague.

Maybe I need to look for existing research on this problem.

A quick search tells me that finding the minimal supersequence that contains all possible subsequences of a certain length is a non-trivial problem.

In fact, it's related to the concept of a universal sequence for subsequences.

I found that for subsequences, the minimal length of such a sequence is known and can be calculated.

Specifically, for an alphabet of size K and subsequences of length N, the minimal length of a string that contains all possible N-length subsequences is K + (N-1)*(K-1).

Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify with the examples.

For N=1, K=2: minimal length should be 2, which matches "ab".

For N=2, K=1: minimal length should be 2, which matches "aa".

For N=2, K=2: minimal length should be 2 + (2-1)*(2-1) = 2 + 1*1 = 3, but the example given is "baab" which has length 4. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, maybe my formula is wrong.

Let me try another formula.

I recall that for universal cycles for subsequences, the minimal length might be different.

Wait, perhaps the minimal length is N*K.

But for N=1, K=2: 2, which matches.

N=2, K=1: 2, which matches.

N=2, K=2: 4, which matches "baab".

N=2, K=3: 6, but the example given is "abcbac" which has length 6.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, N=2, K=3, output is "abcbac" which has length 6, and according to the formula N*K=6, which matches.

So perhaps the minimal length is N*K.

But wait, for N=3, K=2, N*K=6, but what would be the minimal S?

Let's think about it.

Possible sequences of length 3 from 'a' and 'b': "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb".

I need to have all of these as subsequences of S.

If S has length 6, is that possible?

For example, "aaabbb" would contain "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb" as subsequences.

Wait, does it?

Let's check:

- "aaa": positions 1,2,3

- "aab": positions 1,2,4

- "aba": positions 1,4,5

- "abb": positions 1,4,6

- "baa": positions 3,4,5

- "bab": positions 3,4,6

- "bba": positions 3,5,6

- "bbb": positions 4,5,6

So yes, "aaabbb" contains all 8 sequences as subsequences.

So, for N=3, K=2, minimal length seems to be 6, which is N*K=6.

Similarly, for N=2, K=3, minimal length is 6.

For N=1, K=2, minimal length is 2.

For N=2, K=1, minimal length is 2.

For N=2, K=2, minimal length is 4.

So, it seems that the minimal length is K + (N-1)*(K-1).

Wait, earlier I thought it was N*K, but for N=2, K=2, N*K=4, which matches, and for N=3, K=2, N*K=6, which matches.

Wait, but K + (N-1)*(K-1) for N=2, K=2: 2 + (2-1)*(2-1) = 2 + 1*1 = 3, but earlier we saw that minimal length is 4 for N=2, K=2.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

Let me verify with N=2, K=2.

From the third test case, S="baab", which has length 4.

Is there a shorter string that contains all 4 possible sequences ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") as subsequences?

Let's see if there's a string of length 3 that can contain all 4.

Take "aab":

- "aa": positions 1,2

- "ab": positions 1,3

- "ba": positions 2,3

- "bb": not present

So, "aab" doesn't contain "bb".

Take "aba":

- "aa": positions 1,3

- "ab": positions 1,2

- "ba": positions 2,3

- "bb": not present

Missing "bb".

Take "baa":

- "aa": positions 2,3

- "ab": not present

- "ba": positions 1,2

- "bb": not present

Missing "ab" and "bb".

Take "abb":

- "aa": not present

- "ab": positions 1,2

- "ba": positions 2,3

- "bb": positions 2,3

Missing "aa".

Seems like in all 3-letter strings, at least one of the 4 sequences is missing.

Hence, length 4 is indeed minimal for N=2, K=2.

But according to N*K, it's 4, which matches.

For N=3, K=2, N*K=6, which matches the earlier example.

So perhaps the minimal length is N*K.

But for N=1, K=2, N*K=2, which matches.

For N=2, K=1, N*K=2, which matches.

For N=2, K=2, N*K=4, which matches.

For N=2, K=3, N*K=6, which matches.

So, it seems that the minimal length is N*K.

Therefore, the minimal S has length N*K.

Now, I need to construct such an S.

Given that, for K=1, S is just N repetitions of the single letter.

For K=2, S is N*2 letters, alternating between the two letters.

Wait, in the third test case, N=2, K=2, S="baab", which has 4 letters.

Similarly, for N=2, K=3, S="abcbac", which has 6 letters.

I need to find a way to generate such strings.

One way to think about it is to have a string that repeats each letter N times in some order.

Wait, but in "baab", it's 'b','a','a','b'.

It's not exactly repeating each letter N times.

Wait, 'b' appears twice, 'a' appears twice.

Similarly, in "abcbac", 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice, 'c' appears twice, but arranged in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to have each letter appear N times, but interleaved in such a way that all combinations are covered.

Wait, in "baab", 'b' appears twice, 'a' appears twice.

In "abcbac", 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice, 'c' appears twice.

So, it seems that for general N and K, S consists of each of the K letters appearing N times, in some order.

Hence, total length is N*K.

Now, I need to find an arrangement of these letters such that all possible N-length sequences from the K letters are present as subsequences.

I need to find a way to arrange these letters to maximize the coverage of the sequences.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps there's a standard way to arrange them.

Wait, maybe it's to arrange them in a specific pattern, like interleaving them.

For example, for K=2, N=2: "baab".

Here, it's 'b','a','a','b'.

Similarly, for K=3, N=2: "abcbac".

Which is 'a','b','c','b','a','c'.

I need to see if there's a pattern here.

In "baab", for K=2, N=2:

- 'b' appears twice, 'a' appears twice.

- The positions are: 1:'b', 2:'a', 3:'a', 4:'b'

In "abcbac", for K=3, N=2:

- 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice, 'c' appears twice.

- Positions: 1:'a', 2:'b', 3:'c', 4:'b', 5:'a', 6:'c'

It seems like the letters are arranged in a way that they are interleaved, with repetitions.

I need to find a general way to arrange the letters for any N and K.

Let me consider that for N=1, it's just the sequence of the first K letters.

For N>=1, perhaps it's a specific arrangement where each letter is repeated N times, but interleaved.

Wait, perhaps it's a generalized de Bruijn sequence for subsequences.

But again, de Bruijn sequences are for substrings, not subsequences.

I need to find a way to arrange the letters such that each combination of N letters appears as a subsequence at least once.

This seems similar to covering codes or something in coding theory.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a problem of finding a string that has all possible combinations of N letters from K as subsequences, and minimize the length.

Given that, perhaps the minimal length is indeed N*K, and arranging the letters in a specific interleaved pattern achieves this.

Given that, perhaps for K=1, S is just N times that letter.

For K>=2, perhaps it's arranging the letters in a specific pattern where each letter is repeated N times in an interleaved manner.

But I need to confirm if this is correct.

Looking back at the examples:

- For N=1, K=2: "ab"

- For N=2, K=1: "aa"

- For N=2, K=2: "baab"

- For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

I need to see if there's a pattern in how these are constructed.

In "baab", for K=2, N=2:

- 'b' appears at positions 1 and 4

- 'a' appears at positions 2 and 3

In "abcbac", for K=3, N=2:

- 'a' at positions 1,5

- 'b' at positions 2,4

- 'c' at positions 3,6

It seems like for K=2, N=2, "baab" has the letters interleaved, with each letter appearing twice.

Similarly, for K=3, N=2, "abcbac" has each letter appearing twice, in an interleaved manner.

Perhaps, in general, for N=1, S is just the sequence of the first K letters.

For N>1, S is constructed by arranging the letters in a specific order, with each letter appearing N times, in a way that maximizes the coverage of the combinations.

But I need a concrete way to generate S for any N and K.

Let me consider that for N=1, S is just the first K letters.

For N=2, S is arranged such that each letter appears twice, interleaved.

Wait, but in "baab", 'b' appears at both ends, and 'a' in the middle.

Similarly, in "abcbac", each letter appears twice, with the second occurrence coming after the first occurrences of the others.

Maybe it's some kind of round-robin arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's arranging the letters in a specific graph where nodes are the letters and edges represent the order.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to find S of minimal length N*K that contains all possible N-length sequences from the first K letters as subsequences.

Given that, perhaps the way to construct S is to take the first letter N times, then the second letter N times, and so on up to the Kth letter.

Wait, but in the third test case, it's "baab", which is not 'a' repeated twice followed by 'b' repeated twice.

It's 'b','a','a','b'.

Similarly, "abcbac" is not 'a' twice, 'b' twice, 'c' twice in that order.

So, that approach doesn't match the examples.

Alternatively, maybe it's alternating the letters.

But "baab" is 'b','a','a','b', which is a kind of alternation.

Similarly, "abcbac" alternates between different letters.

Wait, perhaps for K=2, it's arranging the letters in a specific pattern like 'b','a','a','b'.

But I need a general method.

Let me think about the structure required for S to contain all N-length sequences as subsequences.

Each sequence of N letters needs to appear in S in order, possibly with other letters in between.

To minimize the length of S, I need to maximize the overlap between different sequences.

This sounds similar to the concept of a supersequence that covers all possible sequences.

I recall that for subsequences, the minimal length can be achieved by constructing a string where each letter appears N times, and arranged such that for any sequence of N letters, there are positions in S that match the sequence in order.

Given that, perhaps for K=2, N=2, "baab" is one such arrangement.

Similarly, for K=3, N=2, "abcbac" is another.

But I need a general way to construct S for any N and K.

Let me consider that for N=1, S is just the first K letters.

For N=2, perhaps it's arranging the letters in a specific pattern where each letter is followed by the others in a certain order.

Wait, perhaps it's arranging the letters in a specific graph where edges represent the transitions between letters.

This seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a greedy approach, where I try to add letters to S in a way that covers as many uncovered sequences as possible at each step.

But that might not lead to the minimal S.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that finding the minimal S is non-trivial and look for a pattern in the examples.

Looking back at the examples:

- For N=1, K=2: "ab"

- For N=2, K=1: "aa"

- For N=2, K=2: "baab"

- For N=2, K=3: "abcbac"

I need to see if there's a pattern in how these are constructed.

In "baab", for K=2, N=2:

- 'b' appears first, then 'a', then 'a', then 'b'.

Similarly, in "abcbac", for K=3, N=2:

- 'a', 'b', 'c', 'b', 'a', 'c'

It seems like the letters are arranged in a way that they are interleaved, with some repetition.

Wait, perhaps for K letters and N=2, S is arranged such that it starts with the last letter, followed by the first letter, then the first letter again, then the last letter.

Wait, in "baab", it's 'b','a','a','b'.

Similarly, for K=3, N=2: "abcbac".

Wait, maybe it's not following that pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps it's arranging the letters in a specific order based on their positions.

This is getting too speculative.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that constructing the minimal S is non-trivial and look for an efficient way to generate S that works, even if it's not the minimal in all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard formula or algorithm for this problem that I'm not aware of.

Given that, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for N=1, S is just the sequence of the first K letters.

For N=2, perhaps it's the sequence of the first K letters, followed by the sequence of the first K letters again, but arranged in a specific way.

Wait, in "baab", it's 'b','a','a','b', which is not exactly two repetitions of "ba".

Similarly, in "abcbac", it's not two repetitions of "abc".

Perhaps, for K=2, N=2, "baab" can be seen as 'b','a','a','b', which is 'b' followed by 'a' repeated twice, followed by 'b'.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's constructing S by repeating a specific pattern related to N and K.

Given that, perhaps for general N and K, S can be constructed by repeating the sequence of the first K letters, N times.

Wait, but in the third test case, N=2, K=2, "baab" is not 'a','b' repeated twice.

It's 'b','a','a','b'.

Similarly, for N=2, K=3, "abcbac" is not 'a','b','c' repeated twice.

It's 'a','b','c','b','a','c'.

So, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's arranging the letters in a specific order based on their indices.

This is getting too vague.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that constructing the minimal S is complex and look for a way to generate S that is correct, even if not minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that for N=1, S is the sequence of the first K letters, and for N=2, it's a specific arrangement of the letters repeated twice in a certain order.

Given that, perhaps for general N and K, S can be constructed by arranging the letters in a specific pattern where each letter is repeated N times, arranged in a way that maximizes the coverage of the sequences.

But I need a concrete way to implement this.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

s = ''

for j in range(97, k + 97):

s += chr(j)

if k == 1:

print(n * s)

else:

print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)

So, it's generating s as the first K letters from 'a' to the Kth letter, and then:

- If K == 1, it prints s repeated N times.

- Else, it prints s repeated (2 - (n == 1)) times.

Wait, (2 - (n == 1)) means:

- If N == 1, it's 2 - 1 = 1.

- If N > 1, it's 2 - 0 = 2.

So, for K == 1:

- Print s repeated N times.

For K > 1:

- If N == 1, print s once.

- If N > 1, print s repeated twice.

Looking back at the examples:

- For N=1, K=2: s = 'ab', printed once: "ab"

- For N=2, K=1: s = 'a', printed twice: "aa"

- For N=2, K=2: s = 'ab', printed twice: "abab"

- For N=2, K=3: s = 'abc', printed twice: "abcabc"

But in the third test case, the expected output is "baab", which is different from "abab".

Similarly, for N=2, K=3, the expected output is "abcbac", which is different from "abcabc".

Hence, this code is not generating the correct S for K > 1 and N > 1.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
