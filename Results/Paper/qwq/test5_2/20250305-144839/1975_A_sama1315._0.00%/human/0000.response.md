Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Mocha has an array of positive integers, and she can perform this specific operation on it any number of times. The operation is to split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix—and swap them. After doing this operation as many times as she wants, including zero times, she wants to know if the array can become sorted in non-decreasing order.

First, I need to understand what this operation does. Splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them sounds like a rotation. For example, if you have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and you choose to split after the first two elements, you get [1, 2] and [3, 4, 5], and swapping them gives [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. So, it's like rotating the array.

But wait, in the problem description, it says "split the array into two parts—a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts." So, it's not just any split; it's specifically splitting into a prefix and a suffix and then swapping them. That means that the order within each part remains the same, only their positions change.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

6

1 1 4 5 1 4

5

7 9 2 2 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

No

Yes

Yes

In the first test case, n=6, array=[1,1,4,5,1,4]. The output is "No", meaning it's impossible to make this array non-decreasing by performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, n=5, array=[7,9,2,2,3]. The output is "Yes", and there's an explanation provided about how to perform the operations to make it non-decreasing.

In the third test case, n=3, array=[1,2,3], which is already sorted, so "Yes".

So, my task is to determine, for each test case, whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation any number of times.

Now, I need to think about what this operation allows me to do. Since I can perform it any number of times, I should consider what sequences of operations can achieve.

Let's consider that each operation is a rotation of the array by a certain number of positions. For example, splitting after the first k elements and swapping the prefix and suffix is equivalent to rotating the array by k positions.

In general, rotating an array multiple times can allow me to arrange the elements in different orders, but it's not arbitrary; it's cyclic in nature.

Wait, but actually, rotation is a cyclic shift, and performing multiple rotations is equivalent to a single rotation by the net number of shifts.

But in this problem, the operation is not a standard rotation; it's swapping the prefix and suffix, which is different.

Let me think again.

If I have an array a = [a1, a2, ..., an], and I split it into x = [a1, a2, ..., ak] and y = [ak+1, ..., an], then swapping them gives y + x = [ak+1, ..., an, a1, a2, ..., ak].

So, it's like rotating the array, but in a specific way.

Wait, no, it's not exactly a rotation. In a standard rotation, you shift elements by k positions to the left or right, and the elements wrap around.

In this operation, you're taking the first k elements, moving them to the end, and vice versa.

Wait, no, specifically, you're swapping the prefix and the suffix.

So, if you have a = [a1, a2, ..., ak, ak+1, ..., an], and you set a := y + x = [ak+1, ..., an, a1, a2, ..., ak].

This is equivalent to a circular shift where you move the prefix to the end.

But in standard rotation, if you rotate left by k positions, it's [k+1, k+2, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., k].

Similarly, rotating right by k positions is [n-k+1, n-k+2, ..., n, 1, 2, ..., n-k].

In this problem, swapping prefix and suffix is similar to rotating left by k positions, but with a specific k.

Wait, but in the problem, k can be any value from 0 to n.

Wait, no, k can be from 0 to n-1, since x can be empty to the entire array except the last element.

So, this operation allows us to perform any rotation that is a swap of a prefix and a suffix.

Now, the key is to understand what permutations of the array can be achieved by performing this operation multiple times.

In group theory, the set of all rotations of an array forms a cyclic group, and any rotation can be achieved by performing the rotation operation repeatedly.

But in this case, the operation is not a single rotation but a swap of prefix and suffix.

Wait, but in the problem, you can choose different k for each operation, so it's not just repeating the same rotation; you can choose different splits each time.

This makes it more flexible.

I need to think about what permutations can be achieved by performing these operations.

Let's consider that each operation is a transposition of two parts of the array, but the parts are required to be prefix and suffix.

This seems quite restrictive.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this operation as generating a certain group of permutations.

But maybe there's a simpler way to think about it.

Let me consider that performing this operation multiple times allows me to rearrange the array in certain ways, and I need to see if I can rearrange it into a sorted order.

Another way to approach this is to consider that the operation allows me to change the starting point of the array, similar to rotating it, but with more flexibility because I can choose different k each time.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], it's "No", meaning it cannot be sorted by any sequence of operations.

In the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], it's "Yes", and the explanation shows a sequence of operations that sort it.

In the third test case, [1,2,3], it's already sorted, so "Yes".

I need to find a general way to determine if a given array can be sorted by performing these operations.

Let me think about the properties of the array after performing these operations.

Each operation is splitting the array into x and y, then setting a := y + x.

So, it's like reversing the order of x and y.

But not exactly reversing; it's swapping their positions.

So, if I have a = x + y, then a becomes y + x.

If I perform this operation again, it becomes x + y again, so it's an involution; performing it twice brings it back to the original.

This means that each operation is its own inverse.

So, the sequence of operations can be thought of as applying different splits in sequence.

But since each operation is its own inverse, it complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of cycles.

If I perform a sequence of these operations, I can represent the permutation induced on the array's indices.

But this seems a bit too abstract for now.

Maybe I can look for a pattern or invariant in the array that remains unchanged no matter how many operations I perform.

An invariant would help me determine if the array can be sorted.

For example, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], it's "No", so there must be something inherent in this array that prevents it from being sorted via these operations.

In the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], it's "Yes", meaning there's a way to arrange it into non-decreasing order using these operations.

Let me try to see what's common in the "Yes" cases and what's different in the "No" cases.

One thing I notice is that in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], the smallest elements are not all at the beginning, but by performing operations, we can rearrange them.

In the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], it's "No", perhaps because there's no way to arrange the 1s and 4s to make it non-decreasing.

Wait, but [1,1,4,5,1,4] does have some order, but it's not fully sorted.

Let me try to sort it manually.

If I perform the operation with x=[1,1,4], y=[5,1,4], then a becomes [5,1,4,1,1,4].

Is this closer to being sorted? No, it's not.

Another operation: x=[5], y=[1,4,1,1,4], a becomes [1,4,1,1,4,5].

Still not sorted.

Another operation: x=[1,4], y=[1,1,4,5], a becomes [1,1,4,5,1,4], which is back to the original.

So, it seems like I'm cycling through a few permutations but not achieving the sorted order.

In contrast, in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], as per the explanation, they perform operations to reach [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, there must be a way to identify which arrays can be sorted via these operations.

Let me consider the array as a circular list, since the operations allow me to rotate and rearrange in a circular fashion.

In that case, perhaps the array can be sorted if there exists a rotation that makes it sorted.

But wait, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], is there any rotation that makes it sorted?

Let's try rotating it:

Original: [1,1,4,5,1,4]

Rotate left by 1: [1,4,5,1,4,1]

Rotate left by 2: [4,5,1,4,1,1]

Rotate left by 3: [5,1,4,1,1,4]

Rotate left by 4: [1,4,1,1,4,5]

Rotate left by 5: [4,1,1,4,5,1]

Rotate left by 6: [1,1,4,5,1,4] (back to original)

None of these rotations are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Similarly, in the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], let's try rotations:

Original: [7,9,2,2,3]

Rotate left by 1: [9,2,2,3,7]

Rotate left by 2: [2,2,3,7,9] — this is sorted!

So, in this case, there exists a rotation that makes the array sorted.

Similarly, in the third test case, [1,2,3], it's already sorted.

So, perhaps the problem reduces to checking if there exists a rotation of the array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

If that's the case, then the program needs to check for each rotation whether it's sorted.

But with n being up to 50 and t up to 1000, it's feasible to check up to n rotations for each test case.

But let's verify if this is indeed the case.

Looking back at the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], no rotation is sorted, hence "No".

Second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], one rotation is sorted, hence "Yes".

Third test case, [1,2,3], already sorted, hence "Yes".

This seems to hold.

But wait, is this always true?

Is it sufficient to just check all possible rotations to see if any is sorted?

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose I have an array [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted, and I perform the operation with x=[2,2,3] and y=[7,9], swapping to get [7,9,2,2,3], which is the second test case.

Then, by performing the operation again with x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3], swapping to get [9,2,2,3,7].

Then, again with x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7], swapping to get [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted.

So, in this case, by performing operations, I can reach a sorted rotation.

But could there be a case where, even if a sorted rotation exists, I cannot reach it via these operations?

I need to think about whether these operations allow me to reach any rotation.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,1,4,5,1,4], no rotation is sorted, so it's "No".

In the second test case, [7,9,2,2,3], one rotation is sorted, and I can reach it via operations, so "Yes".

In the third test case, [1,2,3], it's already sorted, so "Yes".

So, it seems that checking if there exists a rotation that is sorted is sufficient.

But to confirm, I need to ensure that the operations allow me to reach any rotation.

Wait, but in the first test case, even though no rotation is sorted, does that mean that performing these operations cannot make it sorted?

Yes, because no matter how I perform the operations, I can only reach certain permutations, and if none of them are sorted, then the answer is "No".

In the second test case, there exists at least one rotation that is sorted, and I can reach it via operations, so "Yes".

Hence, the approach seems valid.

Therefore, to solve the problem, for each test case, I need to check all possible rotations of the array and see if any of them is sorted in non-decreasing order.

If at least one rotation is sorted, output "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 seems to be the main function that reads input and calls func_1 for each test case.

func_1 takes an array as input and is supposed to determine if it can be sorted via the operations.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(arr):

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

This seems incorrect.

It first checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, return 'Yes'.

Otherwise, it checks if there is any pair of elements where arr[i] > arr[i+1]. If there is, return 'No'; else, return 'Yes'.

Wait, but if there is no pair where arr[i] > arr[i+1], that means the array is sorted, which aligns with the first condition.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the logic.

Wait, the condition is:

if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):

return 'Yes'

else:

return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

But the else clause seems redundant because if the array is not entirely non-decreasing, it should return 'No'.

Wait, let's consider an array that is not sorted but has no increasing pairs, like [3,2,1], which is decreasing.

In this case, all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1]) is False, so it goes to the else clause.

Then, any(arr[i] > arr[i+1]) is True for [3,2,1], so it returns 'No'.

But according to our earlier reasoning, [3,2,1] is not sorted, and no rotation of it is sorted, so 'No' is correct.

Another example, [2,2,3,7,9], which is sorted, should return 'Yes'.

[7,9,2,2,3], which can be rotated to [2,2,3,7,9], should return 'Yes'.

But according to func_1, it would return 'No' because it's not initially sorted and has arr[i] > arr[i+1] pairs.

Wait, in [7,9,2,2,3], arr[1]=9 > arr[2]=2, so any(arr[i] > arr[i+1]) is True, so it returns 'No', but according to the problem, it should return 'Yes'.

Hence, func_1 is incorrect.

It seems that func_1 only checks if the array is initially sorted or not, and if it's not sorted and has decreasing pairs, it returns 'No', which is incorrect because some arrays, like [7,9,2,2,3], can be sorted via operations.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

To fix this, I need to implement a function that checks all possible rotations of the array and sees if any of them is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here's how I can do it:

def can_be_sorted(arr):

n = len(arr)

for i in range(n):

if all(arr[j] <= arr[(j + 1) % n] for j in range(n)):

return 'Yes'

arr = arr[1:] + arr[:1]  # rotate left by 1

return 'No'

This function iterates through all possible rotations of the array and checks if any rotation is sorted.

If it finds a sorted rotation, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, 'No'.

This should correctly handle all cases.

But in the provided program, func_1 does not do this; it only checks the initial array and doesn't consider rotations.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
