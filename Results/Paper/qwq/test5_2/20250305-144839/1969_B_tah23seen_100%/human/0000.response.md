Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before all the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring. So, for a substring from position l to r, I can move the last character to the front, and shift everything else to the right. Each time I do this, it costs me the length of the substring.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. That means I need to do as few operations as possible, and each operation should be on the smallest possible substring to minimize the cost.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does. Let's take an example. Suppose I have "10". If I perform a cyclic shift on the whole string, it becomes "01", which is sorted, and the cost is 2 because the substring length is 2.

Another example: "110". If I perform a cyclic shift on the last two characters, "10" becomes "01", so the string becomes "101". But that's not sorted yet. If I then perform a cyclic shift on the first two characters, "10" becomes "01", so the string becomes "011", which is sorted. The total cost is 2 (for the first shift) + 2 (for the second shift) = 4.

But is there a better way? Maybe if I shift the entire string "110" once, it becomes "011", which is sorted, with a cost of 3. That's better than 4. So, sometimes shifting the entire string is more efficient.

Wait, in the example provided in the problem, for "11000", the optimal cost is 9, which is 3 shifts of length 3 each. But in my previous example, shifting the entire string of length 3 once gives a cost of 3, which seems better. Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me look at the example in the problem more carefully. For "11000", the operations are:

1. Choose [1,3]: "110" -> "011", so the string becomes "01100"

2. Choose [2,4]: "110" -> "011", so the string becomes "00110"

3. Choose [3,5]: "110" -> "011", so the string becomes "00011"

Each shift costs 3, total cost is 9.

But wait, if I could shift the entire string "11000" by moving the last character to the front, it would be "01100", then "00110", and finally "00011" with three shifts of length 5 each, costing 15, which is worse than 9. So, shifting smaller substrings can be more efficient.

But is there a general way to calculate the minimum cost?

I need to think about what needs to be done to sort the string. Essentially, I need to move all the '0's to the front. Each '0' that is after some '1's needs to be moved past those '1's.

Each cyclic shift allows me to move the last character of a substring to the front of that substring. So, it's like rotating the substring.

I need to find a sequence of such rotations that moves all '0's to the front with minimal total cost.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let's consider that each '0' that is after some '1's needs to be moved before those '1's. Each time I perform a cyclic shift, I can effectively move one character over others.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of inversions. In a sorted array, there are no inversions where a '1' comes after a '0'.

Each '0' that is after a '1' is an inversion that needs to be corrected.

Each cyclic shift can correct some inversions at a cost equal to the length of the substring shifted.

I need to find a way to correct all inversions with minimal total cost.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me think about the positions of '0's and '1's.

Suppose I have a '0' at position i, and there are k '1's before it. To move this '0' before those '1's, I need to perform k shifts, each of which moves the '0' past one '1'.

But each shift can move multiple characters at once, so maybe I can correct multiple inversions in one shift.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have a '0' at position i, and there are k '1's before it. To move this '0' to the front past all k '1's, I can perform k shifts, each shifting a substring that includes this '0' and one '1'.

But that would be costly.

Alternatively, I can perform a single shift on a substring that includes all k '1's and this '0', rotating them in one go.

The cost would be the length of this substring.

Wait, but the substring would include the k '1's and the '0', so the length is k+1.

But, in doing so, I'm moving the '0' past all k '1's in one operation, which costs k+1.

Alternatively, I could perform k operations, each of cost 2, to move the '0' past each '1' one by one.

Total cost would be 2k.

So, which is better?

Well, k+1 vs 2k.

If k >= 2, then k+1 < 2k, so shifting a larger substring is cheaper.

Only if k=1, both options cost the same: 2.

So, it seems better to shift larger substrings when possible.

So, maybe the optimal strategy is to find groups of consecutive '1's followed by a '0', and shift the entire group in one operation.

Wait, but '1's can be anywhere.

Let me think differently.

Let me iterate through the string and count the number of '1's before each '0'. For each '0', the cost to move it before all the '1's is the number of '1's before it plus one (for the '0' itself).

But wait, in reality, some shifts might correct multiple inversions at once.

I need a way to group shifts efficiently.

Maybe I can think of it as bubblesort, where each shift is like swapping two elements, but in this case, each shift can affect multiple elements.

Wait, but shifts are not swaps; they are rotations.

This is getting too confusing.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The reference solution is:

def func_1(s):

cost = 0

one = 0

for i in s:

if i == '1':

one += 1

elif i == '0' and one > 0:

cost += one + 1

return cost

So, it's iterating through the string, counting the number of '1's encountered so far. For each '0' encountered after some '1's, it adds "one + 1" to the cost.

Let me see if this makes sense.

Take the first test case: "10"

- i=0: '1', one=1

- i=1: '0', one=1 > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

Total cost: 2, which matches the example.

Second test case: "0000"

- i=0: '0', one=0, no addition

- i=1: '0', one=0

- i=2: '0', one=0

- i=3: '0', one=0

Total cost: 0, which matches the example.

Third test case: "11000"

- i=0: '1', one=1

- i=1: '1', one=2

- i=2: '0', one=2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- i=3: '0', one=2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost=6

- i=4: '0', one=2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost=9

Which matches the example.

Fourth test case: "101011"

- i=0: '1', one=1

- i=1: '0', one=1 > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

- i=2: '1', one=2

- i=3: '0', one=2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost=5

- i=4: '1', one=3

- i=5: '1', one=4

Total cost: 5, which matches the example.

Fifth test case: "01101001"

- i=0: '0', one=0

- i=1: '1', one=1

- i=2: '1', one=2

- i=3: '0', one=2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3

- i=4: '1', one=3

- i=5: '0', one=3 > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4, total cost=7

- i=6: '0', one=3 > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4, total cost=11

Which matches the example.

So, the function seems to be correct based on the examples.

But why does this work?

Let's try to understand the logic.

The function iterates through the string, keeping track of the number of '1's encountered so far (variable 'one').

For each '0' encountered after some '1's, it adds "one + 1" to the cost.

So, for each '0' that appears after a '1', it costs "one + 1".

What does "one + 1" represent?

Well, "one" is the number of '1's before this '0', and "one + 1" is effectively the number of '1's before it plus the '0' itself.

Wait, in the first test case, "10", there is one '1' before the '0', so cost is 1 + 1 = 2.

In the third test case, "11000", for the first '0', there are two '1's before it, so cost is 2 + 1 = 3.

Similarly, for the next two '0's, the cost is again 2 + 1 = 3 each, total 9.

This seems to suggest that for each '0' that needs to be moved past '1's, the cost is the number of '1's before it plus one.

But why is that?

Is there a relationship between the number of '1's before a '0' and the cost to move that '0' to the front?

Wait, perhaps each '0' that appears after a '1' needs to be moved past all the '1's before it.

So, for each such '0', the minimal cost to move it past all the '1's before it is equal to the number of '1's before it plus one.

But is that accurate?

Wait, in the earlier example, for "11000", the function calculates cost as 3 for each '0', since there are two '1's before each '0'.

But in reality, by shifting the substring [1,3]: "110" -> "011", the string becomes "01100", which corrects one '0' with two '1's before it, at a cost of 3.

Then, shifting [2,4]: "110" -> "011", the string becomes "00110", which corrects another '0' with one '1' before it, at a cost of 3.

Finally, shifting [3,5]: "110" -> "011", the string becomes "00011", at a cost of 3.

Total cost is 9, which matches the function's output.

So, in this case, each '0' that was after some '1's was corrected in a shift that cost "one + 1".

But is this general?

Let me consider another example: "101011"

- i=0: '1', one=1

- i=1: '0', one=1 > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

- i=2: '1', one=2

- i=3: '0', one=2 > 0, cost += 2 + 1 = 3, total cost=5

- i=4: '1', one=3

- i=5: '1', one=4

Total cost: 5

Now, let's see how we can achieve this.

One way is:

1. Shift [1,2]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "011011", cost=2

2. Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "001111", cost=2, total=4

But the function outputs 5, not 4.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my manual calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is overestimating the cost in some cases.

Wait, but in the examples provided, the function's output matches the expected output.

Wait, in the fourth test case, the function outputs 5, and according to the note, it's 5.

So, perhaps my manual calculation is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the function is calculating the total number of inversions in a way.

Each '0' after a '1' represents an inversion, and the cost to fix it is "one + 1".

But I need to verify if this is indeed the minimal cost.

Let me consider a different string: "1110"

According to the function:

- i=0: '1', one=1

- i=1: '1', one=2

- i=2: '1', one=3

- i=3: '0', one=3 > 0, cost += 3 + 1 = 4

Total cost: 4

Now, let's see how to achieve this.

Option 1:

- Shift [1,4]: "1110" -> "0111", cost=4

Total cost: 4, which matches the function.

Option 2:

- Shift [3,4]: "10" -> "01", string becomes "1101", cost=2

- Shift [2,4]: "101" -> "110", string becomes "1110", cost=3, total=5

- Shift [1,4]: "1110" -> "0111", cost=4, total=9

This is worse than the first option.

So, shifting the entire substring once is more efficient here.

Hence, the function seems correct.

Another example: "100"

According to the function:

- i=0: '1', one=1

- i=1: '0', one=1 > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2

- i=2: '0', one=1 > 0, cost += 1 + 1 = 2, total cost=4

Now, let's see how to achieve this.

Option 1:

- Shift [1,3]: "100" -> "001", cost=3

Total cost: 3, which is less than the function's output of 4.

Wait, but according to the function, it's 4.

So, perhaps the function is overestimating in this case.

Wait, but in the problem's examples, the function's output matches the expected output.

So, maybe my manual calculation is wrong.

Wait, in the first test case, "10", function outputs 2, which matches the single shift of cost 2.

In the third test case, "11000", function outputs 9, which matches the three shifts of cost 3 each.

In the fourth test case, "101011", function outputs 5, which matches the note.

In the fifth test case, "01101001", function outputs 11, which matches the note.

So, perhaps in my "100" example, the function outputs 4, but in reality, it can be done with a single shift of cost 3.

Does that mean the function is not always correct?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the function is calculating the cost based on individual '0's moved past all '1's before them, without considering the possibility of grouping multiple '0's in one shift.

In the "100" example, there are two '0's, each needing to pass one '1'. According to the function, cost is 2 + 2 = 4, but in reality, by shifting the entire substring, you can move both '0's past the '1' in one operation, costing 3, which is better than 4.

So, in this case, the function overestimates the cost.

Hence, the function is not always correct.

But in the problem's examples, it seems to work.

Wait, perhaps the function assumes that shifts are done in a way that doesn't group multiple '0's in one shift, but rather handles each '0' separately.

In the "100" example, if I shift [1,2]: "10"->"01", string becomes "010", cost=2

Then shift [2,3]: "10"->"01", string becomes "001", cost=2, total=4

Which matches the function's output.

So, in this case, the function is correct, and the minimal cost is indeed 4.

But earlier, I thought shifting [1,3]: "100"->"001", cost=3, which is better.

But according to the function, it's 4.

So, perhaps shifting the entire substring is not always the minimal cost, or perhaps the function is considering a different set of operations.

Wait, but in the "100" example, shifting [1,3] to get "001" in one step with cost 3 is indeed better than two shifts of cost 2 each, totaling 4.

So, in this case, the function is not giving the minimal cost.

Hence, the function is incorrect.

But in the problem's examples, it seems to match.

Wait, perhaps the function is correct for the problem's examples, but not in general.

But the problem guarantees that the function is correct for the given examples, but in reality, it might not be correct in all cases.

Wait, but in the problem's examples, it seems to match.

Wait, in the fourth test case, "101011", function outputs 5, which matches the note.

But in my "100" example, it seems the function overestimates.

Wait, perhaps my "100" example is not representative, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the function is calculating the cost based on the number of '1's that each '0' needs to pass.

For each '0', it adds "one + 1", where "one" is the number of '1's before it.

So, "one + 1" might represent the cost to move that '0' past all the '1's before it.

But in reality, shifting a larger substring can move multiple '0's past the '1's in one operation.

Hence, the function might be overestimating when multiple '0's can be moved in one shift.

So, perhaps the function is not always correct.

But in the problem's examples, it matches, so maybe the function is correct for the given examples, but not in general.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is correct, and my "100" example is incorrect in assuming that shifting [1,3] is allowed or effective.

Wait, in the "100" example, shifting [1,3]: "100"->"001", which is sorted, cost=3, which is better than the function's output of 4.

So, perhaps the function is not always providing the minimal cost.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
