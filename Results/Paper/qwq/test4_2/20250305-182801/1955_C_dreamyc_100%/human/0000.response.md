Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i, and the Kraken attacks them k times. The attacks alternate between the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time, and when a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.

I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1.

If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the list, which affects who the "first" and "last" ships are for subsequent attacks.

My goal is to simulate this process and count how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

But simulating each attack one by one could be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15. That's way too big for a straightforward simulation.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me think about the pattern of attacks. Since the attacks alternate between the first and last ships, I can think of the attacks in pairs: one on the first and one on the last.

Wait, but k could be odd or even, so I need to handle that carefully.

Maybe I can calculate how many times the first and last ships are attacked, and then see how much durability they lose.

But ships in the middle could also be attacked if the first and last ships are sunk and removed.

This seems complicated. Is there a better way to model this?

Let me consider the total number of attacks, k, and see how they are distributed among the ships.

If I think about the sequence of attacks, it's like attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first, and so on, until k attacks are made or all ships are sunk.

I need to find a way to determine which ships are attacked and how many times each is attacked, without simulating each attack step by step.

Perhaps I can calculate the number of times the first and last ships are attacked before they sink, and then proceed to the next ships.

Wait, maybe I can model this as two pointers: one starting from the beginning and one from the end, and iteratively determine which ship is attacked and how many times before it sinks.

But even that seems too slow for the given constraints.

Let me consider the total durability that needs to be reduced for each ship to sink.

For example, if a ship has durability a_i, it needs to lose a_i durability to sink.

If the Kraken attacks k times, I need to distribute these k attacks between the first and last ships alternately, and account for ships sinking along the way.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a mathematical way to calculate how many ships are sunk without simulating each attack.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have n ships with durabilities a1, a2, ..., an.

The Kraken attacks k times, alternating between the first and last ships.

I need to find out how many ships are sunk after these k attacks.

I need to find an efficient way to handle this, considering the constraints.

Wait, maybe I can use a deque to represent the ships, and repeatedly attack the front and back, removing ships when their durability reaches zero.

But even that might be too slow for n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider precomputing prefix sums.

If I calculate the total durability of all ships, and k is greater than or equal to the sum of all durabilities, then all ships will be sunk.

So, if k >= sum(a), the answer is n.

Otherwise, I need to find how many ships are sunk with k attacks.

So, in the function, it checks if k >= sum(nums), and if so, returns n.

That makes sense.
