Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this grid of squares, each being either white ('W') or black ('B'). I can perform operations on the grid where I select two squares of the same color, and then all the squares in the rectangle defined by those two points get changed to that color.

The goal is to determine whether it's possible, after performing any number of these operations, to make the entire grid have squares of the same color, either all 'W' or all 'B'.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I select two squares of the same color, say both 'W', then all squares in the rectangle between them, including the corners, get set to 'W'. Similarly for 'B'. This operation can be performed any number of times, including zero.

I need to think about what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, it lets me change a rectangular region to a single color, provided that both the starting and ending squares of that rectangle are initially of that color.

I should consider what kind of configurations can be achieved through these operations. For example, if I have a grid that's already uniform, then I don't need to do anything, so the answer is "YES". If not, can I make it uniform using these operations?

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case:

2 1

W

B

So, a 2x1 grid with the first square 'W' and the second 'B'. According to the program, it prints 'NO', which seems correct because there's no way to make both squares the same color. If I try to select both squares, they are different colors, so I can't perform an operation on them. And since the grid is 2x1, there's no other pair to select.

Another example:

1 1

W

A 1x1 grid is already uniform, so 'YES'.

A 2x2 grid:

BB

BB

Already all 'B', so 'YES'.

A 3x4 grid:

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Again, already uniform in a checkerboard pattern, but the program says 'YES', which might be incorrect. Wait, according to the sample output, it's 'YES', but in this pattern, it's alternating, so how can it become uniform?

Wait, perhaps I need to see if there's a way to make all squares the same color.

Let me look at the program's logic.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and m, the grid dimensions, and then reads the grid rows.

Then, it builds two strings: first_row and last_row.

first_row is constructed by taking the first character of each row.

last_row is constructed by taking the last character of each row.

Then, it checks:

1. If the first row is uniform (all same characters), and if it's different from the last row, print 'NO'.

2. If the first_column is uniform and different from the last_column, print 'NO'.

Otherwise, print 'YES'.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking the first row and last row, not first and last columns.

Wait, no, in the code, it's building first_row by concatenating the first character of each row, and last_row by concatenating the last character of each row. So, first_row is actually the leftmost column, and last_row is the rightmost column.

But in the variable names, first_row and last_row suggest rows, but in reality, they are columns.

This seems confusing.

Let me look at the conditions:

- If the first row is uniform and different from the last row, print 'NO'.

- If the first column is uniform and different from the last column, print 'NO'.

- Otherwise, print 'YES'.

I think the intention is to check if the first and last rows are uniform and whether they match.

But in the code, first_row is actually the leftmost column, and last_row is the rightmost column.

This seems like a mistake in variable naming.

Let me try to rephrase the conditions:

- If the first row is uniform and different from the last row, print 'NO'.

- If the first column is uniform and different from the last column, print 'NO'.

- Else, print 'YES'.

But in the code, it's using first_row and last_row, which are actually columns.

Wait, no, in the code:

first_row = ''

last_row = ''

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]  # first character of each row, which is the leftmost column

last_row += a[-1][-1]  # last character of each row, which is the rightmost column

So, first_row is actually the leftmost column, and last_row is the rightmost column.

Then, it checks:

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:

print('NO')

This checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row.

Then, elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:

print('NO')

Else:

print('YES')

So, it's checking two conditions:

1. If the first row is uniform and different from the last row, then 'NO'.

2. If the first column is uniform and different from the last column, then 'NO'.

Else, 'YES'.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about what these conditions mean.

First, if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, then it's impossible to make the grid uniform.

Similarly, if the first column is uniform and different from the last column, then it's impossible.

Otherwise, it's possible.

Is this always true?

Let me consider some cases.

Case 1:

2x1 grid:

W

B

First row is 'W', last row is 'B'. First row is uniform, and different from last row, so 'NO'. Which matches the sample output.

Case 2:

1x1 grid:

W

First row is 'W', last row is 'W'. First row is uniform, but it's not different from last row, so proceed to next condition.

First column is 'W', last column is 'W'. First column is uniform, but not different from last column, so 'YES'.

Correct.

Case 3:

2x2 grid:

BB

BB

First row 'BB', last row 'BB'. First row is uniform, but not different from last row.

First column 'BB', last column 'BB'. First column is uniform, not different from last column. So 'YES'. Correct.

Case 4:

3x4 grid:

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

First row 'BWBW', which is not uniform, so first condition doesn't apply.

First column 'BWB', which is not uniform, so second condition doesn't apply.

So, 'YES'. Which matches the sample output.

Case 5:

4x2 grid:

BB

BB

WW

WW

First row 'BB', last row 'WW'. First row is uniform, and different from last row, so 'NO'. Which matches the sample output.

Case 6:

4x4 grid:

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

First row 'WWBW', not uniform.

First column 'WBWW', not uniform.

So, 'YES'. But according to the sample output, it's 'YES'.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says "YES" for this case.

Wait, but in the sample input and output, the 4x4 grid corresponds to "YES", but according to the program, it's "YES". So, it's correct.

Another case:

1x5 grid:

WBBWB

First row 'WBBWB', not uniform.

First column 'W', last column 'B'. But since it's 1x5, first_row is 'W', last_row is 'B'.

Wait, in this case, first_row is 'W', last_row is 'B'.

But len(set(first_row)) == 1, and first_row != last_row, so 'NO'. Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it's 'NO'.

Seems like the program is correctly identifying the cases in the sample input.

But I need to think if this logic is generally correct.

What is the rationale behind these conditions?

I think the idea is that if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, then it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

Similarly, if the first column is uniform and different from the last column, it's impossible.

Is this always true?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Suppose we have a grid where the first row is uniform 'W', and the last row is uniform 'B', but elsewhere in the grid, there are 'W's and 'B's mixed.

According to the program, it would print 'NO', which seems correct because if the first row is all 'W's and the last row is all 'B's, and if I can't change one to match the other, then it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

Similarly, if the first column is uniform 'W' and the last column is uniform 'B', it's impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

But is this sufficient condition?

Is there any case where the program says 'YES', but it's actually 'NO'?

Or vice versa?

Wait, perhaps there are cases where even if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, it's still possible to make the entire grid uniform.

Is there such a case?

Let me think.

Suppose I have a grid where the first row is all 'W's, the last row is all 'B's, but in between, there are rows that have both 'W's and 'B's, but in such a way that I can perform operations to make the entire grid 'W' or 'B'.

But, intuitively, if the first row is all 'W's and the last row is all 'B's, and I can only perform operations that set rectangles to a single color based on the starting and ending points being the same color, it seems impossible to change the last row to 'W's or the first row to 'B's.

Hence, the program's condition seems correct.

Similarly for the columns.

But perhaps there are more nuanced cases.

Let me consider a 3x3 grid:

WWW

WBW

WWW

Here, the first row is 'WWW', last row is 'WWW', first column is 'WWW', last column is 'WWW'. All are uniform and match, so 'YES', which is correct.

Another case:

WWW

WBW

WWB

First row 'WWW', last row 'WWB'. First row is uniform 'W', last row has 'B'. So, first row is uniform and different from last row, so 'NO'.

But wait, in this grid, maybe it's possible to make all 'W's.

Let's see:

Select (1,1) and (3,3), both 'W', so set the rectangle (1,1) to (3,3) to 'W'. Now the grid becomes:

WWW

WWW

WWW

Now, all are 'W's. So, it's possible.

But according to the program, it would print 'NO' because the first row is 'WWW', last row is 'WWB', which are different, and first row is uniform.

So, this seems like a mistake in the program.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color ('W' or 'B') using a series of operations, where each operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

### Approach

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), return "YES".
   
2. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Use a Union-Find data structure to group cells of the same color that can be connected through operations.
   - For each cell, try to connect it with its neighbors (cells in the same row or column) that have the same color.
   
3. **Check Connectivity**:
   - If all 'W' cells are connected and all 'B' cells are connected separately, or if one color is entirely connected, it's possible to make the grid uniform.
   
4. **Final Verification**:
   - If either all 'W' or all 'B' cells form a single connected component, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

### Solution Code

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [0] * size
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        xroot = self.find(x)
        yroot = self.find(y)
        if xroot == yroot:
            return
        if self.rank[xroot] < self.rank[yroot]:
            self.parent[xroot] = yroot
        else:
            self.parent[yroot] = xroot
            if self.rank[xroot] == self.rank[yroot]:
                self.rank[xroot] += 1

### Explanation

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - Check if the grid is already uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'). If so, return "YES".

2. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - Use separate Union-Find structures for 'W' and 'B' cells.
   - Connect cells of the same color that are adjacent in the same row or column.

3. **Check Connectivity**:
   - For 'W' and 'B' cells, check if they form a single connected component.
   - If either 'W' or 'B' cells are fully connected, it's possible to make the entire grid that color.

4. **Final Verification**:
   - If any color forms a single connected component or if the grid lacks one color, return "YES".
   - Otherwise, return "NO".
