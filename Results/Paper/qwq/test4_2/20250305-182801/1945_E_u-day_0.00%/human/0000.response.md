Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have a permutation of size n, which means it's an array of distinct integers from 1 to n in some order. We're also given a number x that we need to find in this permutation using a binary search-like algorithm. The catch is that the array isn't sorted, and we're allowed to perform at most two swaps on the array before running the binary search to make sure that after the algorithm, p_l equals x.

First, I need to make sure I understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just a rearrangement of the integers from 1 to n. For example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3. Important thing here is that all elements are unique and within the range from 1 to n.

Now, the binary search algorithm provided seems a bit unusual. Let's see:

- Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

- While r - l != 1:

- Compute m = floor((r + l) / 2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

Finally, p_l should be equal to x.

Wait a minute, this is not a standard binary search. In standard binary search, we have a sorted array, and we're trying to find the position of x. Here, the array is not sorted, and we're allowed to perform at most two swaps to make this peculiar binary search end with p_l equal to x.

I need to understand how this binary search works. Let's consider an example.

Take n = 6, x = 3, and p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. This is already sorted.

Initialize l = 1, r = 7.

First loop:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4, which is greater than 3, so r = 4

Now, l = 1, r = 4

Next loop:

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2, which is less than or equal to 3, so l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

Next loop:

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3, which is less than or equal to 3, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

Check if r - l == 1: 4 - 3 = 1, so end loop.

p_l = p_3 = 3, which equals x. Perfect.

Another example: n = 6, x = 5, p = [3,1,6,5,2,4]

Find position of 5, which is at index 3 (0-based indexing).

Run the binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1+7)/2) = 4, p_4 = 5, which is less than or equal to 5, so l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

Check r - l = 3, not 1

m = floor((4+7)/2) = 5, p_5 = 2, which is less than or equal to 5, so l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

Check r - l = 2, not 1

m = floor((5+7)/2) = 6, p_6 = 4, which is less than or equal to 5, so l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

Check r - l = 1, end loop.

p_l = p_6 = 4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, in this case, we need to perform at most two swaps to make p_l = x after running this binary search.

The problem statement says it's always possible with at most two swaps, so I need to find a way to achieve that.

First, I need to find the current position of x in the array.

Let's denote pos_x as the index where p[pos_x] = x.

Then, I need to make sure that after at most two swaps, the binary search ends with p_l = x.

One straightforward way is to bring x to the position where the binary search will end up, i.e., swap x to the position where l will be after the binary search completes.

But to do that, I need to know where l will be after the binary search.

Wait, but the binary search depends on the array values, which can change based on the swaps.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think about the possible paths the binary search can take and see where it would end up based on the array values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that after at most two swaps, I can adjust the array such that the binary search, which is a deterministic process, ends up at x.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Given that I can perform at most two swaps, I can potentially correct any misplacement in the array that would cause the binary search to fail.

But I need a more concrete strategy.

Let's consider that the binary search is trying to find x in a sorted array, but since the array is not sorted, it's not working correctly.

However, the binary search here isn't exactly standard because the array isn't sorted, and the conditions are based on p_m <= x or not.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the binary search as partitioning the array into regions where p_m <= x and p_m > x.

But it's not clear.

Maybe I should look at the examples provided in the problem.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

So, for the first test case, n=6, x=3, array is already sorted, and no swaps are needed, so output 0.

In the second test case, n=6, x=5, array is [3,1,6,5,2,4], and output is 1 swap between positions 3 and 4.

Let's see:

Original array: [3,1,6,5,2,4]

After swapping positions 3 and 4 (1-based indexing), which are 6 and 5, we get [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Now, run the binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4, p_4=6, which is greater than 5, so r=4

Now, l=1, r=4

m=2, p_2=1, which is less than or equal to 5, so l=2

Now, l=2, r=4

m=3, p_3=5, which is less than or equal to 5, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=4

Check r - l =1, end loop.

p_l = p_3 =5, which equals x=5.

So, with one swap, we achieved the goal.

Another test case: n=5, x=1, array=[3,5,4,2,1]

Output: 2 swaps: 2 4 and 1 5

Let's apply the swaps:

First swap positions 2 and 4: [3,2,4,5,1]

Then swap positions 1 and 5: [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, run the binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_3=4, which is greater than 1, so r=3

Now, l=1, r=3

m=2, p_2=2, which is greater than 1, so r=2

Now, l=1, r=2

Check r - l =1, end loop.

p_l = p_1 =1, which equals x=1.

So, with two swaps, we achieved the goal.

From these examples, it seems that by swapping elements, we can adjust the array so that the binary search ends at the correct position.

But I need a general strategy to determine which swaps to perform.

One approach could be to try to place x at the position where the binary search will end, and if necessary, adjust another element to ensure the binary search path is correct.

But I need to understand the binary search path better.

Let me think about the binary search steps.

The binary search maintains a range [l, r), initially [1, n+1).

It repeatedly splits the range by taking m = floor((l + r)/2), and decides whether to set l = m or r = m based on p_m <= x or p_m > x.

The loop ends when r - l =1, and it should have p_l = x.

This seems similar to finding the lower bound of x in a sorted array, but since the array isn't sorted, we need to make adjustments.

I need to ensure that after at most two swaps, the binary search ends at the position of x.

One way to think about this is to consider where the binary search ends without any swaps, and if it doesn't end at x, perform swaps to make it do so.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that with at most two swaps, I can place x and one other element in positions that will guide the binary search to land on x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can ensure that the path the binary search takes leads it to x by placing x and possibly one other element in specific positions.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_3()

def func_1():

return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():

return list(func_1())

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n - 1)

st = set()

while low + 1 < high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

So, the program does the following:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case, read n and k.

- Read the permutation array arr.

- Find the position pos of k in arr.

- Initialize low = 0 and high = n - 1.

- Perform a while loop while low + 1 < high:

- Compute mid = floor((low + high)/2)

- If arr[mid] > k, set high = mid

- Else, set low = mid

- After the loop, check if arr[low] == k:

- If yes, print 0 (no swaps needed)

- Else, print 1 and swap between position low + 1 and pos + 1

So, the program is trying to perform the given binary search and see if k is found at p_l. If yes, no swaps are needed. If not, perform one swap between the position where the binary search ended (low) and the position of k.

Let's see if this works with the example where n=6, x=5, arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

Position of 5 is at index 3.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=5

low + 1 < high → 0 + 1 =1 < 5 → True

mid = floor((0+5)/2) = 2

arr[2] =6 >5 → high=2

Now, low=0, high=2

low +1=1 <2 → True

mid = floor((0+2)/2)=1

arr[1]=1 <=5 → low=1

Now, low=1, high=2

low +1=2 <2 → False → end loop

arr[low] = arr[1] =1 !=5 → so print 1 and swap positions low+1=2 and pos+1=4

So, swap positions 2 and 4: swap arr[1]=1 and arr[3]=5 → arr becomes [3,5,6,1,2,4]

Now, run the binary search again:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=6 >5 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=5 <=5 → low=1

Now, low=1, high=2 → r - l =1 → end loop

p_l = p[1] =5 ==x → correct.

So, with one swap, it worked.

Another test case: n=5, x=1, arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

Position of 1 is at index 4.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=4

low+1=1 <4 → True

mid=floor((0+4)/2)=2, arr[2]=4 >1 → high=2

low=0, high=2

low+1=1 <2 → True

mid=floor((0+2)/2)=1, arr[1]=5 >1 → high=1

low=0, high=1

low+1=1 <1 → False → end loop

arr[low] = arr[0]=3 !=1 → so print 1 and swap positions low+1=1 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[0]=3 and arr[4]=1 → arr becomes [1,5,4,2,3]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=4

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >1 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=5 >1 → high=1

low=0, high=1

r - l =1 → end loop

p_l = p[0]=1 ==x → correct.

So, again, one swap suffices.

But wait, in the sample input, for this case, the output is 2 swaps:

2

2 4

1 5

But in the above, only one swap seems to suffice. Maybe the program is not always optimal, but the problem says we don't need to minimize the number of swaps, just perform at most two.

But in this case, it seems one swap is enough, but the sample output shows two swaps. Maybe there are cases where two swaps are necessary.

Let's consider another test case: n=6, x=3, arr=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

Position of 3 is at index 1.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=5

low+1=1 <5 → True

mid=floor((0+5)/2)=2, arr[2]=1 <=3 → low=2

Now, low=2, high=5

low+1=3 <5 → True

mid=floor((2+5)/2)=3, arr[3]=5 >3 → high=3

low=2, high=3

low+1=3 <3 → False → end loop

arr[low] = arr[2]=1 !=3 → so print 1 and swap positions low+1=3 and pos+1=2

Wait, positions are 3 and 2 (1-based indexing).

So, swap arr[2]=1 and arr[1]=3 → arr becomes [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=3 <=3 → low=2

Now, low=2, high=5

mid=3, arr[3]=5 >3 → high=3

low=2, high=3

end loop

p_l = arr[2]=3 ==x → correct.

So, again, one swap suffices.

But in the sample input, for this case, the output is two swaps:

2

2 4

1 5

Which suggests that in some cases, two swaps are needed.

Let me consider a case where one swap is not enough.

Take n=4, x=3, arr=[2,4,1,3]

Position of 3 is at index 3.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=4

low+1=1 <4 → True

mid=floor((0+4)/2)=2, arr[2]=1 <=3 → low=2

low=2, high=4

low+1=3 <4 → True

mid=floor((2+4)/2)=3, arr[3]=3 <=3 → low=3

low=3, high=4

low+1=4 <4 → False → end loop

arr[low] = arr[3]=3 ==x → no swaps needed.

Another case: n=4, x=2, arr=[3,1,4,2]

Position of 2 is at index 3.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=4

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >2 → high=2

low=0, high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=1 <=2 → low=1

low=1, high=2

end loop

arr[low] = arr[1]=1 !=2 → need to swap low+1=2 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[1]=1 and arr[3]=2 → arr becomes [3,2,4,1]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=4

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >2 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=2 <=2 → low=1

low=1, high=2 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[1]=2 ==x → correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

Wait, maybe there are cases where one swap isn't enough.

Consider n=4, x=2, arr=[4,1,3,2]

Position of 2 is at index 3.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=4

mid=2, arr[2]=3 >2 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=1 <=2 → low=1

low=1, high=2 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[1]=1 !=2 → swap low+1=2 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[1]=1 and arr[3]=2 → arr becomes [4,2,3,1]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=4

mid=2, arr[2]=3 >2 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=2 <=2 → low=1

low=1, high=2 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[1]=2 ==x → correct.

Still one swap suffices.

Wait, maybe in some cases, one swap isn't enough.

Let's consider n=5, x=3, arr=[5,1,2,4,3]

Position of 3 is at index 4.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=2 <=3 → low=2

low=2, high=5

mid=3, arr[3]=4 >3 → high=3

low=2, high=3

end loop

arr[low] = arr[2]=2 !=3 → swap low+1=3 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[2]=2 and arr[4]=3 → arr becomes [5,1,3,4,2]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=3 <=3 → low=2

low=2, high=5

mid=3, arr[3]=4 >3 → high=3

low=2, high=3 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[2]=3 ==x → correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

Hmm, maybe in all cases one swap suffices? But the problem says it's always possible with at most two swaps, implying that there might be cases where one swap isn't enough.

Looking back at the sample input, there is a test case where two swaps are performed.

Wait, in the sample input, the third test case:

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

Let's see what happens if we try to perform only one swap.

Original array: [3,5,4,2,1]

Position of 1 is at index 4.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >1 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=5 >1 → high=1

low=0, high=1 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[0]=3 !=1 → need to swap low+1=1 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[0]=3 and arr[4]=1 → arr becomes [1,5,4,2,3]

Run the binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >1 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=5 >1 → high=1

low=0, high=1 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[0]=1 ==x → correct.

So, in this case, one swap suffices, but the sample output shows two swaps.

Maybe performing two swaps can also lead to the correct result, even if one swap suffices. The problem allows up to two swaps, so it's acceptable.

But the program only performs one swap when necessary, which seems sufficient based on the examples.

Wait, perhaps there are cases where one swap isn't enough, but I haven't found one yet.

Let me try another example.

n=6, x=3, arr=[6,1,2,4,5,3]

Position of 3 is at index 5.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=4 >3 → high=3

mid=1, arr[1]=1 <=3 → low=1

low=1, high=3

mid=2, arr[2]=2 <=3 → low=2

low=2, high=3

end loop

arr[low] = arr[2]=2 !=3 → swap low+1=3 and pos+1=6

Swap arr[2]=2 and arr[5]=3 → arr becomes [6,1,3,4,5,2]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=4 >3 → high=3

mid=1, arr[1]=1 <=3 → low=1

low=1, high=3

mid=2, arr[2]=3 <=3 → low=2

low=2, high=3 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[2]=3 ==x → correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

Wait, maybe in all cases one swap suffices, and the "at most two swaps" is just to ensure that it's always possible.

But the problem says "it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient", so perhaps in some cases, two swaps are needed.

I need to find such a case.

Let's try n=7, x=4, arr=[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Position of 4 is at index 6.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=7

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=4 → low=3

low=3, high=7

mid=5, arr[5]=3 <=4 → low=5

low=5, high=7

mid=6, arr[6]=4 <=4 → low=6

low=6, high=7 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[6]=4 ==x → no swaps needed.

Another case: n=7, x=3, arr=[5,6,7,1,2,4,3]

Position of 3 is at index 6.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=7

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=3 → low=3

low=3, high=7

mid=5, arr[5]=4 >3 → high=5

mid=4, arr[4]=2 <=3 → low=4

low=4, high=5 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[4]=2 !=3 → swap low+1=5 and pos+1=7

Swap arr[4]=2 and arr[6]=3 → arr becomes [5,6,7,1,3,4,2]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=7

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=3 → low=3

low=3, high=7

mid=5, arr[5]=4 >3 → high=5

mid=4, arr[4]=3 <=3 → low=4

low=4, high=5 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[4]=3 ==x → correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

Wait, perhaps in all cases one swap suffices, and the "at most two swaps" is just to cover all possible scenarios, including the worst case.

But according to the sample input, there is a case where two swaps are performed.

Looking back at the sample input, the third test case:

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

But as I showed earlier, one swap suffices.

Wait, maybe there are cases where one swap isn't enough.

Let me consider n=4, x=3, arr=[1,2,4,3]

Position of 3 is at index 3.

Swap arr[1]=2 and arr[3]=3 → arr becomes [1,3,4,2]

Run the binary search again:

mid=2, arr[2]=4 >3 → high=2

arr[low] = arr[1]=3 ==x → correct.

Still one swap suffices.

Another case: n=5, x=3, arr=[2,5,1,4,3]

Position of 3 is at index 4.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=5

low=2, high=5

mid=3, arr[3]=4 >3 → high=3

I'm starting to think that maybe in all cases, one swap suffices, and the "at most two swaps" is just to ensure that it's always possible.

But the sample input shows a case where two swaps are performed, even though one swap suffices.

Maybe the program is correct, and in cases where one swap suffices, it's acceptable to perform two swaps, even if one suffices.

Alternatively, perhaps there are cases where one swap isn't enough, and two swaps are necessary.

Let me try to find such a case.

Consider n=5, x=2, arr=[3,5,1,4,2]

Position of 2 is at index 4.

Run the while loop:

Again, one swap suffices.

Wait, maybe if the position of x is such that swapping it to the desired position affects other elements in a way that requires an additional swap.

Let me consider n=6, x=3, arr=[4,5,6,1,2,3]

Position of 3 is at index 5.

Run the while loop:

Another case: n=6, x=4, arr=[1,2,3,5,6,4]

Position of 4 is at index 5.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=6

Output:

Wait, maybe performing two swaps can also lead to the correct result.

Let's see:

Original array: [3,5,4,2,1]

First swap: 2 4 → swap positions 2 and 4 (1-based indexing), which are arr[1]=5 and arr[3]=4 → arr becomes [3,4,5,2,1]

Second swap: 1 5 → swap positions 1 and 5, which are arr[0]=3 and arr[4]=1 → arr becomes [1,4,5,2,3]

Now, run the binary search:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=5 >1 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=4 >1 → high=1

low=0, high=1 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[0]=1 ==x → correct.

So, even with two swaps, it works.

But one swap would have sufficed, as shown earlier.

So, perhaps the program is correct in performing one swap when possible, and it's acceptable to perform two swaps even if one suffices.

But the problem says "it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient", so it's guaranteed that two swaps are enough, but one might not always be enough.

But based on the examples I've tried, one swap seems to suffice in all cases.

Maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider a more complex case.

n=7, x=4, arr=[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Position of 4 is at index 6.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=7

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=4 → low=3

low=3, high=7

mid=5, arr[5]=3 <=4 → low=5

low=5, high=7

mid=6, arr[6]=4 <=4 → low=6

low=6, high=7 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[6]=4 ==x → no swaps needed.

Another case: n=7, x=3, arr=[5,6,7,1,2,4,3]

Position of 3 is at index 6.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=7

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=3 → low=3

low=3, high=7

mid=5, arr[5]=4 >3 → high=5

mid=4, arr[4]=2 <=3 → low=4

low=4, high=5 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[4]=2 !=3 → swap low+1=5 and pos+1=7

Swap arr[4]=2 and arr[6]=3 → arr becomes [5,6,7,1,3,4,2]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=7

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=3 → low=3

low=3, high=7

mid=5, arr[5]=4 >3 → high=5

mid=4, arr[4]=3 <=3 → low=4

low=4, high=5 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[4]=3 ==x → correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

Wait, perhaps there are cases where one swap isn't enough.

Let me consider n=5, x=3, arr=[2,1,5,4,3]

Position of 3 is at index 4.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=5 >3 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=1 <=3 → low=1

low=1, high=2 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[1]=1 !=3 → swap low+1=2 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[1]=1 and arr[4]=3 → arr becomes [2,3,5,4,1]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=5

mid=2, arr[2]=5 >3 → high=2

mid=1, arr[1]=3 <=3 → low=1

low=1, high=2 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[1]=3 ==x → correct.

Still one swap suffices.

Wait, maybe in some cases, after one swap, the binary search still doesn't find x, and we need a second swap.

But in all the cases I've tried, one swap suffices.

Perhaps I need to consider a case where the position of x is such that swapping it to the desired position isn't enough due to other elements.

Let me consider n=6, x=3, arr=[4,5,6,1,2,3]

Position of 3 is at index 5.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=1 <=3 → low=3

low=3, high=6

mid=4, arr[4]=2 <=3 → low=4

low=4, high=6

mid=5, arr[5]=3 <=3 → low=5

low=5, high=6 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[5]=3 ==x → no swaps needed.

Another case: n=6, x=2, arr=[3,4,5,6,1,2]

Position of 2 is at index 5.

Run the while loop:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=6 >2 → high=3

mid=1, arr[1]=4 >2 → high=1

low=0, high=1 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[0]=3 !=2 → swap low+1=1 and pos+1=6

Swap arr[0]=3 and arr[5]=2 → arr becomes [2,4,5,6,1,3]

Run the binary search again:

low=0, high=6

mid=3, arr[3]=6 >2 → high=3

mid=1, arr[1]=4 >2 → high=1

low=0, high=1 → end loop

arr[low] = arr[0]=2 ==x → correct.

Again, one swap suffices.

I'm starting to think that perhaps in all cases, one swap is enough, and the "at most two swaps" is just to ensure that it's always possible.

But according to the sample input, there is a test case where two swaps are performed, even though one swap suffices.

Therefore, the program seems correct in performing one swap when necessary, and in cases where no swap is needed, outputting 0.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
