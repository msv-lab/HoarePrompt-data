Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a permutation p of size n, and a number x that we need to find. A permutation is an array of distinct integers from 1 to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation of size 5.

We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps on the permutation before running a binary search on it. The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that after performing the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand the binary search algorithm provided in the problem. It's a bit unusual because in a standard binary search, we have a sorted array, and we look for a target value. Here, the array is not necessarily sorted, and we're supposed to perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find the correct value.

Let's look at the binary search steps:

1. Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

2. While r - l != 1:

a. Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2).

b. If p_m <= x, set l = m.

c. Otherwise, set r = m.

After the loop, p_l should equal x.

This is interesting because in standard binary search, we would have l = 0 and r = n, and the array would be sorted. Here, the array might not be sorted, and we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work.

The problem states that it can be shown that 2 operations are always sufficient. So, no matter the permutation, we can always make the binary search find x with at most 2 swaps.

My task is to determine if the given Python program correctly solves this problem.

Let's look at the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

So, the program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of n, x, and the permutation p.

It defines some helper functions: func_1 to read integers from input, func_2 to read a list of integers, and func_3 to process each test case.

In func_3:

- Read n and x.

- Read the permutation arr.

- Find the position pos of x in arr.

- Initialize low and high for binary search.

- Perform the binary search as described in the problem.

- If arr[low] equals x, output 0 swaps.

- Otherwise, output 1 swap, swapping the elements at positions low and pos.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 2 swaps, not just 1. However, in this program, it only performs 1 swap if necessary.

Looking back at the problem, it says "perform the following operation no more than 2 times: choose indices i, j (1 <= i, j <= n) and swap elements at positions i and j."

So, we can perform 0, 1, or 2 swaps.

The program seems to perform at most 1 swap. Is that sufficient?

Let me think about when 1 swap is enough.

Suppose the binary search would find x if the array were sorted. By performing swaps, we try to make the binary search work on the permuted array.

But the binary search here is not on a sorted array; it's on a permutation that may or may not be sorted.

Wait, in standard binary search, the array needs to be sorted for the search to work correctly. Here, the array is a permutation, which is arbitrary, and we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search find x.

But the problem says that it can be shown that 2 operations are always sufficient.

So, perhaps there is a way to adjust the array with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search, as described, finds x.

Looking back at the program, it seems to assume that only 1 swap is needed in most cases, and sometimes 0 swaps are needed.

Let's see an example from the provided sample input and output.

Sample Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Sample Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

In the first test case:

n=6, x=3

arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

The array is already sorted. The binary search should find x=3 at position 2 (0-indexed), so no swaps are needed. The output is 0.

In the second test case:

n=6, x=5

arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

The binary search would proceed as follows:

Initialize l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid = floor((0+6)/2) = 3

arr[3]=5 <=5 ? Yes, set l=3

Now l=3, r=6

Check if r - l ==1: 6-3=3 !=1

Second loop:

mid = floor((3+6)/2)=4

arr[4]=2 <=5? Yes, set l=4

Now l=4, r=6

Check if r - l ==1: 6-4=2 !=1

Third loop:

mid = floor((4+6)/2)=5

arr[5]=4 <=5? Yes, set l=5

Now l=5, r=6

Check if r - l ==1: 6-5=1, end loop

Check arr[5]=4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, the program would perform 1 swap: swap positions low=5 and pos=3 (since arr[3]=5).

So, swap arr[5] and arr[3]:

arr becomes [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Now, rerun the binary search on this modified array.

Initialize l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

arr[3]=4 <=5? Yes, set l=3

Now l=3, r=6

Second loop:

mid=4

arr[4]=2 <=5? Yes, set l=4

Now l=4, r=6

Third loop:

mid=5

arr[5]=5 <=5? Yes, set l=5

Now l=5, r=6

End loop, arr[5]=5 == x=5.

So, with 1 swap, it works.

In the third test case:

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

The binary search:

l=0, r=5

First loop:

mid=2

arr[2]=4 <=1? No, set r=2

Now l=0, r=2

Check if r - l ==1: 2-0=2 !=1

Second loop:

mid=1

arr[1]=5 <=1? No, set r=1

Now l=0, r=1

End loop

Check arr[0]=3 !=1

So, perform 1 swap: swap low=0 and pos=4

arr becomes [1,5,4,2,3]

Rerun binary search:

l=0, r=5

First loop:

mid=2

arr[2]=4 <=1? No, set r=2

Now l=0, r=2

Second loop:

mid=1

arr[1]=5 <=1? No, set r=1

Now l=0, r=1

End loop

Check arr[0]=1 == x=1.

So, again, 1 swap suffices.

But according to the problem, 2 swaps are allowed, and sometimes we might need 2 swaps.

Looking at the fourth test case in the sample input:

n=6, x=3

arr=[4,3,1,5,2,6]

The sample output suggests 2 swaps:

2

4 5

2 4

Let's see why 2 swaps are needed here.

First, perform swap 4 and 5: swap arr[3]=5 and arr[4]=2

arr becomes [4,3,1,2,5,6]

Then, swap 2 and 4: swap arr[1]=3 and arr[3]=2

arr becomes [4,2,1,3,5,6]

Now, run the binary search:

l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

arr[3]=3 <=3? Yes, set l=3

Now l=3, r=6

Second loop:

mid=4

arr[4]=5 <=3? No, set r=4

Now l=3, r=4

End loop

Check arr[3]=3 == x=3.

So, with 2 swaps, it works.

But is it possible to make it work with only 1 swap? Let's check.

Original array: [4,3,1,5,2,6]

If we perform 1 swap, can we make the binary search find x=3?

Let's try swapping the positions of 3 and 4: swap arr[0]=4 and arr[1]=3

arr becomes [3,4,1,5,2,6]

Run binary search:

l=0, r=6

First loop:

mid=3

arr[3]=5 <=3? No, set r=3

Now l=0, r=3

Second loop:

mid=1

arr[1]=4 <=3? No, set r=1

Now l=0, r=1

End loop

Check arr[0]=3 == x=3.

So, with just 1 swap, we could have made it work. But the sample output shows 2 swaps.

The problem says "you do not need to minimize the number of operations." So, even if 1 swap suffices, outputting 2 swaps is acceptable.

Hence, the program seems to sometimes use more swaps than necessary, but as long as it's 2 or fewer, it's acceptable.

Now, looking back at the program, in func_3:

- It finds the position pos of x in arr.

- Performs the binary search as described, storing mid indices in a set.

- If arr[low] == x, output 0.

- Else, output 1 swap: swap low and pos.

In the fourth test case, with arr=[4,3,1,5,2,6], x=3:

- pos=1 (since arr[1]=3)

- binary search ends with low=3 (since arr[3]=5 >=3, and arr[5]=6 >=3, so low moves right)

- arr[low]=5 !=3, so perform 1 swap: swap low=3 and pos=1

- arr becomes [4,5,1,3,2,6]

- Run binary search again:

- l=0, r=6

- mid=3, arr[3]=3 <=3? Yes, set l=3

- mid=(3+6)//2=4, arr[4]=2 <=3? Yes, set l=4

- mid=(4+6)//2=5, arr[5]=6 <=3? No, set r=5

- End loop with l=4, arr[4]=2 !=3

- So, 1 swap is not enough in this case.

Wait, but earlier manual calculation with 1 swap showed it works.

Wait, in the manual calculation, I swapped arr[0] and arr[1], which is different from swapping low=3 and pos=1.

So, perhaps swapping low and pos doesn't always work.

Hence, the program might be incorrect in assuming that only 1 swap is sufficient in all cases.

Wait, but the problem says that 2 operations are always sufficient.

So, perhaps in some cases, 1 swap is not enough, and we need 2 swaps.

In the fourth test case, the sample output shows 2 swaps, even though 1 swap could suffice.

But in the program, it only performs 1 swap: swapping low and pos.

In the earlier manual calculation, swapping arr[0] and arr[1] (indices 0 and 1) works with 1 swap, but according to the program, it would swap arr[3] and arr[1], which might not work.

Hence, perhaps the program's approach is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Since we can perform up to 2 swaps, we can consider that we can adjust the positions of up to 2 elements in the array.

Our goal is to make the binary search find x, i.e., after the binary search, p_l should be equal to x.

So, we need to ensure that after performing the binary search, the value at position l is x.

The binary search proceeds as described, and depending on the values in the array, l and r are updated.

At the end, l points to a position, and we want arr[l] to be x.

One way to approach this is to simulate the binary search and see where l ends up, and then adjust arr[l] to be x.

Since we can perform up to 2 swaps, we can swap arr[l] with arr[pos], where pos is the current position of x.

But as seen in the fourth test case, this might not always work.

Perhaps because the path taken by the binary search depends on the values in the array, and swapping only once might not be enough to correct the entire path.

An alternative approach could be to identify the positions that are visited during the binary search and adjust those positions accordingly.

Wait, in the program, it performs the binary search and stores the mid indices in a set.

But it doesn for the sake of finding low, and then decides whether to swap or not.

But perhaps we need to consider all the positions that are involved in the binary search path and adjust them appropriately.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 2e4, we need an efficient solution.

But for now, I need to determine if the given program is correct.

Looking back, in the fourth test case, the program would perform 1 swap: swap low=3 and pos=1.

After swapping, arr becomes [4,5,1,3,2,6]

Running the binary search again:

l=0, r=6

mid=3, arr[3]=3 <=3? Yes, set l=3

mid=(3+6)//2=4, arr[4]=2 <=3? Yes, set l=4

mid=(4+6)//2=5, arr[5]=6 <=3? No, set r=5

End loop with l=4, arr[4]=2 !=3

Hence, the program's approach fails in this case, as 1 swap is not enough.

But according to the sample output, 2 swaps are needed.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it only performs up to 1 swap when needed, but sometimes 2 swaps are necessary.

Wait, but in the sample output, for the fourth test case, 2 swaps are performed, and it works.

But in the program, for that test case, it would perform only 1 swap, which might not be enough.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
