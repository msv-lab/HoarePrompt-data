Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. For a friend to come to the party, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party.

4. He needs to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of friend i, and all p_i are distinct, this forms a permutation of the friends. In other words, it's like matching each friend to another unique friend as their best friend.

Given that, I can think of this as a graph where friends are nodes, and best friendships are directed edges from one friend to another. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, there are no self-loops, and each node has exactly one outgoing edge.

Now, the problem is to select a set of friends to invite such that at least two friends come to the party. A friend comes if both they and their best friend are invited.

I need to minimize the number of invitations sent. So, I need to find the smallest set of invitations that results in at least two friends coming to the party.

Let's consider some examples to understand this better.

Example 1:

n = 5

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3

friend 2's best friend is 1

friend 3's best friend is 2

friend 4's best friend is 5

friend 5's best friend is 4

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5, then:

- Friend 4 comes because both friend 4 and friend 5 (his best friend) are invited.

- Friend 5 comes because both friend 5 and friend 4 (his best friend) are invited.

So, both come, and that's at least 2 friends.

Another way, if he invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes if both friend 1 and friend 3 (his best friend) are invited. But friend 3 is not invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

- Friend 2 comes if both friend 2 and friend 1 (his best friend) are invited. Friend 1 is invited, but friend 3 (friend 2's best friend) is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

- Friend 3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

So, no one comes in this case.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-read the problem.

" The i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, for friend i to come, both friend i and friend p_i must be invited.

In the first example, if Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4: invited and his best friend 5 is also invited → comes.

- Friend 5: invited and his best friend 4 is also invited → comes.

- Friends 1, 2, 3 are not invited, so they don't come.

So, at least 2 friends come (4 and 5), with 2 invitations.

Is there a way to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 2 invitations? No, because you need to invite at least 2 friends to have any come.

Wait, but maybe there's a scenario where inviting fewer than n friends can result in more friends coming. But in this case, it seems that inviting 2 specific friends makes 2 come, and inviting fewer than 2 won't make any come.

Example 2:

n = 4

p = [2, 3, 4, 1]

So, friend 1's best friend is 2

friend 2's best friend is 3

friend 3's best friend is 4

friend 4's best friend is 1

If Monocarp invites friends 1, 2, and 3:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is invited? Friend 4 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come, with 3 invitations.

Is there a way to have at least 2 friends come with fewer invitations?

Let's try inviting friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friends 3 and 4 are not invited → don't come.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is less than 2.

Inviting friends 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

No one comes.

Inviting friends 1, 3, and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

So, friends 3 and 4 come, with 3 invitations.

Seems similar to before.

Is there a way to have at least 2 friends come with fewer than 3 invitations? Let's try inviting friends 1, 2, and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

So, friends 1 and 4 come, with 3 invitations.

Seems like inviting any 3 can achieve at least 2 coming, but not with 2 invitations.

Is there a way with 2 invitations? Let's try inviting friends 1 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

So, only friend 4 comes, which is less than 2.

Inviting friends 2 and 3:

- Friend 1: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

Only friend 2 comes.

Inviting friends 3 and 4:

- Friend 1: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 1 is not invited → doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes.

So, seems like with 2 invitations, only one friend comes, which is less than 2.

Hence, the minimum number of invitations needed is 3.

Example 3:

n = 2

p = [2, 1]

So, friend 1's best friend is 2

friend 2's best friend is 1

If Monocarp invites both friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

So, both come with 2 invitations.

Is there a way to have at least 2 come with fewer than 2 invitations? Since n=2, and we need at least 2 to come, inviting only one friend won't make anyone come, because:

Invite friend 1:

- Friend 1: invited but friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

So, no one comes.

Similarly, inviting only friend 2:

- Friend 2: invited but friend 1 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 1: not invited → doesn't come.

Again, no one comes.

Hence, the minimum number of invitations is 2.

From these examples, it seems that in some cases, inviting a certain set of friends can make multiple friends come, potentially allowing for a smaller number of invitations.

I need to find a general approach to determine the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends come to the party.

First, let's think about the structure of the best friend relationships. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this forms a permutation with cycles.

In graph terms, this is a disjoint union of cycles.

For example:

- In the first example, n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4]:

- Friend 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 (cycle of length 3)

- Friend 4 → 5 → 4 (cycle of length 2)

- So, two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2.

- In the second example, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]:

- Friend 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 (cycle of length 4)

- One cycle of length 4.

- In the third example, n=2, p=[2,1]:

- Friend 1 → 2 → 1 (cycle of length 2)

- One cycle of length 2.

Given that, perhaps the cycle structure influences the minimum number of invitations needed.

Let's think about cycles:

In a cycle of length k:

- If k is even: perhaps we can select k/2 invitations to make k/2 friends come.

- If k is odd: maybe (k+1)/2 invitations to make (k+1)/2 friends come.

But need to verify this.

Wait, let's consider a cycle of length 3: say friends a, b, c, where a's best friend is b, b's best friend is c, c's best friend is a.

If we invite a and b:

- a comes if b is invited → a comes.

- b comes if c is invited → but c is not invited → b doesn't come.

- c doesn't come.

So, only a comes.

If we invite a and c:

- a comes if c is invited → a comes.

- c comes if a is invited → c comes.

- b doesn't come.

So, a and c come, with 2 invitations.

Similarly, inviting b and c would make b and c come.

So, in a cycle of length 3, inviting any two consecutive friends makes two come.

Hence, for a cycle of length 3, minimum invitations to make at least two come is 2.

Similarly, for a cycle of length 4: a → b → c → d → a.

If we invite a, b, and c:

- a comes if b is invited → a comes.

- b comes if c is invited → b comes.

- c comes if d is invited → c doesn't come (d is not invited).

- d doesn't come.

So, a and b come, with 3 invitations.

If we invite a, b, and d:

- a comes if b is invited → a comes.

- b comes if c is invited → b doesn't come.

- d comes if a is invited → d comes.

So, a and d come, with 3 invitations.

Seems similar to the second example.

Is there a way to have at least 2 come with fewer invitations? Let's try inviting a and b:

- a comes if b is invited → a comes.

- b comes if c is invited → b doesn't come.

- c doesn't come.

- d doesn't come.

Only a comes, which is less than 2.

Inviting a and c:

- a comes if b is invited → a doesn't come.

- c comes if d is invited → c doesn't come.

- b doesn't come.

- d doesn't come.

No one comes.

Inviting a and d:

- a comes if b is invited → a doesn't come.

- d comes if a is invited → d doesn't come.

- b doesn't come.

- c doesn't come.

No one comes.

Inviting b and c:

- b comes if c is invited → b comes.

- c comes if d is invited → c doesn't come.

- a doesn't come.

- d doesn't come.

Only b comes.

Inviting b and d:

- b comes if c is invited → b doesn't come.

- d comes if a is invited → d doesn't come.

- a doesn't come.

- c doesn't come.

No one comes.

Inviting c and d:

- c comes if d is invited → c comes.

- d comes if a is invited → d doesn't come.

- a doesn't come.

- b doesn't come.

Only c comes.

So, with 2 invitations, at most one friend comes. With 3 invitations, at least two come.

Hence, for a cycle of length 4, the minimum number of invitations to have at least two friends come is 3.

Wait, but in the first example, with two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2, inviting two friends from different cycles makes two come.

Wait, in the first example, n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4]:

- Cycle 1: 1 → 3 → 2 → 1 (length 3)

- Cycle 2: 4 → 5 → 4 (length 2)

If Monocarp invites friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4 comes (invited and best friend 5 is invited)

- Friend 5 comes (invited and best friend 4 is invited)

So, two come with two invitations.

Alternatively, inviting friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 3 is invited → friend 3 is not invited → friend 1 doesn't come.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 1 is invited → friend 1 is invited, but friend 3 (friend 2's best friend) is not invited → friend 2 doesn't come.

- Friend 3 doesn't come.

So, no one comes.

Hence, inviting two friends from the same cycle might not work, but inviting two from different cycles can work if the cycles are separate.

So, perhaps the key is to identify the cycle structure and determine the minimum invitations based on that.

But for the purpose of this problem, since n is small (n ≤ 50), and t can be up to 5000, I need an efficient way to compute the minimum number of invitations.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

x = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

for i in range(0, x):

if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:

flag = True

print(2)

break

else:

print(3)

This seems to read t test cases, where each test case has n and then the list p.

Then, for each test case, it iterates through the list and checks if l[l[i]-1] == i+1.

If it finds such an i, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

Wait, but in the second example, it should print 3, which it does.

In the first example, it should print 2, which it does.

In the third example, n=2, p=[2,1], l[l[0]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 == 1+1=2 → matches → prints 2.

Seems correct for the examples.

But is this logic general?

Let's see.

What does l[l[i]-1]==i+1 mean?

l[i] is the best friend of i+1.

l[l[i]-1] is the best friend of l[i].

So, l[l[i]-1]==i+1 means that the best friend of l[i] is i+1.

In other words, i+1 and l[i] are mutual best friends.

So, if there exists a pair of mutual best friends, then inviting these two makes both come, so minimum invitations are 2.

Otherwise, from the examples, it seems that the minimum is 3.

Wait, but in the second example, there are no mutual best friends:

p = [2,3,4,1]

l[l[0]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 == 1+1=2 → yes, friend 1 and friend 2 are mutual best friends.

Wait, but in the second example, friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 3, not 1. So, l[l[0]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 != 2 (since i+1=2), wait, i=0, i+1=1.

Wait, the condition is l[l[i]-1]==i+1.

For i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=3 != 1.

For i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[3-1]=l[2]=4 != 2.

For i=2: l[l[2]-1]=l[4-1]=l[3]=1 != 3.

For i=3: l[l[3]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 != 4.

So, no mutual best friends, hence prints 3.

Yes, that matches the second example.

In the first example, n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4]

Check for mutual best friends:

i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[3-1]=l[2]=2 ==1? No.

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=3 ==2? No.

i=2: l[l[2]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=1 ==3? No.

i=3: l[l[3]-1]=l[5-1]=l[4]=4 ==4? Yes.

So, friend 4 and friend 5 are mutual best friends.

Hence, prints 2.

Similarly, in the third example, n=2, p=[2,1]

i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=1 ==1? No.

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 ==2? Yes.

So, mutual best friends, prints 2.

Therefore, the logic seems to be: if there exists at least one pair of mutual best friends, then the minimum invitations are 2; otherwise, it's 3.

But is this always true?

From the second example, where there are no mutual best friends, the minimum is 3.

From the first and third examples, where there are mutual best friends, the minimum is 2.

Is there a case where mutual best friends don't exist, but the minimum invitations are less than 3?

Let's consider a cycle of length 3:

n=3, p=[2,3,1]

Check for mutual best friends:

i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=3 !=1

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[3-1]=l[2]=1 !=2

i=2: l[l[2]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 !=3

No mutual best friends.

What is the minimum number of invitations to have at least 2 friends come?

If we invite friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes.

If we invite friends 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

So, only friend 3 comes.

If we invite friends 2 and 3:

- Friend 1: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 1 is not invited → doesn't come.

Only friend 2 comes.

So, with 2 invitations, only one friend comes.

If we invite all three:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

All three come, but that's with 3 invitations.

Is there a way to have at least 2 come with fewer than 3 invitations? Seems not.

Hence, minimum invitations are 3.

So, in this case, since there are no mutual best friends, the program would print 3, which is correct.

Another case: n=4, p=[2,1,4,3]

Check for mutual best friends:

i=0: l[l[0]-1]=l[2-1]=l[1]=1 ==1? Yes.

i=1: l[l[1]-1]=l[1-1]=l[0]=2 ==2? Yes.

i=2: l[l[2]-1]=l[4-1]=l[3]=3 ==3? Yes.

i=3: l[l[3]-1]=l[3-1]=l[2]=4 ==4? Yes.

So, all pairs are mutual best friends.

Wait, but in this setup, friends are paired: 1-2 and 3-4.

If we invite friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come, with 2 invitations.

Similarly, inviting friends 3 and 4:

- Friend 1: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 3 is invited → comes.

So, friends 3 and 4 come, with 2 invitations.

Hence, minimum invitations are 2.

The program would detect mutual best friends (e.g., i=0: l[l[0]-1]=1==1), so it prints 2, which is correct.

Another case: n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]

As in the second example, no mutual best friends, minimum invitations are 3.

Hence, the program seems to correctly identify whether there are mutual best friends and set the minimum invitations accordingly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]

**Correctness: True**
