Alright, I've got this problem to check if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Let's see.

First, the problem says: "Output two integers: the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y." And there are multiple test cases, specified by t, which is the number of test cases.

Looking at the program, it defines a function called func(). Inside func(), it reads the input for t, but wait, in the code, it's just "t = input()", but in the problem, it says the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). So, it's reading t correctly, I guess, but it's not using t anywhere in the code.

Then, it initializes two empty lists, x and y, to store the values of x and y for each test case.

It reads 10 inputs in a loop, assuming that there are always 10 test cases, but according to the problem, t can be from 1 to 100, and in the example, t is 10. But in the code, it's hard-coded to read 10 lines, which might not be correct if t can vary.

Wait, in the problem, it says "the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)", and then there are t test cases, each with a line containing two integers x and y.

In the code, it reads t but doesn't use it to control the loop; instead, it loops 10 times fixed. That might be a mistake if t can be less than or greater than 10.

Looking at the example input:

10

1 9

8 4

1 4

3 4

2 0

2 4

6 9

3 3

0 0

9 9

So, t=10, and there are 10 test cases following.

But in the code, it always reads 10 lines, regardless of the value of t.

That seems incorrect because according to the problem, t can be any value between 1 and 100, and the code should read t test cases, not always 10.

Wait, perhaps the code assumes that t is always 10, but according to the problem, t can be from 1 to 100.

So, this might be a mistake.

But in the example, t is 10, and the code reads 10 lines, so it works for the example, but not necessarily for other values of t.

Hmm.

Maybe the problem has a constraint where t is always 10, but according to the problem statement, t can be from 1 to 100, so it's not necessarily always 10.

Perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Moving on, for each test case, it splits the input line into x and y, converts them to integers, and appends them to the lists x and y.

Then, it loops through the lists and for each pair, it prints the minimum followed by the maximum.

The logic inside the loop seems correct: if x[i] < y[i], print x[i] and y[i], else print y[i] and x[i].

So, it's correctly identifying the min and max for each pair.

But the issue is with handling the number of test cases, t.

If t is not always 10, then hard-coding the loop to run 10 times is incorrect.

In the problem, t is given, and the code should read t test cases based on the value of t.

So, the code is assuming t is always 10, which might not be the case.

Perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the problem, it says "the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100)", and then there are t test cases.

So, the code should read t and then loop t times to read the test cases.

But in the code, it's fixed to read 10 lines, regardless of t.

That's a problem.

For example, if t=5, the code would still read 10 lines, which is incorrect.

So, the code is incorrect in handling the number of test cases.

It should read t and then loop t times to read the test cases.

Let me think about how to fix it.

Instead of hard-coding the loop to run 10 times, it should read t and loop t times.

So, it should be:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    xylist = input().split(' ')

    x.append(int(xylist[0]))

    y.append(int(xylist[1]))

And then the second loop should also be range(t), not range(10).

But wait, in the problem, it's given that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9, which is fine.

Also, in the output, for each test case, it should output two integers: the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y.

The code is correctly identifying min and max and printing them.

But again, the loop is hard-coded to 10, which is a mistake.

So, overall, the logic is correct, but the handling of the number of test cases is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, t=10, and the code reads 10 lines, so it works for the example.

But according to the problem, t can vary from 1 to 100, so it's not general.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
