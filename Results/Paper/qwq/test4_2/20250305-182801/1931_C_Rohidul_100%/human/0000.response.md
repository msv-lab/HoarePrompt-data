Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers: i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

The goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always make all elements equal, so I don't need to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal with at most one operation. Since I can only perform the operation once, I need to choose a segment of the array to set to a certain value x, and the rest of the array will remain as it is. However, I need all elements to be equal in the end, so the value x that I choose must be the same as the value that remains in the parts of the array that are not modified.

Wait, actually, I can choose to set a segment to x, and the rest of the array will remain as is, but for all elements to be equal, the value x must be equal to the value that is common in the unmodified parts of the array. But this seems a bit confusing. Let me think differently.

Another way to look at it is that I can choose to set the entire array to a single value, but I have to do this in at most one operation, which involves setting a contiguous subarray to a certain value. So, I need to find a way to make the entire array equal by possibly setting one subarray to a specific value.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's consider the extreme cases. If the array is already uniform, meaning all elements are already equal, then I don't need to perform any operation, so the cost is 0. That seems straightforward.

If the array is not uniform, then I need to decide which part to set to make all elements equal. One strategy could be to choose a value that appears most frequently in the array and set the non-matching parts to that value. But wait, the operation allows me to set only a contiguous subarray to a chosen value. So, I might not be able to set disjoint parts of the array in one operation.

Let me try to think of an example. Take the first example in the problem:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

I need to make all elements equal with at most one operation. If I choose to set indices 2 to 4 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1]. Then, I can see that only elements at positions 5 are different. But since I can perform only one operation, I need to choose another operation to set the 5 to 1, but the problem says I can perform the operation at most once. So, perhaps this approach doesn't work.

Wait, no. The problem says "no more than once," meaning I can choose to perform the operation zero times or once. If I perform it once, I can set a contiguous subarray to a certain value. In the above case, if I set indices 2 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal, and the cost is 4 burles.

Another example:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Here, all elements are already equal, so the cost is 0.

Another one:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

I can set indices 4 to 5 to 8, making the array [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], with a cost of 2 burles.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to find the largest contiguous subarray that already has the value I want for the final array, and then set the remaining parts in one operation.

Wait, perhaps another way is to find the minimum cost to make the entire array equal to a particular value, and then choose the value that minimizes this cost.

But since I can perform the operation only once, I need to choose a value and decide which part to set to that value to minimize the cost.

Let me consider that I choose the final value to be x. Then, I need to set all elements that are not equal to x to x, but I can only set one contiguous subarray in one operation.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x, and then set the remaining parts in one operation.

Wait, but I can only set one contiguous subarray to x, so the parts that are not equal to x must be covered by this one operation.

So, I need to find a value x such that the number of elements that are not equal to x is minimized, and those elements can be covered by one contiguous subarray.

Wait, but that might not always be possible. For example, if x appears in multiple disjoint segments, I might need to set multiple operations, but I can only perform one.

So, perhaps I need to choose x such that the longest contiguous subarray of x's is as long as possible, and then set the rest in one operation.

But this seems complicated. Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program defines a function func() that seems to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the loop for _ in range(int(input())).

For each test case:

- It reads n, the size of the array.

- It reads the array a as a list of integers.

- It sets le = len(a), which is the same as n.

- It initializes l and r as the left and right pointers starting from the ends of the array.

- It also initializes st and end to 1, which seem to count the lengths of prefix and suffix that have the same value.

- It then has two while loops:

- The first while loop increments l as long as a[l] == a[l + 1], effectively finding the length of the initial run of equal elements.

- The second while loop decrements r as long as a[r] == a[r - 1], finding the length of the trailing run of equal elements.

- Then, it calculates ans = le - max(st, end), which seems to be the minimum cost.

- If a[0] == a[-1], meaning the first and last elements are equal, it recalculates ans as le - (st + end), but only if st + end <= le.

- Finally, it prints ans.

Let me see if this makes sense.

Take the first example:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Here, a[0] = 1 and a[-1] = 1, so a[0] == a[-1].

- l starts at 0, r at 5.

- a[0] == a[1] is 1 == 2? No, so st remains 1.

- a[5] == a[4]? 1 == 5? No, so end remains 1.

- ans = 6 - max(1,1) = 5.

- But since a[0] == a[-1], ans = max(0, 6 - (1 +1)) = 4.

Which matches the first example's output.

Another example:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

- a[0] == a[-1] == 1.

- l starts at 0, and since a[0] == a[1], l increments to 1, a[1] == a[2], l to 2, ..., up to l=5.

- r starts at 6, and a[6] == a[5], r to 5, but a[5] != a[4], so end remains 1.

- ans = 7 - max(6,1) = 1, but since a[0] == a[-1], ans = max(0, 7 - (6 +1)) = max(0,0) = 0.

Which matches the second example.

Another example:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

- a[0] == a[-1] == 8.

- l starts at 0, increments until a[3] != 8, so st=3.

- r starts at 7, decrements until a[4] !=8, so end=4.

- ans = 8 - max(3,4) = 4, but since a[0] == a[-1], ans = max(0, 8 - (3+4)) = max(0,1) =1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2. Wait, the sample output shows 2 for this case, but according to this calculation, it's 1. So maybe there's an error.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let's see:

a = [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

- l starts at 0, a[0]==a[1], a[1]==a[2], so l=2, st=3.

- r starts at 7, a[7]==a[6], a[6]==a[5], so r=5, end=3.

- ans = 8 - max(3,3) =5, but since a[0]==a[-1], ans = max(0, 8 - (3+3)) = max(0,2) =2.

Which matches the sample output.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, the logic seems to be:

- Find the longest prefix of equal elements.

- Find the longest suffix of equal elements.

- If the first and last elements are equal, consider the combined length of the prefix and suffix that are equal to a[0].

- The answer is the total length minus the maximum of these lengths, adjusted if the prefix and suffix can be combined.

This seems to be a strategy to minimize the cost by maximizing the number of elements that are already equal to the chosen value.

In the case where a[0] == a[-1], combining the prefix and suffix might cover more elements, hence potentially reducing the cost further.

I need to verify if this logic always holds.

Let's consider another example:

1

1

- n=1, a=[1]

- l=r=0, st=end=1

- a[0]==a[-1], ans = max(0,1 - (1+1)) = max(0,-1)=0

Which matches the sample output.

Another example:

2

1 2

- a[0]!=a[-1]

- l=0, a[0]!=a[1], so st=1

- r=1, a[1]!=a[0], end=1

- ans=2 - max(1,1)=1

Which matches the sample output.

Another example:

3

1 2 3

- a[0]!=a[-1]

- l=0, a[0]!=a[1], st=1

- r=2, a[2]!=a[1], end=1

- ans=3 - max(1,1)=2

Which matches the sample.

Another example:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

- a[0]=4, a[-1]=3, they are different.

- l=0, a[0]!=a[1], st=1

- r=6, a[6]!=a[5], end=1

- ans=7 - max(1,1)=6

Which matches the sample.

Last example:

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

- a[0]=9, a[-1]=3, different.

- l=0, a[0]==a[1], l=1, a[1]!=a[2], st=2

- r=8, a[8]!=a[7], end=1

- ans=9 - max(2,1)=7

Which matches the sample.

So, in all these cases, the program seems to be producing the correct output.

Now, I need to think if this logic is universally correct.

Suppose we have an array where the prefix and suffix have the same value, and the middle part is different.

By setting the middle part to the value of the prefix and suffix, we can make the entire array equal to that value, and the cost would be the length of the middle part.

Alternatively, if we choose a different value, we might need to set larger parts to that value, increasing the cost.

So, choosing the value that has the longest combined prefix and suffix seems optimal.

But, in the operation, we can only set one contiguous subarray to a certain value. So, we need to make sure that by setting one contiguous subarray, we can make the entire array equal to a chosen value.

Let me consider an array:

5

1 2 1 2 1

Here, a[0] == a[2] == a[4] ==1, and a[1] == a[3] ==2.

If I choose to set the middle subarray from index 1 to 3 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1], with a cost of 3.

Alternatively, if I choose to set the subarray from index 0 to 4 to 1, which is essentially setting the entire array to 1 with a cost of 5, but that's more expensive.

So, the minimal cost is 3.

According to the program:

- n=5, a=[1,2,1,2,1]

- a[0]==a[-1]==1

- l=0, a[0]==a[1]? 1!=2, so st=1

- r=4, a[4]==a[3]? 1!=2, so end=1

- ans=5 - max(1,1)=4

- But since a[0]==a[-1], ans=max(0,5 - (1+1))=3

Which matches the minimal cost of 3.

Another case:

5

1 1 2 2 2

- a[0]==a[-1]==1

- l=0, a[0]==a[1], l=1, a[1]!=a[2], st=2

- r=4, a[4]==a[3], r=3, a[3]==a[2], r=2, a[2]!=a[1], end=3

- ans=5 - max(2,3)=3

- Since a[0]==a[-1], ans=max(0,5 - (2+3))=0

Wait, but in this case, if I set the subarray from index 2 to 4 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1], with a cost of 3, but according to the program, it's 0.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, according to the program, ans=max(0,5 - (2+3))=0, which suggests that the entire array is already equal to 1, which is not the case.

Wait, but in reality, to make the entire array equal to 1, I need to set the subarray from index 2 to 4 to 1, which costs 3.

So, the program seems to be incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back at the program:

ans = le - max(st, end)

if a[0] == a[-1]:

ans = max(0, le - (st + end))

In this case:

le=5, st=2, end=3, a[0]==a[-1]

So, ans=max(0,5 - (2+3))=max(0,0)=0

But actually, the minimal cost is 3, not 0.

So, the program is giving an incorrect answer here.

Wait, perhaps the program is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the correct approach is:

- Find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray that has elements equal to the chosen value.

- Then, the cost is the total length minus this maximum length.

- To minimize the cost, choose the value that maximizes this length.

But with the operation, I can set one subarray to a certain value, which can potentially increase the length of the uniform segment.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that setting one subarray to a certain value can connect two existing segments that have the same value.

For example, in the array [1,2,1,2,1], setting indices 1 to 3 to 1 connects the prefix and suffix, making the entire array equal to 1 with a cost of 3.

In the array [1,1,2,2,2], setting indices 2 to 4 to 1 connects the first two 1's to the last 1, making the entire array equal to 1 with a cost of 3.

But according to the program, in this case, it's giving ans=0, which is incorrect.

So, the program seems to have a flaw.

Perhaps the correct approach is:

- Choose a value x that appears in the array.

- Find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray consisting of x.

- If the entire array is already x, cost is 0.

- Otherwise, set the non-x parts to x in one operation, with cost equal to the length of the non-x parts.

Wait, but I can only set one contiguous subarray to x.

So, I need to choose which part to set to x to maximize the uniformity of the array.

This seems tricky.

An alternative approach could be:

- Choose a value x.

- Identify all segments that are already x.

- Find the minimal cost to connect these segments by setting one contiguous subarray to x.

This sounds similar to finding the minimal cost to make the entire array equal to x, given that you can set one contiguous subarray to x.

But I'm not sure about the exact implementation.

Given that, the provided program seems to have flaws, as evidenced by the [1,1,2,2,2] example.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
