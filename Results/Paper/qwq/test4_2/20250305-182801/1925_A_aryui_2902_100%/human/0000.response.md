Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. N seems to represent the length of the strings I need to form, and k is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to use. For example, if k is 3, I'd be using 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The task is to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n using those k alphabets appear as subsequences in s. And I need to make sure that s is as short as possible. If there are multiple possibilities with the same length, I can choose any of them.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Given that, I need to ensure that every possible combination of length n using the first k alphabets is a subsequence of s.

Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

Input: 1 2

Output: ab

Possible strings of length 1 using 'a' and 'b' are "a" and "b". Both are present in "ab" as subsequences.

In the second test case:

Input: 2 1

Output: aa

Possible strings: "aa". It's present in "aa" as a subsequence.

In the third test case:

Input: 2 2

Output: baab

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". All these are present in "baab" as subsequences.

In the fourth test case:

Input: 2 3

Output: abcbac

Possible strings: All combinations of two letters from 'a', 'b', 'c', which are "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". All these are present in "abcbac" as subsequences.

Now, looking at the program provided:

It reads the number of test cases, t, and for each test case, it calls a function func_1() and prints the result.

In func_1(), it reads n and k, gets the first k letters of the alphabet, and then repeats that string n times.

So, for example, if n=1 and k=2, s[:2] is 'ab', and 'ab' * 1 is 'ab', which matches the first test case.

For n=2 and k=1, s[:1] is 'a', and 'a' * 2 is 'aa', matching the second test case.

For n=2 and k=2, s[:2] is 'ab', and 'ab' * 2 is 'abab', but in the sample output, it's 'baab'. Hmm, that's different. So, is 'abab' also correct, or is there a specific reason why 'baab' is used?

Wait, in the sample output for n=2 and k=2, it's 'baab', which also contains all the required subsequences: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

So, is 'abab' correct as well? Let's check:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (a from index 1 and a from index 3)

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 (a from index 1 and b from index 2)

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 (b from index 2 and a from index 3)

- "bb": positions 2 and 4 (b from index 2 and b from index 4)

Yes, 'abab' also contains all the required subsequences. So, both 'abab' and 'baab' are correct for this case.

But the problem asks for the string with the smallest length. So, I need to make sure that the string I generate is as short as possible.

In this case, both 'abab' and 'baab' have length 4, which seems optimal.

But let's consider another example: n=2, k=3.

Sample output is 'abcbac'.

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc".

I need to confirm if 'abcbac' is the shortest possible string that contains all these as subsequences.

I don't have an immediate way to verify that, but assuming it's correct, I need to see if the provided program generates something of the same length or shorter.

According to the program, s[:3] is 'abc', and 'abc' * 2 is 'abcabc', which is different from 'abcbac'. But 'abcabc' also contains all the required subsequences:

- "aa": positions 1 and 4

- "ab": positions 1 and 2, or 1 and 5, etc.

- "ac": positions 1 and 6

- "ba": positions 2 and 4

- "bb": positions 2 and 5

- "bc": positions 2 and 6, or 5 and 6

- "ca": positions 3 and 4

- "cb": positions 3 and 5

- "cc": positions 3 and 6

So, 'abcabc' seems to work as well, and it's of length 6, same as 'abcbac'.

So, both are acceptable.

But is there a shorter string that can contain all these subsequences? I'm not sure. Maybe not.

So, it seems that repeating the first k letters n times works, and gives a string of length k*n.

But is this the shortest possible?

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, k=2, output is 'ab', which has length 2, which is k*n.

In the second test case, n=2, k=1, output 'aa', length 2, which is n*k.

In the third test case, n=2, k=2, output 'baab', length 4, which is n*k.

In the fourth test case, n=2, k=3, output 'abcbac', length 6, which is n*k.

So, it seems that the length is always n*k, at least in these examples.

But is this the minimal possible length?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have n=2 and k=2. The output is 'baab' or 'abab', both of length 4.

Is there a string of length 3 that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using 'a' and 'b'?

Let's try 'aab':

- "aa": positions 1 and 2

- "ab": positions 1 and 3

- "ba": no occurrence (there's no 'b' before 'a')

- "bb": no occurrence

So, 'aab' doesn't work.

'aba':

- "aa": positions 1 and 3

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 3

- "bb": no occurrence

Missing "bb".

'abb':

- "aa": no

- "ab": positions 1 and 2, or 1 and 3

- "ba": no

- "bb": positions 2 and 3

Missing "aa" and "ba".

'stabbing': Okay, it seems like it's impossible to have all four subsequences in a string of length 3.

Therefore, length 4 is indeed minimal for n=2 and k=2.

Similarly, for n=2 and k=3, the minimal length seems to be 6, as in 'abcabc' or 'abcbac'.

So, it seems that the approach of repeating the first k letters n times gives the minimal length.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider n=3 and k=2.

According to the approach, s[:2] is 'ab', and 'ab' * 3 is 'ababab'.

Does 'ababab' contain all possible subsequences of length 3 using 'a' and 'b'?

Possible subsequences:

"aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"

Let's check if each of these is present in 'ababab':

- "aaa": positions 1,3,5

- "aab": positions 1,3,4

- "aba": positions 1,2,4

- "abb": positions 1,2,5

- "baa": positions 2,4,5

- "bab": positions 2,3,5

- "bba": positions 2,4,5 (same as "baa"? Wait, no.)

Wait, positions for "bba":

- First 'b' at position 2

- Second 'b' at position 4

- 'a' at position 5

So, positions 2,4,5

- "bbb": positions 2,5,6

So, all subsequences are present.

Is there a shorter string that can contain all these subsequences?

Let's see if a string of length 5 can work.

Take 'ababa':

- "aaa": positions 1,3,5

- "aab": positions 1,3,4

- "aba": positions 1,2,4

- "abb": positions 1,2,5

- "baa": positions 2,4,5

- "bab": positions 2,3,5

- "bba": positions 2,4,5 (same as "baa"?)

- "bbb": positions 2,5,6 (but there's no position 6 in 'ababa')

So, "bbb" is missing.

Therefore, 'ababa' doesn't contain all subsequences.

What about 'ababb'?

- "aaa": positions 1,3,5 (a at 1, b at 3, b at 5: not "aaa")

Wait, no. "aaa" requires three 'a's. In 'ababb', there are 'a's at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, positions 1,4: only two 'a's. So, "aaa" is impossible in 'ababb' because there are only two 'a's.

Hence, 'ababb' doesn't contain "aaa".

So, it seems that a string of length 5 cannot contain all the required subsequences for n=3 and k=2.

Therefore, the minimal length seems to be 6, which is k*n.

Hence, the approach of repeating the first k letters n times seems to give the minimal length.

Therefore, the program's approach seems correct.

But wait, in the third test case, n=2 and k=2, the output is 'baab', which is different from 'abab', but both have the same length.

So, the specific arrangement might differ, but as long as the length is k*n, it seems to work.

Therefore, the program's approach of taking the first k letters and repeating them n times should work.

Hence, the program seems correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
