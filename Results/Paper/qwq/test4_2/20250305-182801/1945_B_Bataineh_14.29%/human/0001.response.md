Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals. The first one launches every 'a' minutes, and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the launch times:

- Installation 1: launches at a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, etc.

- Installation 2: launches at b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, etc.

Each firework launched at time t is visible from t to t + m.

So, for any given time, the number of visible fireworks is the sum of fireworks launched by both installations that are still visible at that time.

I need to find the time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible simultaneously.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the launch times and the visibility periods and see how they overlap.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to calculate this without simulating each time step.

I need to find a mathematical way to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any time.

Let's consider the visibility periods for each installation separately first.

For installation 1:

- Fireworks are launched at a, 2a, 3a, ..., and each is visible for m minutes.

Similarly for installation 2.

Now, I need to find a time when the number of overlapping visibility periods is maximized.

I recall that in similar problems, like finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals, we can sort the start and end times and iterate through them.

But given the large values of a, b, and m, sorting and iterating through each event isn't feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the possible scenarios where the number of visible fireworks is maximized.

It could be at a time when multiple fireworks are launched close to each other.

Specifically, around the times when the launch times of both installations coincide or are within m minutes of each other.

So, I need to find times when launches from both installations are close enough that their visibility periods overlap.

Let's think about the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, which would be the time when both installations launch simultaneously.

But if a and b are co-prime or have no common factors, their LCM would be a*b, which could be very large.

But maybe I don't need to consider the LCM directly.

Let me consider the launch times modulo m.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a time t, and I want to know how many fireworks are visible at that time.

For installation 1, a firework launched at ka (k is a positive integer) is visible at time t if ka <= t <= ka + m.

Similarly, for installation 2, lb <= t <= lb + m.

So, for installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of k such that t - m <= ka <= t.

Similarly for installation 2.

This seems similar to finding how many multiples of a are in the interval [t - m, t].

The number of such k is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a)

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

But since t can be up to very large values, I need a way to find the maximum value without iterating through all possible t.

Let me consider the behavior of the floor functions.

The floor(t / a) increases by 1 every a minutes, and similarly for floor(t / b).

The term floor((t - m - 1) / a) also increases by 1 every a minutes.

So, the difference floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) can change only at multiples of a or at t = m + 1.

Similarly for installation 2.

This seems complex to handle directly.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that for installation 1, the number of visible fireworks is ceil(m / a) + 1, but I need to consider the overlapping with installation 2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the maximum possible overlaps.

The maximum number of visible fireworks from installation 1 alone is floor(m / a) + 1, because m / a gives the number of launches within m minutes.

Similarly for installation 2.

But I need to consider when these visibility periods overlap.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But looking back at the sample input and output:

For the first test case:

a=6, b=7, m=4

floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the sample output of 2.

For the second test case:

a=3, b=4, m=10

floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample output of 7.

For the third test case:

a=7, b=8, m=56

floor(56/7)=8, floor(56/8)=7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the sample output of 17.

For the fourth test case:

a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

floor(78123459896/5)=15624691979, floor(78123459896/6)=13020576649, so 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

For the fifth test case:

a=1, b=1, m=1

floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output of 4.

For the sixth test case:

a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, in all sample cases, the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the correct answer.

But is this always true?

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose I choose a time t such that it maximizes the number of visible fireworks.

What is the best possible t?

I think the best t is when t is equal to LCM(a, b), the least common multiple of a and b.

Because at that time, both installations have launched fireworks, and their visibility periods overlap.

But wait, in the first sample, a=6, b=7, m=4.

LCM(6,7)=42.

At t=42, installation 1 has launched 7 fireworks (at 6,12,18,24,30,36,42), and installation 2 has launched 6 fireworks (at 7,14,21,28,35,42).

Each firework is visible for m=4 minutes.

So, at t=42, fireworks from installation 1 launched at 36 and 42 are visible (36+4=40, 42+4=46, so at t=42, both are visible).

Similarly, from installation 2, fireworks launched at 35 and 42 are visible (35+4=39, 42+4=46, so at t=42, both are visible).

So, total visible fireworks at t=42 are 4, which is different from the sample output of 2.

Wait, but according to the sample, the output is 2, but according to this, it's 4.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the fireworks from the same installation don't overlap if m < a or m < b.

In the first sample, m=4, a=6, b=7.

So, m < a and m < b.

In this case, no two fireworks from the same installation can be visible at the same time because the launch interval is greater than m.

So, at any time, only one firework from each installation can be visible.

Hence, the maximum visible is 2.

But according to my earlier formula, floor(4/6)=0, floor(4/7)=0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

In my earlier calculation at t=42, I got 4, but according to the problem, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm counting incorrectly.

Let's re-examine.

At t=42:

- Installation 1:

- Firework at t=36: visible from 36 to 40.

- Firework at t=42: visible from 42 to 46.

- Only t=42 is common, but at t=42, both are visible.

- Installation 2:

- Firework at t=35: visible from 35 to 39.

- Firework at t=42: visible from 42 to 46.

- At t=42, both are visible.

So, total visible at t=42: 2 from installation 1 and 2 from installation 2, but actually, only one from each installation is visible at t=42, because the fireworks from the same installation don't overlap if m < a and m < b.

Wait, no. In this case, m < a and m < b, so only one firework from each installation is visible at any time.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought two fireworks from installation 1 are visible at t=42, but actually, at t=42:

- Firework from t=36: visible until t=40.

- Firework from t=42: visible from t=42 to 46.

So, at t=42, both are visible, but according to m < a, only one should be visible.

Wait, no, m < a doesn't directly imply that only one is visible.

Wait, m < a means that the visibility period of one firework doesn't overlap with the next firework's launch time.

Wait, in this case, m=4, a=6.

The next firework is launched at t=12, which is after m=4 minutes from t=6.

So, at t=6 + m = 10, the firework launched at t=6 is no longer visible.

The next firework is at t=12, which starts being visible at t=12 and continues until t=16.

So, there is no overlap between fireworks from the same installation.

Hence, at any time, only one firework from each installation is visible.

Therefore, the maximum number of visible fireworks is 2.

But according to my formula, floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which is correct.

In the second sample:

a=3, b=4, m=10

floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/4)=2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

Is this correct?

Let's check.

At t=12 (LCM of 3 and 4):

- Installation 1: launches at t=3,6,9,12.

- Fireworks visible at t=12: t=9 (9 to 19), t=12 (12 to 22).

- So, two from installation 1.

- Installation 2: launches at t=4,8,12.

- Fireworks visible at t=12: t=8 (8 to 18), t=12 (12 to 22).

- So, two from installation 2.

- Total: 4.

But according to the formula, it's 7, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, m=10.

So, visibility is t to t + 10.

Wait, in the first sample, m=4, visibility is t to t + 4.

Wait, in this sample, m=10, so visibility is t to t + 10.

At t=12:

- Installation 1: launches at t=3,6,9,12.

- Firework at t=3: visible from 3 to 13.

- Firework at t=6: visible from 6 to 16.

- Firework at t=9: visible from 9 to 19.

- Firework at t=12: visible from 12 to 22.

- At t=12, all four are visible.

- Installation 2: launches at t=4,8,12.

- Firework at t=4: visible from 4 to 14.

- Firework at t=8: visible from 8 to 18.

- Firework at t=12: visible from 12 to 22.

- At t=12, all three are visible.

- Total visible at t=12: 4 + 3 = 7.

So, in this case, the formula works.

Wait, but in the first sample, it was 2, which matched the formula.

Wait, but in the first sample, at t=7, only one from each installation is visible.

At t=7:

- Installation 1: firework at t=6 (6 to 10), visible at t=7.

- Installation 2: firework at t=7 (7 to 11), visible at t=7.

- Total: 2.

So, the formula still holds.

Wait, but in the second sample, at t=12, total visible is 7, which matches the formula.

So, perhaps the formula is correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a=2, b=3, m=5.

floor(5/2)=2, floor(5/3)=1, so 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

Let's check.

At t=6 (LCM of 2 and 3):

- Installation 1: launches at t=2,4,6.

- Firework at t=2: visible from 2 to 7.

- Firework at t=4: visible from 4 to 9.

- Firework at t=6: visible from 6 to 11.

- At t=6, all three are visible.

- Installation 2: launches at t=3,6.

- Firework at t=3: visible from 3 to 8.

- Firework at t=6: visible from 6 to 11.

- At t=6, both are visible.

- Total: 3 + 2 = 5, which matches the formula.

Another test case:

a=1, b=1, m=1.

floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

At t=1:

- Installation 1: firework at t=1 (1 to 2).

- Installation 2: firework at t=1 (1 to 2).

- But since a=1, b=1, m=1, fireworks are launched every minute and visible for 1 minute.

- At t=1: both fireworks are visible.

- But according to the formula, it's 4, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, in this case, m=1, a=1, b=1.

floor(1/1)=1, floor(1/1)=1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

But actually, at t=1, there are two fireworks visible.

Wait, perhaps the formula overcounts in some cases.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

Wait, in the first sample, floor(4/6)=0, +1=1, floor(4/7)=0, +1=1, total 2, which matches.

In the second sample, floor(10/3)=3, +1=4, floor(10/4)=2, +1=3, total 7, which matches.

In the third sample, floor(56/7)=8, +1=9, floor(56/8)=7, +1=8, total 17, which matches.

In the fourth sample, floor(78123459896/5)=15624691979, +1=15624691980, floor(78123459896/6)=13020576649, +1=13020576650, total 28645268630, which matches.

In the fifth sample, floor(1/1)=1, +1=2, floor(1/1)=1, +1=2, total 4, which matches.

In the sixth sample, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, +1=1000000000000000001, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, +1=1000000000000000001, total 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, perhaps the correct formula is floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

Wait, but in the first sample, floor(4/6)=0, +1=1, floor(4/7)=0, +1=1, total 2, which matches.

In the second sample, floor(10/3)=3, +1=4, floor(10/4)=2, +1=3, total 7, which matches.

In the third sample, floor(56/7)=8, +1=9, floor(56/8)=7, +1=8, total 17, which matches.

In the fourth sample, floor(78123459896/5)=15624691979, +1=15624691980, floor(78123459896/6)=13020576649, +1=13020576650, total 28645268630, which matches.

In the fifth sample, floor(1/1)=1, +1=2, floor(1/1)=1, +1=2, total 4, which matches.

In the sixth sample, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, +1=1000000000000000001, floor(1000000000000000000/1)=1000000000000000000, +1=1000000000000000001, total 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula is floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

Therefore, the program should be:

print(m // a + 1 + m // b + 1)

Simplify to:

print(m // a + m // b + 2)

Which is exactly what the given program does.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
