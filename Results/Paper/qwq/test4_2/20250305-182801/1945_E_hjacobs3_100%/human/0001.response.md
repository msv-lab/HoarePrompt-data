Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can perform at most two swaps to rearrange the elements before running the binary search. The goal is to make sure that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. Here, the array isn't sorted, but I can perform up to two swaps to rearrange the elements. The problem says that it's always possible to do this with at most two swaps, which is good to know.

Let me try to understand the binary search algorithm as described in the problem:

1. Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

2. While r - l > 1:

a. Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2).

b. If p_m <= x, set l = m; else set r = m.

After the loop, p_l should be equal to x.

Wait a minute, this binary search seems a bit unusual. Typically, binary search on a sorted array would have l = 0 and r = n, and the conditions would be adjusted accordingly. But here, l starts at 1 and r at n + 1, which seems off. Also, the array isn't sorted, which makes things tricky.

Let me try to understand how this binary search works with an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 6, x = 3

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

So, the array is already sorted. Let's see how the binary search proceeds:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

While 7 - 1 = 6 > 1:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4 <= 3? No, so r = 4

Now, l = 1, r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2 <= 3? Yes, so l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((3 + 4)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

Since r - l = 1, end the loop.

So, p_l = p_3 = 3, which is equal to x. Perfect.

In this case, no swaps were needed because the array was already sorted.

Now, let's look at the second test case:

n = 6, x = 5

array = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Let's see what happens if we run the binary search without any swaps.

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

While 7 - 1 = 6 > 1:

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 5? Yes, so l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = floor((4 + 7)/2) = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, so l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = floor((5 + 7)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, so l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = floor((6 + 7)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, so l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

Since r - l = 1, end the loop.

p_l = p_6 = 4, which is not equal to x = 5.

So, we need to perform some swaps to make this work.

The problem allows up to two swaps. We need to find a way to swap elements so that after the binary search, p_l = x.

One approach could be to identify where x is located in the array and try to bring it to a position where the binary search will find it.

Let's find the current position of x in the array.

In the second test case, x = 5 is at position 4.

Now, if we run the binary search, it ends up with l = 6, p_l = 4.

We need to adjust the array so that after the binary search, p_l = 5.

One idea is to swap elements to make sure that during the binary search, the comparisons lead l to the position where x is located.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, the problem mentions that it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient.

So, perhaps there's a general strategy that works for any permutation.

Let me think about the binary search process.

In a sorted array, binary search repeatedly divides the array into two halves and decides which half to continue searching in based on comparisons with the middle element.

Here, the array isn't sorted, but we can manipulate its order with swaps to guide the binary search to the correct position.

Given that we can perform up to two swaps, we have some flexibility to adjust the array.

One strategy could be to place x in a specific position where we know the binary search will end up.

But, binary search's behavior depends on the entire array's order, not just the position of x.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about where the binary search will end up based on the current array and see if we can swap elements to make p_l = x.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the binary search and see where it ends up, then determine what changes are needed to make p_l = x.

Let me try that with the second test case.

array = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

x = 5

As before, binary search ends with l = 6, p_l = 4.

But x is at position 4.

So, perhaps I can swap p_6 and p_4 to make p_6 = 5.

Then, the array becomes [3, 1, 6, 4, 2, 5]

Let's see what happens with the binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4, p_4 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = floor((4 + 7)/2) = 5, p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = floor((5 + 7)/2) = 6, p_6 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = floor((6 + 7)/2) = 6, p_6 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

End with p_l = 5, which is equal to x.

So, by swapping positions 4 and 6, we achieved the desired result in one swap.

That's efficient.

So, in this case, one swap was sufficient.

Let's see another test case.

Third test case:

n = 5, x = 1

array = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Let's run the binary search without any swaps.

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 3

Now, l = 1, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 5 <= 1? No, r = 2

Now, l = 1, r = 2

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, p_1 = 3 <= 1? No, r = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 1

Since r - l = 0, end the loop.

p_l = p_1 = 3, which is not equal to x = 1.

So, we need to perform swaps.

Let's see where x = 1 is located: position 5.

We need to adjust the array so that the binary search ends with l = 5.

How can we achieve that?

One way is to bring x to a position where the binary search will reach it.

Alternatively, perhaps we can adjust the array so that the comparisons during binary search guide l to position 5.

This seems a bit tricky.

Another idea: since we can perform up to two swaps, we can try to bring x to a position where l will end up, or adjust other elements to influence the path of the binary search.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the final position where l ends up and see if we can make p_l = x there.

In this case, without any swaps, l ends up at position 1.

We need to make p_1 = 1.

So, swap position 1 and 5.

array becomes [1, 5, 4, 2, 3]

Now, run the binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 5 <= 1? No, r = 2

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, p_1 = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 2

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, p_1 = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 1

End with p_l = 1, which is equal to x.

So, again, one swap was sufficient.

This seems promising.

Let me try to generalize this approach.

Strategy:

1. Perform the binary search to see where l ends up without any swaps.

2. If p_l == x, we're done (0 swaps).

3. If p_l != x, swap p_l with x's current position (1 swap).

4. If after the swap, p_l == x, we're done.

5. If not, perform a second swap to adjust as needed.

But in the examples above, one swap was sufficient.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough, and we need two swaps?

Let's consider another test case.

Fourth test case:

n = 6, x = 3

array = [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]

Let's perform the binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4, p_4 = 5 <= 3? No, r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2, p_2 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((3 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

End with p_l = 1, which is not equal to x = 3.

So, we need to perform swaps.

Current position of x = 3 is position 2.

l ended up at position 3.

So, swap positions 2 and 3.

array becomes [4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]

Now, run the binary search again:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4, p_4 = 5 <= 3? No, r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((3 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

End with p_l = 3, which is equal to x.

So, again, one swap was sufficient.

Another example:

Fifth test case:

n = 3, x = 2

array = [3, 2, 1]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((3 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

End with p_l = 1, which is not equal to x = 2.

So, we need to perform swaps.

Current position of x = 2 is position 2.

l ended up at position 3.

So, swap positions 2 and 3.

array becomes [3, 1, 2]

Run binary search again:

Initialize l = 1, r = 4

m = floor((1 + 4)/2) = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((2 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((3 + 4)/2) = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

End with p_l = 2, which is equal to x.

Again, one swap was sufficient.

So, based on these examples, it seems that swapping the position where l ends up with the position of x is enough in one swap.

But is this always the case?

Let me think of a case where one swap isn't enough.

Suppose we have:

n = 4, x = 2

array = [3, 4, 1, 2]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 5

m = floor((1 + 5)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 5

m = floor((3 + 5)/2) = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 5

m = floor((4 + 5)/2) = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 4

End with p_l = 2, which is equal to x.

So, in this case, no swaps are needed.

Another case:

n = 4, x = 1

array = [3, 4, 2, 1]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 5

m = floor((1 + 5)/2) = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 1? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 2

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, p_1 = 3 <= 1? No, r = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 1

End with p_l = 3, which is not equal to x = 1.

So, need to perform swaps.

Position of x = 1 is position 4.

l ended up at position 1.

Swap positions 1 and 4.

array becomes [1, 4, 2, 3]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 5

m = floor((1 + 5)/2) = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 1? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 2

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, p_1 = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 1

Now, l = 1, r = 2

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, p_1 = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 1

End with p_l = 1, which is equal to x.

Again, one swap was sufficient.

Hmm.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let's try:

n = 5, x = 3

array = [5, 4, 2, 1, 3]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 6

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4, p_4 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 6

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5, p_5 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 6

m = floor((5 + 6)/2) = 5, p_5 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 5

End with p_l = 3, which is equal to x.

No swaps needed in this case.

Wait, but x was at position 5, and l ended up at position 5. So, no swaps needed.

Another case:

n = 4, x = 3

array = [1, 4, 2, 3]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 5

m = floor((1 + 5)/2) = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 5

m = floor((3 + 5)/2) = 4, p_4 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 5

m = floor((4 + 5)/2) = 4, p_4 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

End with p_l = 3, which is equal to x.

No swaps needed.

Wait, I'm not finding a case where one swap isn't enough.

Maybe in all cases, one swap is sufficient.

But the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient, but it doesn't say that one swap is always sufficient.

Maybe there are cases where one swap isn't enough.

Let me try to construct such a case.

Suppose n = 4, x = 2

array = [3, 1, 4, 2]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 5

m = floor((1 + 5)/2) = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 2? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

End with p_l = 1, which is not equal to x = 2.

So, need to perform swaps.

Position of x = 2 is position 4.

l ended up at position 2.

Swap positions 2 and 4.

array becomes [3, 2, 4, 1]

Run binary search again:

Initialize l = 1, r = 5

m = floor((1 + 5)/2) = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 2? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

End with p_l = 2, which is equal to x.

Again, one swap was sufficient.

Hmm.

Maybe one swap is always sufficient.

But the problem says two swaps are always sufficient, implying that one might not be enough in some cases.

Wait, maybe I need to look for a case where one swap isn't enough.

Let's try:

n = 5, x = 3

array = [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 6

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 6

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5, p_5 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 6

m = floor((5 + 6)/2) = 5, p_5 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 5

End with p_l = 3, which is equal to x.

No swaps needed.

Another case:

n = 5, x = 4

array = [3, 5, 1, 2, 4]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 6

m = floor((3 + 6)/2) = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 4? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 6

m = floor((4 + 6)/2) = 5, p_5 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 6

m = floor((5 + 6)/2) = 5, p_5 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 5

End with p_l = 4, which is equal to x.

No swaps needed.

Wait, I'm not finding a case where one swap isn't enough.

Maybe in all cases, one swap is sufficient.

But the problem mentions that two swaps are always sufficient, suggesting that there might be cases where one swap isn't enough.

Perhaps I need to consider a more complex scenario.

Let's try:

n = 6, x = 3

array = [5, 4, 6, 1, 2, 3]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((1 + 7)/2) = 4, p_4 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = floor((4 + 7)/2) = 5, p_5 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = floor((5 + 7)/2) = 6, p_6 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = floor((6 + 7)/2) = 6, p_6 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 6

End with p_l = 3, which is equal to x.

No swaps needed.

Another case:

n = 5, x = 4

array = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 5 <= 4? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

End with p_l = 1, which is not equal to x = 4.

So, need to perform swaps.

Position of x = 4 is position 4.

l ended up at position 2.

Swap positions 2 and 4.

array becomes [3, 2, 5, 1, 4]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 5 <= 4? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

End with p_l = 2, which is not equal to x = 4.

Hmm, so one swap wasn't enough.

I need to perform a second swap.

Where is x = 4? At position 5.

Where is l ending? At position 2.

Maybe swap position 2 with position 5.

array becomes [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Run binary search:

Initialize l = 1, r = 6

m = floor((1 + 6)/2) = 3, p_3 = 5 <= 4? No, r = 3

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 3

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2, p_2 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

End with p_l = 4, which is equal to x.

So, two swaps were needed in this case.

Finally, a case where one swap wasn't enough.

So, in general, we might need up to two swaps to achieve the goal.

Therefore, a general strategy could be:

1. Perform the binary search to see where l ends up without any swaps.

2. If p_l == x, we're done (0 swaps).

3. If p_l != x, perform a swap between l and the position of x.

4. Perform the binary search again.

5. If p_l == x, we're done (1 swap).

6. If p_l != x, perform a second swap between l and the position of x.

7. Perform the binary search again.

8. p_l should now be equal to x (2 swaps).

However, in the last example, one swap wasn't enough, but two swaps were enough.

So, this seems like a viable strategy.

But I need to make sure that this always works.

Wait, in the last example, after the first swap, p_l was still not equal to x, so I performed a second swap and it worked.

Is there a guarantee that two swaps are always sufficient?

The problem states that two swaps are always sufficient.

So, I can rely on that.

Therefore, in my implementation, I can perform up to two swaps as needed.

Now, to implement this efficiently, especially considering the constraints (t up to 2*10^4 and n up to 2*10^5 with sum of n over t <= 2*10^5), I need an efficient way to find the position of x and the position where l ends up after the binary search.

First, I need to simulate the binary search to find where l ends up.

Then, based on that, decide the swaps needed.

Let's outline the steps in code:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and x.

b. Read the permutation array.

c. Find the current position of x in the array.

d. Simulate the binary search to find where l ends up.

i. Initialize l = 0 (since Python uses 0-based indexing), r = n

ii. While r - l > 1:

- m = floor((l + r) / 2)

- if array[m] <= x:

- l = m

- else:

- r = m

iii. At the end, l is the final position (0-based).

e. If array[l] == x, no swaps needed (output 0).

f. Else, swap array[l] with array[pos_x] (pos_x is the current position of x).

g. Simulate the binary search again to find where l ends up.

i. If array[l] == x, one swap was sufficient (output 1 swap).

h. Else, perform a second swap: swap array[l] with array[pos_x].

i. Simulate the binary search again; array[l] should now be x (output 2 swaps).

However, in practice, we don't need to simulate the binary search multiple times; we can reason about the positions after swaps.

But to keep it simple and ensure correctness, I can simulate the binary search each time after performing the swaps.

Given the time constraints, I need to make sure that each test case is processed efficiently.

Since the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, and each binary search is O(log n), the total time should be acceptable.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Find the position of x in the array.

- Simulate the binary search to find l.

- If array[l] == x, output 0.

- Else, swap array[l] with array[pos_x], and check again.

- If array[l] == x after the first swap, output 1.

- Else, perform a second swap between the new l and pos_x, and output 2.

Wait, but in code, I need to perform the swaps before running the binary search.

So, perhaps I should:

1. Find pos_x.

2. Find where l ends up without any swaps.

3. If array[l] == x, output 0.

4. Else, swap array[l] and array[pos_x], and check if array[l] == x.

5. If yes, output 1 swap.

6. Else, perform a second swap between array[l] and array[pos_x], and output 2 swaps.

But in the second swap, I need to be careful about what positions to swap.

Wait, in the last example:

Original array: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

x = 4, pos_x = 4 (0-based)

First, run binary search, l ends up at 2 (0-based, value 5)

Swap array[2] and array[4]: array becomes [3, 1, 4, 2, 5]

Run binary search again, l ends up at 2, array[2] = 4 == x, so one swap is enough.

Wait, in my earlier manual simulation, it seemed like one swap wasn't enough, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recast this.

Original array: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

x = 4, pos_x = 4

Binary search:

l = 0, r = 5

m = floor((0 + 5)/2) = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = floor((0 + 2)/2) = 1, array[1] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 1

m = floor((1 + 2)/2) = 1, array[1] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 1

End with l = 1, array[1] = 1 != 4

So, swap array[1] and array[4]: array becomes [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Run binary search again:

l = 0, r = 5

m = floor((0 + 5)/2) = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = floor((0 + 2)/2) = 0, array[0] = 3 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = floor((0 + 2)/2) = 0, array[0] = 3 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 3 != 4

Wait, in this case, one swap wasn't enough.

So, need to perform a second swap.

Now, l is at 0, x is at 4.

Swap array[0] and array[4]: array becomes [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]

Run binary search again:

l = 0, r = 5

m = floor((0 + 5)/2) = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = floor((0 + 2)/2) = 0, array[0] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = floor((0 + 2)/2) = 0, array[0] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 1 != 4

Hmm, it seems like two swaps weren't enough.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different positions to swap.

Alternative approach:

After the first swap, if array[l] still isn't x, perhaps I should swap l with another position, not necessarily pos_x again.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to think about the positions.

In the original array: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

x = 4, pos_x = 4

First, binary search ends with l = 1, array[1] = 1

Swap array[1] and array[4]: [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Now, binary search ends with l = 0, array[0] = 3

Now, swap array[0] and array[4]: [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]

Binary search:

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = 0, array[0] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 1 != 4

Not working.

Alternative second swap: swap l (0) with pos_x (4): [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Wait, no. After the first swap, array is [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Now, l is at 0, array[0] = 3 != x = 4

So, swap array[0] with array[pos_x = 4]: [1, 4, 5, 2, 3]

Now, run binary search:

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = 0, array[0] = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 1 != 4

Still not working.

Maybe I need to choose different positions to swap.

Alternative approach:

After the first swap, array is [3, 4, 5, 2, 1]

Now, l is at 0, array[0] = 3 != 4

So, swap array[0] with array[1]: [4, 3, 5, 2, 1]

Run binary search:

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = 0, array[0] = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 4 == x

So, in this case, swapping array[l] with array[pos_x] and then swapping array[l] with another position worked.

But it required choosing which position to swap with carefully.

In this case, swapping array[l] with array[1] instead of array[pos_x] again led to the correct result.

This suggests that the strategy needs to be more nuanced.

Perhaps a better approach is:

1. Find pos_x.

2. Find where l ends up without any swaps.

3. If array[l] == x, output 0.

4. Else, swap array[l] with array[pos_x].

5. Find where l ends up now.

6. If array[l] == x, output 1.

7. Else, swap array[l] with array[pos_x] again.

8. Find where l ends up now; array[l] should be x, output 2.

But in the above example, after two swaps, it still didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different positions for the second swap.

Alternatively, maybe I should swap array[l] with a position that has a value that would guide the binary search correctly.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look for a different strategy.

Given that the problem states that two swaps are always sufficient, there must be a general way to perform these swaps.

One possible strategy is:

1. Find pos_x.

2. Find where l ends up without any swaps.

3. If array[l] == x, output 0.

4. Else, swap array[l] with array[pos_x].

5. Find where l ends up now.

6. If array[l] == x, output 1.

7. Else, swap array[l] with a position that has x.

But this seems similar to what I did before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the binary search path and adjust the array accordingly.

But this might be too time-consuming.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can accept that in most cases one swap is sufficient, and in some cases two swaps are needed, and implement accordingly.

In code, I can perform up to two swaps as needed.

Now, considering the implementation:

- Read t.

- For each test case:

- Read n and x.

- Read the permutation array.

- Find pos_x = array.index(x)

- Define a function to simulate binary search and return l.

- Perform the binary search to find l.

- If array[l] == x, output 0.

- Else, perform a swap between l and pos_x.

- Simulate the binary search again.

- If array[l] == x, output 1 and the swap performed.

- Else, perform a second swap between l and pos_x.

- Output 2 and the swaps performed.

Wait, in the second swap, perhaps I need to swap l with another position.

But to keep it simple, I can stick with swapping l with pos_x each time.

In the earlier example, it worked with two swaps.

Let me try implementing this.

But first, I need to make sure that this approach works in all cases.

Let me consider another example where two swaps are needed.

Suppose n = 5, x = 3

array = [4, 1, 5, 2, 3]

Find pos_x = 4

Binary search:

l = 0, r = 5

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 3? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 4 <= 3? No, r = 0

m = 0, but r - l = 0 - 0 = 0, end loop

l = 0, array[0] = 4 != 3

Swap array[0] and array[4]: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

Binary search:

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 3? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 0

m = 0, array[0] = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 3 == x, so one swap is enough.

Wait, in this case, one swap was enough.

Another example:

n = 5, x = 4

array = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]

Find pos_x = 4

Binary search:

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 3 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = 0, array[0] = 3 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 3 != 4

Swap array[0] and array[4]: [4, 1, 5, 2, 3]

Binary search:

m = 2, array[2] = 5 <= 4? No, r = 2

m = 0, array[0] = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

m = 0, array[0] = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 0

End with l = 0, array[0] = 4 == x, so one swap is enough.

Wait, but earlier I had a case where one swap wasn't enough.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform the swaps in a way that places x in a position where the binary search will find it.

To do that, I need to understand the binary search's behavior based on the array's configuration.

But this seems too involved.

Given time constraints, perhaps I can implement the strategy of performing up to two swaps as needed and assume it will work.

In code, this would involve:

- Finding pos_x.

- Performing the binary search to find l.

- If array[l] == x, output 0.

- Else, swap array[l] with array[pos_x], record the swap.

- Perform the binary search again to find l.

- If array[l] == x, output 1 and the swap performed.

- Else, perform a second swap between array[l] and array[pos_x], record the second swap.

- Perform the binary search again; array[l] should now be x, output 2 and the swaps performed.

I need to make sure that after two swaps, array
