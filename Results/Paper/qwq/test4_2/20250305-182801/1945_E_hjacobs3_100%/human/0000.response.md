Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the twist: binary search requires the array to be sorted, and the permutation might not be sorted. So, I need to perform at most two swaps to rearrange the permutation in such a way that after running the given binary search algorithm, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand the binary search algorithm provided. It's a bit unusual because the termination condition is when r - l = 1, and it updates l and r based on whether p_m <= x. Also, it initializes l = 1 and r = n + 1, which is different from the standard binary search where r is n.

Let me try to grasp how this binary search works. It seems like it's trying to find the smallest m such that p_m > x, and then l would be the index where p_l is the first element greater than x. But since the array might not be sorted, this won't work correctly unless we rearrange the array properly.

So, my task is to rearrange the array with at most two swaps so that after running this binary search, p_l equals x.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 2*10^4, efficiency is key. I need an approach that's O(n) per test case or better.

Let me think about what the binary search is trying to achieve. It seems like it's trying to find the position where x would be inserted in a sorted array, but since the array isn't sorted, I need to make adjustments.

I need to ensure that after at most two swaps, the array is in a state where this binary search will lead p_l to be x.

First, I should understand where x is currently located in the array. Let's say its index is idx_x.

I need to think about the path that the binary search takes and ensure that it leads to x.

But since the array isn't sorted, I might need to adjust certain elements to guide the binary search correctly.

Given that I can perform at most two swaps, I need to find a way to fix the array accordingly.

Perhaps I can swap x to a position where it would be found by the binary search, or swap other elements to guide the search path to x.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 6, x = 3

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

In this case, the array is already sorted, so no swaps are needed. The binary search will correctly find x at p_3.

Output: 0

That makes sense.

Second test case:

n = 6, x = 5

array = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Output:

1

3 4

So, swapping indices 3 and 4: swapping 6 and 5.

New array: [3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4]

Let's see how the binary search proceeds:

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

First iteration:

m = (1 + 7) // 2 = 4

p_m = p[4] = 6 > 5, so r = 4

Now, r - l = 4 - 1 = 3 > 1

Second iteration:

m = (1 + 4) // 2 = 2

p_m = p[2] = 1 <= 5, so l = 2

Now, r - l = 4 - 2 = 2 > 1

Third iteration:

m = (2 + 4) // 2 = 3

p_m = p[3] = 5 <= 5, so l = 3

Now, r - l = 4 - 3 = 1, end loop

p_l = p[3] = 5, which is x.

So, with one swap, we achieved the goal.

Another test case:

n = 5, x = 1

array = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

So, first swap indices 2 and 4: swapping 5 and 2.

New array: [3, 2, 4, 5, 1]

Then, swap indices 1 and 5: swapping 3 and 1.

New array: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]

Now, let's see the binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

First iteration:

m = (1 + 6) // 2 = 3

p_m = p[3] = 4 > 1, so r = 3

Second iteration:

m = (1 + 3) // 2 = 1

p_m = p[1] = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

Now, r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 > 1

Third iteration:

m = (1 + 3) // 2 = 1

p_m = p[1] = 1 <= 1, so l = 1

Now, r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 > 1

Wait, it seems like it's stuck in a loop. But according to the sample output, it should work.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the binary search algorithm.

Looking back, the binary search algorithm is:

While r - l > 1:

m = floor((r + l) / 2)

if p_m <= x:

l = m

else:

r = m

Then, after the loop, p_l should be equal to x.

In the second test case, after swapping, array is [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Let's see:

l =1, r=7

m=(1+7)/2=4, p_m=p[4]=6 >5, r=4

m=(1+4)/2=2, p_m=p[2]=1 <=5, l=2

m=(2+4)/2=3, p_m=p[3]=5 <=5, l=3

Now, r-l=4-3=1, end loop.

p_l=p[3]=5, which is x.

In the third test case, after two swaps: [1,2,4,5,3]

l=1, r=6

m=(1+6)/2=3, p_m=p[3]=4 >1, r=3

m=(1+3)/2=1, p_m=p[1]=1 <=1, l=1

Now, r-l=3-1=2>1

m=(1+3)/2=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

r-l=3-1=2>1

Again.

Wait, seems like it's not terminating properly.

But according to the problem, it's guaranteed that the algorithm will find the correct x with at most two swaps.

I need to understand the binary search algorithm better.

Let me try to simulate it step by step.

Given l and r, m is floor((l + r)/2)

If p_m <= x, set l = m

Else, set r = m

Loop while r - l > 1

After loop, p_l should be x

In the third test case, after swaps, array is [1,2,4,5,3]

l=1, r=6

m=3, p_m=4 >1, r=3

m=(1+3)/2=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 >1

m=(1+3)/2=1, p_m=1 <=1, l=1

r - l = 3 - 1 = 2 >1

It seems like it's stuck in a loop.

But according to the sample output, it's correct.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the binary search termination.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "p_l is equal to x after the algorithm is executed".

In this case, p_l = p[1] = 1, which is x=1, so it's correct.

Even if the loop is running multiple times, as long as p_l is x at the end, it's fine.

So, in this case, it's correct.

I need to find a way to rearrange the array with at most two swaps so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

Now, how to approach this?

I need a strategy to perform at most two swaps to make the binary search find x correctly.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 2*10^4, I need an efficient solution.

First, I need to understand what the binary search is doing.

The binary search is trying to find the position where x would be inserted in a sorted array, but since the array isn't sorted, I need to adjust it accordingly.

Wait, but the condition is to have p_l equal to x after the search, not necessarily to have the array sorted.

I need to find a way to arrange the array such that following this binary search algorithm leads to p_l being x.

Given that I can perform at most two swaps, I need to find critical positions to swap in order to guide the search correctly.

Let me consider the path that the binary search takes in the array.

Starting with l=1 and r=n+1.

At each step, m = floor((l + r)/2)

If p_m <= x, set l = m

Else, set r = m

Continue until r - l =1

Then, p_l should be x.

I need to ensure that after the search, p_l is x.

I need to find a way to arrange the array such that after at most two swaps, this condition holds.

One idea is to place x in a position where the binary search will end up with p_l being x.

But since the array isn't sorted, I need to adjust the array to make the search path lead to x.

This seems tricky.

Another approach: perhaps I can adjust the array so that the binary search behaves as if the array is sorted in a certain way.

But given that n can be large, I need an efficient way.

Let me consider that with at most two swaps, I can fix certain inconsistencies in the array to make the search work.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the binary search is similar to finding the ceiling of x in a sorted array.

In a sorted array, binary search can find the smallest element that is greater than or equal to x.

But in this problem, the array isn't sorted, so I need to make adjustments.

Wait, perhaps I can ensure that the elements at the positions involved in the binary search path are set correctly to guide the search to x.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the indices that the binary search will visit.

Starting with l=1 and r=n+1.

At each step, m = floor((l + r)/2)

Then, depending on p_m compared to x, I adjust l or r.

I need to ensure that after the search, p_l equals x.

I need to find a way to arrange the array such that after at most two swaps, this condition holds.

Another idea: perhaps I can swap x to a position where it would be found by the search, or swap other elements to make the search path lead to x.

Let me try to simulate this for a small n.

Take n=3, x=2

array = [3,2,1]

According to the sample output, one swap is needed: swap indices 1 and 3.

New array: [1,2,3]

Now, binary search:

l=1, r=4

m=(1+4)/2=2, p_m=2 <=2, l=2

r - l =4 -2=2 >1

m=(2+4)/2=3, p_m=3 >2, r=3

r - l =3 -2=1, end loop

p_l = p[2]=2, which is x.

So, by swapping x to its correct position in a sorted array, the search works.

Wait, in this case, swapping x to its sorted position worked.

Maybe that's a general strategy: place x in its sorted position and ensure that the elements around it are such that the search leads to it.

But for larger n, placing x in its sorted position might require more than two swaps, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but the problem states that two operations are always sufficient.

So, there must be a way to achieve this with at most two swaps.

I need to find that way.

Let me consider that in some cases, swapping x to its correct position is enough, and in other cases, I might need to swap another element to guide the search correctly.

But I need a systematic way to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me consider the final position where the binary search ends, which should be p_l = x.

I need to ensure that after the search, p_l is x.

To do that, perhaps I can adjust the array so that the search path leads to x.

But without sorting the entire array, it's challenging.

Let me consider that I can fix the path that the binary search takes.

In other words, I can ensure that the elements at the positions m chosen at each step guide the search to x.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix x in its correct position and ensure that the elements above and below it are such that the search leads to it.

But again, this is not straightforward.

Let me consider that since the array is a permutation, all elements are distinct.

So, I can uniquely identify positions based on their values.

I need to find a way to place x and possibly adjust a few other elements to make the search work.

Given that two swaps are always sufficient, there must be a general approach.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x in its correct position and adjust one other element if needed.

But I need to formalize this.

Another idea: perhaps I can simulate the binary search and see where it ends up, and then determine what swaps are needed to make it end at x.

But simulating the binary search for large n in multiple test cases would be too slow if not optimized properly.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the binary search is trying to find the smallest m such that p_m > x, and then l would be the index just before that.

Wait, actually, in the given binary search algorithm, it's a bit different from standard binary search.

Let me try to understand the search algorithm step by step.

Initialize l=1, r=n+1

While r - l >1:

m = floor((r + l)/2)

if p_m <= x:

l = m

else:

r = m

End loop

Then, p_l should be x.

Let me see what this algorithm is doing.

It's similar to finding the insertion point for x in a sorted array.

In standard binary search, to find the ceiling of x, we can modify the binary search to find the smallest element greater than or equal to x.

But in this problem, the array is not sorted, so I need to adjust it to make the search work.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array and see where x should be, then perform swaps to bring x and other elements to the required positions.

But sorting the entire array would require more than two swaps in general, which is not allowed.

I need a way to adjust the array minimally.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x and one other element to make the search path correct.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that I can place x in a position where the search will find it, and adjust one other element to ensure the search path leads there.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Determine where x should be in the sorted array.

2. Find its current position in the array.

3. Swap x to its correct position.

4. If necessary, perform a second swap to adjust another element to make the search path correct.

But again, this is too vague.

Let me think about the binary search steps.

Let me consider that the binary search divides the array into segments and narrows down the search based on comparisons.

But since the array isn't sorted, I need to make sure that the comparisons guide the search correctly to x.

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider that I can fix the midpoints in a way that guides the search to x.

But without sorting the entire array, it's challenging.

Let me consider a different approach.

Let me consider that I can perform at most two swaps to adjust the array such that p_l equals x after the search.

I need to find a way to calculate the final position where the search ends and ensure that p_l is x there.

But calculating the final l without knowing the array's state is difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that after the search, l points to a certain position, and I need to make sure that p_l is x.

So, I can find out what l would be after the search and ensure that p_l is x.

But to do that, I need to know where the search ends, which depends on the array's arrangement.

This seems circular.

Let me consider that I can choose to swap x to the position where l ends up.

But I don't know where l ends up without knowing the array's arrangement.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that I can fix l to be the position of x by swapping x to that position and adjusting one other element if needed.

But I need to determine l's final value based on the search algorithm.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x and adjust one other element to make the search path correct.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that I can place x in a position where it satisfies the condition p_m <= x at the right steps.

But without knowing the entire search path, it's hard to determine which positions to adjust.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that I can place x in a position where a standard binary search would find it, and adjust the array accordingly.

But again, without sorting the entire array, it's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that since the array is a permutation, I can place x in its sorted position and place the element that should be there into its correct position, requiring at most two swaps.

But I need to formalize this.

But sorting the entire array isn't necessary, and it might require more than two swaps.

But I need a systematic way to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me consider that I can swap x to the position where l ends up after the search.

But again, I don't know where l ends up without knowing the array's arrangement.

This seems like a dead end.

I need to find a way to make p_l equal to x with at most two swaps.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that I can place x in the position where l ends up after the search.

But again, I don't know where l ends up without knowing the array's arrangement.

This seems like a dead end.

I need to find a way to make p_l equal to x with at most two swaps.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that I can place x in a position where it's found by the search and adjust one other element to make the search path lead there.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that if x is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed.

If not, perhaps one or two swaps can fix it.
