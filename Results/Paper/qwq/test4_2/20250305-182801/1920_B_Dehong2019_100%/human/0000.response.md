Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some moves to affect the sum of these numbers.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's think about this step by step.

First, Alice is going to remove elements to maximize the sum. That means she probably wants to remove the smallest elements, right? Because removing smaller numbers will leave larger numbers in the array, which would contribute more to the sum.

But hold on, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1 later. So, if Alice removes some elements, that affects which elements Bob can multiply by -1.

This seems a bit tricky. I need to consider both players' moves together.

Let me consider the array sorted in descending order. That might make it easier to see which elements are larger or smaller.

So, if the array is sorted in descending order, the first elements are the largest, and the last elements are the smallest.

Alice can remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she might want to remove the smallest elements. But, Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1, which would make some positive elements negative, reducing the sum.

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll choose to multiply the largest positive elements by -1 to reduce the sum as much as possible.

But Alice goes first, and she can remove some elements before Bob acts.

I need to find a way to optimize both of their moves.

Let me think about the sum after Alice removes k elements.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements. Then, Bob will multiply the largest x elements by -1.

But is that always the best strategy?

Wait, maybe not. Because if Alice removes some elements, she might be removing elements that Bob would have multiplied by -1.

Let me try to think differently.

Let's consider that after Alice removes k elements, Bob will multiply the largest x remaining elements by -1.

So, Alice needs to consider that when she removes elements, she's affecting which elements Bob can multiply by -1.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of choosing which elements to keep.

Alice is removing k elements, which means she's choosing to keep n - k elements.

Then, Bob will multiply up to x of those remaining elements by -1.

So, the sum will be the sum of the remaining elements after Bob's multiplication.

Alice wants this sum to be as large as possible, and Bob wants it to be as small as possible.

I need to find the sum when both play optimally.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum, and Bob is trying to minimize it.

To solve this, I need to find the maximum sum that Alice can achieve, considering that Bob will try to minimize it.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let S be the set of all possible subsets of the array after Alice removes k elements.

For each subset s in S, Bob can choose up to x elements to multiply by -1.

The sum for subset s after Bob's move is sum(s) - 2 * sum of the top x elements in s.

Wait, not necessarily. Bob can choose any x elements to multiply by -1, not necessarily the top x.

But to minimize the sum, Bob would want to multiply the largest positive elements by -1.

Assuming all elements are positive, which they are according to the input constraints (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), Bob should multiply the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

Wait, but the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", which means he can choose to multiply fewer than x elements.

So, Bob will choose to multiply the largest elements by -1, up to x of them, to minimize the sum.

Therefore, for a given subset s, the minimal sum Bob can achieve is sum(s) - 2 * sum of the top min(x, len(s)) elements in s.

Wait, no. If he multiplies elements by -1, the sum becomes sum(s) - 2 * sum of the multiplied elements.

Yes, because multiplying by -1 subtracts twice the value from the sum.

So, to minimize the sum, Bob should multiply the largest elements in s by -1.

Therefore, for a given subset s, the minimal sum is sum(s) - 2 * sum of the top min(x, len(s)) elements in s.

So, Alice needs to choose a subset s of size n - k to maximize this minimal sum.

This seems complex because Alice has to choose the subset that maximizes the minimal sum after Bob's move.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Let me think about sorting the array in descending order.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order: a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an.

Alice can choose to remove any k elements, which means she chooses which n - k elements to keep.

Bob then multiplies up to x of the remaining n - k elements by -1.

To minimize the sum, Bob will multiply the largest x elements among the remaining ones by -1.

So, for a given subset of n - k elements, the minimal sum is sum(s) - 2 * sum of the top min(x, len(s)) elements in s.

Alice wants to choose s to maximize this value.

I need to find the subset s of size n - k that maximizes sum(s) - 2 * sum of the top min(x, len(s)) elements in s.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider different possibilities for the subset s.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to select which elements to remove such that the impact of Bob's multiplication is minimized.

Let me consider that after Alice removes k elements, Bob will multiply the top x remaining elements by -1.

So, if Alice can remove some of the largest elements, that might affect Bob's choices.

But Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's multiplication.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice removes the top x elements. Then, Bob can't multiply any elements by -1 because there are no elements left.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because Alice is removing elements, and Bob is multiplying up to x elements by -1 from the remaining ones.

Wait, no, Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1 from the remaining ones after Alice's removal.

So, if Alice removes k elements, Bob multiplies up to x remaining elements by -1.

I need to find a way to maximize the sum after Bob's multiplication.

Let me consider the following approach.

Sort the array in descending order: a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an.

Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

To maximize the sum after Bob's multiplication, Alice should remove the elements that would cause the greatest decrease when Bob multiplies the top x remaining elements by -1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the net effect.

Let me consider that for each element, if it's among the top min(x, n - k) elements, it will be multiplied by -1 by Bob.

So, to maximize the sum, Alice should minimize the sum of the top min(x, n - k) elements after her removal.

Wait, no.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements.

Then, Bob will multiply the top min(x, n - k) elements by -1.

The sum would be sum of the remaining n - k elements minus 2 times the sum of the top min(x, n - k) elements.

But Alice might want to remove some larger elements to prevent Bob from multiplying them by -1.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider different cases based on the values of k and x.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the second test case from the example:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [3,1,2,4]

After sorting in descending order: [4,3,2,1]

Alice can remove one element. She has choices:

- Remove 4: remaining [3,2,1], Bob multiplies 3 by -1: sum = 3 -3 +2 +1 = 3

- Remove 3: remaining [4,2,1], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum = -4 +2 +1 = -1

- Remove 2: remaining [4,3,1], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum = -4 +3 +1 = 0

- Remove 1: remaining [4,3,2], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum = -4 +3 +2 = 1

Among these, the maximum sum Alice can achieve is 1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, in the note, it says that in the second test case, it's optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.

Wait, but k=1, so she has to remove at least one element.

Wait, no, it says "remove up to k elements", which means she can remove 0 to k elements.

So, in this case, she can remove 0 elements.

Ah, I see. So, she can choose to remove 0 elements.

Wait, but k=1, so she can remove up to 1 element.

In the note, it says it's optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.

Wait, but k=1 allows her to remove up to 1 element.

So, perhaps removing 1 element is worse than not removing any.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

If Alice removes 1 element, say 1, then remaining [4,3,2], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum = -4 +3 +2 =1, which is worse than 2.

If she removes 2, sum = -4 +3 +1 =0.

If she removes 3, sum = -4 +2 +1 =-1.

If she removes 4, sum =3 -3 +2 +1=3, but wait, if she removes 4, remaining [3,2,1], Bob multiplies 3 by -1: sum =3 -3 +2 +1=3.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob multiplies only up to x elements by -1.

In this case, x=1.

So, if Alice removes 4, remaining [3,2,1], Bob multiplies 3 by -1: sum =3 -3 +2 +1=3.

If she removes nothing, [4,3,2,1], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=4 -4 +3 +2 +1=6, but that can't be.

Wait, no, if Alice removes nothing, Bob can multiply up to x=1 elements by -1.

So, he multiplies 4 by -1: sum= -4 +3 +2 +1=2.

If Alice removes 3, sum=4 +2 +1=7, but Bob can multiply 4 by -1: sum= -4 +2 +1=-1.

If Alice removes 2, sum=4 +3 +1=8, Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum= -4 +3 +1=0.

If Alice removes 1, sum=4 +3 +2=9, Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum= -4 +3 +2=1.

So, the best for Alice is to not remove any, resulting in sum=2.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says sum=2 when Alice removes nothing.

Wait, but according to my calculations, if Alice removes nothing, sum=2; if she removes 3, sum=-1; removes 2, sum=0; removes 4, sum=3.

So, why is 3 better than 2?

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in 2.

But according to my calculation, if Alice removes 3, sum=7, Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=-4+2+1=-1.

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize the sum, so 3 is better than 2.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the sample input, for the second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Sample output: 2

But according to my earlier calculation, if Alice removes 3, sum=7, Bob makes it -4+2+1=-1; if she removes nothing, sum=2; if she removes 4, sum=3; if she removes 2, sum=0; if she removes 1, sum=1.

So, why is the sample output 2?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that Alice can choose to remove fewer than k elements.

In this case, k=1, so she can remove 0 or 1 elements.

From the options above, the best for Alice is to remove 4, resulting in sum=3.

But according to the sample explanation, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says it's optimal for Alice to not remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in 2.

But according to my calculation, if Alice removes 3, sum=7, Bob makes it -4+2+1=-1; if she removes 4, sum=3; if she removes nothing, sum=2.

So, why is the sample output 2?

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the sum.

If Alice removes nothing, array is [3,1,2,4], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=3+1+2-4=2.

If Alice removes 3, array is [1,2,4], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=1+2-4=-1.

If Alice removes 4, array is [3,1,2], Bob multiplies 3 by -1: sum=-3+1+2=0.

Wait, now, according to this, the best for Alice is to remove 4, getting sum=0, which is better than -1, but worse than 2.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it says sum=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose to remove fewer than k elements.

In this case, k=1, so she can remove 0 or 1 elements.

So, removing 0 elements gives sum=2; removing 1 element can give sums of 0, -1, or 1.

So, the best for Alice is to remove nothing, getting sum=2.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, if she removes 4, sum=0, which is better than -1 or -4.

But according to the sample explanation, it's 2.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when Alice removes elements, she's removing them from the original array, and Bob multiplies up to x elements from the remaining array.

So, in the second test case:

Original array: [3,1,2,4]

If Alice removes nothing, Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=3+1+2-4=2.

If Alice removes 3, array becomes [1,2,4], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=1+2-4=-1.

If Alice removes 4, array becomes [3,1,2], Bob multiplies 3 by -1: sum=-3+1+2=0.

If Alice removes 2, array becomes [3,1,4], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=3+1-4=0.

If Alice removes 1, array becomes [3,2,4], Bob multiplies 4 by -1: sum=3+2-4=1.

So, the best for Alice is to remove 4, getting sum=0, which is better than -1, but worse than 2.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose to remove fewer than k elements.

In this case, k=1, so she can choose to remove 0 elements, getting sum=2.

So, among the options: 2, -1, 0, 0, 1, the best is 2.

Wait, but removing nothing gives sum=2, which is better than removing 4, which gives sum=0.

Wait, but according to my calculation, removing nothing gives sum=2, which is less than removing 4, which gives sum=0.

Wait, no: removing nothing gives sum=2; removing 4 gives sum=0; removing 3 gives sum=-1; removing 2 gives sum=0; removing 1 gives sum=1.

Wait, but 2 is better than -1 and 0, so why is the sample output 2?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says "at most k elements", which means Alice can choose to remove fewer elements, including zero.

So, in this case, she can choose to remove 0 elements, getting sum=2; or remove 1 element, getting sums of 0, -1, or 1.

So, the best for her is to remove nothing, getting sum=2.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, if she removes 4, sum=0, which is better than -1, but worse than 2.

So, the sample output is 2.

Okay, I see now.

So, in this case, Alice should choose to remove nothing, getting sum=2.

But, in general, how can I find the optimal number of elements to remove?

I need to consider all possible numbers of elements to remove, from 0 to k, and for each, calculate the sum after Bob's multiplication, and choose the maximum among them.

But, with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to compute the sum for each possible number of elements removed.

Let's sort the array in descending order: a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an.

For a given number of elements removed, say m (0 ≤ m ≤ k), the remaining array is a_{m+1} to a_n.

Bob will multiply the top min(x, n - m) elements by -1.

So, the sum after Bob's multiplication is sum_{m+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{m+1 to m + min(x, n - m)} a_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, the top min(x, n - m) elements among the remaining ones are the first min(x, n - m) elements in the sorted list.

Wait, since the array is sorted in descending order, the top min(x, n - m) elements are a_{m+1} to a_{m + min(x, n - m)}.

So, the sum after Bob's multiplication is sum_{m+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{m+1 to m + min(x, n - m)} a_i.

I need to maximize this over m from 0 to k.

So, for each m from 0 to k, compute sum_{m+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{m+1 to m + min(x, n - m)} a_i, and take the maximum among them.

This seems feasible.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about precomputing prefix sums.

Let me sort the array in descending order and compute prefix sums.

Let prefix[m] = sum_{1 to m} a_i.

Then, sum_{m+1 to n} a_i = total_sum - prefix[m].

And sum_{m+1 to m + min(x, n - m)} a_i can be expressed using prefix sums as well.

Wait, sum_{m+1 to m + min(x, n - m)} a_i = prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] - prefix[m].

So, the sum after Bob's multiplication is (total_sum - prefix[m]) - 2 * (prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] - prefix[m]).

Simplify this:

total_sum - prefix[m] - 2 * (prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] - prefix[m]) = total_sum - prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] + 2 * prefix[m] = total_sum + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)].

So, for each m from 0 to k, compute total_sum + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)], and take the maximum among them.

Also, need to handle the cases where m + min(x, n - m) exceeds n.

Wait, but since m ≤ k and n ≤ 2e5, and t ≤ 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this for each test case.

Let me think about precomputing prefix sums for each test case.

Wait, but t is up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, so it's manageable.

So, for each test case, sort the array in descending order, compute prefix sums, and then for m from 0 to k, compute the expression above.

But I need to optimize this as much as possible.

Let me see if there's a pattern or a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that min(x, n - m) is the number of elements Bob will multiply by -1.

So, for each m, it's min(x, n - m).

But since m ≤ k, and k can be up to n, I need to consider m from 0 to k.

But in the expression, m + min(x, n - m) could be up to m + x.

But m ≤ k and x ≤ n, so it's manageable.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate m from 0 to k, compute the sum as total_sum + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)], and keep track of the maximum.

But I need to make sure that m + min(x, n - m) does not exceed n.

Wait, in the prefix array, prefix[n] is the sum of all elements.

Wait, to avoid index out of range, I need to ensure that m + min(x, n - m) ≤ n.

But in the expression, prefix[m + min(x, n - m)], m + min(x, n - m) could be up to m + x.

But m + x could be greater than n.

So, I need to set m + min(x, n - m).

Wait, m + min(x, n - m) = m + x if m + x ≤ n, else m + (n - m) = n.

So, m + min(x, n - m) = min(m + x, n).

Therefore, prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] = prefix[min(m + x, n)].

So, the expression becomes total_sum + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[min(m + x, n)].

Wait, but prefix[n] is the sum of all elements, which is total_sum.

Wait, no, prefix[m] is the sum of the first m elements in the sorted array.

Wait, perhaps I need to redefine prefix sums.

Let me define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = a1

prefix[2] = a1 + a2

...

prefix[n] = a1 + a2 + ... + an

So, total_sum = prefix[n]

Then, sum_{m+1 to n} a_i = prefix[n] - prefix[m]

sum_{m+1 to m + min(x, n - m)} a_i = prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] - prefix[m]

So, the sum after Bob's multiplication is (prefix[n] - prefix[m]) - 2 * (prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] - prefix[m]) = prefix[n] - prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] + 2 * prefix[m] = prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)]

So, for each m from 0 to k, compute prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[min(m + x, n)]

Wait, min(m + x, n)

So, m + min(x, n - m) = m + x if m + x ≤ n, else m + (n - m) = n.

So, m + min(x, n - m) = min(m + x, n)

Therefore, prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] = prefix[min(m + x, n)]

So, the expression is prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[min(m + x, n)]

So, for m from 0 to k, compute prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[min(m + x, n)], and take the maximum among them.

This seems manageable.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Let me think about how to compute this.

First, sort the array in descending order.

Compute prefix sums.

Then, for m from 0 to k, compute the expression and keep track of the maximum.

Finally, print the maximum.

Let me consider edge cases.

Edge case 1: k = 0, meaning Alice cannot remove any elements.

So, she has to keep all elements, and Bob will multiply up to x elements by -1.

So, the sum is sum_{1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{1 to x} a_i.

Edge case 2: x = 0, meaning Bob cannot multiply any elements by -1.

So, the sum is sum_{m+1 to n} a_i, for m from 0 to k, choose m to maximize this.

Which would be m=0, since larger m means removing more elements, which might decrease the sum.

Edge case 3: k >= n, meaning Alice can remove all elements.

So, she can choose to remove all elements, resulting in sum=0.

But she might choose to remove fewer elements.

Wait, in this case, she can choose to remove 0 to n elements.

So, she would choose the number of elements to remove that maximizes the sum after Bob's multiplication.

Wait, but if k >= n, she can choose to remove all elements, resulting in sum=0.

Alternatively, she can remove fewer elements and let Bob multiply some elements by -1.

But sum=0 might be better than some other sums.

Wait, need to consider specific cases.

Let me look at the first test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

Alice can remove 0 or 1 elements.

If she removes 0 elements, Bob multiplies 1 by -1: sum=-1.

If she removes 1 element, sum=0.

So, the better choice is to remove 1 element, getting sum=0.

According to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, but the sample output shows 0, but according to the problem statement, it's 0.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the sum of elements of the array after the game", which in this case is 0.

So, the program should output 0 for this test case.

Another test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a=[3,1,2,4]

After sorting in descending order: [4,3,2,1]

For m=0: sum=prefix[4] + prefix[0] - 2 * prefix[min(0+1,4)] = 4+3+2+1 + 0 - 2*(4) = 10 - 8 = 2

For m=1: sum=prefix[4] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1+1,4)] = 10 + 4 - 2*(4+3)=14-14=0

So, maximum is 2.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

m=0: sum=1 + 0 - 2*1 = -1

m=1: sum=1 +1 - 2*1 = 1 - 2 = -1

Maximum is -1, but according to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m elements are removed, the remaining elements are from m+1 to n.

But in the first test case, n=1, k=1.

If m=0: sum=1 -2*1=-1

If m=1: sum=0

So, the maximum is 0.

Hence, in the program, perhaps we need to consider m from 0 to k, inclusive.

And take the maximum of these sums.

So, in code, we need to iterate m from 0 to k, compute the sum as prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[min(m + x, n)], and keep track of the maximum.

Then, print the maximum.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)

ans1 = sum(a)

for i in range(x):

ans1 -= a[i] * 2

ans2 = ans1

for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)

print(ans2)

So, let's analyze this.

First, it sorts the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Then, it computes ans1 as sum(a) - 2 * sum of the first x elements.

Wait, no.

It initializes ans1 as sum(a).

Then, it subtracts a[i]*2 for i in range(x), so ans1 becomes sum(a) - 2 * sum of the first x elements.

Then, ans2 is set to ans1.

Then, it iterates i from 0 to k-1:

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)

Finally, it prints ans2.

Wait, let's see what this is doing.

It seems like it's trying to implement the logic I described earlier.

Let me map it to my earlier notation.

In my earlier analysis, for m from 0 to k, compute sum = prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)], and take the maximum.

In the code:

ans1 starts as sum(a), which is prefix[n].

Then, for i in range(x), ans1 -= a[i] * 2, so ans1 becomes prefix[n] - 2 * sum of the first x elements, which is prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x].

Then, ans2 is set to ans1.

Then, for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)

So, in the loop, for each i from 0 to k-1:

ans1 += a[i] - (if i + x < n: -2 * a[i + x])

Wait, no.

Wait, ans1 starts as prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x]

Then, for each i from 0 to k-1:

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= 2 * a[i + x]

Then, ans2 takes the max of ans1 and ans2.

Is this equivalent to computing prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] for m from 0 to k?

Wait, perhaps it's implementing a cumulative update.

Let me see for m=0:

ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x]

ans2 = ans1

For i=0:

ans1 += a[0]

if 0 + x < n:

ans1 -= 2 * a[0 + x]

ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)

So, for m=1, it's doing ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, for m=1, sum = prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

Which is prefix[n] + a[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

So, it seems different.

Wait, perhaps it's a different way of computing the same thing.

Let me see for m=0:

ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x]

Which matches sum_{1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{1 to x} a_i

Which is what we have for m=0 in my earlier formula.

Then, for m=1:

ans1 += a[0] - 2 * a[x]

So, ans1 becomes prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Which is prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * (prefix[x] + a[x])

Wait, but prefix[x] includes a[x], so prefix[x] = sum_{1 to x} a_i

So, prefix[x] + a[x] = sum_{1 to x} a_i + a[x]

Wait, that doesn't seem to match my earlier formula.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent.

Let me see for m=1:

sum = prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

If 1 + x <= n, then sum = prefix[n] + a[1] - 2 * prefix[1 + x]

Else, sum = prefix[n] + a[1] - 2 * prefix[n]

Wait, in the code, it's ans1 += a[0] - 2 * a[x]

So, ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Which is prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * (prefix[x] + a[x])

But prefix[x] + a[x] = prefix[x + 1], if x < n

Wait, if x < n, prefix[x + 1] = prefix[x] + a[x + 1], but a[x + 1] is the (x + 1)th element.

Wait, a[x] is the xth element.

So, prefix[x] = sum_{1 to x} a_i

prefix[x + 1] = sum_{1 to x + 1} a_i = prefix[x] + a[x + 1]

So, in the code, for m=1, it's doing prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * (prefix[x] + a[x])

But in my formula, it should be prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

Which is prefix[n] + a[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

Wait, but in the sorted array, a[0] is the largest element.

Wait, perhaps there's a mismatch in indexing.

In Python, list indices start from 0.

In my earlier analysis, I assumed m starts from 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust for 0-based indexing.

Let me redefine prefix[m] as sum of the first m elements, with m starting from 0.

So, prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = a[0]

prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1]

...

prefix[n] = sum of all elements.

Then, for m from 0 to k:

sum = prefix[n] + prefix[m] - 2 * prefix[m + min(x, n - m)]

In the code:

ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x]

Then, for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i] - 2 * a[i + x] (if i + x < n)

Wait, but in terms of prefix, a[i] = prefix[i + 1] - prefix[i]

But it's not matching directly.

I think there's a mistake in the code.

Let me see for m=0:

sum = prefix[n] + prefix[0] - 2 * prefix[min(0 + x, n)] = prefix[n] + 0 - 2 * prefix[x]

Which matches ans1 initially.

Then, for m=1:

sum = prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

In the code, it's ans1 += a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Which is ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

But prefix[1] = a[0], and prefix[x + 1] = prefix[x] + a[x + 1], but m + x = 1 + x

So, it's not directly matching.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent.

Let me see:

sum for m=1:

prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

If 1 + x <= n, then sum = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[1 + x]

Else, sum = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[n] = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[n] = a[0] - prefix[n]

But in the code, ans1 += a[0] - 2 * a[x]

So, ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x] = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * (prefix[x] + a[x])

But prefix[x] + a[x] is prefix[x + 1], if x < n

So, ans1 = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[x + 1]

But in my formula, sum for m=1 is prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[1 + x]

So, if m=1, min(x, n - m) = x if x <= n - 1, else n - m

Wait, m + min(x, n - m) = min(m + x, n)

So, for m=1, min(1 + x, n)

So, prefix[m + min(x, n - m)] = prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

In the code, ans1 -= 2 * a[x]

Wait, but a[x] is a[x - 1] in 0-based indexing.

Wait, no, in Python, list indices start from 0, but in the code, a is sorted in descending order, so a[0] is the largest.

Wait, perhaps there's a mismatch in indexing.

Wait, in the code:

a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)

So, a[0] is the largest element, a[1] is the second largest, and so on.

Then, ans1 = sum(a)

for i in range(x):

ans1 -= a[i] * 2

So, ans1 = sum(a) - 2 * sum(a[0] to a[x-1])

Then, for i in range(k):

ans1 += a[i]

if i + x < n:

ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2

So, in the loop, for each i from 0 to k-1:

ans1 += a[i] - 2 * a[i + x]

But only if i + x < n

So, for m=1, it's adding a[0] and subtracting 2 * a[x]

Similarly, for m=2, it's adding a[1] and subtracting 2 * a[x + 1], if x + 1 < n

Wait, but in my formula, for m=1, sum = prefix[n] + prefix[1] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

Which is sum = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[min(1 + x, n)]

Similarly, in the code, ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

Wait, is prefix[min(1 + x, n)] equal to prefix[x] + a[x]?

If 1 + x <= n, then prefix[1 + x] = prefix[x] + a[x]

Yes, so in that case, sum = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * prefix[1 + x] = prefix[n] + a[0] - 2 * (prefix[x] + a[x])

Which matches ans1 = prefix[n] - 2 * prefix[x] + a[0] - 2 * a[x]

So, it seems that the code is correctly implementing the formula for m=1.

Similarly, for m=2:

ans1 += a[1] - 2 * a[x + 1]

Which would be prefix[n] + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * (prefix[x] + a[x] + a[x + 1])

But in my formula, sum = prefix[n] + prefix[2] - 2 * prefix[2 + x]

Which is prefix[n] + a[0] + a[1] - 2 * prefix[2 + x]

Which is the same as above, since prefix[2 + x] = prefix[x] + a[x] + a[x + 1]

So, it seems consistent.

Therefore, the code is correctly implementing the logic I described earlier.

Hence, the program is correct.
