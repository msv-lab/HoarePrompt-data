Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice and Bob have a ribbon divided into n parts, and they want to paint it. Alice first paints each part with one of m colors, and then Bob can choose at most k parts to repaint them all to the same color. Alice wants to paint the ribbon in such a way that no matter what Bob does, he can't make all parts the same color. I need to determine if it's possible for Alice to do that.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what the problem is really about. We have t test cases, each with values of n, m, and k. For each test case, I have to output "YES" if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob can't make all parts the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5

1 1 1

5 1 1

5 2 1

5 2 2

5 5 3

Output:

NO

NO

YES

NO

YES

So, for n=1, m=1, k=1, it's "NO". That makes sense because there's only one part, so it's already all the same color, and Bob can repaint it if k >=1.

Similarly, for n=5, m=1, k=1, since there's only one color, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts with that color, so Bob doesn't need to do anything, and it's "NO".

In the third case, n=5, m=2, k=1, it's "YES". Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob can't make all parts the same color even with one repaint.

Fourth case, n=5, m=2, k=2, it's "NO", meaning that no matter how Alice paints with two colors, Bob can always make all parts the same color by repainting at most two parts.

Fifth case, n=5, m=5, k=3, "YES", Alice can paint in a way that Bob can't make all parts the same color with at most three repaints.

So, I need to find a general rule for any n, m, k.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, if n <= k, that means Bob can repaint the entire ribbon, so he can always make all parts the same color. So, in this case, it should be "NO". Similarly, if m =1, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts with the same color, and Bob can repaint them if k >=1.

Now, for other cases, I need to see if Alice can paint the ribbon such that even after Bob repaints at most k parts, not all parts are the same color.

I recall that in similar problems, we can think about the maximum number of parts that can be of the same color after Alice's painting, and see if Bob can make the remaining parts match that color with his k repaints.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it in terms of the most frequent color after Alice's painting.

Suppose Alice paints the ribbon in such a way that the most frequent color appears f times. Then, Bob needs to repaint n - f parts to make all parts that color. If n - f <= k, then Bob can do it; otherwise, he can't.

So, Alice wants to minimize f, so that n - f > k, which would mean Bob can't make all parts the same color.

But Alice also has m colors to choose from.

Wait, actually, Alice wants to maximize the smallest possible f, but I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice paints the ribbon in a way that no single color appears more than some amount, say f. Then, Bob needs to repaint at least n - f parts to make all parts that color.

So, if n - f > k, then Bob can't make all parts the same color.

Therefore, Alice should aim to have f as small as possible, but since she can choose how to distribute the colors, she can try to maximize f while ensuring that n - f > k.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me consider that Alice can distribute the parts into m colors in such a way that no color dominates too much.

If Alice uses all m colors evenly, then the frequency of the most frequent color would be ceil(n/m).

Wait, more precisely, if n is divisible by m, then each color can have n/m parts.

If not, some colors will have floor(n/m), and some will have ceil(n/m).

But to be precise, the maximum frequency f_max would be ceil(n/m).

Then, the number of parts that Bob needs to repaint to make all parts that color is n - f_max.

If n - f_max > k, then Bob can't do it; otherwise, he can.

So, in general, if n - ceil(n/m) > k, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the third example, n=5, m=2, k=1.

ceil(5/2) = 3, so n - 3 = 2 > 1, so "YES".

In the fourth case, n=5, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(5/2) = 2 <= 2, so "NO".

In the fifth case, n=5, m=5, k=3.

ceil(5/5)=1, n -1 =4 >3, so "YES".

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the first case, n=1, m=1, k=1.

ceil(1/1)=1, n -1 =0 >1? No, 0 >1 is False, so "NO", which matches.

Second case, n=5, m=1, k=1.

ceil(5/1)=5, n -5=0 >1? No, 0 >1 is False, so "NO", which matches.

So, it seems that the condition is:

if n - ceil(n/m) > k, then "YES", else "NO".

But in the program, it's checking if n <=k or n - ceil(n/m) < k, then "NO", else "YES".

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but in the program, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

But in python, math.ceil(n/m) should give ceil(n/m).

So, seems correct.

But let me verify with the examples.

First test case: n=1, m=1, k=1.

n - ceil(1/1)=1-1=0 <1, so "NO".

Second test case: n=5, m=1, k=1.

n - ceil(5/1)=5-5=0 <1, so "NO".

Third test case: n=5, m=2, k=1.

n - ceil(5/2)=5-3=2 >1, so "YES".

Fourth test case: n=5, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(5/2)=5-3=2 >2? 2>2 is False, so "NO".

Fifth test case: n=5, m=5, k=3.

n - ceil(5/5)=5-1=4 >3, so "YES".

All match the expected output.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n - ceil(n/m)=2 >2 is False, so "NO".

Wait, 2 >2 is False, correct.

But in the explanation, it says that for n=5, m=2, k=2, it's "NO", meaning that no matter how Alice paints, Bob can always make all parts the same color.

But according to the formula, it's "NO" when n - ceil(n/m) <=k.

Wait, but in this case, n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=2, so "NO".

Which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let's think about another example.

Suppose n=4, m=2, k=1.

ceil(4/2)=2, n -2=2 >1, so "YES".

Meaning Alice can paint in a way that Bob can't make all parts the same color with one repaint.

For example, Alice paints [1,2,1,2]. Then, to make all parts color 1, Bob needs to repaint parts 2 and 4, which is two repaints, more than k=1. Similarly, to make all parts color 2, he needs to repaint parts 1 and 3, which is again two repaints. So, Bob can't achieve it with k=1, which matches "YES".

Another example: n=4, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(4/2)=4-2=2 >2? No, 2<=2, so "NO".

Meaning that no matter how Alice paints, Bob can make all parts the same color with at most two repaints.

For example, if Alice paints [1,2,1,2], Bob can choose to repaint parts 2 and 4 to color 1, making all parts color 1.

Alternatively, if Alice paints [1,1,2,2], Bob can repaint parts 3 and 4 to color 1.

So, in any case, Bob can achieve it with k=2.

Thus, the condition seems correct.

Another edge case: n=1, m=1, k=0.

But in the problem, k >=1, so k=0 is not possible.

Wait, no, k can be 0.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "at most k parts", which can include k=0.

But in the constraints, it's 1 <= m, k <=n <=50, so k >=1.

Wait, no, looking back, it's 1 <= t <=1000, and 1 <= m, k <=n <=50.

So, k can be 1 to 50.

But in the problem, Bob will choose at most k parts, which could include choosing zero parts.

But according to the problem, Bob will choose at most k parts, but it doesn't say he can choose zero.

Wait, in the problem statement: "Bob will choose at most k parts of the ribbon and repaint them into the same color (he chooses the affected parts and the color arbitrarily)."

It says "at most k parts", which includes choosing zero parts.

So, if k=0, Bob cannot repaint any parts.

But according to the constraints, k >=1, so k=1 to 50.

But in reality, if k=0, then Bob cannot repaint any parts, and the answer would depend on whether Alice can paint all parts differently or not.

But since k >=1, we don't need to worry about k=0.

Wait, no, in the problem constraints, k >=1.

So, k is at least 1.

Ok.

So, in summary, the condition is:

if n - ceil(n/m) > k, then "YES", else "NO".

Which matches the program's logic.

In the program, it's checking if n <=k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then "NO", else "YES".

Which is equivalent to n - ceil(n/m) <=k, then "NO", else "YES".

Which is the same as my condition.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the program, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then "NO".

But in my condition, it's n - ceil(n/m) <=k, then "NO".

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the program, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k, then "NO".

Which is equivalent to n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO".

Else, "YES".

But in my earlier reasoning, it should be n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO".

Wait, which one is correct?

Let's think carefully.

If n - ceil(n/m) >k, then "YES".

Else, "NO".

So, in the program, it's n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO".

Wait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me re-express the condition.

We have n parts, and after Alice paints, the most frequent color appears ceil(n/m) times.

Bob needs to repaint n - ceil(n/m) parts to make all parts that color.

If n - ceil(n/m) >k, then Bob can't do it, so "YES".

Else, "NO".

So, in the program, it's checking if n - ceil(n/m) <k, then "NO".

But according to my condition, it should be n - ceil(n/m) >k implies "YES", else "NO".

So, the program seems to have a mistake.

Wait, no, in the program, it's:

if n <=k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, it's saying that if n <=k or n - ceil(n/m) <k, then "NO", else "YES".

But according to my reasoning, it should be if n - ceil(n/m) >k, then "YES", else "NO".

So, the condition in the program seems to have a mistake.

Wait, no, in the program, it's n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO".

But according to my reasoning, n - ceil(n/m) >k implies "YES", and n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO".

So, the program is checking n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO", which covers part of the "NO" cases, and also n <=k implies "NO".

Wait, but n <=k implies that Bob can repaint the entire ribbon, so "NO".

Otherwise, check n - ceil(n/m) <k.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be n - ceil(n/m) >k implies "YES", else "NO".

So, perhaps the program should have n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO", else "YES".

But it has n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO", which is slightly different.

Wait, but in practice, since n and m are integers, n - ceil(n/m) <k is equivalent to n - ceil(n/m) <=k-1.

But according to my condition, it should be n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO".

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

Let me check with an example.

Take n=5, m=2, k=2.

ceil(5/2)=3, n -3=2.

2 >2? No, 2==2, so "NO".

According to the program:

n - ceil(n/m)=2 <2? 2<2 is False, so "YES".

Wait, but in the example, it's "NO".

Wait, there's a mistake.

Wait, in the fourth test case, n=5, m=2, k=2, output is "NO".

But according to the program, n - ceil(n/m)=2 <2 is False, so "YES".

Which contradicts the expected output "NO".

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps it's n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO", else "YES".

In the fourth test case, n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=2, so "NO", which matches the expected output.

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO", else "YES".

Which in this case, 2 <2 is False, so "YES", which doesn't match the expected "NO".

So, the program seems to have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the program.

Wait, in the program, it's n - math.ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO", else "YES".

But according to the correct logic, it should be n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO", else "YES".

So, it should be n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO", else "YES".

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO", else "YES".

Which is incorrect, as per the fourth test case.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=2, which should be "NO", but according to the program's condition, 2 <2 is False, so "YES", which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is wrong.

So, to fix it, it should be n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO", else "YES".

Therefore, the program should have:

if n <=k or n - math.ceil(n/m) <=k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

But it has n - math.ceil(n/m) <k.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=5, m=2, k=1.

n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=1? 2<=1 is False, so "YES", which matches.

In the fourth test case, n=5, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=2, so "NO", which matches.

In the fifth test case, n=5, m=5, k=3.

n - ceil(n/m)=4 <=3? 4<=3 is False, so "YES", which matches.

So, the correct condition should be if n <=k or n - ceil(n/m) <=k, then "NO", else "YES".

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n/m) <k.

So, it's a mistake.

It should be n - ceil(n/m) <=k implies "NO", else "YES".

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=1, m=1, k=1.

n - ceil(n/m)=1-1=0 <=1, so "NO", which matches.

Second test case, n=5, m=1, k=1.

n - ceil(n/m)=5-5=0 <=1, so "NO", which matches.

Third test case, n=5, m=2, k=1.

n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=1? No, so "YES", matches.

Fourth test case, n=5, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(n/m)=2 <=2, so "NO", matches.

Fifth test case, n=5, m=5, k=3.

n - ceil(n/m)=4 <=3? No, so "YES", matches.

Hence, the correct condition is if n <=k or n - ceil(n/m) <=k, then "NO", else "YES".

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n/m) <k implies "NO", else "YES".

Which is incorrect, as in the fourth test case, n - ceil(n/m)=2 <2 is False, so "YES", which is wrong, it should be "NO".

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

But wait, perhaps there's another way to interpret it.

Maybe I made a mistake in understanding the condition.

Let me think again.

If n - ceil(n/m) <=k, then Bob can repaint n - ceil(n/m) parts to make all parts the same color, so "NO".

Else, "YES".

So, the condition should be if n - ceil(n/m) <=k, then "NO", else "YES".

But in the program, it's if n - ceil(n/m) <k, then "NO", else "YES".

Which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \textbf{False}} \]
