Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

There are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. So, it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n(n-1)/2.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit, assuming Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem. Everule starts from island 1 and can travel through bridges to other islands. Dominater wants to restrict this by destroying up to k bridges.

Our goal is to find out how many islands Everule can still reach after Dominater has destroyed up to k bridges in the best possible way to minimize the number of reachable islands.

Let me think about graph theory terms. Islands are nodes, and bridges are edges. It's a complete graph, meaning every pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

Everule starts from node 1 and can traverse the graph via edges. Dominater can remove up to k edges to minimize the number of nodes Everule can reach.

I need to find the minimum number of nodes that remain accessible to node 1 after Dominater removes up to k edges optimally.

First, in a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes. So, even if some bridges are destroyed, there might still be paths connecting node 1 to other nodes.

Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, so they will try to cut off as many islands as possible by destroying bridges.

But since the graph is complete, to isolate an island from node 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connecting that island to node 1.

Wait, no. Actually, since the graph is complete, there are multiple paths. So, to prevent Everule from reaching a particular island, Dominater needs to make sure that all paths from node 1 to that island are broken.

But in a complete graph, there are many paths, so it's not straightforward.

Let me think differently. Suppose Dominater wants to isolate as many islands as possible. To isolate one island, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connecting that island to the rest of the graph.

But since it's a complete graph, to isolate one island, Dominater needs to destroy n-1 bridges (one from each of the other n-1 islands to that island).

Wait, but in this problem, Dominater can destroy up to k bridges.

So, perhaps the strategy is to isolate as many islands as possible by destroying bridges in a way that maximizes the number of islands disconnected from node 1.

Let me consider that each island is connected to node 1 directly via one bridge. So, if Dominater destroys the bridge directly connecting node 1 to another island, that island is directly disconnected from node 1.

However, since it's a complete graph, there might still be paths through other islands.

But if Dominater destroys all bridges from node 1 to certain islands, and also from those islands to other islands, maybe they can isolate them.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let me look at small values of n and k to see a pattern.

Take n=2, k=0.

So, two islands, connected by one bridge. Dominater can't destroy any bridges. So, Everule can visit both islands. Output should be 2.

n=2, k=1.

Dominater can destroy the single bridge. Now, Everule can only stay on island 1. Output is 1.

n=4, k=1.

With n=4, there are 6 bridges.

If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between island 1 and island 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via other paths, like 1-3-2 or 1-4-2.

So, Everule can still reach all islands. Output is 4.

n=5, k=10.

Wait, with n=5, total bridges are 10. If k=10, Dominater can destroy all bridges. So, Everule can only stay on island 1. Output is 1.

n=5, k=3.

Total bridges are 10. Dominater can destroy 3 bridges.

Need to see how many islands can be isolated.

Not sure.

Another test case: n=4, k=4.

Total bridges are 6. Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

Need to see if Everule can still reach some islands.

Maybe.

Wait, in the example output, for n=4, k=1, output is 4; for n=4, k=4, output is 1.

So, seems like for n=4, k=4, Everule can only reach island 1.

Let me think about the general case.

I need to find the minimum number of islands that remain connected to island 1 after Dominater destroys up to k bridges optimally.

Optimal for Dominater means maximizing the number of islands disconnected from island 1.

So, to disconnect an island from island 1, Dominater needs to make sure that all paths from island 1 to that island are broken.

In a complete graph, to disconnect island A from island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges from island A to islands that are connected to island 1.

This seems complex.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

I recall that in graph theory, the connectivity of a complete graph is very high. Specifically, a complete graph is (n-1)-connected, meaning you need to remove at least n-1 edges to disconnect any two nodes.

So, to disconnect any single island from island 1, Dominater needs to destroy at least n-1 bridges.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4 and k=1, output is 4, meaning all islands are still connected.

For n=4 and k=4, output is 1, meaning only island 1 is reachable.

So, there must be a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the number of bridges connected to island 1.

There are n-1 bridges directly connected from island 1 to other islands.

If Dominater destroys all these n-1 bridges, Everule can't reach any other island.

But in a complete graph, even if these bridges are destroyed, there might still be paths through other islands.

Wait, no. If all direct bridges from island 1 to others are destroyed, but since other islands are connected among themselves, Everule might still reach other islands via those paths.

Wait, no. If all bridges from island 1 to others are destroyed, and Dominater hasn't destroyed any other bridges, then Everule can't reach other islands directly or indirectly, because any path to other islands would need to go through some island, but since all bridges from island 1 to others are destroyed, there's no way to reach those islands.

Wait, but in a complete graph, islands are connected among themselves.

So, if island 1 is connected to island 2, 3, 4, etc., and Dominater destroys the bridge between 1 and 2, but islands 2, 3, 4 are all connected to each other, then Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3, for example.

Wait, no, if all bridges from island 1 to others are destroyed, then island 1 is completely isolated, and Everule can't reach any other island, regardless of how the other islands are connected among themselves.

So, if Dominater destroys all n-1 bridges connected from island 1 to others, Everule can only stay on island 1.

But in the example, for n=4 and k=1, output is 4, meaning all islands are still connected, even after destroying one bridge.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, the number of bridges Dominater can destroy to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach is limited by the number of bridges connected to island 1.

So, if Dominater destroys up to n-1 bridges connected to island 1, Everule's reach is reduced accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that Everule can reach an island if there exists at least one path from island 1 to that island that is not destroyed.

Dominater wants to destroy bridges to maximize the number of islands that are not reachable from island 1.

But in a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes, so it's hard to disconnect islands.

Wait, maybe the problem can be approached by considering the number of bridges that need to be destroyed to isolate a set of islands from island 1.

But this seems complicated.

Let me look back at the example inputs and outputs.

First test case:

n=2, k=0

Output: 2

Meaning, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can reach both islands.

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

Output: 1

Dominater destroys the only bridge, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

Third test case:

n=4, k=1

Output: 4

Dominater destroys one bridge, but Everule can still reach all islands through other paths.

Fourth test case:

n=5, k=10

Output: 1

Dominater destroys all possible bridges, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

Fifth test case:

n=5, k=3

Output: 5

Dominater destroys 3 bridges, but Everule can still reach all islands.

Sixth test case:

n=4, k=4

Output:1

Dominater destroys 4 bridges, which is enough to isolate some islands, but according to the output, Everule can only reach island 1.

Wait, but in the third test case, for n=4 and k=1, output is 4, meaning all islands are still connected.

But for n=4 and k=4, output is 1, meaning only island 1 is reachable.

So, seems like there's a threshold where if Dominater destroys a certain number of bridges, they can isolate some islands.

I need to find a formula or a way to compute the minimum number of islands Everule can reach for given n and k.

Let me consider that in a complete graph, the number of bridges that need to be destroyed to isolate a set of islands from island 1 is equal to the number of bridges connecting island 1 to those islands.

Wait, no. If Dominater wants to isolate a particular island from island 1, they need to destroy all bridges connecting that island to island 1.

But in a complete graph, islands are highly connected, so isolating one island requires destroying all bridges from that island to islands that are connected to island 1.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I should think in terms of the number of bridges connected to island 1.

Island 1 has n-1 bridges connecting it directly to other islands.

If Dominater destroys some of these bridges, Everule can't reach those directly connected islands via those direct bridges, but there might still be other paths through other islands.

In a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes, so isolating an island would require destroying enough bridges to break all possible paths.

This seems too involved for this problem.

Perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider that the minimum number of islands Everule can reach is 1 plus the number of islands that cannot be isolated by destroying up to k bridges.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the maximum number of islands that can be isolated by destroying up to k bridges.

Then, the minimum number of islands Everule can reach is total islands minus the number of isolated islands.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in a complete graph, to isolate an island from island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connecting that island to islands that are connected to island 1.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the number of bridges connected to island 1.

If Dominater destroys m bridges connected to island 1, then Everule loses direct access to m islands.

But since the graph is complete, there might still be paths through other islands.

So, perhaps the number of islands Everule can reach is n minus the number of islands that can be isolated by destroying up to k bridges.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider the maximum number of islands that can be isolated.

Each island can be isolated by destroying its connections to the rest of the graph.

In a complete graph, to isolate one island, Dominater needs to destroy n-1 bridges (all bridges connecting to that island).

But Dominater can choose to destroy bridges to isolate multiple islands.

So, for each island to be isolated, it requires n-1 bridges to be destroyed.

But bridges are shared among islands, so there might be overlapping.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to think about the minimum number of bridges that need to be destroyed to isolate a certain number of islands.

Let me consider that to isolate one island, Dominater needs to destroy n-1 bridges.

To isolate two islands, Dominater needs to destroy 2*(n-1) - 1 bridges, since one bridge is shared between the two islands.

But this is getting too involved.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider the complement: instead of destroying bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, think about preserving bridges to maximize the number of islands Everule can reach.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of connectivity.

In a complete graph, the graph remains connected as long as no bridges are destroyed.

But that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of bridges that need to be preserved to keep certain islands connected to island 1.

So, Everule can reach an island if there is at least one path preserved.

Dominater wants to destroy bridges to prevent this.

This seems like a max-flow min-cut problem, but maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that the number of islands Everule can reach is equal to 1 plus the number of islands that are still connected to island 1 after Dominater destroys up to k bridges.

So, I need to find the maximum number of islands that can be connected to island 1, given that Dominater can destroy up to k bridges.

Wait, but Dominater wants to minimize this number.

I need to find the minimum number of islands that can be reached by Everule, considering Dominater's optimal bridge destruction.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that Everule can reach all islands except those that Dominater successfully isolates.

So, the number of islands Everule can reach is n minus the number of islands that are successfully isolated by Dominater.

Thus, I need to find the maximum number of islands that Dominater can isolate by destroying up to k bridges.

Then, the number of islands Everule can reach is n minus that number.

But how do I find the maximum number of islands that can be isolated?

Each island requires n-1 bridges to be destroyed to isolate it.

But since bridges are shared, there might be overlapping.

This seems too complex.

Maybe I need to consider the number of bridges that need to be destroyed to isolate a group of islands.

If Dominater wants to isolate a group of s islands, they need to destroy all bridges between those s islands and the rest.

In a complete graph, the number of bridges between a group of s islands and the rest is s*(n-s).

So, to isolate s islands, Dominater needs to destroy s*(n-s) bridges.

Then, Dominater can choose s such that s*(n-s) <= k, and maximize s.

Then, the number of islands Everule can reach is n - s.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4 and k=1, s*(4-s) <=1.

For s=1, 1*(4-1)=3 >1, so s=1 not possible.

For s=2, 2*(4-2)=4 >1, not possible.

For s=3, 3*(4-3)=3 >1, not possible.

So, only s=0 is possible, meaning Everule can reach all 4 islands, which matches the example.

For n=4 and k=4.

s=1: 1*3=3 >4, no.

s=2: 2*2=4 <=4, possible.

So, Dominater can isolate 2 islands by destroying 4 bridges.

Thus, Everule can reach n - s = 4 - 2 = 2 islands.

But in the example, output is 1.

Wait, contradiction.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the example for n=4 and k=4, output is 1, but according to this, it should be 2.

So, perhaps this approach is not accurate.

Maybe I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps Dominater can choose to isolate more islands by destroying more bridges.

For n=4 and k=4, s=3: 3*(4-3)=3 <=4, so s=3 is possible.

Then, Everule can reach n - s = 1 island, which matches the example.

Similarly, for s=2, 2*(4-2)=4 <=4, s=2, Everule can reach 4-2=2 islands.

But Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so they would choose s=3, isolating 3 islands, leaving only 1 island reachable.

Hence, the output is 1.

Wait, but earlier for n=4 and k=1, s=3: 3*(4-3)=3 >1, not possible.

s=2: 2*(4-2)=4 >1, not possible.

s=1:1*(4-1)=3 >1, not possible.

s=0:0.

So, only s=0 is possible, meaning Everule can reach all 4 islands.

Which matches the example.

Good.

Similarly, for n=5 and k=3.

s=1:1*(5-1)=4 >3, not possible.

s=2:2*(5-2)=6 >3, not possible.

s=3:3*(5-3)=6 >3, not possible.

s=4:4*(5-4)=4 >3, not possible.

Only s=0 is possible, so Everule can reach all 5 islands.

Which matches the example.

For n=5 and k=10.

s=1:1*4=4 <=10.

s=2:2*3=6 <=10.

s=3:3*2=6 <=10.

s=4:4*1=4 <=10.

s=5:5*0=0 <=10.

Dominater wants to maximize s, so s=5.

Everule can reach n - s =0 islands.

But according to the example, output is 1.

Wait, but according to this, Everule can reach 0 islands, but that contradicts the example.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the example, for n=5 and k=10, output is 1.

According to my earlier logic, s=5, n - s=0, but output is 1.

So, perhaps Everule can always reach island 1, so the minimum number is at least 1.

Hence, the number of islands Everule can reach is max(1, n - s).

So, in this case, max(1, 5 - 5)=1, which matches the example.

Okay, that makes sense.

Hence, the general formula is:

Find the maximum s such that s*(n - s) <= k.

Then, the number of islands Everule can reach is max(1, n - s).

This seems to align with the examples.

So, in code, I need to find the largest s where s*(n - s) <= k.

Then, output max(1, n - s).

Let me verify this with the examples.

First test case: n=2, k=0.

s=1:1*(2-1)=1 >0, not allowed.

s=0:0 <=0, allowed.

So, s=0, Everule reaches max(1, 2 - 0)=2, which matches the output.

Second test case: n=2, k=1.

s=1:1*(2-1)=1 <=1, allowed.

s=0:0 <=1.

So, s=1, Everule reaches max(1, 2 -1)=1, matches output.

Third test case: n=4, k=1.

s=1:1*3=3 >1, not allowed.

s=0:0 <=1.

So, s=0, Everule reaches max(1,4-0)=4, matches output.

Fourth test case: n=5, k=10.

s=5:5*0=0 <=10, allowed.

So, s=5, Everule reaches max(1,5-5)=1, matches output.

Fifth test case: n=5, k=3.

s=0:0 <=3.

s=1:1*4=4 >3, not allowed.

So, s=0, Everule reaches max(1,5-0)=5, matches output.

Sixth test case: n=4, k=4.

s=2:2*2=4 <=4.

s=3:3*1=3 <=4.

s=4:4*0=0 <=4.

So, s=4 is allowed.

Everule reaches max(1,4-4)=1, matches output.

Great, this seems correct.

Hence, the approach is:

- For a given n and k, find the largest s such that s*(n - s) <= k.

- The number of islands Everule can reach is max(1, n - s).

Now, to implement this in code.

I need to find the largest s where s*(n - s) <= k.

I can iterate from s=0 to s=n.

Find the largest s where s*(n - s) <=k.

Alternatively, since s*(n - s) is a quadratic in s, I can solve for s where s*(n - s) <=k.

But to make it efficient, since n is up to 100, I can just iterate s from 0 to n and find the maximum s where s*(n - s) <=k.

Then, compute max(1, n - s).

Also, need to handle t test cases.

Let me look at the provided code.

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n - 1)

So, the code checks if k >= n -1, then print 1, else print n -1.

But according to my earlier analysis, this is incorrect.

For example, in the third test case: n=4, k=1.

According to the code, k < n -1 (1 < 3), so it prints n -1 =3, but the correct output is 4.

Hence, this code is wrong.

Wait, but according to the example, output is 4, but the code would output 3, which is incorrect.

Similarly, in the fifth test case: n=5, k=3.

n -1=4.

k < n -1 (3 < 4), so it would print 4, but the correct output is 5.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

But let's see.

Wait, perhaps the person who wrote this code thought that to isolate island 1 from others, Dominater needs to destroy n -1 bridges, which is the number of direct bridges from island 1 to others.

So, if k >= n -1, Dominater can destroy all direct bridges from island 1 to others, isolating island 1, so Everule can only reach island 1.

If k < n -1, Dominater can only destroy some direct bridges, but not all, so Everule can reach island 1 plus the islands whose direct bridges are not destroyed.

Hence, Everule can reach n - (number of bridges destroyed), but since the graph is complete, there might be other paths.

But as we saw earlier, in a complete graph, even if some direct bridges are destroyed, there might still be paths through other islands.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

The correct approach is to find the largest s such that s*(n - s) <=k, then Everule can reach n -s islands, but at least 1.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit starting from island 1, given that Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges in a complete graph of \( n \) islands.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Islands are numbered from 1 to \( n \).
   - Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach from island 1.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - In a complete graph, islands are highly connected via multiple paths.
   - To isolate a group of islands from island 1, Dominater needs to destroy bridges connecting these islands to the rest.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Determine the largest subset of islands \( s \) that can be isolated by destroying \( s \times (n - s) \) bridges.
   - Find the maximum \( s \) such that \( s \times (n - s) \leq k \).
   - The number of islands Everule can reach is \( n - s \), but at least 1 (since Everule always stays on island 1).

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        max_isolated = 0
        for s in range(n):
            if s * (n - s) <= k:
                max_isolated = s
        print(max(1, n - max_isolated))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Finding Maximum Isolated Islands:**
   - For each \( s \) from 0 to \( n-1 \), calculate \( s \times (n - s) \).
   - Find the largest \( s \) where \( s \times (n - s) \leq k \).

3. **Calculating Reachable Islands:**
   - The number of islands Everule can reach is \( n - s \).
   - Ensure that Everule can reach at least island 1, hence `max(1, n - s)`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - For each test case, print the minimum number of islands Everule can visit.

This approach ensures that we handle the problem correctly by considering the optimal way Dominater can destroy bridges to minimize Everule's reachable islands.
