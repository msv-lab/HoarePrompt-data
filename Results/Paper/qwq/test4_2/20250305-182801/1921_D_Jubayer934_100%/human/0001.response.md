Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, Petya has an array a_i of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array c_i of n integers from a given list of m integers b_i, where m is at least n. Vasya can choose any n integers from b_i and arrange them in any order he wants to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of a_i and c_i.

Okay, so the goal is to maximize D = sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|.

First, I need to understand what makes D as large as possible. The absolute difference |a_i - c_i| is maximized when c_i is as far away as possible from a_i. So, for each a_i, I should pair it with the c_i that is either the largest possible or the smallest possible from the b_i list, depending on whether a_i is smaller or larger than the median of b_i.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Since Vasya can arrange the c_i in any order, I don't have to worry about the positions corresponding to a_i. I can choose any n numbers from b_i and arrange them to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

Hmm. Let me consider sorting both arrays.

If I sort a_i in ascending order and sort b_i in descending order, then pairing the smallest a_i with the largest b_i, the second smallest a_i with the second largest b_i, and so on, might give me the maximum D.

Wait, is that correct? Let's take an example.

Suppose a_i = [1, 2, 3], b_i = [4, 5, 6].

If I sort a_i as [1, 2, 3], and b_i in descending order as [6, 5, 4], then D = |1-6| + |2-5| + |3-4| = 5 + 3 + 1 = 9.

Is there a better arrangement? If I arrange c_i as [5, 4, 6], then D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-6| = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9, which is the same.

Another arrangement: [6, 4, 5], D = |1-6| + |2-4| + |3-5| = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9.

Seems like 9 is the maximum.

Another example: a_i = [1, 1, 1], b_i = [1, 1, 1, 1]. No matter how I arrange c_i, D will always be 0, which makes sense.

Another example: a_i = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b_i = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If I sort a_i as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b_i in descending order as [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], then D = |1-5| + |2-4| + |3-3| + |4-2| + |5-1| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12.

Is there a better arrangement? If I arrange c_i as [4, 5, 3, 1, 2], then D = |1-4| + |2-5| + |3-3| + |4-1| + |5-2| = 3 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 3 = 12 again.

So, sorting a_i in ascending and b_i in descending order and pairing them seems to give the maximum D.

Is this always the case? Let me think about another example.

a_i = [3], b_i = [1, 2, 10]. The best c_i is 10, so D = |3 - 10| = 7.

If I choose 1, D = |3 - 1| = 2, which is less than 7.

So, choosing the farthest possible c_i from a_i maximizes D.

But in this case, since I can arrange c_i any way, I need to pair each a_i with a c_i that maximizes |a_i - c_i|.

Wait, but I have to choose n c_i from m b_i and arrange them in any order.

So, to maximize the sum of absolute differences, I should pair the smallest a_i with the largest possible c_i, and the largest a_i with the smallest possible c_i.

Wait, that seems consistent with sorting a_i in ascending and b_i in descending order and pairing them accordingly.

Ok, so the strategy seems solid.

Now, looking at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

temp = -1

ans = []

a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]

b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]

for i in range(n):

if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):

temp = i

break

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))

if temp != -1:

for i in range(temp, n):

ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))

print(sum(ans))

So, the code reads t test cases, then for each test case, reads n and m, then reads a_i and b_i.

It sorts a_i in ascending order and b_i in descending order.

Then, it iterates through the first n elements of a_i and the first m elements of b_i.

Wait, but m can be larger than n, but we only need to choose n elements from b_i.

But in the code, it's sorting b_i in descending order and taking the first m elements, which is redundant since m can be up to 2e5 per test case, but in reality, m can be up to 2e5 in total across all test cases, as per the problem's guarantee.

But anyway, m is at least n, so taking the first m elements after sorting is fine.

Then, it initializes an answer list ans and a temporary variable temp set to -1.

Then, for each i in range(n), it checks if the absolute difference between a[i] and b[-(n - i)] is greater than the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i].

Wait, b[-(n - i)] means b[-n + i], which is accessing b from the end.

Wait, let's see with an example.

Suppose n=4, m=6, i=0: b[-4 + 0] = b[-4], which is the fourth last element in b.

But b is sorted in descending order, so b[0] is the largest, b[1] is the second largest, and b[-1] is the smallest.

So b[-4] would be the fourth smallest in the original b.

Wait, but b is sorted in descending order, so b[-4] is the fourth smallest.

Wait, no, in Python, negative indices count from the end.

So, if b is sorted in descending order, b[0] is the largest, b[1] is the second largest, ..., b[m-1] is the smallest.

Then, b[-1] is the smallest, b[-2] is the second smallest, and so on.

So, b[-(n - i)] would be b[-(4 - 0)] = b[-4], which is the fourth smallest.

Wait, but in the code, it's b[-(n - i)], which for i=0, n=4, it's b[-4], which is the fourth smallest.

Meanwhile, b[i] is the i-th largest.

So, for i=0, it's comparing |a[0] - b[-4]| vs |a[0] - b[0]|.

Is this intended?

Wait, maybe the idea is to consider two possible pairings:

1. Pair a[i] with b[i], i.e., a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], etc.

2. Pair a[i] with b[-(n - i)], which seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps the author is trying to consider pairing a[i] with both the corresponding position in b and the corresponding position from the end, and choosing the one that gives a larger difference.

But this seems convoluted.

Alternatively, perhaps the author is trying to implement a strategy where for some i, pairing with b[i] gives a larger difference, and for others, pairing with b[-(n - i)] gives a larger difference.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

In the standard approach, to maximize the sum of absolute differences, we should pair each a_i with either the largest possible or smallest possible c_i in a way that maximizes |a_i - c_i|.

But since we can arrange c_i in any order, the optimal strategy is to sort a_i and sort b_i, then pair the smallest a_i with the largest b_i, the second smallest a_i with the second largest b_i, and so on.

This is a standard approach in these kinds of problems.

In code, that would be:

a = sorted(a)

b = sorted(b, reverse=True)

Then, D = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))

But in the provided code, it's doing something more complicated.

It's iterating through i from 0 to n-1, and checking if |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| > |a[i] - b[i]|.

If it finds any i where this is true, it sets temp = i and breaks.

Then, if temp != -1, it appends |a[i] - b[i]| for i from 0 to temp-1, and then |a[i] - b[-(n - i)]| for i from temp to n-1.

This seems like a hybrid approach, trying to switch pairing strategies at some point.

But is this necessary?

In the standard approach, just pairing a_i with b_{m - i - 1} (i.e., pairing with the corresponding position in the reversed sorted b) should give the maximum D.

In the first example:

a = [1, 2, 4, 6], sorted a = [1, 2, 4, 6]

b = [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8], sorted descending b = [8, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1]

Then, pairing:

a[0]=1 with b[0]=8, |1-8|=7

a[1]=2 with b[1]=7, |2-7|=5

a[2]=4 with b[2]=5, |4-5|=1

a[3]=6 with b[3]=3, |6-3|=3

Total D=7+5+1+3=16, which matches the first example.

Alternatively, if we pair a[0]=1 with b[5]=1, |1-1|=0

a[1]=2 with b[4]=2, |2-2|=0

a[2]=4 with b[3]=3, |4-3|=1

a[3]=6 with b[2]=5, |6-5|=1

Total D=0+0+1+1=2, which is worse.

So, the standard approach works.

In the second example:

a = [1, 1, 1], sorted a = [1, 1, 1]

b = [1, 1, 1, 1], sorted descending b = [1, 1, 1, 1]

Pairing:

a[0]=1 with b[0]=1, |1-1|=0

a[1]=1 with b[1]=1, |1-1|=0

a[2]=1 with b[2]=1, |1-1|=0

Total D=0

Which is correct.

In the third example:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sorted a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sorted descending b = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Pairing:

a[0]=1 with b[0]=5, |1-5|=4

a[1]=2 with b[1]=4, |2-4|=2

a[2]=3 with b[2]=3, |3-3|=0

a[3]=4 with b[3]=2, |4-2|=2

a[4]=5 with b[4]=1, |5-1|=4

Total D=4+2+0+2+4=12

Which matches the third example.

So, the standard approach works.

Therefore, the provided code seems to be overcomplicating things.

It's trying to check if there's a point where switching from pairing with b[i] to pairing with b[-(n - i)] gives a better difference.

But according to the standard approach, just pairing a_i with b_{m - i - 1} should suffice.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect because it introduces unnecessary complexity and potentially incorrect logic.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the total difference D between Petya's array a and Vasya's array c, where c is composed of n integers chosen from m integers b. The strategy involves sorting both arrays and pairing the smallest elements of a with the largest elements of b, and vice versa.

### Approach
1. **Sort Arrays**: 
   - Sort array a in ascending order.
   - Sort array b in descending order.
2. **Calculate Differences**:
   - Pair each element of a with the corresponding element in b and calculate the absolute difference.
3. **Sum Differences**:
   - Sum up all the absolute differences to get the maximum total difference D.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        D = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))
        print(D)

func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases t.
   - For each test case, read n and m, then read arrays a and b.
2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - Sort array a in ascending order.
   - Sort array b in descending order.
3. **Calculating Total Difference**:
   - Calculate the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of a and b.
4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the total difference D for each test case.

This approach ensures that we are maximizing the differences by pairing smallest elements of a with largest elements of b, and so on, thus achieving the highest possible total difference D.
