Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i, and the Kraken attacks them k times. The attacks alternate between the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the line, affecting who the first and last ships are for subsequent attacks.

I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the sequence of attacks. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it's removed from the line.

Given that, I need to simulate this process efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k can be up to 10^15, which suggests that a straightforward simulation per attack would be too slow.

So, I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let's think about it in terms of pairs of attacks: one on the first ship and one on the last ship. In each pair, both ships lose 1 durability, unless one of them has already been sunk.

But with k potentially being up to 10^15, I need a way to handle this in a more efficient manner, perhaps in O(1) time per pair or something similar.

Wait, O(1) per pair might still not be efficient enough if k is large. I need to find a way to handle this in logarithmic time or better.

Let me consider the total number of attacks k and see how many ships can be sunk in bulk.

Suppose I have a list of ships from first to last. I need to alternate attacks between the first and last ships until k attacks are done or all ships are sunk.

One approach could be to keep track of the number of attacks on the first and last ships and reduce their durability accordingly.

But I need to handle the cases where a ship is sunk and removed from the line, which affects who the first and last ships are.

This seems tricky to handle directly, especially with large n and k.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of two pointers: one for the first ship and one for the last ship. I can iterate through the ships, alternating between reducing the durability of the first and last ships, and removing them from the list when their durability reaches zero.

But again, with n up to 2*10^5, I need this to be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach where I keep track of the current first and last ships, and in each step, I calculate how many attacks can be applied before one of them is sunk.

For example, if I have ships from left to right, with durabilities a[l], a[l+1], ..., a[r-1], a[r]. I can alternate attacks between a[l] and a[r], reducing their durability by 1 each time.

I need to find out how many attacks to apply before either a[l] or a[r] is sunk, i.e., its durability becomes 0.

Suppose a[l] <= a[r]. If I attack the first ship a[l] times, it will be sunk, and during these a[l] attacks, the last ship will be attacked a[l] // 2 times (since attacks alternate).

Wait, no. Let's think differently.

Each pair of attacks consists of one on the first ship and one on the last ship, unless k is odd, in which case there's one extra attack on the first ship.

But this might not be accurate, especially when ships are sinking.

Maybe I should think in terms of the minimum durability between the current first and last ships.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the smallest durability between a[l] and a[r], and see how many attacks are needed to sink one of them.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let l be the index of the current first ship, and r be the index of the current last ship.

While l < r and k > 0:

    If a[l] <= a[r]:

        attacks_on_first = a[l]

        attacks_on_last = attacks_on_first // 2  # because attacks alternate

        if attacks_on_first * 2 - (attacks_on_first % 2) <= k:

            # Sinking the first ship takes attacks_on_first attacks

            # During these attacks, the last ship is attacked attacks_on_first // 2 times

            a[l] = 0

            a[r] -= attacks_on_first // 2

            k -= attacks_on_first * 2 - (attacks_on_first % 2)

            ans += 1  # first ship is sunk

            l += 1

        else:

            # Not enough attacks to sink the first ship

            # Calculate how many attacks can be applied

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[l] -= 1

            if a[l] <= 0:

                ans += 1

            if a[r] <= 0:

                ans += 1

            break

    Else:

        # Similar logic but with a[r] <= a[l]

        attacks_on_last = a[r]

        attacks_on_first = attacks_on_last // 2

        if attacks_on_last * 2 - (attacks_on_last % 2) <= k:

            a[r] = 0

            a[l] -= attacks_on_last // 2

            k -= attacks_on_last * 2 - (attacks_on_last % 2)

            ans += 1  # last ship is sunk

            r -= 1

        else:

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[r] -= 1

            if a[l] <= 0:

                ans += 1

            if a[r] <= 0:

                ans += 1

            break

After this, if l == r, handle the remaining attacks on the single ship.

This seems a bit messy, but it might work.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, read the number of test cases T.

For each test case:

    Read n and k.

    Read the list of durabilities a.

    Initialize l = 0 and r = n - 1.

    Initialize ans = 0.

    While l < r and k > 0:

        If a[l] <= a[r]:

            If a[l] * 2 <= k:

                # Sinking the first ship takes a[l] attacks

                # During these a[l] attacks, the last ship is attacked a[l] // 2 times

                a[l] = 0

                a[r] -= a[l] // 2

                k -= a[l] * 2 - (a[l] % 2)

                ans += 1

                l += 1

            Else:

                # Not enough attacks to sink the first ship

                t = k // 2

                a[l] -= t

                a[r] -= t

                if k % 2:

                    a[l] -= 1

                if a[l] <= 0:

                    ans += 1

                if a[r] <= 0:

                    ans += 1

                break

        Else:

            If a[r] * 2 <= k:

                # Sinking the last ship takes a[r] attacks

                # During these a[r] attacks, the first ship is attacked a[r] // 2 times

                a[r] = 0

                a[l] -= a[r] // 2

                k -= a[r] * 2 - (a[r] % 2)

                ans += 1

                r -= 1

            Else:

                # Not enough attacks to sink the last ship

                t = k // 2

                a[l] -= t

                a[r] -= t

                if k % 2:

                    a[r] -= 1

                if a[l] <= 0:

                    ans += 1

                if a[r] <= 0:

                    ans += 1

                break

    If l == r and k > 0:

        if k >= a[l]:

            ans += 1

    Print ans.

Wait, I need to make sure that when a ship is sunk, it's removed from the line, meaning l is incremented or r is decremented.

Also, I need to handle the case where l == r separately, as there's only one ship left.

Let me try to test this logic with the sample input.

Sample Input:

6

4 5

1 2 4 3

4 6

1 2 4 3

5 20

2 7 1 8 2

2 2

3 2

2 15

1 5

2 7

5 2

Sample Output:

2

3

5

0

2

2

Let's take the first test case:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1: l=0, r=3

a[l]=1, a[r]=3

Since a[l] <= a[r], and a[l]*2=2 <= k=5

Sinking the first ship takes 1 attack, and during these attacks, the last ship is attacked 1//2=0 times.

So, a[l]=0, a[r]=3-0=3, k=5-2+1%2=5-2+1=4, ans=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,3]

Step 2: l=1, r=3

a[l]=2, a[r]=3

a[l] <= a[r], and a[l]*2=4 <= k=4

Sinking the first ship takes 2 attacks, and during these attacks, the last ship is attacked 2//2=1 time.

So, a[l]=0, a[r]=3-1=2, k=4-3=1, ans=2, l=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,2]

Step 3: l=2, r=3

a[l]=4, a[r]=2

a[r] <= a[l], and a[r]*2=4 <= k=1? No.

So, t = k//2=0

a[l]-=0, a[r]-=0

k%2=1, so a[l]-=1 => a[l]=3

Since a[l] >0 and a[r]>0, no ships sunk.

Break the loop.

Final ans=2, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Let's check the second test case:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1: l=0, r=3

a[l]=1, a[r]=3

a[l] <= a[r], and a[l]*2=2 <= k=6

Sinking the first ship takes 1 attack, last ship attacked 0 times.

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-0=3, k=6-1*2+1%2=6-2+1=5, ans=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,3]

Step 2: l=1, r=3

a[l]=2, a[r]=3

a[l] <= a[r], and a[l]*2=4 <= k=5

Sinking the first ship takes 2 attacks, last ship attacked 2//2=1 time.

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-1=2, k=5-3=2, ans=2, l=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,2]

Step 3: l=2, r=3

a[l]=4, a[r]=2

a[r] <= a[l], and a[r]*2=4 <= k=2? No.

t = k//2=1

a[l]-=1=3, a[r]-=1=1

k%2=0, so no extra attack.

Now, a[l]=3 >0, a[r]=1 >0, no ships sunk.

Break the loop.

Final ans=2, but sample output is 3.

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I have a mistake in the logic.

In the second test case, according to the sample output, it should be 3 ships sunk, but according to my logic, it's 2.

Let me see what's wrong.

Wait, in the second test case, after step 2, a=[0,0,4,2], l=2, r=3, k=2.

Then, in step 3, since a[r]=2 <= a[l]=4, and a[r]*2=4 > k=2, so t=2//2=1.

a[l]-=1=3, a[r]-=1=1, k%2=0, so no extra attack.

Now, a[l]=3 >0, a[r]=1 >0, so no additional ships sunk.

Thus, ans=2, but sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to continue attacking until k=0.

Wait, maybe I need to keep attacking even after the first pair where no ship is sunk.

But according to the problem, if no ship is sunk in a pair, I should stop.

Wait, no, the problem says that if all ships have sunk, the Kraken stops.

But in this case, two ships are still afloat, so the Kraken should continue attacking.

Wait, perhaps my logic is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Maybe instead of checking if one ship can be sunk in each iteration, I should calculate how many attacks can be applied before any ship is sunk.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the number of attacks needed to sink each ship, considering the alternating attacks.

This might be more efficient.

Let me consider that in each cycle of two attacks (one on the first and one on the last), both ships lose 1 durability.

Unless one of them has less durability, in which case it gets sunk first.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a process where in each cycle, the first and last ships both lose 1 durability, until one of them is sunk.

Then, remove the sunk ship and continue with the next first and last ships.

But with k up to 10^15, I need a way to handle this efficiently.

Maybe I can use a two-pointer approach and calculate the number of cycles needed to sink either the first or the last ship, then subtract the corresponding attacks from k.

Repeat this until k is exhausted or all ships are sunk.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize l=0, r=n-1, ans=0.

While l < r and k > 0:

    If a[l] <= a[r]:

        cycles = a[l]

        attacks = cycles * 2 - (cycles % 2)

        if attacks <= k:

            k -= attacks

            a[l] = 0

            a[r] -= cycles // 2

            l += 1

            ans += 1

        Else:

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[l] -= 1

            if a[l] <= 0:

                ans += 1

                l += 1

            if a[r] <= 0:

                ans += 1

                r -= 1

            break

    Else:

        cycles = a[r]

        attacks = cycles * 2 - (cycles % 2)

        if attacks <= k:

            k -= attacks

            a[r] = 0

            a[l] -= cycles // 2

            r -= 1

            ans += 1

        Else:

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[r] -= 1

            if a[l] <= 0:

                ans += 1

                l += 1

            if a[r] <= 0:

                ans += 1

                r -= 1

            break

If l == r:

    if k >= a[l]:

        ans += 1

Print ans.

Let me test this logic with the second test case.

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1: l=0, r=3

a[l]=1 <= a[r]=3

cycles = 1, attacks = 1*2 -1=1

k=6 >=1

k=6-1=5

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-0=3, l=1, ans=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,3]

Step 2: l=1, r=3

a[l]=2 <= a[r]=3

cycles=2, attacks=2*2 -0=4 <=k=5

k=5-4=1

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-1=2, l=2, ans=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,2]

Step 3: l=2, r=3

a[l]=4 > a[r]=2

So, a[r]=2, cycles=2, attacks=2*2 -0=4 >k=1

So, t=k//2=0

a[l]-=0=4, a[r]-=0=2

k%2=1, so a[l]-=1=3

Now, a[l]=3 >0, a[r]=2 >0, so no additional ships sunk.

Break the loop.

Final ans=2, but sample output is 3.

Wait, according to the sample explanation, after 6 attacks, ships [2,4,3] should be remaining, with a=[1,4,2]. Wait, no, let's see the sample explanation again.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3], the output is 3, meaning 3 ships are sunk.

But according to my logic, only 2 ships are sunk.

So, there must be a mistake in my logic.

Let me think again.

Maybe my calculation of attacks is incorrect.

Wait, for the first ship with a[l]=1, it takes 1 attack to sink, and during these attacks, the last ship is attacked 1//2=0 times.

So, a[r] remains 3.

Then, k=6-1*2 +1%2=6-2+1=5.

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,3]

Next, a[l]=2 <= a[r]=3

cycles=2, attacks=2*2 -0=4 <=k=5

k=5-4=1

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-1=2, l=2

ans=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,2], k=1

Since l < r, and k=1 >0

a[l]=4 > a[r]=2

cycles=2, attacks=2*2 -0=4 >k=1

So, t=k//2=0

a[l]-=0=4, a[r]-=0=2

k%2=1, so a[l]-=1=3

Now, a[l]=3 >0, a[r]=2 >0, no ships sunk.

Break the loop.

Final ans=2

But sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to continue attacking until k=0, even if no ship is sunk in a step.

But according to the problem, the Kraken stops attacking if all ships have been sunk, but in this case, two ships are still afloat.

Wait, maybe I need to keep attacking the remaining ships until k=0, even if no ship is sunk in a particular step.

In this case, after the break, I have k=1 left, but no ships are sunk in that step.

But according to the sample, after 6 attacks, 3 ships should be sunk.

Wait, perhaps my calculation of attacks is wrong.

Let me try to simulate the attacks step by step.

Initial a=[1,2,4,3]

Attack 1: first ship, a=[0,2,4,3], k=5

Attack 2: last ship, a=[0,2,4,2], k=4

Attack 3: first ship, a=[-1,2,4,2], but since a[l]=0, it's already sunk, so skip to next first ship, which is a[1]=2

Now, a=[0,1,4,2], k=3

Attack 4: last ship, a=[0,1,4,1], k=2

Attack 5: first ship, a=[0,0,4,1], k=1

Attack 6: last ship, a=[0,0,4,0], k=0

Now, ships with a=0 are sunk: ship1, ship2, ship4, so ans=3, which matches the sample.

But in my earlier logic, I only counted ship1 and ship2 as sunk, missing ship4.

So, my logic is incomplete because it doesn't account for sinking the last ship in the final attacks.

I need to adjust my logic to handle this correctly.

Perhaps, after the main loop, I need to check if any of the remaining ships can be sunk with the remaining k attacks.

Wait, but in the above simulation, ship4 was sunk in the last attack.

So, perhaps I need to continue attacking the remaining ships until k=0.

Let me adjust my logic.

Initialize l=0, r=3, a=[1,2,4,3], k=6

Step1: a[l]=1 <= a[r]=3

attacks=1*2-1=1 <=6

k=6-1=5

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-0=3, l=1, ans=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,3], k=5

Step2: a[l]=2 <= a[r]=3

attacks=2*2-0=4 <=5

k=5-4=1

a[l]=0, a[r]=3-1=2, l=2, ans=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,2], k=1

Step3: a[l]=4 > a[r]=2

attacks=2*2-0=4 >1

So, t=1//2=0

a[l]-=0=4, a[r]-=0=2

k%2=1, so a[l]-=1=3

Now, a[l]=3 >0, a[r]=2 >0, no ships sunk.

But in the simulation, with k=1, the last attack was on the last ship, sinking it.

So, perhaps I need to check if after these operations, any ship's durability becomes <=0.

In this case, a[r]=2 -1 (from the extra attack)=1, but in the simulation, it became 0.

Wait, in the simulation, after step3, k=1 is used to attack the last ship, making a[r]=2-1=1.

But in the earlier manual simulation, I had a[r]=2 -1=1, but in the actual sample, it seems ship4 is sunk.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in manual simulation.

Wait, in the manual simulation above, after attack6, a=[0,0,4,0], which means ship4 is sunk.

But according to the adjusted logic, a[r]=2 -1=1, which is >0.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the remaining k attacks after the main loop differently.

Let me think again.

Maybe, after the main loop, if l == r and k >= a[l], then ans +=1.

But in the sample, after the main loop, l=2, r=3, k=1, a=[0,0,4,1]

So, l != r, but k=1 is used to attack the last ship, sinking it.

So, perhaps I need to handle the case when l < r and k >0, perform the remaining attacks on the last ship.

Wait, no, attacks alternate between first and last.

But in the remaining k attacks, I need to alternate between first and last ships.

But with k potentially large, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Maybe I should switch to a different approach.

Let me consider that in each cycle of two attacks, the first and last ships each lose 1 durability.

I can calculate how many full cycles can be performed before running out of k attacks or before sinking one of the ships.

Then, subtract the durability accordingly.

This seems similar to what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate until l < r and k >= the minimum of a[l] and a[r] multiplied by 2 (minus 1 if necessary).

Wait, maybe I need to use a while loop that continues as long as l < r and k can cover the attacks needed to sink either the first or the last ship.

In each iteration, I calculate the number of attacks needed to sink the ship with lesser durability, and see if k can cover that.

If yes, sink that ship, update k, l, or r, and continue.

If not, perform as many attacks as possible with the remaining k, update the durabilities, and break.

Then, if l == r, check if k is enough to sink the last ship.

This seems similar to my initial approach but perhaps I need to adjust the calculation of attacks needed.

Let me try to formalize this again.

While l < r:

    if a[l] <= a[r]:

        if k >= a[l] * 2 - (a[l] % 2):

            k -= a[l] * 2 - (a[l] % 2)

            a[l] = 0

            a[r] -= a[l] // 2

            l += 1

            ans +=1

        else:

            # Not enough k to sink the first ship

            # Calculate how many attacks can be performed

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[l] -=1

            if a[l] <=0:

                ans +=1

                l +=1

            if a[r] <=0:

                ans +=1

                r -=1

            break

    else:

        if k >= a[r] * 2 - (a[r] % 2):

            k -= a[r] * 2 - (a[r] % 2)

            a[r] = 0

            a[l] -= a[r] // 2

            r -=1

            ans +=1

        else:

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[r] -=1

            if a[l] <=0:

                ans +=1

                l +=1

            if a[r] <=0:

                ans +=1

                r -=1

            break

If l == r:

    if k >= a[l]:

        ans +=1

Print ans.

Wait, in the second test case, this still gives ans=2, but sample output is 3.

I need to find a way to account for the last ship being sunk with the remaining k attacks.

Wait, perhaps after the main loop, I need to check if any remaining ships can be sunk with the remaining k attacks.

But in the earlier simulation, with k=1 left, and a=[0,0,4,1], l=2, r=3.

Then, l == r is not true, since l=2 and r=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the case when l < r and k >0 after the main loop.

In this case, I need to see if I can sink any of the remaining ships with the remaining k attacks.

Wait, perhaps I need to continue attacking the remaining ships in a similar manner until k=0 or no ships are left.

This seems complicated to handle efficiently.

Let me consider another approach.

Maybe I can model this as a priority queue or something, but with n up to 2e5, it's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute how many attacks are needed to sink each ship, considering the order of attacks.

But it's tricky because the attacks alternate between first and last ships.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate for each ship, the number of attacks required to sink it, assuming continuous attacks on it.

But considering the alternating attacks, it's not straightforward.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have ships from l to r.

Each pair of attacks (first and last) reduces their durability by 1 each.

Unless one of them has less durability, in which case it gets sunk first.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the sum of durabilities of first and last ships, and see how many pairs of attacks can be applied before one of them is sunk.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let total_attacks = sum of all attacks needed to sink all ships, considering the alternating attacks.

But calculating total_attacks directly is complex.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the ships in pairs, calculating the attacks needed to sink both ends simultaneously.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look for a better way.

I recall that in similar problems, we can use a two-pointer approach to handle operations on both ends.

In this case, I can use a two-pointer approach, but need to handle the attacks in a way that accounts for the alternating pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of attacks needed to sink either the first or the last ship, whichever has less durability, and subtract that from k, repeating until k is exhausted or no ships are left.

This is similar to my initial approach.

But in the second test case, it's not giving the correct answer.

Maybe I need to adjust the calculation of attacks needed.

Let me consider that for a ship with durability d, it takes d attacks to sink it, during which the opposite end ship is attacked floor(d/2) times.

So, the total attacks needed to sink one ship is d, and the opposite ship loses floor(d/2) durability.

If k >= d, then we can sink the ship and update the opposite ship's durability.

Otherwise, we can reduce the durability of both ships based on the available k.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle the attacks in batches where in each batch, I sink one ship and update the opposite ship accordingly.

Let me try to implement this logic.

Initialize l=0, r=n-1, ans=0.

While l < r and k >0:

    if a[l] <= a[r]:

        if k >= a[l]:

            k -= a[l]

            a[r] -= a[l] // 2

            if a[r] <=0:

                ans +=1

            l +=1

            ans +=1

        else:

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[l] -=1

            if a[l] <=0:

                ans +=1

                l +=1

            if a[r] <=0:

                ans +=1

                r -=1

            break

    else:

        if k >= a[r]:

            k -= a[r]

            a[l] -= a[r] // 2

            if a[l] <=0:

                ans +=1

            r -=1

            ans +=1

        else:

            t = k // 2

            a[l] -= t

            a[r] -= t

            if k % 2:

                a[r] -=1

            if a[l] <=0:

                ans +=1

                l +=1

            if a[r] <=0:

                ans +=1

                r -=1

            break

If l == r:

    if k >= a[l]:

        ans +=1

Print ans.

Let me test this with the second test case.

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step1: l=0, r=3

a[l]=1 <= a[r]=3

k >= a[l]=1

k=6-1=5

a[r]=3 -1//2=3-0=3

ans=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,2,4,3], k=5

Step2: l=1, r=3

a[l]=2 <= a[r]=3

k >= a[l]=2

k=5-2=3

a[r]=3 -2//2=3-1=2

ans=2, l=2

Now, l=2, r=3, a=[0,0,4,2], k=3

Step3: l=2, r=3

a[l]=4 > a[r]=2

So, a[r]=2, k >=2

k=3-2=1

a[l]=4 -2//2=4-1=3

ans=3, r=2

Now, l=2, r=2, a=[0,0,3], k=1

l == r, and k >= a[l]=3? No, k=1 <3, so no ship sunk.

Final ans=3, which matches the sample.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the key was to correctly calculate the attacks needed to sink one ship and update the opposite ship's durability accordingly.

Also, handling the case when k is not enough to sink a ship in a single batch, and updating the durabilities accordingly.

Now, let's see if this logic works for other test cases.

Take the third test case:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Step1: l=0, r=4

a[l]=2 <= a[r]=2

k >=2

k=20-2=18

a[r]=2 -2//2=2-1=1

ans=1, l=1

Now, l=1, r=4, a=[0,7,1,8,0], k=18

Step2: l=1, r=4

a[l]=7 > a[r]=0

Wait, a[r]=0, so a[r]=0 <= a[l]=7

But since a[r]=0, it's already sunk.

So, k >=0

k=18-0=18

a[r]=0, a[l]=7 -0//2=7-0=7

ans=2, l=1, r=3

Wait, no.

Wait, if a[r]=0, then it's already sunk, so ans +=1, r -=1

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the logic to check if a[r] <=0 or a[l] <=0 before proceeding.

Wait, in the code, I have:

if a[l] <= a[r]:

    if k >= a[l]:

        k -= a[l]

        a[r] -= a[l] // 2

        if a[r] <=0:

            ans +=1

        l +=1

        ans +=1

    else:

        ...

Similarly for a[r] <= a[l].

But in this case, a[r]=0, so a[r] <= a[l], and k >=0, which is always true.

So, k=18-0=18

a[r]=0 -0//2=0-0=0

ans=2, l=1, r=3

Now, l=1, r=3, a=[0,7,1,8,0], k=18

Step3: l=1, r=3

a[l]=7 > a[r]=8

So, a[r]=8, k >=8

k=18-8=10

a[l]=7 -8//2=7-4=3

ans=3, r=2

Now, l=1, r=2, a=[0,3,1,8,0], k=10

Step4: l=1, r=2

a[l]=3 <= a[r]=1

a[r]=1, k >=1

k=10-1=9

a[l]=3 -1//2=3-0=3

ans=4, r=1

Now, l=1, r=1, a=[0,3,1,8,0], k=9

l == r, and k >= a[l]=3

So, ans=5

Which matches the sample output of 5.

Good.

Let's check another test case.

n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

Step1: l=0, r=1

a[l]=3 > a[r]=2

a[r]=2, k >=2

k=2-2=0

a[l]=3 -2//2=3-1=2

ans=1, r=0

Now, l=0, r=0, a=[2], k=0

So, final ans=1, but sample output is 0.

Wait, according to the sample, for n=2, k=2, a=[3,2], output is 0.

But according to my logic, ans=1.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Let me simulate manually.

Initial a=[3,2], k=2

Attack1: first ship, a=[2,2], k=1

Attack2: last ship, a=[2,1], k=0

No ship is sunk, so ans=0, which matches the sample.

But according to my earlier logic, ans=1, which is incorrect.

So, my logic is still flawed.

In the earlier logic, when l=0, r=1, a=[3,2], k=2

a[r]=2 <= a[l]=3

k >=2

k=2-2=0

a[l]=3 -2//2=3-1=2

ans=1, r=0

Then, l=0, r=0, a=[2], k=0

ans=1

But according to the sample, no ship is sunk.

So, the condition to increment ans needs to be adjusted.

I need to only increment ans when a ship's durability becomes 0 or less.

In this case, after the first batch, a[l]=2, which is still >0, so ans should not be incremented.

Wait, in my earlier logic, I have ans +=1 when sinking the ship, but in this case, the ship is not sunk because a[l]=2 >0.

So, perhaps I need to check if a[l] <=0 after updating, then ans +=1.

Let me adjust the logic.

Initialize l=0, r=1, a=[3,2], k=2

Step1: a[l]=3 > a[r]=2

if k >= a[r]:

    k -= a[r]

    a[l] -= a[r] //2

    if a[r] <=0:

        ans +=1

    r -=1

    if a[r] <=0:

        ans +=1

else:

    ...

In this case, k=2 >= a[r]=2

k=2-2=0

a[l]=3 -2//2=3-1=2

if a[r]=0 <=0, ans +=1, r=0

Now, check if a[l]=2 <=0? No.

So, ans=1, which is still incorrect.

Wait, according to the sample, no ship should be sunk.

So, perhaps I need to only increment ans when a ship's durability becomes <=0 due to attacks in that batch.

In the first batch, a[r] becomes 0, so ans +=1.

But in reality, the ship's durability reaches 0 exactly at the end of the batch.

But according to the problem, if a ship's durability drops to 0, it's sunk and removed.

So, in this case, the last ship is sunk, but since k is exhausted, no further attacks can be performed.

Hence, ans=1 is correct.

Wait, but according to the sample, output is 0.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=2, k=2, a=[3,2], output is 0.

But according to my logic, ans=1.

There must be a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts only the ships that are sunk, not the ones that are reduced to 0 durability.

Wait, no, the problem says "When the durability of the ship drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer subjected to attacks."

So, in the above case, the last ship's durability drops to 0 and is sunk.

Hence, ans=1, but sample output is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the ship is only removed after its durability drops to 0.

So, in the first batch, the last ship's durability drops to 0, so it's sunk.

Then, l=0, r=0, a=[2], k=0, so no more attacks.

Hence, ans=1.

But sample output is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the ship is only removed after the batch in which it is sunk.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me simulate again.

Initial a=[3,2], k=2

Attack1: first ship, a=[2,2], k=1

Attack2: last ship, a=[2,1], k=0

No ship's durability drops to 0, so no ships are sunk.

Hence, ans=0, which matches the sample.

So, in my earlier logic, I incorrectly counted the last ship as sunk when its durability is 0.

But in reality, in the second attack, the last ship's durability becomes 1, which is still >0.

Hence, no ship is sunk, ans=0.

So, my logic is still flawed.

I need to adjust it to only count ships that have durability <=0 after all attacks are applied.

Wait, no, according to the problem, "When the durability of the ship drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer subjected to attacks."

So, in the above simulation, after attack2, a=[2,1], no ship's durability is 0, so no ships are sunk.

Hence, ans=0.

So, perhaps I need to track the ships that have durability <=0 at any point during the attacks.

But in this case, no ship's durability drops to 0.

Wait, in my earlier logic, when k >= a[r], I set a[r]=0, and increment ans.

But in reality, a[r] is only set to 0 if k >= a[r], but in the simulation, a[r]=2-1=1, since attack2 reduces it to 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the exact durability after k attacks, not just set it to 0.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the durability based on the actual number of attacks applied, not assume that the ship is fully sunk.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try a different approach.

I can simulate the attacks in pairs, reducing the durability of both ends by 1 per pair, until one of them is sunk or k is exhausted.

But with k up to 1e15, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of full pairs that can be applied before sinking one of the ships.

Then, subtract the corresponding durability and k.

Repeat this until k is exhausted or no ships are left.

Let me try to formalize this.

While l < r and k >0:

    if a[l] <= a[r]:

        # Calculate how many pairs can be applied before sinking the first ship

        pairs = a[l]

        attacks = pairs * 2 - (pairs % 2)

        if attacks <= k:

            k -= attacks

            a[l] = 0

            a[r] -= pairs // 2

            if a[r] <=0:

                ans +=1
