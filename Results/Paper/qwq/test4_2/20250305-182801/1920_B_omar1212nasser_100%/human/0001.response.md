Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the elements that are most harmful to the sum. But wait, Bob gets to flip some signs after that. So, Alice needs to consider what Bob might do.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the sum. He can flip up to x elements to negative. So, if Alice leaves some negatives in the array, Bob might flip them back to positive, or if there are positives, he might flip them to negative to reduce the sum.

This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum considering that Bob will minimize it.

Let me think about the array and how to approach this.

First, since Alice can remove up to k elements, she might want to remove the smallest elements if Bob doesn't flip any, but Bob will try to minimize the sum, so he might flip some positives to negatives.

Wait, but Bob can only flip up to x elements. So, Alice needs to consider that Bob will flip the most positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

But it's more complicated because Alice can remove elements before Bob acts.

Let me consider sorting the array. If I sort the array in ascending order, the smallest elements are first, and the largest are last.

Alice can remove up to k elements. She might want to remove the smallest elements, but again, Bob can flip some of the largest elements to negative.

Hmm.

Maybe I should think about the array after Alice's removal. Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements. Then, Bob can flip the largest x remaining elements to negative.

But is that the optimal strategy?

Wait, maybe not. Maybe Alice should remove some elements in such a way that minimizes the impact of Bob's flipping.

Let me consider different scenarios.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements. Then, Bob can flip the largest x remaining elements to negative. So, the sum would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements (because flipping them to negative subtracts twice their value from the sum).

Alternatively, Alice could remove some other elements to minimize the impact of Bob's flipping.

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's flipping.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that, when removed, minimize the potential damage from Bob's flipping.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to consider different possibilities and find a general approach.

Let's consider that after Alice removes k elements, there are n - k elements left. Bob can then flip up to x of these to negative.

To minimize the sum, Bob would flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

So, the sum after Bob's action would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Therefore, the sum after both actions would be:

sum_remaining - 2 * sum(top_x_remaining)

Alice wants to maximize this sum by choosing which k elements to remove.

So, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove such that the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This seems like a tricky optimization problem.

Maybe I can think of it differently. Suppose I fix which k elements Alice removes, then compute the sum after Bob flips the x largest remaining elements.

I need to maximize this overall.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think about the properties of the array.

First, sorting the array seems essential.

Let's sort the array in ascending order.

So, the smallest elements are first, and the largest are last.

Alice can remove any k elements, but probably it's best to remove the smallest k elements to maximize the remaining sum before Bob's action.

But wait, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative to minimize the sum.

So, if Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining array is the largest n - k elements.

Bob will flip the x largest of these to negative.

So, the sum after Bob's action would be sum(largest n - k elements) - 2 * sum(largest x of these).

Wait, but maybe Alice can do better by removing some of the elements that Bob would flip.

For example, if Alice removes some of the elements that Bob would flip, then Bob has fewer elements to flip, which might lead to a higher sum.

This seems like a trade-off.

Perhaps Alice should remove some of the elements that Bob would flip, to prevent him from flipping them.

Wait, but Alice's goal is to maximize the sum after Bob's flipping.

So, if Alice removes some of the elements that Bob would flip, then those elements are removed, and Bob can't flip them, but he can flip other elements instead.

It's getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider different cases based on the values of k and x.

Let me consider some examples from the problem statement.

In the first test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

Alice removes the only element, so the sum is 0.

In the second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a=[3,1,2,4]

Alice can remove one element. If she removes the smallest, which is 1, then the remaining elements are [2,3,4]. Bob can flip one of these, say 4 to -4, so the sum is 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1.

But in the explanation, it says Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum is 3 + 1 + 2 + (-4) = 2.

And the output is 2.

Wait, according to the program, it's printing 2.

So, in this case, Alice chooses not to remove any elements, and Bob flips the largest element to negative.

In the third test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

Alice can remove up to 6 elements. If she removes all, sum is 0.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

a=[3,7,3,3,32,15]

Similarly, Alice removes all, sum is 0.

Wait, but in the output, it's 3, which suggests that Alice doesn't remove all elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the code to understand.

Looking back at the code:

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):

pos = []

s = sum(elements)

pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))

s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])

for i in range(1, removals + 1):

s -= elements[-i]

s2 -= elements[-i]

if negatives + i <= len(elements):

s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

return max(pos)

So, in this function, it seems to be calculating multiple possibilities and taking the maximum.

Specifically, it seems to be considering removing different numbers of elements from the end of the sorted array and calculating the sum after Bob flips the top x elements.

Wait, let's see.

First, it sorts the array in ascending order.

Then, s is the sum of all elements.

pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))

So, this is sum minus twice the sum of the top x elements.

Which corresponds to not removing any elements and Bob flipping the top x elements.

Then, in the loop, for i from 1 to removals:

s -= elements[-i]

s2 -= elements[-i]

if negatives + i <= len(elements):

s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

So, it's removing the top i elements, and adjusting s2 accordingly.

Wait, s is the sum after removing i elements from the end.

s2 is somehow related to the sum of the top x elements after removals.

I need to understand what s2 represents.

Initially, s2 is sum of the top x elements.

Then, for each removal, it removes the last element (which is one of the largest) from s2, and if possible, adds the next element.

Wait, it's trying to keep track of the sum of the top x remaining elements after removals.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a=[3,1,2,4]

sorted a=[1,2,3,4]

s = 1+2+3+4=10

pos.append(10 - 2*(4)) = 10 - 8 = 2

Then, for i=1:

s -= 4 => s=6

s2 -=4 => s2=0

since x+i=1+1=2 <=4, s2 += elements[-2] =3

pos.append(6 - 2*3 ) = 6-6=0

So, pos=[2,0], maximum is 2, which matches the output.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

sorted a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s=21

pos.append(21 - 2*(5+6+4)=21-2*15=21-30=-9)

Then, for i=1:

s=21-6=15

s2=15-6=9

if 3+1=4<=6, s2 += elements[-4]=4

s2=9+4=13

pos.append(15-2*13)=15-26=-11

for i=2:

s=15-5=10

s2=13-5=8

if 3+2=5<=6, s2 += elements[-5]=3

s2=8+3=11

pos.append(10-22)=-12

for i=3:

s=10-4=6

s2=11-4=7

if 3+3=6<=6, s2 += elements[-6]=1

s2=7+1=8

pos.append(6-16)=-10

for i=4:

s=6-3=3

s2=8-3=5

if 3+4=7>6, no addition

pos.append(3-10)=-7

for i=5:

s=3-2=1

s2=5-2=3

if 3+5=8>6, no addition

pos.append(1-6)=-5

for i=6:

s=1-1=0

s2=3-1=2

if 3+6=9>6, no addition

pos.append(0-4)=-4

So, pos=[-9,-11,-12,-10,-7,-5,-4], maximum is -4, but in the output, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case.

Wait, in the test case description, for n=6, k=6, x=3, a=[1,4,3,2,5,6], output is 0.

But according to this calculation, it's -4.

Hmm, maybe the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating s2.

Let's revisit the code.

s = sum(elements)

pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))

s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])

Then, for each i from 1 to removals:

s -= elements[-i]

s2 -= elements[-i]

if negatives + i <= len(elements):

s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]

pos.append(s - 2 * s2)

So, in the first iteration:

s = sum(a) = 21

s2 = sum(top x elements) = 6+5+4=15

pos.append(21 - 2*15) = -9

Then, i=1:

s -= 6 => s=15

s2 -=6 => s2=9

since x+i=4<=6, s2 += elements[-4]=3 => s2=12

pos.append(15 - 2*12) = -9

i=2:

s -=5 => s=10

s2 -=5 => s2=7

x+i=3+2=5<=6, s2 += elements[-5]=2 => s2=9

pos.append(10 - 18) = -8

i=3:

s -=4 => s=6

s2 -=4 => s2=5

x+i=3+3=6<=6, s2 += elements[-6]=1 => s2=6

pos.append(6 - 12) = -6

i=4:

s -=3 => s=3

s2 -=3 => s2=3

x+i=3+4=7>6, no addition

pos.append(3 - 6) = -3

i=5:

s -=2 => s=1

s2 -=2 => s2=1

x+i=3+5=8>6, no addition

pos.append(1 - 2) = -1

i=6:

s -=1 => s=0

s2 -=1 => s2=0

x+i=3+6=9>6, no addition

pos.append(0 - 0) = 0

So, pos=[-9,-9,-8,-6,-3,-1,0], maximum is 0, which matches the output.

Wait, earlier I miscalculated s2.

In i=1:

s2 = 15 -6 +3 =12

i=2:

s2=12 -5 +2=9

i=3:

s2=9 -4 +1=6

i=4:

s2=6 -3=3

i=5:

s2=3 -2=1

i=6:

s2=1 -1=0

So, pos=[-9,-9,-8,-6,-3,-1,0], max is 0.

Okay, so the code seems correct in this case.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1

a=[3,7,3,3,32,15]

sorted a=[3,3,3,7,15,32]

s=3+3+3+7+15+32=63

pos.append(63 - 2*(32)=63-64=-1)

Then, i=1:

s=63-32=31

s2=31-32=-1

x+i=1+1=2<=6, s2 += elements[-2]=15 => s2=14

pos.append(31 - 2*14)=31-28=3

i=2:

s=31-15=16

s2=14-15=-1

x+i=1+2=3<=6, s2 += elements[-3]=7 => s2=6

pos.append(16 - 12)=4

i=3:

s=16-7=9

s2=6-7=-1

x+i=1+3=4<=6, s2 += elements[-4]=3 => s2=2

pos.append(9-4)=5

i=4:

s=9-3=6

s2=2-3=-1

x+i=1+4=5<=6, s2 += elements[-5]=3 => s2=2

pos.append(6-4)=2

i=5:

s=6-3=3

s2=2-3=-1

x+i=1+5=6<=6, s2 += elements[-6]=3 => s2=2

pos.append(3-4)=-1

i=6:

s=3-3=0

s2=2-3=-1

x+i=1+6=7>6, no addition

pos.append(0 - (-2))=2

So, pos=[-1,-1,3,4,5,2,2], maximum is 5, but in the output, it's 3.

Wait, but according to the problem's output, for this test case, the output is 3.

But according to this calculation, the maximum is 5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating s2.

Let's check again.

Initial s=63, s2=32

pos.append(63-64)=-1

i=1:

s=63-32=31

s2=32-32=-0 +15=15

pos.append(31-30)=1

Wait, no, earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, s2 = s2 - elements[-i] + elements[-(x+i)] if x+i <= n

Wait, in the code:

s2 -= elements[-i]

if x + i <= n:

s2 += elements[-(x + i)]

So, in i=1:

s2 = 32 - 32 + elements[-(1+1)=2] = 0 +15=15

pos.append(31 - 30)=1

i=2:

s2=15 -15 + elements[-(1+2)=3]=0 +7=7

pos.append(16 -14)=2

i=3:

s2=7 -7 + elements[-(1+3)=4]=0 +3=3

pos.append(9 -6)=3

i=4:

s2=3 -3, no addition since x+i=5>6

pos.append(6 - (-6))=12

Wait, no, s2=3-3=0, no addition

pos.append(6 - 0)=6

i=5:

s2=0 -3, but s2 can't be negative, maybe?

Wait, s2=0-3=-3, no addition

pos.append(3 - (-6))=9

i=6:

s2=-3-3=-6, no addition

pos.append(0 - (-12))=12

But in my earlier calculation, I had different values. Maybe I messed up.

But according to this, pos=[-1,1,2,3,6,9,12], maximum is 12, but the output is 3.

This is conflicting with the output given in the example.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case.

Wait, in the test case description:

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

Output: 3

But according to this calculation, it should be 12, but that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I misread the test case. Let me check the input again.

Looking back at the input:

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Output: 0

6 6 1

3 7 3 3 32 15

Output: 3

Wait, in the earlier calculation, I got pos=[-9,-11,-12,-10,-7,-5,-4], max=-4, but output is 0.

Wait, no, in the earlier calculation for n=6, k=6, x=3, a=[1,4,3,2,5,6], pos=[-9,-9,-8,-6,-3,-1,0], max=0, which matches output=0.

But for n=6, k=6, x=1, a=[3,7,3,3,32,15], according to my calculation, pos=[-1,1,2,3,6,9,12], max=12, but output is 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says "at most k elements", meaning Alice can remove from 0 to k elements.

So, in the func_2, it's considering removing 0 to k elements.

In the first iteration, removals=0, s=sum(a), s2=sum(top x elements)

Then, for removals=1 to k, s -= elements[-i], s2 -= elements[-i], and if x+i <=n, s2 += elements[-(x+i)]

Wait, but in the second test case, n=4, k=1, x=1, a=[3,1,2,4], output=2

According to the calculation:

sorted a=[1,2,3,4]

pos.append(10 - 2*4)=2

i=1:

s=6, s2=3, pos.append(6-6)=0

max(2,0)=2, which matches output=2

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=1, a=[3,7,3,3,32,15], sorted=[3,3,3,7,15,32]

pos.append(63 - 2*32)=-1

i=1:

s=63-32=31

s2=32-32 + elements[-2]=15 => s2=15

pos.append(31 - 30)=1

i=2:

s=31-15=16

s2=15-15 + elements[-3]=7 => s2=7

pos.append(16 - 14)=2

i=3:

s=16-7=9

s2=7-7 + elements[-4]=3 => s2=3

pos.append(9 - 6)=3

i=4:

s=9-3=6

s2=3-3, no addition since x+i=5>6

pos.append(6 - (-6))=12

i=5:

s=6-3=3

s2=0-3, no addition

pos.append(3 - (-6))=9

i=6:

s=3-3=0

s2=-3, no addition

pos.append(0 - (-6))=6

So, pos=[-1,1,2,3,12,9,6], max=12, but output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"at most k elements", "at most x elements"

So, Alice can choose to remove fewer than k elements, and Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

But in the code, it seems to assume that Bob will flip exactly x elements.

Wait, but the problem says "at most x elements", so Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

But in the code, it seems to consider flipping exactly x elements.

Wait, perhaps that's the issue.

Looking back at the code:

pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))

This assumes that Bob flips exactly x elements.

But according to the problem, Bob can flip at most x elements.

So, Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements to minimize the sum.

Therefore, the code might be incorrect because it assumes Bob flips exactly x elements.

Wait, but in the explanation of the second test case, Bob flips one element (the largest), which is correct.

In the first test case, Alice removes one element, and Bob can flip one element, but since there are no elements left, he can't flip anything.

Wait, no, in the first test case, Alice removes the only element, so the sum is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip fewer elements.

So, in general, Bob can choose to flip any number of elements up to x.

Therefore, for a given set of remaining elements after Alice's removal, Bob will choose to flip the top y elements, where y is between 0 and x, to minimize the sum.

So, the sum would be sum_remaining - 2 * sum(top_y_elements), where y is chosen to minimize this sum.

But how does y minimize the sum?

Wait, sum_remaining - 2 * sum(top_y_elements)

To minimize this, since sum_remaining is fixed, and we subtract 2 times sum of top y elements, Bob wants to make this subtraction as large as possible, meaning y should be x, the maximum allowed.

Wait, but that would make the sum smaller.

Wait, no, wait: sum_remaining - 2 * sum(top_y_elements)

sum
