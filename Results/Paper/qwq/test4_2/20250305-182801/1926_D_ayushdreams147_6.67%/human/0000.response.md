Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values from the 1st to the 31st bit. Essentially, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. If two numbers are in the same group, their binary representations must differ in all bit positions from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for each pair of numbers in a group, their bitwise AND should be zero because if any bit is set in both numbers, their AND would have that bit set to 1, which violates the condition.

Wait, actually, that's not quite right. If two numbers have the same bit in any position, their AND in that position would be 1, which is not allowed. So, for the condition to hold, no two numbers in the same group should have any bit set to the same value in any of the 31 positions.

Hmm, that seems tricky. Let me think differently. Maybe I can look at this from the perspective of bitwise XOR. If two numbers have different bits in all positions, their XOR would have all bits set to 1 because XOR is 1 when the bits differ and 0 when they are the same. So, if two numbers have different bits in all positions, their XOR should be all 1's in the 31 least significant bits.

Wait, but that's not exactly correct either. If two numbers differ in all bits, their XOR would indeed be all 1's. But the condition is that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit in any position from 1 to 31. So, for any pair in a group, their bitwise AND should be zero in these positions.

Actually, re-reading the problem, it says: "any two numbers in the same group must have x_2(i) != y_2(i) for all 1 <= i < 32." That means, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits of x and y must be different.

So, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise XOR for these 31 bits must be all 1's, meaning that they differ in all bit positions.

This seems similar to error-correcting codes where you want codewords to be maximally different.

Now, I need to find the minimum number of groups such that in each group, no two numbers have the same bit in any of the 31 positions.

This sounds like a graph coloring problem where each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they violate the condition, i.e., if they have the same bit in any of the 31 positions. Then, the minimum number of groups is the chromatic number of this graph.

However, constructing such a graph explicitly would be inefficient for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way to compute this without building a massive graph.

Let's think about the properties of the numbers. Since the condition is based on the bits being different in all positions from 1 to 31, maybe there's a way to group numbers based on some property of their bits.

Wait a minute, if two numbers differ in all 31 bits, that's a very strict condition. It's like saying that for any two numbers in a group, their bitwise difference is all 1's.

But perhaps there's a better way to look at this.

Let's consider the bitwise NOT operation. If I take a number and flip all its bits in the 31 positions, I get its complement in those bits.

If I have a number x, its complement would be x ^ ((1 << 31) - 1), assuming 31 bits.

Wait, (1 << 31) - 1 is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

So, x ^ ((1 << 31) - 1) would flip all the bits in the 31 least significant bits of x.

Now, if I have two numbers x and y, and y is the complement of x (y = x ^ ((1 << 31) - 1)), then x and y differ in all 31 bits.

So, x and y would satisfy the condition to be in the same group.

But, if I have a third number z that is different from both x and y, I need to check if z can be in the same group as x and y.

Wait, but x and y are complements, and z is different from both. For z to be in the same group as x, z must differ from x in all 31 bits, and similarly, z must differ from y in all 31 bits.

But y is the complement of x, so y differs from x in all bits.

Now, if z differs from x in all bits, and z differs from y in all bits, but y is the complement of x, so z would have to be something that differs from both x and its complement in all bits.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps it's only possible to have two numbers in a group: a number and its complement.

Because any third number would have to differ from both in all bits, which might not be possible.

Let me check with an example.

Suppose n=4, and the numbers are 1, 4, 3, 4.

First, let's look at their binary representations.

Assuming 31 bits, but for simplicity, let's look at their last 31 bits.

1 is 000...00001

4 is 000...00100

3 is 000...00011

4 is 000...00100

So, we have two 4's.

Now, let's see if any two of these can be in the same group.

Looking at 1 and 4:

1 is 000...00001

4 is 000...00100

Their bitwise AND is 000...00000, since no bit is set in both.

Wait, but the condition is that for all 1 <= i < 32, x_2(i) != y_2(i).

In this case, for bit position 1, x_2(1) = 1 and y_2(1) = 0, which are different.

For bit position 3, x_2(3) = 0 and y_2(3) = 1, which are different.

All other bits are 0 in both, so x_2(i) != y_2(i) holds for all i.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the first test case, it says that each number needs its own group, implying that no two numbers can be in the same group.

But according to my analysis, 1 and 4 seem to satisfy the condition.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Looking back, it says: "for any two numbers in the same group, x_2(i) != y_2(i) must hold for all 1 <= i < 32."

In the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

From the explanation, it says: "In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits."

Wait, that doesn't seem right. 1,4,3,4 have different binary representations.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the sample input and output.

Looking back:

Sample Output:

So, for the first test case with n=4 and numbers 1,4,3,4, the output is 4, meaning each number needs its own group.

But according to my earlier analysis, 1 and 4 seem to satisfy the condition to be in the same group.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x_2(i) != y_2(i) for all 1 <= i < 32."

So, for all bit positions from 1 to 31, the bits of x and y must be different.

In the first test case, numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Let's look at their binary representations:

1: 000...00001

4: 000...00100

3: 000...00011

4: 000...00100

Now, let's check pairwise:

1 and 4:

In bit position 1: 1 and 0 -> different

In bit position 2: 0 and 0 -> same

Wait, bit position 1 is the least significant bit.

Wait, according to the problem, bit 1 is the least significant bit.

So, for 1 (binary 1), bit 1 is 1, bit 2 is 0, and so on.

For 4 (binary 100), bit 1 is 0, bit 3 is 1.

So, comparing 1 and 4:

bit 1: 1 vs 0 -> different

bit 2: 0 vs 0 -> same

Wait, but the condition requires that for all i from 1 to 31, x_2(i) != y_2(i).

So, since in bit position 2, both have 0, which is the same, they do not satisfy the condition.

Therefore, 1 and 4 cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 1 and 3:

1: 000...00001

3: 000...00011

bit 1: 1 vs 1 -> same

bit 2: 0 vs 1 -> different

Since in bit position 1, both have 1, they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 4 and 3:

4: 000...00100

3: 000...00011

bit 1: 0 vs 1 -> different

bit 2: 0 vs 1 -> different

bit 3: 1 vs 0 -> different

So, 4 and 3 can be in the same group.

Wait, but according to the sample output, each number is in its own group, i.e., 4 groups.

But according to this, 4 and 3 can be in the same group.

Wait, maybe there's another number that conflicts.

Wait, there are two 4's.

So, let's check 4 and 4:

4 and 4 have the same bits in all positions, so they cannot be in the same group.

So, even if 4 and 3 can be in the same group, the two 4's cannot be in the same group as each other.

Therefore, we need at least three groups: one for 1, one for 3 and one of the 4's, and another for the other 4.

But the sample output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says: "each number must fall into exactly one group."

And the condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st.

In the first test case, the explanation says: "In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need to place each number in its own group."

Wait, that can't be right because 1,4,3,4 don't all have the same last 31 bits.

1 is 000...00001

4 is 000...00100

3 is 000...00011

4 is 000...00100

They don't all have the same bits.

Maybe the explanation means that any two numbers have at least one matching bit.

Indeed, 1 and 4 have bit 2 matching (both 0).

1 and 3 have bit 1 matching (both 1).

4 and 3 have no bits matching.

Wait, 4 and 3 have bit 1: 0 vs 1, bit 2: 0 vs 1, bit 3: 1 vs 0 -> all bits different.

So, 4 and 3 can be in the same group.

But 4 and 4 cannot be in the same group because all bits are the same.

Similarly, 1 and 1 could be in the same group only if their bits are all different, which is not possible since they are the same.

But in this case, there are no duplicates except for the two 4's.

Wait, but in the input, there are two 4's.

So, we need to place each 4 in separate groups.

Also, 1 cannot be in the same group as 3 because 1 and 3 have bit 1 both set to 1.

Similarly, 1 cannot be in the same group as 4 because they have bit 2 both set to 0.

So, 1 cannot be in a group with anyone else.

3 can be in a group with one of the 4's, but not both, because the two 4's cannot be in the same group.

Therefore, we need at least four groups: one for 1, one for 3, one for the first 4, and one for the second 4.

Hence, the sample output is 4.

So, the condition is very strict: no two numbers in the same group can have any bit in common from bits 1 to 31.

This seems similar to assigning variables to different registers in a way that no two variables share the same bit, meaning their bitwise AND is zero for those bits.

But in this problem, it's stronger: no two numbers can have the same bit set in any position from 1 to 31.

Wait, no, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits must be different.

In other words, x & y == 0 for all pairs in the same group, but more strictly, x ^ y == (1 << 31) - 1, meaning all bits are different.

Wait, no.

Actually, x ^ y == (1 << 31) - 1 would mean that all 31 bits are different.

But the condition is that for all i from 1 to 31, x_2(i) != y_2(i), which is equivalent to x ^ y having all bits set to 1 in positions 1 to 31.

So, x ^ y == (1 << 31) - 1.

Therefore, two numbers can be in the same group if and only if their XOR is equal to a number with all 31 bits set to 1.

In other words, they are complements of each other in these 31 bits.

Given that, for each number, there is only one other number that can be in the same group as it, which is its complement.

Therefore, numbers can be paired with their complements in the same group.

But, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, we need an efficient way to group them.

So, for each number, find its complement and group them together.

However, in the first test case, 1 and 4 are not complements:

1 is 000...00001

4 is 000...00100

Their XOR is 000...00101, which is not all 1's.

The complement of 1 would be (1 << 31) - 1 ^ 1, which is all 1's except the least significant bit.

Wait, let's compute it.

Let mask = (1 << 31) - 1, which is all 31 bits set to 1.

Then, complement of x is x ^ mask.

So, for x=1, complement is mask ^ 1.

Similarly, for x=4, complement is mask ^ 4.

Now, in the first test case, numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Let's compute their complements:

1: mask ^ 1

4: mask ^ 4

3: mask ^ 3

4: mask ^ 4

Now, mask is a number with all 31 bits set to 1.

So, mask ^ 1 would flip the least significant bit.

Similarly, mask ^ 4 would flip the 3rd bit.

Now, according to the condition, two numbers can be in the same group if one is the complement of the other.

So, in this test case, we have:

1 and mask^1

4 and mask^4

3 and mask^3

4 and mask^4

But since mask^4 is unique for each number, unless two numbers are complements of each other, they cannot be in the same group.

In this case, none of the numbers are complements of each other, because if we have x and x^mask in the list, but in this case, 1,4,3,4, none of them are complements of each other.

Therefore, each number needs its own group, hence the output is 4.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I thought 4 and 3 could be in the same group because their bits are all different, but actually, their XOR is not equal to mask.

Wait, let's check:

4 is 000...00100

3 is 000...00011

XOR: 000...00111, which is not equal to mask (all 31 bits set to 1).

Wait, mask is (1 << 31) - 1, which is all 31 bits set to 1.

So, for 31 bits, mask is 0b111...111 (31 ones).

But in the XOR of 4 and 3, which is 0b000...00111, which is not equal to mask.

Therefore, 4 and 3 are not complements of each other, so they cannot be in the same group.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 4 and 3 differ in all bits, but actually, they don't differ in all 31 bits; they only differ in the first three bits, and the rest are zero in both.

Wait, assuming leading zeros, in all 31 bits, they have zeros in many positions, so their XOR would have zeros in those positions, which is not equal to mask.

Therefore, they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, each number needs its own group.

Okay, now I understand why the first test case requires 4 groups.

So, the general approach is:

- For each number, find its complement (x ^ mask).

- If the complement is not present in the list, then this number needs its own group.

- If the complement is present, then they can be in the same group.

- Each such pair (x, x^mask) forms a group of size 2.

- If a number appears multiple times, and its complement also appears multiple times, we need to pair them accordingly.

Wait, but in the first test case, none of the numbers have their complements in the list, so each number needs its own group.

In the second test case:

n=2

a=[0, 2147483647]

2147483647 is 111...111 in 31 bits (all bits set to 1).

0 is 000...000.

Their XOR is 111...111, which is equal to mask.

Therefore, they can be in the same group.

Hence, output is 1.

In the third test case:

n=5

a=[476319172, 261956880, 2136179468, 1671164475, 1885526767]

Need to check if any two numbers are complements of each other.

Let's assume that some pairs are complements and some are not.

If there are two pairs that are complements and one number without a complement, then we need 3 groups.

Hence, the output is 3.

Similarly, for other test cases.

So, the general algorithm is:

- For each test case, iterate through the numbers.

- For each number, compute its complement (x ^ mask).

- If the complement is seen before, they can be in the same group.

- If not, start a new group for this number.

- To implement this efficiently, use a set to keep track of seen complements.

But need to be careful with duplicates.

Wait, but in the first test case, there are two 4's.

Their complements are the same, but since two 4's cannot be in the same group, we need to assign each to different groups.

Hence, we need to keep track of how many of each complement we have.

So, a better approach is:

- Create a frequency map of the numbers.

- For each number, compute its complement.

- If the complement is in the frequency map and has not been assigned yet, pair them into one group.

- Otherwise, assign the number to a new group.

- Need to keep track of which numbers have been assigned to groups.

But this might be complicated with frequencies.

An easier way is to realize that each pair of a number and its complement forms a group of size 2.

Any unpaired numbers need their own groups.

Hence, for each test case, count the number of unpaired numbers and the number of pairs.

The total number of groups is the number of unpaired numbers plus the number of pairs.

But need to handle frequencies correctly.

Wait, but in the first test case, none of the numbers have their complements in the list, so all numbers are unpaired and need their own groups.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, so they form one group.

In the third test case, suppose there are three numbers where one pair is complements and one is not, then total groups are 3.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- For each test case:

- Read n and the list a.

- Initialize a set to keep track of assigned numbers.

- Initialize a counter for the number of groups.

- For each number in a:

- If it's already assigned, continue.

- Else, check if its complement is in a.

- If it is, pair them and mark both as assigned, increment group counter by 1.

- If not, assign this number to a new group, mark it as assigned, increment group counter by 1.

- Output the group counter.

But to implement this efficiently for large n, we need an efficient way to check if a complement exists and to handle frequencies.

A better way is to use a frequency dictionary:

- Create a frequency dictionary for a.

- Initialize a set to keep track of visited numbers.

- For each number in a:

- If it's already visited, continue.

- Else, compute its complement.

- If the complement is in the frequency dictionary and has not been visited:

- If the frequency of the number and its complement allows, pair them and mark them as visited.

- Increment group counter by 1.

- Else:

- Assign the number to a new group, mark it as visited.

- Increment group counter by 1.

But need to handle frequencies correctly.

Wait, here's a better idea.

- For each number, if its complement is present in the list, they can be in the same group.

- Each such pair reduces the group count by 1 compared to counting each individually.

- So, for each pair of a number and its complement, they can be in one group.

- Unpaired numbers need their own groups.

Hence, the minimum number of groups is equal to the total number of numbers minus the number of pairs.

Which is n - number_of_pairs.

Number of pairs is half the number of numbers that have their complement present.

But need to handle frequencies properly.

Wait, to handle frequencies, for each number, if its complement is present, they can be in the same group.

But if a number appears multiple times, and its complement also appears multiple times, we can pair them accordingly.

So, for each pair of x and its complement, we can put them in one group.

Any remaining unpaired numbers need their own groups.

Hence, the number of groups is equal to the number of unpaired numbers plus the number of pairs.

But since each pair reduces the group count by 1 (as two numbers are in one group), the total groups are n - number_of_pairs.

But to maximize the number of pairs, we need to pair as many complements as possible.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is ceil(n / 2), but in this problem, it's not necessarily ceil(n / 2) because some numbers might not have their complements.

Wait, no, to minimize the number of groups, we want to maximize the number of pairs.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs, where number_of_pairs is the number of pairs we can form where each pair consists of a number and its complement.

But actually, no, because each pair reduces the group count by 1 compared to n individual groups.

Wait, let's think in terms of graph coloring.

Each number is a node.

An edge exists between two nodes if they cannot be in the same group, i.e., if they are not complements.

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, the condition is that in a group, any two numbers must have all bits different, which is only true if they are complements.

Hence, only two numbers that are complements can be in the same group.

Hence, it's like each pair of complements can be in one group, and any unpaired numbers need their own groups.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is the total number of numbers minus the number of pairs we can form.

Each pair consists of a number and its complement.

So, it's n - number_of_pairs.

But to maximize number_of_pairs, we need to pair as many complements as possible.

Hence, it's similar to counting the number of pairs in a set where each pair is a number and its complement.

To implement this efficiently, we can:

- Create a frequency dictionary.

- Initialize a counter for pairs to 0.

- For each number in the frequency dictionary:

- Compute its complement.

- If the complement is in the frequency dictionary and has not been assigned yet:

- Pair them, decrement their frequencies, increment pairs counter.

- Finally, the number of groups is n - pairs.

But need to handle the frequencies correctly.

Also, since pairing x and its complement reduces the group count by 1, as they share one group instead of two.

Wait, actually, if you have a pair, they share one group, so instead of two groups, it's one group.

Hence, for each pair, you save one group.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is n - number_of_pairs.

Yes, that makes sense.

Hence, to minimize the number of groups, maximize the number of pairs.

Hence, iterate through the frequency dictionary, pair each number with its complement if available, and count the pairs.

Finally, the number of groups is n - pairs.

This should work efficiently.

Now, looking back at the given code:

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

return res

This seems to be attempting to implement the pairing logic.

It uses a dictionary to keep track of counts.

For each number, it checks if its complement is already in the count dictionary.

If not, it adds the complement to the count dictionary.

If yes, it decrements the count of the complement.

And it increments the result counter each time it sees a new number.

But I'm not entirely sure if this logic is correct.

Let me test it with the first test case.

First test case:

n=4

a=[1,4,3,4]

mask = (1 << 31) - 1

complement of 1 is mask ^ 1

complement of 4 is mask ^ 4

complement of 3 is mask ^ 3

complement of 4 is mask ^ 4

Assuming mask is all 31 bits set to 1.

Now, in the code:

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[num ^ mask] = count.get(num ^ mask, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

So, for num=1:

1 not in count, so count[mask ^ 1] = 1

res = 1

for num=4:

4 not in count, so count[mask ^ 4] = 1

res = 2

for num=3:

3 not in count, so count[mask ^ 3] = 1

res = 3

for num=4:

4 in count, so count[4] -= 1

But count[4] was set to 1 in the previous step, so now it's 0

res remains 3

Hence, res=3, but the sample output is 4.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis,
