Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of substrings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], right?

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string into substrings, none of which are palindromes. If such a partition exists, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition, and then the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should output "NO".

Looking at the constraints, there can be up to 10^4 test cases, and each string can be up to 10^6 characters long, with a total sum of |s| across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. So, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably linear time per test case.

Let me think about when a partition into non-palindromic substrings is possible.

Case 1: The entire string is not a palindrome. In this case, the simplest partition is the string itself, which is not a palindrome. So, I can just output "YES", 1, and the string itself.

Case 2: The entire string is a palindrome. Then, I need to split it into smaller substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, if all possible substrings are palindromes, then it's impossible to have such a partition. For example, if the string is "aaa", every possible substring is a palindrome: "a", "aa", "aaa". So, in this case, I should output "NO".

Wait, in the example provided, for "lllllllll", the output is "NO", which makes sense because any substring of "l"s is a palindrome.

But, for "uwuowouwu", it's possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, as shown in the example output.

So, the key is to identify if the string consists of repeating characters such that every substring is a palindrome, in which case it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it should be possible to partition it in such a way that at least some substrings are not palindromes.

Wait, but in the second test case, "lllllllll", every possible substring is a palindrome because all characters are the same. So, it's impossible to have a partition where all parts are non-palindromic, since single 'l's are palindromes, "ll" is a palindrome, "lll" is a palindrome, and so on.

In contrast, "uwuowouwu" has mixed characters, so it's possible to create substrings that are not palindromes.

So, perhaps the general rule is: if all characters in the string are identical, then it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, because any substring will consist of identical characters and hence be a palindrome.

Otherwise, if there is at least one character that is different from another, then it's possible to create substrings that are not palindromes.

Wait, but that might not be entirely accurate. For example, consider "aabaa". The entire string is a palindrome, but if I partition it into "a", "ab", "a", "a", then "ab" is not a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome. So, this partition doesn't satisfy the condition.

But, I could partition it into "aab", "aa", where "aab" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, "aa", "ba", "a", where "ba" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is.

Hmm, seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that all parts of the partition are not palindromes.

So, in the case where all characters are the same, it's impossible to have any substring that is not a palindrome, since any substring of identical characters is a palindrome.

In the case where there are different characters, I should be able to find a partition where each substring is not a palindrome.

But, perhaps there are cases where even with different characters, it's impossible.

Wait, for example, "abba". The entire string is a palindrome, "ab" and "ba" are both not palindromes.

So, partitioning into "ab" and "ba" would work.

Another example, "aabb". Partitioning into "aa", "bb" would have "aa" and "bb" as palindromes, which is not allowed.

But, partitioning into "aab", "b" would have "aab" (not palindrome) and "b" (palindrome). Not acceptable.

Alternatively, "a", "abb". "a" is palindrome, "abb" is not. Still not acceptable.

Wait, "aa", "b", "b". "aa" is palindrome, which is not allowed.

Hmm, seems like for "aabb", it's impossible to partition it into substrings that are all not palindromes.

Wait, but according to the problem, in the second test case "lllllllll", the output is "NO", which makes sense.

But for "aabb", it seems similar to "lllllllll" in that any substring containing only 'a's or only 'b's is a palindrome.

Wait, but in "aabb", if I take "aab" and "b", "aab" is not a palindrome, and "b" is a palindrome.

Not acceptable.

If I take "a", "abb", "a" is palindrome.

If I take "aa", "b", "b", "aa" is palindrome.

If I take "a", "a", "b", "b", all are palindromes.

Seems like it's impossible to partition "aabb" into substrings that are all not palindromes.

But according to the problem's example, for "uwuowouwu", it's possible.

So, perhaps the general rule is: if the string consists of repeated identical characters, like "aaaaa" or "bb", then it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, because any substring will be a palindrome.

Otherwise, if there is any variation in characters, it's possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in "aabb", it's impossible, even though there is variation.

Wait, perhaps it's when all substrings are palindromes.

Wait, in "aabb", "ab" is not a palindrome, but to partition "aabb" into non-palindromic substrings, I would need to find a way to have all parts not be palindromes.

But, "aabb" can be partitioned into "aab", "b". "aab" is not a palindrome, "b" is a palindrome. Not acceptable.

Alternatively, "a", "abb". "a" is palindrome, "abb" is not. Still not acceptable.

"aa", "bb". Both are palindromes. Not acceptable.

"aaa", "b". "aaa" is palindrome, "b" is palindrome. Not acceptable.

Seems like it's impossible for "aabb".

But in the problem's example, "lllllllll" is impossible, which makes sense.

Wait, perhaps the rule is: if the string consists of only one distinct character, then it's impossible, because any substring is a palindrome.

Otherwise, it's possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

But, in "aabb", there are two distinct characters, but it seems impossible.

Wait, maybe it's when all characters are the same, or when the string is composed of repeated palindromic substrings.

This is getting complicated.

Looking back at the problem's example, "lllllllll" is all 'l's, so "NO".

"uwuowouwu" has mixed characters, so "YES".

Another example in the note is "uwuowouwu" partitioned into ["uw", "uow", "ouwu"], and "uw" is not a palindrome, "uow" is not a palindrome, "ouwu" is not a palindrome.

So, seems like if there's variation in characters, it's possible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

But, in "aabb", it seems impossible.

Wait, maybe it's possible to partition "aabb" into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, "aab" and "b". "aab" is not a palindrome, "b" is a palindrome. Not acceptable.

"aa", "ab", "b". "aa" is palindrome, which is not allowed.

"a", "ab", "b". "a" is palindrome, which is not allowed.

Seems like no valid partition exists for "aabb".

But according to the problem's example, for "lllllllll", which is all identical characters, "NO" is outputted.

So, perhaps the rule is: if all characters are identical, output "NO"; otherwise, output "YES" with some partition.

But, in "aabb", even though there are two distinct characters, it's impossible to partition into non-palindrimic substrings.

Wait, but in "aab", it's possible: "aab" is not a palindrome, so partitioning into ["aab"] is valid.

Wait, "aab" is not a palindrome, because "aab" reversed is "baa", which is different.

So, in this case, partitioning into ["aab"] is valid.

But in "aabb", "aabb" reversed is "bbaa", which is different, so ["aabb"] is a valid partition.

Wait, no, "aabb" reversed is "bbaa", which is not the same as "aabb", so "aabb" is not a palindrome.

Therefore, partitioning into ["aabb"] is valid, and "YES" should be outputted.

But earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, the whole string is not a palindrome, so partitioning into the whole string is valid.

Wait, but "aabb" is not a palindrome, because "aabb" != "bbaa".

Wait, hold on, is "aabb" a palindrome?

A palindrome should be the same forwards and backwards.

"aabb" backwards is "bbaa", which is different from "aabb", so "aabb" is not a palindrome.

Therefore, partitioning into ["aabb"] is valid, and "YES" should be outputted.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, it's possible.

So, perhaps the general rule is: if the entire string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with partition [s]; otherwise, check if there exists a way to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes.

If the entire string is a palindrome, then try to find a partition where each substring is not a palindrome.

But, if all possible substrings are palindromes, then output "NO".

Wait, but in "aabb", which is not a palindrome, it's possible to output ["aabb"].

In "lllllllll", which is a palindrome, and all substrings are palindromes, output "NO".

In "aab", which is not a palindrome, output ["aab"].

In "aa", which is a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome, so cannot partition into non-palindromic substrings, so "NO".

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome, and any substring "a" is a palindrome, so indeed, "NO".

So, perhaps the rule is: if the entire string is not a palindrome, output ["s"]; else, if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, output a partition using that substring.

But in "aa", all substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

In "aabb", the entire string is not a palindrome, so output ["aabb"].

In "aab", the entire string is not a palindrome, so output ["aab"].

In "lllllllll", the entire string is a palindrome, and all substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

In "uwuowouwu", the entire string is not a palindrome, so output ["uwuowouwu"].

But in the sample output, it's partitioned into ["uw", "uow", "ouwu"], but actually, ["uwuowouwu"] should also be acceptable, as it's not a palindrome.

So, perhaps the simplest way is: if the entire string is not a palindrome, output ["s"]; else, try to find a partition where each substring is not a palindrome.

But in cases where the entire string is a palindrome, and all possible substrings are palindromes, output "NO".

Otherwise, find a way to partition it.

But, in practice, for strings that are palindromes, it's often possible to partition them into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, for example, "abba" is a palindrome, but partitioning into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

Wait, "ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome, so ["ab", "ba"] is a valid partition.

Similarly, "aabaa" is a palindrome, but can be partitioned into "aab", "aa", where "aab" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "aa", "ba", "a", where "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Or "a", "aba", "a", where "aba" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Wait, is there a way to partition "aabaa" into non-palindromic substrings?

Let's see: "a", "ab", "aa", but "a" and "aa" are palindromes.

"aab", "aa", "aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

"a", "abaa", "a" is a palindrome.

"aab", "a", "a", "aab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Seems tricky.

Wait, maybe "aaba", "a", "aaba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Hmm.

Alternatively, "aabaa" can be partitioned into "a", "ab", "a", "a", but "a" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, "aab", "aa", "aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

Seems like it's impossible to partition "aabaa" into non-palindromic substrings.

So, in this case, the answer should be "NO".

But according to the earlier logic, if the entire string is a palindrome, and it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, output "NO".

Otherwise, output "YES" with a possible partition.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with partition [s].

- Else, if the string is a palindrome, check if there exists a way to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes.

- To do this, look for a substring that is not a palindrome, and partition the string accordingly.

- If no such substring exists, output "NO".

But, in "aabaa", which is a palindrome, and it seems impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, so "NO".

In "abba", which is a palindrome, but can be partitioned into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes, so "YES".

So, how to determine if a palindrome string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings?

Perhaps, if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

In "abba", "ab" is not a palindrome, so we can partition into "ab" and "ba".

In "aabaa", no substring is not a palindrome, so it's impossible.

Wait, is that true? Let's check.

In "aabaa", possible substrings:

- "a": palindrome

- "aa": palindrome

- "aab": not a palindrome

- "aba": palindrome

- "baa": not a palindrome

- "aabaa": palindrome

So, "aab" is not a palindrome, and "baa" is not a palindrome.

So, why couldn't I partition "aabaa" into non-palindromic substrings earlier?

Wait, perhaps I can partition "aabaa" into "aab", "aa".

But "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "a", "ab", "aa", "a".

"ab" is not a palindrome, but "a" and "aa" are palindromes.

Another way, "aab", "a", "a".

"aab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Not acceptable.

Alternatively, "a", "abaa".

"a" is a palindrome.

"aa", "aba".

"aa" is palindrome, "aba" is palindrome.

"aab", "aa".

"aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is palindrome.

Seems like no partition exists where all parts are non-palindromic.

Hence, "NO".

But according to the earlier logic, since there exists a substring that is not a palindrome ("aab" and "baa"), perhaps there's a way to partition it.

But apparently, in this case, it's still impossible.

So, perhaps the rule is: if the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, and all possible non-trivial substrings are palindromes, then output "NO"; else, output "YES" with a possible partition.

Wait, but in "aabaa", "aab" and "baa" are not palindromes, so perhaps there's a way to partition it.

Wait, maybe I can partition "aabaa" into "aab", "a", "a".

But "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "a", "abaa".

"a" is palindrome.

"aa", "aba", "a".

"aa" is palindrome.

"aab", "aa".

"aab" is not palindrome, "aa" is palindrome.

Seems like no valid partition exists.

So, perhaps the rule is: if the string is a palindrome and has substrings that are not palindromes, but no partition exists where all parts are non-palindromes, then "NO".

But this seems too vague.

Maybe a better approach is:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with partition [s].

- Else, if the entire string is a palindrome, try to find two substrings such that neither is a palindrome.

- If such a partition exists, output "YES" with that partition; else, output "NO".

In "abba", which is a palindrome, I can partition it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes, so "YES".

In "aabaa", which is a palindrome, but no partition exists where all parts are non-palindromes, so "NO".

In "aa", which is a palindrome, and all possible substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

In "a", which is a palindrome, and the only possible substring is "a", which is a palindrome, so "NO".

In "aab", which is not a palindrome, output "YES" with partition ["aab"].

In "aabb", which is not a palindrome, output "YES" with partition ["aabb"].

In "lllllllll", which is a palindrome, and all substrings are palindromes, so "NO".

Seems consistent with the sample input and output.

So, in code, I need to:

1. Check if the string is not a palindrome. If not, output "YES" with partition [s].

2. If the string is a palindrome, check if there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome.

- If such a substring exists, try to partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes.

- If no such substring exists, output "NO".

But, in "aabaa", there exist substrings that are not palindromes, but still, no valid partition exists.

Hmm, maybe I need a better way to check if a partition into non-palindromic substrings is possible when the entire string is a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps if the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 2, and all characters are the same, then output "NO"; else, try to partition it.

But in "aabaa", which is a palindrome, but not all characters are the same, and it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, that rule doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps if the string is a palindrome and contains at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], then it's possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings; else, "NO".

Wait, in "aabaa", which is a palindrome, but s[1] != s[2] ('a' != 'b'), but still, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps that's not sufficient.

Wait, maybe if the string is a palindrome and has at least one character that's different from the first character, then it's possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aabaa", which is a palindrome, and has 'b' which is different from 'a', but still, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps it's impossible to partition a palindrome string into non-palindromic substrings only when all characters are the same.

In "aabaa", which is a palindrome, but characters are not all the same, yet it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in "abba", which is a palindrome, and characters are not all the same, and it's possible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

So, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe it's impossible only when the string is a palindrome and for some k, the string is composed of repeated palindromic blocks of length k.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to look for a substring that is not a palindrome and see if I can partition the string around that.

In "abba", which is a palindrome, "ab" is not a palindrome, so I can partition into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "aabaa", which is a palindrome, "aab" is not a palindrome, but any partition involving "aab" will have another part that is a palindrome, like "aa", which is a palindrome.

Hence, it's impossible.

So, perhaps the rule is: if the string is a palindrome, and all possible partitions result in at least one palindrome, then "NO"; else, "YES".

But checking all possible partitions is not efficient.

I need a better way to determine this.

Wait, perhaps if the string is a palindrome and has at least one character that is different from the first character, and the substring from that character to the end is not a palindrome, then I can partition accordingly.

But this seems too convoluted.

Looking at the code provided:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_2()

def func_1(s) -> bool:

return s == s[::-1]

def func_2():

s = input()

(n, x) = (len(s), -1)

if func_1(s[0:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(s)

return

for i in range(1, n):

if s[i] != s[0]:

x = i

break

if x == -1:

print('NO')

return

if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])

elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])

So, the code does the following:

- Read the number of test cases.

- For each test case, read the string s.

- Define a function func_1 that checks if a string is a palindrome.

- In func_2:

- If s is not a palindrome, output "YES", 1, and s.

- Else, find the first index x where s[x] != s[0].

- If no such index exists, output "NO".

- Else, check if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome.

- If it's not a palindrome, output "YES", 2, and partition s into s[:x+1] and s[x+1:].

- Else, if x == 1 or x == n//2, output "NO".

- Else, output "YES", 2, and partition s into s[:x+2] and s[x+2:].

So, it's trying to partition the string into two parts:

- The first part is from the start to the first character that's different from the first character, inclusive.

- The second part is the rest of the string.

And check if at least one of these parts is not a palindrome.

But according to our earlier analysis, in "aabaa", which is a palindrome, and s[1] != s[0], so x =1.

Then, s[x+1:] = s[2:] = "baa", which is not a palindrome.

So, it would output "YES", 2, and partition into s[:2] = "aa" (which is a palindrome, which is invalid).

Wait, but according to the code, it checks if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome.

In this case, s[x+1:] = "baa", which is not a palindrome.

But s[:x+1] = s[:2] = "aa", which is a palindrome, which is invalid.

So, this partition is invalid because one part is a palindrome.

But the code would output it as a valid partition, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is flawed.

Wait, but according to the code, in this case, it would print s[:x+1] and s[x+1:], which are "aa" and "baa".

"aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

So, this is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is intended to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

But in this case, "aa" is a palindrome, which makes the partition invalid.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, let's see what the code actually does.

In the else clause, it checks if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome.

If it is not a palindrome, it outputs s[:x+1] and s[x+1:].

But s[:x+1] might be a palindrome, which would make the partition invalid.

Hence, the code can output invalid partitions.

Therefore, it's incorrect.

Moreover, in the sample input, for "sinktheyacht", which is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES", 1, "sinktheyacht".

For "lllllllll", which is a palindrome, and all characters are the same, it would find no x where s[x] != s[0], so it outputs "NO", which is correct.

For "uwuowouwu", which is not a palindrome, it would output "YES", 1, "uwuowouwu", but the sample output shows a different partition, which is also acceptable, but outputting 1 is acceptable as well.

However, in the case of "aabaa", which is a palindrome, and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, the code would find x=1, s[x+1:]="baa", which is not a palindrome, and output s[:2]="aa" (palindrome) and s[2:]="baa" (not palindrome), which is invalid.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
