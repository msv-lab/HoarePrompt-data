Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. I need to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. The goal is to minimize the number of cards I have in the end.

Let me think about how this operation affects the total number of cards. Every time I perform the operation, I remove k cards and add back k-1 cards. So, the net effect is reducing the number of cards by 1. That seems straightforward.

But wait, I can choose the numbers on the new cards. Maybe I can use this to set up more operations in the future. For example, if I have multiple groups of cards with the same number, I might be able to chain operations to reduce the total number further.

Let me consider a simple example. Suppose n=5, k=3, and the cards are [4,1,1,4,4]. From the example, the answer is 2. Let's see how that works.

In this case, I have three 4's and two 1's. I can perform the operation on the three 4's: replace them with two cards of any number. Let's say I choose to make them two 1's. Now, my hand is [1,1,1]. Now, I can perform the operation again: choose three 1's and replace them with two cards of any number. But wait, I only have three cards, and k=3, so I can perform the operation once more, reducing it to two cards.

So, starting with five cards, I performed two operations, each reducing the total by one, ending up with three cards, but according to the example, it's two. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the first operation, I replaced the three 4's with two 1's. So, originally I had [4,1,1,4,4]. After replacing three 4's with two 1's, I have [1,1,1,1]. Wait, no, I had two original 1's and two new 1's, so [1,1,1,1]. Now, I can perform the operation again: choose three 1's and replace them with two 1's. So, I have [1,1,1] after the second operation. Then, I can perform it again to get [1,1]. So, indeed, ending up with two cards.

Okay, that makes sense. Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

But is this always the case? Let's consider another example. Suppose n=7, k=2, and cards are [4,2,1,100,5,2,3]. The answer is 1.

Wait, if k=2, each operation reduces the number of cards by one. Starting with 7 cards, if I can perform 6 operations, I can end up with 1 card.

But how? I need to have groups of two cards with the same number to perform the operation.

Looking at the cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3. There are two 2's and the rest are unique.

So, I can perform the operation on the two 2's, replacing them with one card of any number. Let's say I choose to make it a 1.

Now, my hand is [4,1,100,5,1,3]. Now, I have two 1's. I can perform the operation on these two 1's, replacing them with one card of any number, say 1.

Now, my hand is [4,100,5,1,3]. Now, all cards have unique numbers. I can't perform any more operations because there are no k=2 cards with the same number.

Wait, but according to the example, the answer is 1, but in this case, I'm left with five cards. That doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I can choose differently. Let's try again.

Starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3]. Perform the operation on the two 2's, replace them with one card, say a 4.

Now, my hand is [4,1,100,5,4,3]. Now, I have two 4's. I can perform the operation on these two 4's, replacing them with one card, say a 1.

Now, my hand is [1,100,5,3]. All cards are unique. I can't perform any more operations. Again, ending up with four cards, but the example says 1.

There must be something wrong with my approach.

Wait, perhaps I can choose the new cards in such a way that I create new pairs.

For example, after replacing the two 2's with one 4, I have [4,1,100,5,4,3]. Then, replace the two 4's with one 1.

Now, [1,100,5,3]. Again, no pairs left.

Alternatively, after replacing the two 2's with one 1, I have [4,1,100,5,1,3]. Then, replace the two 1's with one 1.

Now, [4,100,5,3]. Still four cards.

I must be missing something. Let's look at another example.

Take n=10, k=4, and all cards are 1. The answer is 3.

Starting with ten 1's. I can perform operations on groups of four 1's, replacing them with three 1's.

So, starting with ten 1's, perform two operations: first, choose four 1's and replace them with three 1's. Now, I have six 1's. Then, perform another operation: choose four 1's and replace them with three 1's. Now, I have five 1's. Wait, but the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps I can chain operations differently.

Starting with ten 1's.

First operation: choose four 1's, replace with three 1's. Now, I have six 1's.

Second operation: choose four 1's again, replace with three 1's. Now, I have five 1's.

Third operation: choose four 1's, replace with three 1's. Now, I have four 1's.

Fourth operation: choose four 1's, replace with three 1's. Now, I have three 1's.

So, four operations, reducing from ten to three cards.

That matches the example.

So, in this case, I was able to perform four operations, each reducing the total by one, from ten to six, then to five, then to four, then to three.

But in the previous example, I couldn't get down to one card.

Wait, but the second example has n=1, k=10, cards=[7]. The answer is 1.

But k=10, and n=1, so no operation can be performed because you need at least k=10 cards to perform an operation. So, the answer is indeed 1.

In the third example, n=7, k=2, cards=[4,2,1,100,5,2,3]. The answer is 1.

Wait, but in my earlier attempt, I ended up with four cards. How can I get down to one card?

Maybe I need to choose differently.

Starting with [4,2,1,100,5,2,3].

First, perform the operation on the two 2's, replacing them with one card, say a 4.

Now, hand is [4,1,100,5,4,3].

Now, perform the operation on the two 4's, replacing them with one card, say a 1.

Now, hand is [1,100,5,3].

Wait, no pairs left.

Alternatively, after replacing the two 2's with one 4, hand is [4,1,100,5,4,3].

Now, perform the operation on the two 4's, replacing them with one 1.

Now, hand is [1,100,5,3].

No pairs left.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the two 2's with two different numbers.

Wait, no, when you perform the operation, you replace k cards with k-1 cards of any numbers.

So, when replacing two 2's, I can choose to replace them with one card of any number, not necessarily two different numbers.

Wait, no, k=2, so you replace them with k-1=1 card.

So, it's one card.

But in this case, I still end up with four cards.

How can the answer be 1?

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I can perform operations in a way that I create new pairs.

Wait, let's think about the general strategy.

I need a way to minimize the number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, theoretically, I can perform up to n - m operations, where m is the number of distinct numbers that cannot form any more operations.

But I need a better way to think about this.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Let's say freq[x] is the frequency of number x in the hand.

For each number x, I can perform operations on groups of k cards with number x, replacing them with k-1 cards of any number.

I can choose the numbers on the new cards to potentially create new groups for future operations.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should look for a way to model this problem more mathematically.

Let me consider the hand as a multiset of numbers.

Each operation allows me to remove k cards of the same number and add k-1 cards of any numbers.

I need to minimize the total number of cards in the hand after any number of operations.

I need to find the smallest possible size of the hand.

I need to find a way to reduce the hand as much as possible.

Let me think about the constraints.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the minimum number of cards I can have is 0, but only if I can perform operations until no cards are left.

But in some cases, I can't reach 0.

For example, if I have n=1 and k=10, I can't perform any operations, so the minimum is 1.

In another case, if I have n=k, and all cards have the same number, I can perform one operation and replace them with k-1 cards.

Then, if I have k-1 cards, I can't perform any more operations because I need k cards to perform an operation.

So, the minimum is k-1.

Wait, but in the first example, n=5, k=3, and the answer is 2, which is less than k-1=2.

Wait, k-1=2, and the answer is 2, which matches.

Wait, but in the fourth example, n=10, k=4, and the answer is 3, which is less than k-1=3.

Wait, k-1=3, and the answer is 3, which matches.

In the third example, n=7, k=2, answer is 1, which is less than k-1=1.

Wait, k-1=1, and the answer is 1, which matches.

In the second example, n=1, k=10, answer is 1, which is greater than k-1=9.

Wait, but k-1=9 is greater than n=1, so the minimum is n=1.

Wait, perhaps the minimum is the maximum of (n - m*(k-1)), where m is the number of operations performed.

This seems messy.

Let me try to think differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the minimum number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

I need to maximize p.

Each operation requires k cards of the same number.

So, p is limited by the frequency of the most frequent number.

Wait, but I can perform operations on different numbers in sequence.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Let freq be a list of frequencies of each distinct number.

I need to perform operations on these frequencies.

Each operation on a frequency reduces it by k and adds k-1 to another frequency.

Wait, but I can choose the numbers on the new cards.

So, I can choose to add k-1 cards to any existing frequency or create new frequencies.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think in terms of borrowing from one frequency to another.

But that might not be helpful.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent frequencies, and edges represent the ability to perform operations.

But that might be overcomplicating.

Let me consider the total number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total by one.

So, the minimum number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

I need to maximize p.

To maximize p, I need to perform as many operations as possible.

Each operation requires k cards of the same number.

So, p is limited by the sum of floor(freq[x]/k) for all x.

Wait, but I can choose to perform operations on one frequency at a time.

But perhaps I can optimize by choosing which frequencies to perform operations on.

Wait, maybe it's more complicated.

Let me consider an example.

Take n=5, k=3, frequencies: 3 (for 4's), 2 (for 1's).

I can perform one operation on the three 4's, reducing them to two 4's, and adding two cards of any number.

If I add two 1's, then I have two 4's and four 1's.

Now, I can perform another operation on three 1's, reducing to two 1's.

Now, I have two 4's and two 1's.

No more operations can be performed.

Total cards left: 4.

But in the example, the answer is 2.

So, I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, in the first operation, when I replace the three 4's with two 1's, I should have [1,1,1,4,4].

Wait, no, I had two original 1's and add two more 1's, making four 1's, and two 4's.

Wait, no, the original hand was [4,1,1,4,4]. After replacing three 4's with two 1's, the hand becomes [1,1,1,4].

Wait, I think I miscounted.

Starting with [4,1,1,4,4]. Replace three 4's with two 1's: [1,1,1,4].

Now, perform operation on three 1's, replace with two 1's: [1,1,4].

Perform operation on two 1's and one 4, but wait, I need k=3 cards with the same number.

I can't perform operations on mixed numbers.

Wait, no, I can only perform operations on k cards with the same number.

So, from [1,1,4], I can't perform any more operations because I don't have three cards with the same number.

So, the minimum is two cards.

Wait, but according to the example, it's two.

But in my earlier calculation, I had four cards.

I must have made a mistake in counting.

Wait, starting with [4,1,1,4,4], replace three 4's with two 1's: [1,1,1,4].

Then, replace three 1's with two 1's: [1,1,4].

Can't perform any more operations. So, two cards left.

Wait, but in my previous calculation, I thought I had four cards, but actually, it's three cards: [1,1,4]. Then, I can perform another operation on the two 1's and one more card, but k=3 requires three cards of the same number.

Wait, no, I can only perform operations on k cards with the same number.

So, from [1,1,4], I can't perform any more operations because I don't have three cards with the same number.

So, the minimum is three cards, but the example says two.

I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace the three 4's with two different numbers.

Wait, no, when replacing, I choose k-1 cards of any numbers.

So, replacing three 4's with two cards of any numbers.

I chose to make them two 1's, but maybe I can choose differently.

Suppose I replace three 4's with one 1 and one new number, say 5.

So, starting with [4,1,1,4,4], replace three 4's with one 1 and one 5: [1,1,1,5].

Now, perform operation on three 1's, replace with two 1's: [1,1,5].

Again, can't perform any more operations. Still three cards.

I must be misunderstanding the example.

Wait, maybe the sequence of operations is different.

Let's look back at the problem statement.

"In the first example case, which has k=3:

Choose three 4's and replace them with two cards. Let's say we choose to make them two 1's. Now, the hand is [1,1,1,4].

Then, choose three 1's and replace them with two 1's. Now, the hand is [1,1,4].

Wait, but in the problem's picture, it shows ending with two cards, but according to this, it's three.

Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I can choose to replace three 4's with two different numbers.

Wait, no, when replacing, I get k-1 cards, each of which can be any number I choose.

So, I can choose to make them any numbers, but I have to choose the numbers individually.

Perhaps I can choose to make them different numbers to create more flexibility.

For example, replace three 4's with one 1 and one 5: [1,1,5,4].

Now, perform operation on the three 1's and the 5 and 4.

Wait, no, I only have two 1's now.

I can't perform an operation on three 1's because I only have two.

So, I can't perform any more operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose to replace three 4's with one 1 and one 5: [1,1,5,4].

Now, I have two 1's, one 5, and one 4.

I can't perform any operations because no group of three cards with the same number.

So, again, ending with four cards.

But according to the example, it's two.

I must be missing something crucial here.

Let me try to think differently.

Maybe I need to consider that the new cards can be chosen to match existing cards to create new groups for operations.

Wait, for example, replace three 4's with two 1's: [1,1,1,4].

Now, perform operation on three 1's, replace them with two 1's: [1,1,4].

Now, perform operation on two 1's and one 4, but I need three cards of the same number.

Wait, no, I can't because k=3 requires three same numbers.

So, I can't perform any more operations.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace the three 4's with one 1 and one new number, say 5: [1,1,5,4].

Now, I have two 1's, one 5, and one 4.

Again, no group of three same numbers.

So, I can't perform any more operations.

Still, I'm left with four cards.

But according to the example, it's two.

I must be misunderstanding the sequence of operations.

Let me look at the problem's picture.

Unfortunately, I can't see the picture, but according to the text, the answer is two.

Maybe there's a way to end up with two cards, but I'm not seeing it.

Perhaps I need to accept that my approach is limited and look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by one, and I can perform operations as long as there exists a group of k cards with the same number.

So, the minimum number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

To maximize p, I need to maximize the number of operations I can perform.

Each operation consumes k cards of the same number and produces k-1 cards.

So, effectively, each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the minimum number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximum number of operations.

I need to find the maximum p such that after performing p operations, there are no groups of k cards with the same number left.

This sounds like finding the maximum number of times I can reduce the hand by one card through these operations.

But how do I calculate p?

I need to consider the frequency of each number.

Let freq[x] be the frequency of number x.

For each x, I can perform floor(freq[x]/k) operations on x.

But it's not that simple because after performing operations on one number, I can affect the frequencies of other numbers by adding new cards.

Wait, but in each operation, I choose k cards of the same number and replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose.

So, I can choose to add k-1 cards to existing numbers or create new numbers.

This complicates things because it introduces flexibility in how frequencies change.

This seems like a greedy problem where I need to always perform operations on the number with the highest frequency to maximize the number of operations.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that in each operation, I choose the number with the highest frequency that has at least k cards, perform the operation on it, and adjust the frequencies accordingly.

I repeat this until no number has at least k cards.

The total number of operations p is the sum of floor(freq[x]/k) for all x, but adjusted for the interactions between operations.

This seems too simplistic because frequencies can change based on the new cards added.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this with a priority queue.

But that might be too time-consuming for the problem's constraints.

Given that n <= 100 and t <= 500, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider that the minimal number of cards is the minimal m such that m < k or m >=k and m cannot be reduced further.

Wait, that's too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that the minimal number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximal number of operations I can perform.

Each operation reduces n by one, and requires that there exists at least one number with frequency >=k.

So, p is the maximal number of times I can find a number with frequency >=k and reduce its frequency by k and increase some other numbers by k-1.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that the minimal number of cards is the smallest m where m <k or m >=k but no number has frequency >=k.

Wait, but with the ability to choose the numbers on the new cards, I can potentially create new frequencies that allow for more operations.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that finding the exact minimal number requires a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving graph theory or some other optimization technique.

But for the purpose of this problem, with n <=100 and t <=500, I need an efficient algorithm.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the frequencies and calculate how many operations I can perform.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm for the distinct numbers.

Each operation reduces one frequency by k and increases some other frequencies by k-1.

I need to perform operations in such a way that the total number of cards is minimized.

This seems like a system of equations or inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum flow or some other graph algorithm.

But that might be overkill.

Let me consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by one, and I can perform operations as long as some frequency is >=k.

So, the minimal number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

To maximize p, I need to keep performing operations as long as there is at least one frequency >=k.

This seems similar to the standard problem of finding how many operations I can perform given these constraints.

In that case, p is the sum of floor(freq[x]/k) for all x, but considering that frequencies can change after each operation.

Wait, but in reality, since I can choose the numbers on the new cards, I can potentially optimize p.

But perhaps in practice, the minimal number of cards is k-1, because if I have k cards of the same number, I can reduce them to k-1, and so on, until I can't perform any more operations.

Wait, but in the first example, it's 2, which is k-1=2.

In the fourth example, it's 3, which is k-1=3.

In the third example, it's 1, which is k-1=1.

Wait, but in the second example, n=1, k=10, answer is 1, which is greater than k-1=9.

Wait, but k-1=9 is greater than n=1, so the minimal is n=1.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards is max(n - (n - m)/(k-1), 0), where m is something.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by one.

So, the minimal number of cards is n - p, where p is the maximum number of operations I can perform.

I need to maximize p.

To maximize p, I need to perform operations as long as there is at least one frequency >=k.

So, p is the maximum number of times I can find a frequency >=k and reduce it by k, possibly increasing other frequencies by k-1.

But since I can choose the numbers on the new cards, I can potentially create new frequencies to perform more operations.

However, in practice, it's not clear how to optimally choose the new cards to maximize p.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to always perform operations on the frequency with the highest frequency.

But even that is not straightforward.

Given the time constraints, maybe I need to accept that the minimal number of cards is k-1, but only if n >=k.

But in the second example, n=1 <k=10, so minimal is n=1.

In the third example, n=7, k=2, answer is 1.

Wait, k-1=1, and n=7, so minimal is 1.

In the fourth example, n=10, k=4, answer is 3, which is k-1=3.

So, perhaps the minimal is k-1, but only if n >=k.

But in the third example, n=7, k=2, minimal is 1, which is k-1=1.

Wait, but if k=2, then k-1=1, and n=7, which is greater than k-1=1.

So, perhaps the minimal is k-1, but adjusted for n.

Wait, perhaps the minimal is n - floor((n - m)/(k-1)), where m is something.

I'm getting lost here.

Let me consider that for each operation, I reduce the total by one, and I can perform operations until no frequency >=k.

So, p is the maximum number of times I can find a frequency >=k.

This is similar to the standard greedy algorithm for this type of problem.

In that case, p is the sum of floor(freq[x]/k) for all x.

But I need to consider that after performing operations, frequencies can change.

Wait, but since I can choose the numbers on the new cards, I can potentially optimize p.

For example, I can choose to add k-1 cards to a frequency that already has some cards, to make it eligible for more operations.

But in practice, it's not clear how to maximize p.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that the minimal number of cards is k-1, but only if n >=k.

Otherwise, it's n.

But in the third example, n=7, k=2, minimal is 1, which is k-1=1.

In the first example, n=5, k=3, minimal is 2, which is k-1=2.

In the fourth example, n=10, k=4, minimal is 3, which is k-1=3.

In the second example, n=1, k=10, minimal is 1, which is max(n, k-1).

Wait, no, k-1=9, but n=1, so minimal is n=1.

So, perhaps the minimal is min(n, k-1).

But in the third example, n=7, k=2, min(7,1)=1, which matches.

In the first example, min(5,2)=2, which matches.

In the fourth example, min(10,3)=3, which matches.

In the second example, min(1,1)=1, which matches.

So, perhaps the minimal number of cards is min(n, k-1).

This seems to fit all the examples.

Let me verify this.

If n <=k-1, then minimal is n, because I can't perform any operations.

If n >=k, then I can perform operations to reduce the total to k-1.

Hence, minimal is min(n, k-1).

This seems correct.

So, the answer is simply k-1 if n >=k, else n.

This would explain why in the first example, with n=5 and k=3, minimal is 2.

In the third example, n=7 and k=2, minimal is 1.

In the fourth example, n=10 and k=4, minimal is 3.

In the second example, n=1 and k=10, minimal is 1.

This seems consistent.

Therefore, the program should just output k-1 if n >=k, else n.

Looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(k - 1)

So, it's always printing k-1, regardless of n.

But according to my reasoning, it should print k-1 only if n >=k, else print n.

But in the examples, it seems to be printing k-1 in cases where n >=k, and n when n <k.

Wait, but in the third example, n=7, k=2, minimal is 1, which is k-1=1.

In the first example, n=5, k=3, minimal is 2, which is k-1=2.

In the fourth example, n=10, k=4, minimal is 3, which is k-1=3.

In the second example, n=1, k=10, minimal is 1, which is n since n <k-1=9.

Wait, but k-1=9, and n=1, so min(n, k-1)=1.

Wait, but k-1=9 >n=1, so minimal is n=1.

Wait, but in the third example, k-1=1, n=7 >=k-1=1, so minimal is k-1=1.

In the first example, n=5 >=k-1=2, so minimal is k-1=2.

In the fourth example, n=10 >=k-1=3, so minimal is k-1=3.

So, the program should print k-1 if n >=k-1, else n.

Wait, but in the second example, n=1 <k=10, so minimal is n=1.

But k-1=9, and n=1 <k-1=9, so minimal is n=1.

In the third example, n=7 >=k-1=1, so minimal is k-1=1.

Wait, but k-1=1, and n=7 >=k-1=1, so minimal is k-1=1.

Wait, but in the first example, k-1=2, n=5 >=k-1=2, so minimal is k-1=2.

In the fourth example, k-1=3, n=10 >=k-1=3, so minimal is k-1=3.

So, the minimal is k-1 if n >=k-1, else n.

But in the second example, k-1=9, n=1 <k-1=9, so minimal is n=1.

Hence, minimal is max(n, k-1).

Wait, no, min(n, k-1).

Wait, no, wait.

Wait, in the second example, n=1, k=10, k-1=9, n <k-1, so minimal is n=1.

In the third example, n=7, k=2, k-1=1, n >=k-1=1, so minimal is k-1=1.

In the first example, n=5, k=3, k-1=2, n >=k-1=2, so minimal is k-1=2.

In the fourth example, n=10, k=4, k-1=3, n >=k-1=3, so minimal is k-1=3.

Hence, the minimal is min(n, k-1).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the program should print min(n, k-1).

But in the given program, it's printing k-1 regardless of n.

Hence, it's incorrect.

For example, in the second example, n=1, k=10, k-1=9, but minimal is n=1, which is less than k-1=9.

So, it should print n=1, not k-1=9.

Similarly, in the third example, n=7, k=2, k-1=1, n >=k-1=1, so minimal is k-1=1.

Hence, print 1.

Similarly, in the first example, n=5, k=3, k-1=2, n >=k-1=2, so minimal is 2.

Hence, print 2.

In the fourth example, n=10, k=4, k-1=3, n >=k-1=3, so minimal is 3.

Hence, print 3.

So, the program should be:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n, k = map(int, input().split())

cards = list(map(int, input().split()))

if n >= k-1:

print(k-1)

else:

print(n)

But in the given program, it's always printing k-1, regardless of n.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
