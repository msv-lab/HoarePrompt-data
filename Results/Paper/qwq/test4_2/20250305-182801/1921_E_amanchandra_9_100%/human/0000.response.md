Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game on a checkered board with h rows and w columns. Alice and Bob have their chips on the board, and they take turns moving their chips according to specific rules. Alice can move down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob can move up, up-right, or up-left. The goal for each is to land on the opponent's chip to win, and if someone can't move, it's a draw.

First, I need to understand the movement options for both players. Alice, starting from (x_a, y_a), can move to (x_a + 1, y_a), (x_a + 1, y_a - 1), or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1), as long as she doesn't go off the board. Similarly, Bob from (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b), (x_b - 1, y_b - 1), or (x_b - 1, y_b + 1), within the board limits.

The game ends in a win for Alice if she lands on Bob's position, a win for Bob if he lands on Alice's position, or a draw if neither can move.

Given that both play optimally, I need to determine the outcome of the game for multiple test cases.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to handle multiple test cases in a loop, reading the inputs for each case and making decisions based on the positions and the number of moves possible.

Let's break down the logic in the given program.

The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`, and then for each test case, it reads six integers: r, w, a, b, c, d, which correspond to h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b in the problem statement.

Then, there's an immediate check: if a > c, it prints 'Draw'. This suggests that if Alice's initial row is lower than Bob's, the game ends in a draw. I need to think about why that might be the case.

Given that Alice can only move down or diagonally down, and Bob can only move up or diagonally up, if Alice is already below Bob, she can't go up to reach Bob, and Bob can't go down to reach Alice. So, neither can reach the other, leading to a draw. That makes sense.

Next, if a <= c, it calculates x as the integer division of the absolute difference between a and c by 2. So, x = abs(a - c) // 2.

Then, it checks if the difference between a and c is odd or even. If it's odd, it calculates l and r as the possible range for y coordinates where Alice can capture Bob, considering the movement steps.

It sets l to the maximum of 1 and d - x, and r to the minimum of w and d + x. Then, it checks if b (Alice's initial y-coordinate) is within x + 1 steps from l and r. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, 'Draw'.

Similarly, if the difference is even, it calculates l and r for Bob's possible capture range and checks if d is within x steps from l and r for Bob to capture Alice, printing 'Bob' if so, otherwise 'Draw'.

I need to verify if this logic accurately reflects the game's outcomes based on the rules.

First, the condition when a > c leading to a draw seems correct, as neither can reach the other.

When a <= c, the number of moves Alice can make down is c - a (since she needs to reach row c from row a). Bob can move up a - 1 moves (from row c to row a), but since a <= c, a - 1 could be negative, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, a starts from 1 to h, and c is also from 1 to h, with a <= c in this branch.

Actually, if a <= c, Alice needs to move down c - a rows to reach Bob's row. Bob can move up a - 1 rows to reach the top, but since a <= c, a - 1 might be less than c - a, depending on their positions.

I think the key here is to calculate the number of moves each needs to make to reach a certain point and see who can intercept the other.

The given solution calculates x as (c - a) // 2. This seems to be an attempt to see how many moves each can make towards each other.

If (c - a) is even, x is an integer, and if it's odd, x is the floor division result.

Then, based on whether (c - a) is odd or even, it calculates the possible y positions where a capture can occur.

I need to think about the movement in terms of steps.

Let me consider the steps:

- Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left.

- Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left.

If Alice needs to move c - a steps down to reach Bob's row, and Bob needs to move a - 1 steps up to reach the top, but since a <= c, Bob can move up to row 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of relative positions.

Let me consider the relative movement in terms of rows and columns.

Each move Alice makes increases her row by 1 and can change her column by -1, 0, or +1.

Each move Bob makes decreases his row by 1 and can change his column by -1, 0, or +1.

So, to meet at some point, the number of moves Alice makes down should be equal to the number of moves Bob makes up, such that their row positions coincide.

Let’s denote the number of moves Alice makes as m_a and Bob as m_b.

For them to meet at some row, we have:

a + m_a = c - m_b

Because Alice moves down m_a steps to row a + m_a, and Bob moves up m_b steps to row c - m_b.

So, m_a + m_b = c - a.

This is the total number of moves required for them to meet at some row between a and c.

Now, in terms of columns, after m_a moves by Alice and m_b by Bob, their column positions should be the same.

Alice's column position after m_a moves can be y_a + k, where -m_a <= k <= m_a (since she can move left or right up to m_a steps).

Similarly, Bob's column position after m_b moves can be y_b + l, where -m_b <= l <= m_b.

But Bob's movement is up and can be up-left, up, or up-right, so his column can change by -1, 0, or +1 per move.

So, his total column change after m_b moves is between -m_b and +m_b.

For them to meet, y_a + k = y_b + l, where k is in [-m_a, m_a] and l is in [-m_b, m_b].

Given that m_a + m_b = c - a, we can express l = k + (y_a - y_b).

So, we need to find k and l within their respective ranges.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let’s consider the meeting point.

Suppose they meet at row r_m, which must satisfy a <= r_m <= c.

Alice moves down to r_m - a steps, and Bob moves up c - r_m steps.

So, m_a = r_m - a, m_b = c - r_m.

Thus, m_a + m_b = c - a.

Now, in columns, Alice can be at y_a + k_a, where -m_a <= k_a <= m_a.

Bob can be at y_b + k_b, where -m_b <= k_b <= m_b.

For them to meet, y_a + k_a = y_b + k_b.

So, k_b = k_a + (y_a - y_b).

Now, since -m_b <= k_b <= m_b, we have:

-m_b <= k_a + (y_a - y_b) <= m_b.

Similarly, -m_a <= k_a <= m_a.

We need to find if there exists a k_a within [-m_a, m_a] such that k_a + (y_a - y_b) is within [-m_b, m_b].

Given that m_a = r_m - a and m_b = c - r_m, and r_m can vary between a and c, we can think of optimizing r_m to maximize the overlap of these intervals.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let’s consider the total number of moves, which is m_a + m_b = c - a.

We can think of Alice and Bob moving simultaneously towards each other.

In each pair of moves (Alice's and Bob's), the row difference decreases by 2 (since Alice moves down and Bob moves up).

Unless one of them cannot move, they will eventually meet at some row.

But we need to consider the column positions when they meet.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a game where we calculate the minimum number of moves for Alice to reach Bob's position and for Bob to reach Alice's position, and see who can do it first.

But given the constraints on their movements, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the provided solution again.

In the provided solution, when a > c, it's immediately a draw, which makes sense.

When a <= c, it calculates x = (c - a) // 2.

Then, if (c - a) is odd, it calculates the possible y range for Alice to capture Bob, and if (c - a) is even, it calculates for Bob to capture Alice.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example input:

6 5 2 2 5 3

Here, h=6, w=5, Alice at (2,2), Bob at (5,3).

So, a=2, c=5, c - a = 3, which is odd.

x = 3 // 2 = 1.

Then, l = max(1, 3 - 1) = 2, r = min(5, 3 + 1) = 4.

Now, check if abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1.

b=2.

abs(2 - 2) = 0 <= 2 (since x=1, x+1=2), and abs(4 - 2) = 2 <= 2.

Both conditions are true, so it should print 'Alice', which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

4 1 2 1 4 1

h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

a=2, c=4, c - a = 2, even.

x = 2 // 2 = 1.

Now, calculate l and r for Bob's capture range.

l = max(1, 1 - 1) = 1, r = min(1, 1 + 1) = 1.

Check if abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x.

d=1.

abs(1 - 1) = 0 <= 1, and abs(1 - 1) = 0 <= 1.

Both true, so print 'Bob', matching the sample.

Another test case:

1 4 1 3 1 1

a=1, c=1, c - a = 0, even.

x=0.

l = max(1, 3 - 0) = 3, r = min(4, 3 + 0) = 3.

Check if abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x.

d=1.

abs(3 - 1) = 2 <= 0? No.

So, doesn't satisfy, hence 'Draw', matching sample.

Seems correct so far.

Let me think about the general case.

When a > c, Alice can't move up, Bob can't move down, so can't meet, draw.

When a <= c:

- If c - a is odd:

The provided solution calculates the y-range where Alice can capture Bob.

It seems to be considering that Alice can adjust her column position within x+1 steps in the y-direction.

Similarly, when c - a is even:

It checks if Bob can capture Alice within x steps in the y-direction.

I need to verify if this accurately reflects the possible movements and capture conditions.

Perhaps there's a better way to model this.

Let’s consider the relative movement in rows and columns.

The row difference is c - a.

Alice needs to cover c - a rows moving down.

Bob needs to cover a - 1 rows moving up, but since a <= c, and c - a is known, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of moves required.

Wait, since Alice moves down c - a steps, and Bob moves up c - a steps (since total row difference is c - a), but Bob can only move up to a - 1 steps (since he starts at c and moves up to row 1).

Wait, no, Bob can move up to c - 1 steps (from c to 1).

But in this context, since a <= c, Bob can move up to c - 1 rows.

But in the game, they take turns alternately, with Alice starting.

So, Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on.

Each move consists of moving one step down or diagonally down for Alice, and up or diagonally up for Bob.

I need to see if Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position.

This seems like a pursuit-evasion game on a grid.

An alternative approach is to model the game as a graph where nodes represent board positions, and edges represent possible moves.

But given the large constraints (h up to 1e6 and w up to 1e9), this is impractical.

I need a smarter way.

Let’s consider the time steps.

Let t be the number of moves Alice makes.

Then, Bob makes t moves as well, since they alternate turns, but since Alice starts, if t is Alice's moves, Bob has made t moves as well.

Wait, actually, since Alice starts, after t moves by Alice, Bob has made t moves if t > 0, and t-1 moves if t >=1.

Wait, it's better to think in terms of total moves.

Let’s define:

- Alice moves on odd steps (1st, 3rd, etc.)

- Bob moves on even steps (2nd, 4th, etc.)

But this might not help directly.

An alternative is to consider the difference in rows between Alice and Bob.

Initially, the row difference is c - a.

Each pair of moves (Alice's and Bob's turn) reduces the row difference by 2, since Alice moves down and Bob moves up.

So, after k pairs of moves, the row difference is c - a - 2k.

The game ends when the row difference is less than 2, meaning c - a - 2k < 2.

Wait, more precisely, when c - a - 2k <= 0, someone wins or it's a draw.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Each pair of moves reduces the row difference by 2.

If c - a is even, they will meet after k = (c - a)/2 pairs of moves.

If c - a is odd, the row difference becomes 1 after k = (c - a - 1)/2 pairs of moves.

Then, the player who moves next can decide the outcome.

Given that Alice moves first, after k pairs of moves, if c - a is even, Bob moves last in that sequence.

If c - a is odd, Alice moves last.

So, when c - a is even, after k pairs, row difference is 0, meaning they are in the same row.

Since Bob moved last, it's Alice's turn next.

Alice can move down, but since they are in the same row, Alice can only stay in the same row by moving down and then back up, which isn't allowed.

Wait, no.

Wait, if c - a is even, after k pairs, they are in the same row.

Alice moves first in the next move, but since she's already in the same row as Bob, she can try to capture Bob in that row.

Similarly, Bob can try to capture Alice.

So, in this situation, both are in the same row, and they can adjust their columns to try to capture each other.

Similarly, if c - a is odd, after k pairs, the row difference is 1, with Alice moving next.

So, Alice can move up to the same row as Bob and try to capture him, or Bob can move down to Alice's row and try to capture her.

So, in both cases, it boils down to whether one player can adjust their column position to match the other's column position within their possible moves.

Given that, perhaps the provided solution is correctly handling these cases by calculating the possible column ranges where capture can occur.

In the even case, it's checking if Bob can capture Alice, and in the odd case, if Alice can capture Bob.

Given that, and considering the sample inputs and outputs, it seems the provided solution is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**
