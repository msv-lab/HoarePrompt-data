Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, but string c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as t's i-th character.

2. If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of t's i-th character.

Also, it's important to note that t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters in any position.

My task is to find such a template t for each test case, and based on whether it exists, print "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

In the first test case, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c". The solution says "YES", and the explanation is that using template "C" works because 'a' and 'b' are different from 'c' (since 'C' is uppercase, it means the corresponding character in a and b must be different from 'c').

Wait, but 'C' is uppercase, so for a and b to match, their i-th character must be different from the lowercase version of 'C', which is 'c'. Since a="a" and b="b" are both different from 'c', they match. For c="c", it must be the same as 'c' if 'C' were considered lowercase, but since 'C' is uppercase, it's checking for difference. But 'c' is equal to 'c', so it doesn't match, which is what we want.

Okay, that makes sense.

In the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa". The output is "NO". I need to think why.

If I try to create a template t where both characters are uppercase, say "AA". Then for a="aa", both characters would need to be different from 'a', so 'a' should be different from 'a', which is not true. So a doesn't match "AA". Similarly, b="bb" would need to have both characters different from 'b', which they are not. So b doesn't match "AA". c="aa" would also not match "AA" for the same reason.

But I need a template where a and b match, but c does not.

Alternatively, if I make t="aA", then for a="aa", the first character must be 'a' (since 'a' is lowercase in t), and the second character must be different from 'a' (since 'A' is uppercase in t). So a's second character is 'a', which should be different from 'a', which is not true. So a doesn't match t="aA".

If I try t="Aa", then for a="aa", the first character must be different from 'a' (since 'A' is uppercase), and the second character must be 'a' (since 'a' is lowercase). a="aa" has first character 'a', which should be different from 'a' – not the case. So a doesn't match.

Similarly, for b="bb", with t="Aa", first character 'b' is different from 'a', so that's good, and second character 'b' must be 'a' – which it's not. So b doesn't match.

For c="aa", same as a, doesn't match t="Aa".

It seems no template works here, hence "NO".

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder". The output is "YES". The explanation is to use the template "CODEforces". Let's see:

t="CODEforces"

For a="mathforces":

- 'm' vs 'C' (uppercase): 'm' must be different from 'c' lowercase, which is 'c'. 'm' != 'c', so okay.

- 'a' vs 'O': 'a' != 'o'

- 't' vs 'D': 't' != 'd'

- 'h' vs 'E': 'h' != 'e'

- 'f' vs 'f': 'f' == 'f' (since 'f' is lowercase in t), which is okay.

- 'o' vs 'o': okay

- 'r' vs 'r': okay

- 'c' vs 'c': okay

- 'e' vs 'e': okay

- 's' vs 's': okay

So a matches t.

Similarly, b="luckforces":

- 'l' vs 'C': 'l' != 'c'

- 'u' vs 'O': 'u' != 'o'

- 'c' vs 'D': 'c' != 'd'

- 'k' vs 'E': 'k' != 'e'

- 'f' vs 'f': okay

- 'o' vs 'o': okay

- 'r' vs 'r': okay

- 'c' vs 'c': okay

- 'e' vs 'e': okay

- 's' vs 's': okay

So b matches t.

Now, c="adhoccoder":

- 'a' vs 'C': 'a' != 'c' → okay

- 'd' vs 'O': 'd' != 'o' → okay

- 'h' vs 'D': 'h' != 'd' → okay

- 'o' vs 'E': 'o' != 'e' → okay

- 'c' vs 'f': 'c' != 'f' → okay

- 'c' vs 'o': 'c' != 'o' → okay

- 'o' vs 'r': 'o' != 'r' → okay

- 'd' vs 'c': 'd' != 'c' → okay

- 'e' vs 'o': 'e' != 'o' → okay

- 'r' vs 'd': 'r' != 'd' → okay

Wait, but the explanation says "CODEforces" works, but according to this, c also matches the template t="CODEforces", because all its characters are different from the corresponding lowercase letters in t where t has uppercase letters, and equal where t has lowercase letters. So why is the output "YES"?

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. It says "the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't hold for at least one i". So, if for at least one position, the condition fails, then the string doesn't match the template.

In this case, for c="adhoccoder" and t="CODEforces", let's check:

- 'a' != 'c' → okay

- 'd' != 'o' → okay

- 'h' != 'd' → okay

- 'o' != 'e' → okay

- 'c' != 'f' → okay

- 'c' != 'o' → okay

- 'o' != 'r' → okay

- 'd' != 'c' → okay

- 'e' != 'o' → okay

- 'r' != 'd' → okay

So, all conditions hold for c, meaning c matches the template t="CODEforces", which is not what we want. We want a template where a and b match, but c does not match.

So, perhaps "CODEforces" is not a correct template for this test case. But the example output is "YES", so there must be some other template that works.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose t such that for positions where a and b have the same character, t has that character in lowercase, and for positions where a and b differ, t has an uppercase character that corresponds to a or b's character.

Wait, no, that might not work.

Let me think about the conditions more carefully.

I need to find a template t such that:

1. a matches t

2. b matches t

3. c does not match t

So, I need to find t that satisfies both 1 and 2, and not 3.

First, let's think about positions where a and b have the same character. In those positions, for t:

- If t has a lowercase letter, it must be equal to that character.

- If t has an uppercase letter, a and b's character must be different from the lowercase version of that uppercase letter.

So, if a and b have the same character at some position, say 'x', then:

- If t has 'y' lowercase at that position, then 'x' must be 'y'.

- If t has 'Y' uppercase at that position, then 'x' must be different from 'y'.

So, in the case where a and b have 'x' at that position, t can have 'x' lowercase, or any uppercase 'Y' where 'y' != 'x'.

Now, for c, which is different from a and b, I need it to not match t. That means, there should be at least one position where:

- If t has lowercase 'y', then c's character at that position must be different from 'y'.

- If t has uppercase 'Y', then c's character at that position must be equal to 'y'.

So, my goal is to choose t in such a way that a and b match t, and c does not match t.

Let me consider the positions one by one.

For each position i from 1 to n:

Case 1: a[i] == b[i] == c[i]

Then, to make c not match t, I need to set t[i] in such a way that c does not match. But if a and b match t, and c is the same as a and b, it's likely that c will also match t, unless I force a contradiction.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c", and output is "YES". Here, a, b, c are all different single characters. The solution is to choose t="C", which makes a and b match (since 'a' != 'c' and 'b' != 'c'), and c does not match (since 'c' == 'c').

So, in this case, a, b, c are all different.

In the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa". Here, a and b are different, c is same as a.

The output is "NO", meaning no such template exists.

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder". a and b differ in some positions, c is different from both.

The output is "YES", meaning such a template exists.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a="acc", b="abd", c="abc". Output is "NO".

So, I need to find a general approach to determine if such a template t exists.

Let me try to formalize the conditions.

For each position i:

- Let x = a[i], y = b[i], z = c[i].

- We need t[i] such that:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, say 'k', then x == k and y == k.

  - If t[i] is uppercase, say 'K', then x != k and y != k.

- Additionally, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position i where:

  - If t[i] is lowercase 'k', then z != k.

  - If t[i] is uppercase 'K', then z == k.

So, for each position i, I need to choose t[i] in a way that:

1. If t[i] is lowercase 'k', then x == k and y == k.

2. If t[i] is uppercase 'K', then x != k and y != k.

And for c:

- There exists at least one position i where:

  - If t[i] is lowercase 'k', then z != k.

  - If t[i] is uppercase 'K', then z == k.

Now, I need to choose t[i] for each i to satisfy these conditions.

Let's consider different scenarios for each position i.

Case 1: x == y == z

Then, to have c not match t, I need to set t[i] in such a way that c does not match. But if x == y == z, and I set t[i] to lowercase 'x', then a and b match (since x == t[i]), but c also matches (since z == t[i]). If I set t[i] to uppercase 'X', then a and b match (since x != 'x'), but c also matches (since z != 'x'). So, in this case, it's impossible to have c not match t while a and b match t. Hence, no such template exists.

Case 2: x == y != z

Then, I can set t[i] to lowercase 'x'. Then a and b match (since x == t[i]), and c does not match (since z != t[i]).

Alternatively, I can set t[i] to uppercase 'X'. Then a and b match (since x != 'x'), and c does not match (since z != 'x').

So, in this case, I have choices for t[i] that satisfy the conditions.

Case 3: x != y

Subcases:

Subcase 3.1: z == x or z == y

If z == x, then to have c not match t, while a and b match t.

If I set t[i] to uppercase 'Y', where y is some character:

- For a to match, a[i] != y.

- For b to match, b[i] != y.

- For c to not match, c[i] == y.

But c[i] == x, so x == y.

But x != y in this subcase, so this is impossible.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, if x != y, and z == x, then:

- Set t[i] to uppercase 'Y', where y is such that y != x and y != y (which is impossible since y != y is not possible).

This seems confusing.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of possible choices for t[i] given a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me try to think of t[i] as a variable that can be either lowercase or uppercase, with specific constraints based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

For each position i, define the possible choices for t[i] that satisfy the conditions for a and b to match t, and c to not match t.

Let's define:

- Let a_i = a[i], b_i = b[i], c_i = c[i].

- Define possible t[i] as follows:

  - If t[i] is lowercase 'k', then:

    - a_i == k

    - b_i == k

    - c_i != k

  - If t[i] is uppercase 'K', then:

    - a_i != k

    - b_i != k

    - c_i == k

So, for each position i, the possible choices for t[i] are:

- Lowercase 'k' only if a_i == k and b_i == k and c_i != k.

- Uppercase 'K' only if a_i != k and b_i != k and c_i == k.

But this seems too restrictive. Maybe I need to consider that t[i] can be any character, not necessarily related to a[i], b[i], or c[i].

Wait, but t[i] is to be chosen based on the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate over all possible t[i] and check if they satisfy the conditions.

But that's not efficient, especially since n can be up to 20, and t can have both lowercase and uppercase letters.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for each position i, the choice of t[i] must satisfy:

- If t[i] is lowercase 'k', then a_i == k and b_i == k and c_i != k.

- If t[i] is uppercase 'K', then a_i != k and b_i != k and c_i == k.

So, for each position i, I can look at a_i, b_i, and c_i, and determine what t[i] can be.

Let's define for each position i:

- Possible lowercase choices: only 'k' where k == a_i and k == b_i and k != c_i.

- Possible uppercase choices: 'K' where k != a_i and k != b_i and k == c_i.

But in practice, since a_i == b_i == c_i would make it impossible, as in case 1 above.

Wait, in case 1, a_i == b_i == c_i, then:

- For lowercase 'k', we need k == a_i and k == b_i and k != c_i, which is impossible since a_i == c_i.

- For uppercase 'K', we need k != a_i and k != b_i and k == c_i, which is also impossible since c_i == a_i.

Hence, in this case, no choice of t[i] satisfies the conditions, so no template exists.

In case 2, a_i == b_i != c_i:

- Lowercase 'a_i': satisfies a_i == 'a_i', b_i == 'a_i', c_i != 'a_i'.

- Uppercase 'A_i': requires a_i != 'a_i' and b_i != 'a_i' and c_i == 'a_i', but a_i == b_i != c_i, so a_i != 'a_i' is false. Hence, only lowercase 'a_i' is possible.

In case 3, a_i != b_i:

- Subcase 3.1: c_i == a_i

  - Lowercase 'a_i': requires a_i == 'a_i', b_i == 'a_i' (but b_i != a_i), so false.

  - Uppercase 'A_i': requires a_i != 'a_i' (false), b_i != 'a_i' (true), c_i == 'a_i' (true).

  - So, uppercase 'A_i' is possible only if b_i != 'a_i' and c_i == 'a_i'.

  - But since a_i != b_i, and c_i == a_i, then uppercase 'A_i' is possible only if b_i != 'a_i', which is already true.

  - So, t[i] can be uppercase 'A_i'.

- Subcase 3.2: c_i == b_i

  - Similar to above, but with roles of a and b swapped.

  - Lowercase 'b_i': requires a_i == 'b_i' (false), b_i == 'b_i' (true), c_i != 'b_i' (false).

  - Uppercase 'B_i': requires a_i != 'b_i' (true), b_i != 'b_i' (false), c_i == 'b_i' (true).

  - So, uppercase 'B_i' is not possible because b_i != 'b_i' is false.

  - Hence, no possible t[i] in this subcase.

- Subcase 3.3: c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i

  - Lowercase 'k': requires k == a_i and k == b_i, which is false since a_i != b_i.

  - Uppercase 'K': requires k != a_i and k != b_i and k == c_i.

    - Since c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, then k == c_i satisfies k != a_i and k != b_i.

    - Hence, t[i] can be uppercase 'K' where K is the uppercase of c_i.

So, summarizing:

- If a_i == b_i == c_i, no possible t[i].

- If a_i == b_i != c_i, t[i] can be lowercase 'a_i'.

- If a_i != b_i:

  - If c_i == a_i, t[i] can be uppercase 'A_i' (where 'A_i' is the uppercase of a_i).

  - If c_i == b_i, no possible t[i].

  - If c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, t[i] can be uppercase 'C_i' (where 'C_i' is the uppercase of c_i).

Hence, for each position i:

- If a_i == b_i == c_i, fail.

- If a_i == b_i != c_i, set t[i] to lowercase 'a_i'.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i == a_i, set t[i] to uppercase 'A_i'.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i == b_i, fail.

- If a_i != b_i and c_i != a_i and c_i != b_i, set t[i] to uppercase 'C_i'.

So, in code, for each position i, choose t[i] accordingly, and if at any position where a_i == b_i == c_i, or a_i != b_i and c_i == b_i, then output "NO". Otherwise, construct t accordingly and output "YES".

Wait, but in the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder", the output is "YES". Let's see:

Compare a and b:

Positions where a and b have the same character:

- Position 5: 'f' == 'f'

- Positions 6 to 10: 'o','r','c','e','s' are same in a and b.

Positions where a and b differ:

- Positions 1 to 4: 'm','a','t','h' vs 'l','u','c','k'

Now, c is "adhoccoder".

At positions where a and b are equal (5 to 10), c must differ in at least one of these positions for t's corresponding lowercase letters.

At positions where a and b differ (1 to 4), we can set t[i] to uppercase 'A_i' if c[i] == a[i], or uppercase 'C_i' if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

At positions 1 to 4:

1: m vs l vs a → a == c[i], so set t[1] to uppercase 'M'

2: a vs u vs d → d != a and d != u, so set t[2] to uppercase 'D'

3: t vs c vs h → h != t and h != c, so set t[3] to uppercase 'H'

4: h vs k vs o → o != h and o != k, so set t[4] to uppercase 'O'

Positions 5 to 10:

5: f == f == c[i] 'c' → f == f and f != c[i], so set t[5] to lowercase 'f'

6: o == o == o → o == o and o != o (wait, c[6] is 'c' != 'o', so set t[6] to lowercase 'o'

7: r == r == d → r == r and r != d, so set t[7] to lowercase 'r'

8: c == c == c → c == c and c != c → contradiction, can't set to lowercase 'c'

Wait, c[8] is 'c', which is equal to a[8] and b[8], so if I set t[8] to lowercase 'c', then c matches because c[i] == 'c'. But I need c to not match at least one position.

Wait, but if t[8] is lowercase 'c', then for c to not match, c[i] != 'c', but c[i] == 'c', so it matches, which is not what I want.

Wait, maybe I need to set t[8] to uppercase 'C', so that for a and b, their c != 'c', but a[8] == 'c' and b[8] == 'c', which would require that 'c' != 'c' (lowercase version), which is false. So, can't set t[8] to uppercase 'C'.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

According to my earlier logic:

- At positions where a and b are equal:

  - If c is different, set t[i] to lowercase 'a_i'

  - If c is equal, then cannot set t[i] to lowercase 'a_i', because c would match.

- Wait, in position 8, a[8] == b[8] == 'c', and c[8] == 'c'.

- So, a_i == b_i == c_i, which is the impossible case.

Hence, no template exists for this test case, but the output is "YES". So, perhaps my earlier logic is incomplete.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that t can have any uppercase letter for positions where a and b differ, as long as the conditions are satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose t[i] such that for positions where a and b differ, t[i] is uppercase, and the lowercase version is something that a and b are not equal to.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think in terms of constraints for each position and see if there's a consistent way to set t[i] across all positions.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to determine if such a template exists.

Let me consider that for a and b to match t, their differences and similarities must be compatible with t's specifications.

And c must violate at least one of t's specifications.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the positions where a and b differ and see if c differs in a way that allows for t to be set appropriately.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look back at the given program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

tests = int(input())

for i in range(tests):

slength = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

no = True

if c == a or c == b:

no = False

print('NO')

else:

for x in c:

if x not in a and x not in b:

print('YES')

no = False

break

if no:

print('NO')

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, a, b, c.

Then, it checks if c is equal to a or b. If so, sets no = False and prints 'NO'.

Else, it iterates through each character in c and checks if that character is not in a and not in b. If such a character exists in c, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it sets no = False and breaks.

If no is still True after the loop, it prints 'NO'.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c". c != a and c != b, since c="c" != "a" and "c" != "b". Then, it iterates through c: 'c' is not in a ("a") and 'c' is not in b ("b"), so it should print 'YES', which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa". c == a, so it prints 'NO', which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder". c != a and c != b. Then, it checks each character in c: 'a' is in a, 'd' is not in a and not in b, so it should print 'YES', which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a="acc", b="abd", c="abc". c != a and c != b. Then, it checks each character in c:

- 'a' is in a and b

- 'b' is in a and b

- 'c' is in a and b

So, no character in c is not in a and not in b, so it should print 'NO', which matches the sample output.

So, this program seems to be working correctly based on the sample inputs.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to understand the logic:

- If c == a or c == b, then print 'NO'.

- Else, if there exists at least one character in c that is not present in a and not present in b, then print 'YES'; else, print 'NO'.

But is this equivalent to the problem's requirements?

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the logic is that if c is exactly equal to a or b, then it cannot be made to not match t while a and b match t.

Because if c is exactly equal to a or b, and we set t to match a and b, then c will also match t.

Hence, in that case, it's impossible, so output 'NO'.

Otherwise, if c is different from both a and b, then we can try to find a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not.

But the program's logic seems too simplistic. It's not considering the positions or the specific characters in corresponding positions.

It's just checking if c is equal to a or b, and if not, checking if there's any character in c that is not present in a or b.

But according to the problem, it's position-based matching.

So, perhaps this logic is incorrect.

But in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=2, a="ab", b="ba", c="bb".

According to the program:

c != a and c != b.

Then, check each character in c:

- 'b' is in a and b.

- 'b' is in a and b.

So, it should print 'NO'.

But is there a template t that makes a and b match t, but c does not match t?

Let's see:

Position 1: a="a", b="b", c="b"

- To make a and b match t:

  - If t[1] is lowercase 'k', then k == 'a' and k == 'b' → impossible.

  - So, t[1] must be uppercase 'K', where 'a' != k and 'b' != k.

    - So, k != 'a' and k != 'b'.

- For c to not match t:

  - If t[1] is uppercase 'K', then c[1] == k.

    - So, k == 'b', but k != 'b' from earlier.

    - Contradiction.

Hence, no such t exists, so "NO" is correct.

Another test case: n=2, a="aa", b="ab", c="bb"

c != a and c != b.

Check each character in c:

- 'b' is in a and b.

- 'b' is in a and b.

So, program outputs 'NO'.

But let's see if there's a template t.

Position 1: a="a", b="a", c="b"

- a and b are equal, c is different.

- Set t[1] to lowercase 'a'.

  - a and b match (a == 'a', a == 'a').

  - c does not match (b != 'a').

Position 2: a="a", b="b", c="b"

- a and b are different, c="b"

- Set t[2] to uppercase 'A' (since c[2] == 'b' != 'a').

  - a matches: a != 'a' → no, a == 'a' != 'a' is false.

  - Wait, no.

  - If t[2] is uppercase 'A', then a must have a[2] != 'a', but a[2] == 'a', which is not != 'a'. So, a does not match.

  - b must have b[2] != 'a', which is 'b' != 'a', true.

  - c has c[2] == 'b', which should be equal to 'a' for uppercase 'A', but 'b' != 'a', so c matches.

  - So, a does not match, b matches, c matches.

  - Not good.

- Alternatively, set t[2] to uppercase 'B'.

  - a must have a[2] != 'b', which is 'a' != 'b', true.

  - b must have b[2] != 'b', which is 'b' != 'b', false.

  - c has c[2] == 'b', which should be equal to 'b', so c matches.

  - So, b does not match, a matches, c matches.

  - Not good.

- Set t[2] to lowercase 'b'.

  - a must have a[2] == 'b', which is 'a' == 'b', false.

  - b must have b[2] == 'b', which is 'b' == 'b', true.

  - c must have c[2] == 'b', which is 'b' == 'b', true.

  - So, a does not match, b matches, c matches.

  - Not good.

- Set t[2] to uppercase 'C'.

  - a must have a[2] != 'c', which is 'a' != 'c', true.

  - b must have b[2] != 'c', which is 'b' != 'c', true.

  - c must have c[2] == 'c', which is 'b' == 'c', false.

  - So, c does not match, a and b match.

Hence, t="aC" would work: t[1] = 'a' lowercase, t[2] = 'C' uppercase.

- a: 'a' matches 'a', 'a' != 'c' → matches t.

- b: 'a' matches 'a', 'b' != 'c' → matches t.

- c: 'b' == 'a'? No, 'b' != 'a' → matches t (wait, no).

Wait, for t[1] = 'a' lowercase, c[1] = 'b' != 'a' → does not match.

Wait, no. If t[1] is lowercase 'a', then c[1] must be 'a', but c[1] = 'b' != 'a' → does not match.

For t[2] = 'C' uppercase, c[2] = 'b' != 'c' → matches t.

Wait, but since c does not match t at position 1, it's enough for c to not match at least one position.

Hence, "YES" should be the output, but according to the program, it would output 'NO' because no character in c is not in a or b.

In this case, c="bb", a="aa", b="ab", so both 'b's are in a or b.

Hence, the program would output 'NO', but actually, a template exists ("aC"), so it should be 'YES'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
