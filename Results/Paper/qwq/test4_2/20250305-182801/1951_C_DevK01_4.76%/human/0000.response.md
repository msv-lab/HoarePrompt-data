Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. I can buy up to m tickets per day, but there's a catch: every time I buy x tickets on a day, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets across these n days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what they mean:

- n can be up to 3*10^5, which is 300,000 days. That's a lot, so any solution that is O(n^2) is probably not going to work because it would be too slow.

- m can be up to 10^9, which is a billion tickets per day. That's a huge number.

- k can be up to min(n*m, 10^9), which is also a very large number.

Given these constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) at worst.

Let's try to wrap my head around the problem.

I have to buy k tickets across n days, with daily prices a_i, and I can buy up to m tickets per day. Each time I buy x tickets on day i, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, the cost is x * a_i, and then for all days j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

My aim is to minimize the total cost for k tickets.

First, I need to think about how the order in which I buy tickets affects the total cost.

Since buying tickets on earlier days affects the prices on later days, the order matters.

I need to find a strategy to minimize the total cost.

One approach is to prioritize buying tickets on days with the lowest initial prices, because that would minimize the immediate cost and also minimize the increase in prices for subsequent days.

But, I have to consider that if I buy too many tickets on a day, it might increase the prices for later days too much, potentially making it more expensive overall.

So, there's a trade-off between buying on cheaper days and not increasing the prices too much for future days.

Maybe I should sort the days based on their prices and try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, up to the daily limit m.

But, I need to be careful because buying m tickets on a cheap day will increase the prices for all subsequent days by m, which could make buying on later days more expensive.

Wait, perhaps I should consider grouping the days into blocks where I buy a certain number of tickets on each block.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a priority queue or use some kind of greedy approach.

Let me think about a smaller example to get some intuition.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

According to the explanation, the optimal way is to buy 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 1 on day 3, and 2 on day 4, with a total cost of 10.

Wait, buying 0 on day 1 means no increase in prices for subsequent days. Then buying 0 on day 2 again means no increase. Then on day 3, buy 1 ticket at price 4, so cost is 4, and prices for day 4 increase by 1 to become 3. Then on day 4, buy 2 tickets at price 3, cost is 6. Total cost is 4 + 6 = 10.

Another approach could be to buy 1 ticket on day 1 at price 8, then prices increase by 1 for remaining days to [ ,6+1=7,4+1=5,2+1=3]. Then buy 1 ticket on day 2 at price 7, and buy 1 ticket on day 4 at price 3. Total cost would be 8 + 7 + 3 = 18, which is worse than 10.

So, in this case, delaying the purchases to cheaper days is better.

Another example:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a = [8,6,4,2]

Since m=2 and k=8, I have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days.

Total cost would be:

Day 1: 2 tickets at 8, total 16. Prices increase by 2 for remaining days.

New prices: [ , 8+2=10, 4+2=6, 2+2=4]

Day 2: 2 tickets at 10, total 20. Prices increase by 2 again.

New prices: [ , , 6+2=8, 4+2=6]

Day 3: 2 tickets at 8, total 16.

Day 4: 2 tickets at 6, total 12.

Total cost: 16 + 20 + 16 + 12 = 64.

This matches the second output in the example.

Another example:

n=5, m=100, k=1

a = [10000,1,100,10,1000]

Since m=100, I can buy up to 100 tickets per day, but I only need 1.

The optimal strategy is to buy on the day with the lowest price, which is day 2 with price 1.

Total cost is 1.

This matches the third output in the example.

Last example:

n=6, m=3, k=9

a = [5,5,5,5,5,5]

Since all days have the same price, and m=3, k=9, I can buy 3 tickets each day for 3 days.

Total cost would be 3*5 + 3*8 + 3*11 = 15 + 24 + 33 = 72.

Wait, how did they get 72?

Wait, initial prices: [5,5,5,5,5,5]

Buy 3 tickets on day 1 at 5 each, total 15. Prices increase by 3 for remaining days.

New prices: [ ,5+3=8,5+3=8,5+3=8,5+3=8,5+3=8]

Buy 3 tickets on day 2 at 8 each, total 24. Prices increase by 3 again.

New prices: [ , ,8+3=11,11,11,11]

Buy 3 tickets on day 3 at 11 each, total 33.

Total cost: 15 + 24 + 33 = 72.

This matches the fourth output.

So, in this case, since all days have the same price, it's optimal to buy as many tickets as possible early, up to m per day.

Wait, but in the first example, it was better to delay purchases to cheaper days.

So, there seems to be a contradiction.

Wait, no, in the first example, buying on cheaper days is better, but in the uniform price case, buying early is better because it minimizes the number of days you have to buy on, thus minimizing the number of times the price increases.

Wait, actually, in the first example, buying on cheaper days is better because the price increases affect future days, but in the uniform price case, since prices are the same, buying early allows you to minimize the number of days you need to buy on.

Wait, but in the first example, buying on day 3 and day 4 was better than buying on day 1 and day 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the price increase applies to all future days, so buying tickets on earlier days increases the prices for more days, whereas buying on later days affects fewer days.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I should try to buy tickets on days where the price is low, but also consider that buying on later days causes the price increase to affect fewer remaining days.

Wait, but in the first example, buying on day 3 and day 4 was better.

In that case, buying on day 3 increases the price for day 4 only, and then buying on day 4 at the new price.

So, perhaps the general strategy is to buy tickets on the cheapest available days, but taking into account the future price increases.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to model this.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I decide to buy x1 tickets on day 1, x2 on day 2, ..., xn on day n, with sum xi = k, and 0 <= xi <= m for each i.

The total cost would be:

sum over i from 1 to n of xi * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of xj)

This is because each ticket bought on day i costs a_i plus the sum of all tickets bought on previous days.

So, cost = sum_{i=1 to n} xi * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} xj)

I need to minimize this cost, given that sum xi = k and 0 <= xi <= m for each i.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints.

This looks similar to a linear programming problem, but with integer constraints, which could be time-consuming for large n.

But n can be up to 3*10^5, so I need an efficient algorithm.

Perhaps there's a way to simplify this expression.

Let me expand the cost expression:

cost = sum_{i=1 to n} xi * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} xi * sum_{j=1 to i-1} xj

The second term can be rewritten as sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i-1} xi * xj

So, cost = sum_{i=1 to n} xi * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i-1} xi * xj

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Let me consider that the price increase is cumulative based on the total tickets bought on previous days.

So, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

Therefore, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize the sum of these costs over all days, with sum x_i = k and 0 <= x_i <= m.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think of this as a dynamic programming problem.

Letâ€™s define dp[i][s], where i is the day index, and s is the total number of tickets bought so far.

Then, dp[i][s] represents the minimum cost to buy s tickets in the first i days.

The recurrence would be:

dp[i][s] = min over x from 0 to min(m, s) of (x * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j)) + dp[i-1][s - x]

But this seems too slow because n and k can be up to 3*10^5 and 10^9, respectively.

I need a better approach.

Let me see if I can find a mathematical formulation or a way to sort the days to prioritize which days to buy on.

Perhaps sorting the days by a_i in ascending order and buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days first.

But, wait, in the first example, buying on day 3 and day 4 (cheaper days) was better than buying on day 1 and day 4.

So, maybe sorting the days by a_i and processing them in increasing order makes sense.

Let me try to think of it this way:

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, but the price increases are based on the total tickets bought on previous days, not on the order of the sorted days.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the contribution of each ticket bought.

Each ticket bought increases the price for all future days by 1.

So, the cost of buying a ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

Wait, that's similar to what I had earlier.

Let me think about the total cost if I buy all k tickets on a single day.

If I buy all k tickets on day 1, the cost is k * a_1, and then the prices increase by k for all remaining days.

If I buy some tickets on day 1 and the rest on later days, the cost would be x1 * a1 + x2 * (a2 + x1) + x3 * (a3 + x1 + x2) + ...

I need to minimize this expression.

This seems similar to a cumulative sum where each term depends on the previous ones.

Maybe I can rearrange the terms.

Let me try to expand the cost:

cost = x1 * a1 + x2 * (a2 + x1) + x3 * (a3 + x1 + x2) + ... + xn * (an + sum_{j=1 to n-1} xj)

This can be written as:

cost = sum_{i=1 to n} xi * a_i + sum_{i=2 to n} xi * sum_{j=1 to i-1} xj

Simplify the second term:

sum_{i=2 to n} xi * sum_{j=1 to i-1} xj = sum_{i=2 to n} sum_{j=1 to i-1} xi * xj

This seems messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that the total cost is the sum of the prices paid for each ticket, considering the price at the time it's bought.

Each ticket bought on day i costs a_i plus the sum of all tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I buy x1 tickets on day 1, x2 on day 2, etc., then the total cost is:

sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j)

Let me define s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

Then, s_i - s_{i-1} = x_i

So, the cost can be written as:

sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is:

sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * s_{i-1}

This still seems complicated.

Wait, s_{i-1} is the total tickets bought before day i.

Maybe I can think of this in terms of prefix sums.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, where the cost of buying on a particular day depends on the cumulative tickets bought before that day.

This sounds similar to a knapsack problem, but with dependencies between the days.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Maybe I can sort the days in a particular order and then decide how many tickets to buy on each day greedily.

Wait, perhaps sorting the days in increasing order of a_i is a good idea.

Then, I can try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

Let me try this with the first example:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

So, the cheapest day is day 4 with a=2, then day 3 with a=4, etc.

Now, I need to buy 3 tickets.

Option 1: Buy 2 tickets on day 4 at price 2 each, total 4. Then, buy 1 ticket on day 3 at price 4 + 2 (since 2 tickets were bought before) = 6, total 6. Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10.

Option 2: Buy 1 ticket on day 3 at price 4, total 4. Then, buy 2 tickets on day 4 at price 2 + 1 (since 1 ticket was bought before) = 3 each, total 6. Total cost: 4 + 6 = 10.

Same total cost.

Another option: Buy all 3 tickets on day 4 at price 2 each, total 6. But then, since I bought 3 tickets, the prices increase by 3 for all previous days. But since I'm buying all on day 4, it doesn't matter. Total cost is 6, but wait, is this allowed?

Wait, the problem says "the prices per ticket for the remaining days will be increased by x". So, if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all days j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

So, if I buy 3 tickets on day 4, there are no remaining days after day 4, so no price increases affect anything. So, total cost is 3 * 2 = 6, which is better than 10.

But according to the example, the minimal cost is 10, not 6. So, what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, in the first example, the minimal cost is 10, but according to this, buying all 3 tickets on day 4 would cost only 6, which is less than 10. So, why isn't that the minimal cost?

Wait, perhaps because m=2, meaning I can buy at most 2 tickets per day. So, I cannot buy 3 tickets on day 4; I can only buy up to 2.

Therefore, in that case, buying 2 tickets on day 4 costs 4, and then I need to buy 1 more ticket on another day.

If I buy 2 tickets on day 4 at price 2 each (total 4), then the prices for remaining days increase by 2.

But there are no remaining days after day 4, so no price increases.

Then, I need to buy 1 more ticket. I have to buy it on one of the previous days.

Wait, but according to the problem, "the prices per ticket for the remaining days will be increased by x", meaning that if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all days j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

In the first example, if I buy 2 tickets on day 4, there are no days j > 4, so no price increases affect any days.

Then, I still need to buy 1 more ticket on one of the previous days, but now the prices on those days have increased by 2.

Wait, but in the first example, the prices were [8,6,4,2].

If I buy 2 tickets on day 4, cost is 4, and no price increases affect other days, because day 4 is the last day.

Therefore, I still need to buy 1 ticket on one of the first three days, but their prices remain the same, since no purchases were made after those days.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, "if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

Since day 4 is the last day, there are no subsequent days, so no price increases.

Therefore, I can buy 2 tickets on day 4 for 4, and then buy 1 ticket on day 3 at price 4, total 4 + 4 = 8, which is better than 10.

But according to the example, the minimal cost is 10, not 8.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the price increases apply retroactively, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, the problem says "all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, in the first example, buying on day 4 doesn't affect any previous days' prices.

Therefore, buying 2 on day 4 and 1 on day 3 should cost 2*2 + 1*4 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is less than 10.

But according to the example, the minimal cost is 10.

This suggests that my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the price increases are cumulative based on all purchases before that day.

Wait, let's read the problem again carefully.

"if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, the price increases only affect days after day i.

In the first example, buying on day 4 doesn't affect any days because there are no days after day 4.

Therefore, buying 2 on day 4 at price 2 each (total 4), and then buying 1 on day 3 at price 4 (total 4), for a total of 8, should be acceptable.

But according to the example, the minimal cost is 10.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the price increases are not just for subsequent days, but also affect the prices for previous days in some way.

Wait, no, the problem says "from day i+1 onwards."

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sequence of purchases.

Maybe the purchases have to be made in order, day by day, and the price increases apply to days after the current day.

In that case, I cannot buy on day 4 first and then on day 3.

Wait, perhaps the purchases must be made in chronological order, meaning I have to decide how many tickets to buy on each day in sequence, knowing that future days' prices will increase based on previous purchases.

In that case, buying on day 1 first would increase the prices for days 2 to 4, and so on.

So, perhaps I need to decide the number of tickets to buy on each day in sequence, keeping track of the cumulative price increases.

In that case, it's not possible to buy on day 4 first and then on day 3.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the purchases have to be made in chronological order.

It just says that buying x tickets on day i increases the prices for days j > i by x.

So, perhaps I can choose the order in which I make the purchases.

But, in reality, the days are in a sequence, and I have to make purchases day by day.

Wait, the problem likely intends that you make purchases day by day, with price increases applying to future days based on past purchases.

In that case, you cannot buy on day 4 and then on day 3; you must make purchases in order from day 1 to day n.

If that's the case, then in the first example, you would have to make purchases on day 1, then day 2, then day 3, then day 4, with price increases applying to future days based on previous purchases.

In that case, the minimal cost would be achieved by buying 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 1 on day 3, and 2 on day 4, as per the example.

Let me verify that:

- Day 1: buy 0 tickets. Price increase for days 2-4 by 0.

- Day 2: buy 0 tickets. Price increase for days 3-4 by 0.

- Day 3: buy 1 ticket at price 4, cost = 4. Price increase for day 4 by 1, so day 4 price becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

- Day 4: buy 2 tickets at price 3, cost = 6.

- Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

Another option:

- Day 1: buy 0 tickets. Price increase for days 2-4 by 0.

- Day 2: buy 0 tickets. Price increase for days 3-4 by 0.

- Day 3: buy 0 tickets. Price increase for day 4 by 0.

- Day 4: buy 2 tickets at price 2, cost = 4. Now, price increase for no days.

- Then, need to buy 1 more ticket on one of the previous days.

- But, I've already passed those days.

Wait, the problem likely expects that all purchases are made in sequence, and you cannot go back to buy on previous days after making purchases on a later day.

So, in that case, the minimal cost is indeed 10, as per the example.

Therefore, the purchases must be made in order from day 1 to day n, and once you've moved on to a later day, you cannot go back to buy on earlier days.

Given that, I need to find a strategy to decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the price increases for future days based on previous purchases.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the number of tickets bought so far and the cumulative price increase.

But with n up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution.

Maybe I can sort the days in some way or find a mathematical formula.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Sort the days based on their original prices a_i in ascending order.

- Then, try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, up to the daily limit m, considering the price increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, but I have to buy tickets in sequence, so I'm not sure if sorting helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can process the days in order, keeping track of the cumulative price increase, and decide how many tickets to buy on each day to minimize the total cost.

But this still seems too slow for large n.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets I buy on each day, x1, x2, ..., xn, with sum xi = k and 0 <= xi <= m.

Then, the total
