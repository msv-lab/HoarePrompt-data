Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of integers, with at most 200 elements, such that the number of increasing subsequences in it is exactly equal to a given number X. X can be as large as 10^18, which is a huge number, so I need to think carefully about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence where elements are strictly increasing, and they maintain their relative order in the array. Also, even empty subsequences are considered increasing. That's important to note.

So, for a given array, how do I calculate the number of increasing subsequences? Well, for any array, the total number of increasing subsequences can be tricky to compute directly, especially for large arrays. But perhaps there's a pattern or a mathematical formula that can help me here.

I recall that for a sequence with distinct elements, the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the length of the sequence. But in this problem, elements can be repeated, and the subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions, even if the elements are the same.

Wait, the problem gives an example: for the array [2, 2], there are two different subsequences equal to [2], because they are in different positions. So, duplicates are allowed, and positions matter.

Hmm. This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I should think about simpler cases first.

Let's start with small values of X and see what arrays would correspond to them.

For X = 2:

The problem says that if X = 2, the output should be an array of length 1 with element 0. So, array [0] has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence [0]. That makes sense.

For X = 5:

The sample output is an array of length 3: [0, 1, 0]. Let's see the increasing subsequences here:

- Empty subsequence

- [0] (first element)

- [0] (second element)

- [0,1] (first and second elements)

- [1] (second element only)

So, that's 5 subsequences. Wait, is that correct? Let me list them again:

1. Empty subsequence

2. [0] (first element)

3. [0] (second element)

4. [1] (second element)

5. [0,1] (first and second elements)

Yes, that's 5. Good.

For X = 13:

The sample output is [2,2,3,4,2]. Let's list the increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [2] (first)

- [2] (second)

- [3]

- [4]

- [2,3]

- [2,4]

- [3,4]

- [2,3,4]

- [2,4] (second 2 and 4)

- [2] (third)

- [2,3] (third and third)

- [2,4] (third and fourth)

- [2,3,4] (third, third, fourth)

Wait, this seems more than 13. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps I need a better way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences for a given array.

Let me think differently. Maybe I can consider building an array that consists of repeated minimal elements, like all zeros, and see how many increasing subsequences I can get from that.

For example, if I have an array of all zeros, say [0,0,0], then the increasing subsequences would be:

- Empty

- [0] (each zero individually)

- [0,0] (various pairs, but since they are equal, they are not strictly increasing)

Wait, strictly increasing means that each subsequent element must be larger than the previous one. So, [0,0] is not strictly increasing. Therefore, only the single zeros and the empty subsequence would be counted in this case.

So, for [0,0,0], number of increasing subsequences would be:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [0] (second)

- [0] (third)

Total of 4.

Similarly, for [0,1], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0,1]

Total of 4.

Wait, but in the sample input for X=5, they provided [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences, as listed earlier.

So, perhaps by introducing some duplicates and varying values, I can control the number of increasing subsequences.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

I recall that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the number of ways to choose elements such that they are in increasing order.

Wait, but that's a bit vague.

Let me think about binary representations or something similar, since X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60.

Wait, 2^60 is approximately 1.1529215e+18, which is less than 10^18 (1e18), but close.

So, perhaps I can represent X in binary and build the array based on that.

Let me consider that.

If I represent X in binary, each bit corresponds to a power of 2.

For example, X=5 is 101 in binary, which is 4 + 1.

Maybe I can build the array such that the number of increasing subsequences is the sum of certain powers of 2 based on the binary representation.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of lengths of the array.

I know that for an array of length N, the number of possible subsequences is 2^N, including the empty subsequence.

But in our case, we need only the strictly increasing subsequences, which is a subset of all possible subsequences.

So, perhaps I can construct an array where the number of strictly increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Is there a way to control this number precisely?

Let me consider building the array incrementally.

Suppose I start with an empty array, which has only one subsequence: the empty one.

Then, if I add one element, say 0, now I have two subsequences: empty and [0].

If I add another element that is larger than the previous one, say 1, then the new increasing subsequences are:

- All previous subsequences

- New subsequences that include the new element at the end

So, in this case, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the previous number plus the number of subsequences that can be extended by the new element.

Wait, perhaps I can formalize this.

Let me define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences in the first i elements of the array.

Then, when I add the (i+1)-th element, say A[i+1], the new increasing subsequences would be:

- All previous increasing subsequences

- All subsequences where A[i+1] is appended to a subsequence ending with a value less than A[i+1]

So, dp[i+1] = dp[i] + (number of elements among the first i that are less than A[i+1])

Wait, is that accurate?

Actually, it's a bit more involved. The number of new increasing subsequences when adding A[i+1] is equal to the number of increasing subsequences in the first i elements that end with a value less than A[i+1].

This seems complicated to keep track of directly.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider a specific construction.

Suppose I build an array that is strictly increasing. For example, [0,1,2,3,...].

In this case, every subsequence is increasing, so the total number of increasing subsequences is 2^N, where N is the length of the array.

But X can be up to 10^18, which would require N up to around 60, since 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18.

But the problem constraints say that the array can have at most 200 elements, which is more than enough.

However, X can be any value up to 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, perhaps I can construct the array by combining multiple strictly increasing segments.

Wait, but subsequences can span across these segments if they form an increasing sequence.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences is the sum of certain powers of 2.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of binary representation of X.

Suppose X is represented in binary as the sum of certain powers of 2.

For example, X=5 is 2^2 + 2^0.

Then, maybe I can construct the array as two separate strictly increasing segments, one contributing 2^2=4 subsequences and another contributing 2^0=1 subsequence.

But how do I ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly the sum of these?

I need to make sure that there are no overlapping or crossing increasing subsequences between these segments.

Maybe I can arrange the array in such a way that the segments are separated, with decreasing values in between, so that no subsequence can span across multiple segments.

For example, suppose I have segments [0,1,2] and [3], with a decreasing value in between, like [0,1,2,-1,3].

In this case, the increasing subsequences would be:

- Subsequences from the first segment: 2^3 = 8 subsequences

- Subsequences from the second segment: 2^1 = 2 subsequences

- But there might be subsequences that include elements from both segments if the second segment is larger than the first.

Wait, in this case, [0,1,2,3] would be a valid increasing subsequence.

So, that would make the total number of increasing subsequences more than 8 + 2.

That's not what I want.

So, I need to prevent that.

Perhaps I can arrange the segments so that the second segment starts with a value smaller than the first segment's minimum.

For example, [0,1,2,-1,0].

Then, the increasing subsequences would be:

- From the first segment: [0],[1],[2],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[0,1,2], and empty -> 8

- From the second segment: [-1],[0],[-1,0], and empty -> 4

- But the empty subsequence is counted twice, so total is 8 + 4 - 1 = 11.

Wait, but in reality, the empty subsequence is only counted once.

Wait, no, in this construction, the empty subsequence is only present once.

Wait, I need to be careful with how I count.

Actually, the total number of increasing subsequences in the combined array would be the sum of the increasing subsequences in each segment, because no subsequence can span across both segments if the second segment has values less than the first segment's minimum.

Wait, in the example [0,1,2,-1,0], the possible increasing subsequences are:

- From [0,1,2]: empty, [0], [1], [2], [0,1], [0,2], [1,2], [0,1,2] -> 8

- From [-1,0]: empty, [-1], [0], [-1,0] -> 4

- Total: 8 + 4 = 12

But actually, the empty subsequence is only counted once, so it should be 8 + 4 - 1 = 11.

Wait, but in reality, the empty subsequence is only one instance, so total unique increasing subsequences are 11.

But in terms of counting for this problem, since each subsequence corresponds to a specific set of positions, even if two subsequences have the same values but from different positions, they are considered different.

So, in this case, the total number of increasing subsequences would indeed be 8 + 4 = 12, because the empty subsequence is only one, but in the problem's context, it's considered once.

Wait, no, the problem says that two subsequences are considered different if they correspond to different positions, even if the elements are the same.

So, in this case, the empty subsequence is unique, and all other subsequences are based on positions.

Therefore, total increasing subsequences would be 8 (from the first segment) + 4 (from the second segment) = 12.

But in reality, it's 8 + 4 = 12, including the empty subsequence.

Wait, but the empty subsequence is only one, but in the counts above, it's included in both segments.

So, to avoid double-counting, it should be 8 + 4 - 1 = 11.

But in reality, when you consider the positions, the empty subsequence is only one.

So, perhaps the total is 11.

But I'm getting confused here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I build the array as a sequence of decreasing runs, where each run is strictly increasing, and each run is separated by a drop in value.

For example, [a,b,c,d,e,f,g], where a < b < c, and d < e < f < g, but g < c.

In this case, no increasing subsequence can cross from one run to another, because the second run starts with a value less than the end of the first run.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the increasing subsequences in each run.

Each run being strictly increasing, the number of increasing subsequences in a run of length k is 2^k.

So, if I have multiple such runs, with no possible crossing increasing subsequences, then the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of 2^k for each run.

Additionally, I need to account for the empty subsequence, which is counted only once.

Wait, but in the problem, the empty subsequence is considered as one subsequence.

So, if I have multiple runs, each contributing 2^k subsequences, including the empty one, then the total would be sum over all runs of 2^k, minus the number of runs (since each run includes one empty subsequence), plus one (for the global empty subsequence).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of disjoint contributions.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose I have m runs, with lengths k1, k2, ..., km.

Each run contributes 2^{k_i} subsequences, including the empty one.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences in the entire array would be the sum of 2^{k_i} for all i, minus m (to remove the m empty subsequences from each run), plus 1 (for the global empty subsequence).

So, total increasing subsequences = sum_{i=1 to m} 2^{k_i} - m + 1.

But in the problem, the empty subsequence is considered as one subsequence, and all non-empty subsequences are counted based on their positions.

So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number being sum_{i=1 to m} 2^{k_i} - m + 1.

But this seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using binary representations.

Given X, I can represent it in binary, and each bit corresponds to a run of a certain length.

For example, if X is 5, which is 101 in binary, corresponding to 2^2 + 2^0 = 4 + 1.

Then, I can have two runs: one of length 2 (contributing 2^2 = 4 subsequences) and one of length 0 (contributing 2^0 = 1 subsequence).

Wait, length 0 is just the empty subsequence.

But I need to have actual runs of positive lengths.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this approach.

Let me consider that each run contributes 2^{k_i} - 1 non-empty increasing subsequences, plus the empty subsequence.

Wait, no, 2^{k_i} includes the empty subsequence.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each run contributes 2^{k_i} subsequences, including the empty one.

Then, for m runs, total increasing subsequences would be sum_{i=1 to m} 2^{k_i} - m + 1, as mentioned earlier.

Wait, but in practice, it's complicated.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

I recall that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be computed using dynamic programming.

Specifically, for each position, you can keep track of the number of increasing subsequences ending at that position.

Then, the total is the sum over all positions of the number of increasing subsequences ending at that position, plus the empty subsequence.

But again, this is not directly helpful for constructing the array.

Maybe I need to think about the binary representation of X and build the array accordingly.

Let's consider that.

Given X, represent it in binary.

For example, X = 5 is 101 in binary, which is 2^2 + 2^0.

So, I need to build runs of lengths such that 2^{k1} + 2^{k2} + ... = X.

But as I saw earlier, if I have multiple runs, the total number of increasing subsequences is sum of 2^{k_i} - m + 1.

This doesn't directly add up to X.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust for the overlaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can arrange the runs in such a way that no increasing subsequence can span across multiple runs, by ensuring that the starting value of each run is less than the ending value of the previous run.

Wait, but that would allow subsequences to span across runs.

Maybe I need to ensure that the starting value of each run is less than or equal to the ending value of the previous run, but not strictly increasing.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think of a different strategy.

Suppose I fix the number of runs and their lengths, and try to compute the total number of increasing subsequences.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Perhaps I can look for a minimal representation.

I notice that in the sample input for X=2, the output is an array of length 1: [0], which has 2 increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

For X=5, the output is [0,1,0], which has 5 increasing subsequences, as listed earlier.

For X=13, it's [2,2,3,4,2], which presumably has 13 increasing subsequences.

And for X=37, it's [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1], which should have 37 increasing subsequences.

I need to find a general way to construct such arrays.

Let me consider that for X=1, the array would be empty, but the problem says X starts from 2.

Wait, X=1 is not allowed, since X >=2.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, X starts from 2.

Wait, the problem says 2 <= X <= 10^18.

So, X=1 is not considered.

But for X=2, the minimal array is [0], which has 2 increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

Wait, but the problem mentions that even empty subsequence is considered increasing, but for X=1, we would need only the empty subsequence, which would correspond to an empty array.

But the problem states X >=2, so we don't need to handle X=1.

Good.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of building an array that has runs of increasing sequences, each contributing a certain number of increasing subsequences.

But I need to make sure that the total is exactly X.

This seems difficult.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I build an array that is strictly increasing up to a certain point, and then decreases, and then increases again, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I can look for a way to represent X as a sum of powers of 2, which correspond to the number of increasing subsequences contributed by different parts of the array.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X to determine the lengths of the runs.

For example, if X=5, which is 101 in binary, corresponding to 2^2 + 2^0 = 4 +1.

Then, I can have two runs: one of length 2 (contributing 2^2=4 increasing subsequences) and one of length 0 (which would contribute 2^0=1 subsequence).

But a run of length 0 doesn't make sense in practice; it would just be the empty subsequence.

So, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, maybe I can have runs of lengths corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of X, minus one for the empty subsequence.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I build an array that consists of a single strictly increasing sequence of length N.

Then, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^N.

So, if X is a power of 2, say X=2^k, then I can simply build an array of length k that is strictly increasing.

For example, for X=4 (which is 2^2), an array like [0,1] would have 2^2=4 increasing subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1].

Similarly, for X=8 (2^3), an array like [0,1,2] would have 2^3=8 increasing subsequences.

But X can be any number up to 10^18, so I need to handle sums of different powers of 2.

So, perhaps I can represent X as a sum of powers of 2, and then build corresponding runs in the array.

But as I saw earlier, if I have multiple runs that are separated properly, such that no increasing subsequence can span across them, then the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the increasing subsequences from each run.

Wait, but in practice, it's tricky to ensure that no increasing subsequence spans across runs.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have m runs, each of length k1, k2, ..., km.

Each run is strictly increasing.

I need to arrange these runs in the array such that no increasing subsequence can span across more than one run.

To achieve this, I need to ensure that the starting value of each run is less than or equal to the ending value of the previous run, but not strictly greater.

Wait, no. If I want to prevent any increasing subsequence from spanning across runs, I need to ensure that the starting value of each run is less than or equal to the ending value of the previous run.

Wait, but if it's equal, you can still have increasing subsequences that include elements from both runs, as long as the values are equal.

But in the problem, since subsequences are considered based on positions, not just values, I need to make sure that no subsequence can be increasing across runs.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the starting value of each run is less than the ending value of the previous run.

Wait, but that's not possible if the runs are strictly increasing.

Wait, maybe I need to have the starting value of each run be less than or equal to the ending value of the previous run, but make sure that the runs are separated by decreasing values in between.

For example, have a decreasing value between runs to prevent any increasing subsequence from spanning across them.

Let me try this.

Suppose I have runs [a,b,c] and [d,e], with c > d.

Then, in the array: a < b < c, d < e, and c > d.

In this case, [a,b,c,d] is not increasing because c > d.

Similarly, [b,c,d,e] is not increasing for the same reason.

So, no increasing subsequence can span across both runs.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the increasing subsequences in each run.

For the first run [a,b,c]: 2^3 = 8 subsequences.

For the second run [d,e]: 2^2 = 4 subsequences.

But in reality, the empty subsequence is counted in both, but in the overall array, it's only one empty subsequence.

Wait, but in terms of counting unique subsequences based on positions, the total would be 8 + 4 -1 =11, because the empty subsequence is shared.

But in the problem's context, the empty subsequence is considered only once.

So, total increasing subsequences would be 11.

But is that accurate?

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Each subsequence corresponds to a specific set of positions, so even if two subsequences have the same values but from different positions, they are considered different.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences is indeed 8 + 4 =12, including the empty subsequence.

Wait, but in reality, the empty subsequence is only one.

Wait, no, in this construction, each run includes its own empty subsequence, but in the overall array, the empty subsequence is only one.

So, perhaps the total is 8 + 4 -1 =11.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider a smaller example.

Take X=5.

Sample output: [0,1,0]

Increasing subsequences:

- Empty

- [0] (first)

- [0] (second)

- [1]

- [0,1]

Total:5.

So, in this case, it's two runs: [0,1] and [0].

The first run has 2^2=4 subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1].

The second run has 2^1=2 subsequences: empty, [0].

Total would be 4 + 2 -1 =5, accounting for the shared empty subsequence.

This matches the sample.

Similarly, for X=13, the sample output is [2,2,3,4,2].

Let's see:

Possible runs: [2,2,3,4], and [2].

Wait, but [2,2,3,4] is not strictly increasing; it has two 2's.

Wait, but the problem allows duplicates, as long as the subsequences are strictly increasing.

Wait, no, strictly increasing means that each element in the subsequence is larger than the previous one.

So, in [2,2,3,4], the subsequence [2,3,4] is strictly increasing, but [2,2] is not.

So, in this array, the increasing subsequences would include:

- From [2,2,3,4]: empty, [2](first), [2](second), [3], [4], [2,3], [2,4], [3,4], [2,3,4] (first 2), [2,3,4] (second 2) -> total 10

- From [2]: empty, [2] -> 2

- Total: 10 + 2 -1 =11, but the sample is for X=13.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Maybe there's another way to count this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the total number of increasing subsequences is the product of the number of increasing subsequences in each run, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is needed here, but that's getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I build the array by repeating a certain pattern.

For example, having multiple copies of the same value.

Wait, but as I saw earlier, having multiple copies of the same value limits the strictly increasing subsequences.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use negative values to reset the increasing subsequences.

Wait, in the sample for X=37, the array is [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1].

This has runs of [-1,-1,0,0,2,3] and then [-1].

It's unclear how to generalize this.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences in an array is equal to the sum over all positions of the number of increasing subsequences ending at that position.

This can be computed using dynamic programming.

Let me define dp[i] as the number of increasing subsequences ending at position i.

Then, dp[i] = 1 (for the subsequence consisting only of a_i) plus the sum of dp[j] for all j < i where a_j < a_i.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences is the sum of dp[i] for all i, plus 1 for the empty subsequence.

But again, this is for computation, not for construction.

I need a way to construct the array such that this sum is exactly X.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that for X=2^k, I can build a strictly increasing sequence of length k.

For general X, I can represent it in binary and build corresponding runs.

But as I saw earlier, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of 2^{k_i}, but accounting for overlaps is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can arrange the runs in such a way that their contributions are additive.

For example, by ensuring that no increasing subsequence can span across multiple runs.

To do that, I need to separate the runs with a drop in value.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have m runs, each strictly increasing, and separated by values that are less than or equal to the previous run's last value.

In this case, no increasing subsequence can span across multiple runs.

Therefore, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the increasing subsequences in each run, minus the m empty subsequences, plus one global empty subsequence.

So, total increasing subsequences = sum_{i=1 to m} (2^{k_i}) - m +1.

I need this to be equal to X.

So, sum_{i=1 to m} 2^{k_i} - m +1 = X.

I need to find m and k1, k2, ..., km such that this equation holds, and the array length is at most 200.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, which is about 2^60, and m + sum k_i <=200, this seems feasible.

So, perhaps I can represent X as sum_{i=1 to m} 2^{k_i} - m +1.

I need to solve for k1, k2, ..., km.

This seems similar to representing X in binary, but with some adjustments.

Wait, perhaps I can represent X-1 as the sum of powers of 2, since sum 2^{k_i} - m = X -1.

So, sum 2^{k_i} - m = X -1.

Wait, but m is the number of runs.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to fix m and see if I can find k1, k2, ..., km.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider m=1 first.

If m=1, then 2^{k1} -1 +1 = 2^{k1} = X.

So, if X is a power of 2, I can just have one run of length k1.

For example, X=4, k1=2, array [0,1], which has 4 increasing subsequences: empty, [0], [1], [0,1].

Similarly, X=8, k1=3, array [0,1,2], with 8 increasing subsequences.

But X can be any number, not just powers of 2.

So, I need m >=1, and choose k1, k2, ..., km such that sum 2^{k_i} - m +1 =X.

I need to solve for k1, k2, ..., km.

This seems like solving for sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

Given that m is the number of terms, this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can fix m = number of 1s in the binary representation of X.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider an example.

Take X=5.

Then, 5 in binary is 101, which is 2^2 + 2^0.

So, m=2, k1=2, k2=0.

Then, sum 2^{k_i} - m +1 = 4 +1 -2 +1 =4. Wait, that's not equal to 5.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have m runs, with lengths k1, k2, ..., km.

Each run contributes 2^{k_i} subsequences, including the empty one.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences in the array would be sum_{i=1 to m} (2^{k_i} -1) +1, where -1 removes the empty subsequence from each run, and +1 adds the global empty subsequence.

So, total = sum 2^{k_i} - m +1.

I need this to be equal to X.

So, sum 2^{k_i} - m +1 =X.

Therefore, sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

Given m, I can choose k_i such that sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

But m is the number of runs, which is also the number of terms in the sum.

This seems similar to representing X + m -1 as a sum of m powers of 2.

But m is variable.

Wait, perhaps I can choose m such that X + m -1 can be expressed as a sum of m distinct powers of 2.

But X + m -1 might not be a sum of m distinct powers of 2.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to fix m.

Suppose m is the number of 1s in the binary representation of X.

Then, sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

But I'm not sure.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for any X >=2, I can represent it as sum of powers of 2, and build corresponding runs.

But I need to handle the overlaps correctly.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by concatenating runs of different lengths, separated by decreasing values to prevent overlapping increasing subsequences.

Let me try to implement this idea.

First, represent X-1 as a sum of powers of 2.

Since X-1 can be represented uniquely in binary.

Let me take the binary representation of X-1.

Each 1 in the binary representation corresponds to a run of a certain length.

Specifically, if the binary representation has a 1 at position i (0-indexed from the right), then I can have a run of length i+1.

Wait, position i corresponds to 2^i.

So, for each set bit in X-1, I create a run of length equal to the position of the bit plus one.

Wait, perhaps position i (0-indexed) corresponds to 2^i, so run length could be i.

But I need to make sure that sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose I fix m, the number of runs.

Then, sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

I need to choose m and k_i such that this holds, and sum k_i <=200.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, m can be up to 60 or so.

But this seems too vague for a general solution.

Perhaps I need to look for a minimal m.

Wait, maybe I can set m = sum of the number of runs needed to represent X-1 in binary.

Wait, I'm getting stuck in circular logic here.

Let me try to look for a different strategy altogether.

Suppose I build the array by repeating a minimal value, say 0, multiple times.

For example, [0,0,0,...].

In this case, the only increasing subsequences are the empty one and the single [0] for each occurrence.

Wait, but [0,0] is not strictly increasing, so only single [0]'s and the empty subsequence.

So, for n zeros, the number of increasing subsequences is n +1 (n single [0]'s and the empty one).

But for X=5, I would need n=4, but the sample output is [0,1,0], which has 5 subsequences.

So, this approach doesn't cover all cases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can build the array by having a combination of different values, some increasing and some not, to reach the desired X.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for any array, the number of increasing subsequences is at least the number of elements plus one (for the empty subsequence), and at most 2^n.

Given that n <=200, and X can be up to 10^18, which is less than 2^60, it's feasible.

So, I need to find an array of up to 200 elements where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that, perhaps I can aim for a minimal n.

But minimizing n is not required; I just need n <=200.

Let me consider that for n=1, X=2.

For n=2, X can be 3 or 4, depending on whether the array is strictly increasing or not.

Wait, for n=2:

- If a1 < a2, then the increasing subsequences are: empty, [a1], [a2], [a1,a2] -> total 4.

- If a1 >= a2, then: empty, [a1], [a2] -> total 3.

So, for n=2, X can be 3 or 4.

Similarly, for n=3:

- If strictly increasing: empty + 3 singles + 3 doubles + 1 triple -> 8.

- If not strictly increasing: fewer subsequences.

So, for n=3, X can be up to 8.

But in the sample, for X=5, they used n=3.

So, it's possible to have X=5 with n=3.

Wait, but in the strictly increasing case, n=3 gives X=8.

But with some elements equal or decreasing, X can be less.

For example, in [0,1,0]:

- empty

- [0](first)

- [1]

- [0](second)

- [0,1]

Total:5.

So, by introducing duplicates and decreases, I can control X.

But this is still not a general method.

Let me consider that the number of increasing subsequences is equal to the number of non-empty subsets that are strictly increasing plus one (for the empty subsequence).

But again, this doesn't directly help in construction.

Perhaps I need to accept that constructing the array is non-trivial and look for a different approach.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for any X >=2, I can build an array that achieves it.

Given that n <=200, and X can be up to 10^18, which is manageable.

So, perhaps I can implement a method that, given X, constructs the array by representing X in terms of contributions from different positions.

But I'm not sure how to do that systematically.

Let me consider that the problem allows me to print any array that satisfies the condition, as long as n <=200.

So, perhaps I can build the array incrementally, choosing elements such that the total number of increasing subsequences reaches X.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that adding a new element to the array can increase the number of increasing subsequences by a certain amount, depending on its value relative to the previous elements.

But implementing this dynamically seems too time-consuming.

Let me consider that for X=2^k, I can build a strictly increasing sequence of length k.

For general X, I can represent it as a sum of powers of 2 and build corresponding sequences.

But as I saw earlier, combining them requires careful separation to avoid overlapping increasing subsequences.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that this is a complex problem and look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can look for a way to represent X as a sum of distinct powers of 2, each corresponding to a run of a certain length in the array, separated in such a way that no increasing subsequence can span across multiple runs.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences would be the sum of the increasing subsequences from each run, minus the m empty subsequences, plus one global empty subsequence.

So, sum 2^{k_i} - m +1 =X.

Therefore, sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1.

Given m and X, I can solve for sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1, with m being the number of runs.

This seems recursive.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible m and see if X + m -1 can be expressed as a sum of m distinct powers of 2.

But X can be up to 10^18, and m up to, say, 60, since 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18.

This seems computationally intensive.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for X=2, n=1 is sufficient.

For X=3, n=2 with a non-increasing sequence: [a,b] where a >= b, giving empty, [a], [b].

For X=4, n=2 with a < b, giving empty, [a], [b], [a,b].

For X=5, n=3 with [0,1,0], as in the sample.

Wait, but in the sample, n=3 for X=5.

Similarly, for X=13, n=5.

For X=37, n=7.

So, perhaps n can be determined based on X.

But I need a general method.

Let me consider that the minimal n required is the smallest integer such that 2^n >=X.

But in the sample, for X=5, 2^3=8 >=5, so n=3 is sufficient, which matches the sample.

Similarly, for X=13, 2^4=16 >=13, but they used n=5.

Maybe n doesn't have to be minimal.

Given that n <=200, I can aim for n up to 60 or so, since 2^60 is about 1.1529215e+18.

So, perhaps I can set n=60, which would give 2^60 subsequences, which covers up to X=10^18.

But for smaller X, I need to adjust the array accordingly.

But this seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can build the array by including runs of different lengths, each contributing a certain number of increasing subsequences, and adjust the array to reach exactly X.

But I'm still stuck.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that I need to represent X in terms of contributions from different parts of the array and proceed accordingly.

Let me consider that for X=5, I can represent it as 4 +1, corresponding to runs of length 2 and 0.

But a run of length 0 is not practical.

Alternatively, perhaps represent X as sum of distinct powers of 2, each corresponding to a run, and arrange the runs such that no increasing subsequence spans across them.

Given that, perhaps I can set the runs in decreasing order, with separators in between.

But I'm not sure.

At this point, I think I need to implement a method that, given X, finds m and k1, k2, ..., km such that sum 2^{k_i} = X + m -1, and then builds the array accordingly.

But I need to ensure that the array has at most 200 elements.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over possible m, from 1 up to, say, 60, and see if X + m -1 can be expressed as a sum of m distinct powers of 2.

If so, then I can build m runs, each of length k_i, arranged in such a way that no increasing subsequence can span across runs.

To prevent spanning, I can separate the runs with decreasing values.

For example, after each run, insert a value that is less than the end of the previous run.

This way, no increasing subsequence can cross from one run to the next.

Then, the total number of increasing subsequences would be sum 2^{k_i}, minus m (for the m empty subsequences from each run), plus
