Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower using exactly n moves. In each move, he can either add one cube to the top of the tower or remove one cube from the top. The question is, after these n moves, can he have exactly m cubes in the tower?

First, I need to understand the operations. Each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top. That means he can't remove a cube from a level that's not the top; it has to be the most recently added one. So, it's like a stack data structure, where you only access the top element.

Let me think about the initial state. The tower starts with zero cubes. So, if he makes zero moves, the tower has zero cubes, but since n is at least 1, he has to make at least one move.

Let's consider some examples to get a feel for the problem.

Example 1:

n = 3, m = 3

Possible sequence:

Add 1 (tower has 1 cube)

Add 1 (tower has 2 cubes)

Add 1 (tower has 3 cubes)

So, yes, it's possible. The answer is "Yes".

Example 2:

n = 2, m = 4

Possible sequence:

Add 1 (1)

Add 1 (2)

Wait, only 2 moves result in 2 cubes, not 4. So, it's impossible. "No".

Example 3:

n = 5, m = 3

Possible sequence:

Add 1 (1)

Add 1 (2)

Add 1 (3)

Remove 1 (2)

Add 1 (3)

So, yes, it's possible. "Yes".

From these examples, it seems that the number of adds and removes needs to be such that the final number of cubes is m after n moves.

Let me try to generalize this.

Letâ€™s denote:

- a = number of add operations

- r = number of remove operations

We have:

a + r = n (total moves)

And the final number of cubes is:

m = a - r

Because each add increases the cube count by 1, and each remove decreases it by 1.

So, we have two equations:

1. a + r = n

2. a - r = m

We can solve these equations for a and r:

Adding both equations: 2a = n + m => a = (n + m)/2

Subtracting the second equation from the first: 2r = n - m => r = (n - m)/2

For a and r to be valid, they must be non-negative integers because you can't have a fraction of a move.

So, the conditions are:

1. (n + m)/2 is an integer.

2. (n - m)/2 is an integer.

3. a >= 0 and r >= 0, which implies:

- (n + m)/2 >= 0

- (n - m)/2 >= 0

But since n and m are both at least 1, and n can be greater than, equal to, or less than m, I need to consider these inequalities.

Wait, but m can be less than n, equal to n, or greater than n, depending on the operations.

But in reality, since each remove operation can only remove a cube that was previously added, the sequence must be such that you don't try to remove a cube when the tower is empty.

This seems like a potential constraint, but for the purpose of just determining if it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves, perhaps it's sufficient to check the conditions above.

Let me verify with the examples:

Example 1:

n = 3, m = 3

a = (3 + 3)/2 = 3

r = (3 - 3)/2 = 0

Both are integers and non-negative. So, "Yes".

Example 2:

n = 2, m = 4

a = (2 + 4)/2 = 3

r = (2 - 4)/2 = -1

r is negative, which is invalid. So, "No".

Example 3:

n = 5, m = 3

a = (5 + 3)/2 = 4

r = (5 - 3)/2 = 1

Both are integers and non-negative. So, "Yes".

Seems correct.

Let me consider another example:

n = 1, m = 1

a = (1 + 1)/2 = 1

r = (1 - 1)/2 = 0

" Yes ".

n = 1, m = 0

a = (1 + 0)/2 = 0.5, which is not an integer. Invalid. " No ".

n = 1, m = 2

a = (1 + 2)/2 = 1.5, not integer. " No ".

n = 2, m = 0

a = (2 + 0)/2 = 1

r = (2 - 0)/2 = 1

" Yes ".

So, it seems that as long as (n + m)/2 and (n - m)/2 are integers and non-negative, it's possible.

Now, looking at the reference solution:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(b, c) = map(int, input().split())

q = (b, c)

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif a % 2 == b % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

Wait, this seems a bit messy.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and m.

Then, it stores (b, c) in q, which is not used later.

Then, it has conditions:

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif a % 2 == b % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, let's analyze this.

First, b is n, and c is m.

So, if n == m:

print 'YES'

This makes sense only if n == m and it's possible.

From earlier analysis, if n == m, then a = n, r = 0.

a = n, which is an integer, and r = 0, which is an integer and non-negative.

So, it's possible only if n == m and n is even? Wait, no, n can be any positive integer.

Wait, no, a = n, r = 0 is always valid as long as n >= 0 and r >= 0, which they are.

But, in the first example, n = 3, m = 3, which is "Yes".

Second test case, n = 2, m = 4, which is "No", but according to this, b == c is False, b < c is True, so print 'NO', which is correct.

Third test case, n = 5, m = 3, b < c is False, so go to next condition.

a % 2 == b % 2, where a is t, the number of test cases, which is 3, and b is n, which is 5.

3 % 2 == 1, 5 % 2 == 1, so True, print 'Yes', which is correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, t = 3, n = 3, m = 3.

a % 2 == b % 2 is 3 % 2 == 3 % 2, which is True, so it would print 'Yes', which matches the expected output.

In the second test case, t = 3, n = 2, m = 4.

b < c is True, so print 'NO'.

Third test case, t = 3, n = 5, m = 3.

b < c is False, check a % 2 == b % 2, which is 3 % 2 == 1, and 5 % 2 == 1, so True, print 'Yes'.

So, in this specific set of test cases, it seems to work.

But is this logic general?

Wait, a is t, the number of test cases, which is 3 in this input.

But in other test cases, t can be different, up to 100.

So, this seems fishy.

Let me check another test case.

Suppose t = 4

Test case 1: n = 4, m = 2

a = (4 + 2)/2 = 3, r = (4 - 2)/2 = 1, both integers, non-negative, "Yes"

Test case 2: n = 3, m = 2

a = (3 + 2)/2 = 2.5, not integer, "No"

Test case 3: n = 2, m = 0

a = 1, r = 1, "Yes"

Test case 4: n = 1, m = 1

a = 1, r = 0, "Yes"

According to the reference solution:

For t = 4

First test case: n = 4, m = 2

b == c? 4 == 2? No

b < c? 4 < 2? No

a % 2 == b % 2? a = 4, b = 4, 4 % 2 == 0, 4 % 2 == 0, True, print 'Yes'

Second test case: n = 3, m = 2

b == c? 3 == 2? No

b < c? 3 < 2? No

a % 2 == b % 2? a = 4, b = 3, 4 % 2 == 0, 3 % 2 == 1, False, print 'No'

Third test case: n = 2, m = 0

b == c? 2 == 0? No

b < c? 2 < 0? No

a % 2 == b % 2? a = 4, b = 2, both even, True, print 'Yes'

Fourth test case: n = 1, m = 1

b == c? 1 == 1, print 'YES'

So, in this case, it works correctly.

But is this general?

Wait, in the reference solution, it uses 'a' which is t, the number of test cases, which is specific to the input provided.

But in general, t can be any number from 1 to 100, and using t % 2 == n % 2 might not always hold.

Wait, but in the problem, t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and m are given.

So, t is independent of n and m.

So, using t % 2 == n % 2 is not logical.

It's just coinciding in the given test cases.

Let me consider another test case where t = 2

Test case 1: n = 1, m = 1

a = 1, r = 0, "Yes"

Test case 2: n = 2, m = 0

a = 1, r = 1, "Yes"

According to the reference solution:

First test case: n = 1, m = 1

b == c? 1 == 1, print 'YES'

Second test case: n = 2, m = 0

b == c? 2 == 0? No

b < c? 2 < 0? No

a % 2 == b % 2? a = 2, b = 2, both even, True, print 'Yes'

Which is correct.

But consider t = 3

Test case 1: n = 2, m = 2

a = (2 + 2)/2 = 2, r = 0, "Yes"

Test case 2: n = 3, m = 1

a = (3 + 1)/2 = 2, r = (3 - 1)/2 = 1, "Yes"

Test case 3: n = 4, m = 0

a = 2, r = 2, "Yes"

According to the reference solution:

First test case: n = 2, m = 2

b == c? 2 == 2, print 'YES'

Second test case: n = 3, m = 1

b == c? 3 == 1? No

b < c? 3 < 1? No

a % 2 == b % 2? a = 3, b = 3, both odd, True, print 'Yes'

Third test case: n = 4, m = 0

b == c? 4 == 0? No

b < c? 4 < 0? No

a % 2 == b % 2? a = 3 (odd), b = 4 (even), False, print 'No'

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, it should be "Yes".

So, in this case, the reference solution would print 'No' for the third test case, which should be 'Yes'.

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it seemed to work.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me look back at the reference solution:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(b, c) = map(int, input().split())

q = (b, c)

if b == c:

print('YES')

elif b < c:

print('NO')

elif a % 2 == b % 2:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, the condition is:

- If b == c, print 'YES'

- Else if b < c, print 'NO'

- Else if a % 2 == b % 2, print 'Yes'

- Else, print 'No'

From our earlier analysis, the correct conditions should be:

- If (b + c) is even and (b - c) is even, and (b + c)/2 >= 0 and (b - c)/2 >= 0, then "Yes", else "No"

But in the reference solution, it's checking a % 2 == b % 2, where a is t, the number of test cases.

This seems incorrect because t is independent of the values of n and m.

In the test case I just considered, t = 3, and for n = 4, m = 0, which should be "Yes", but according to a % 2 == b % 2, 3 % 2 == 1 and 4 % 2 == 0, which is False, so it would print 'No', which is wrong.

Hence, the reference solution is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
