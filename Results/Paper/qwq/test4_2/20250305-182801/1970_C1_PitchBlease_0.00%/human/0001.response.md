Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game being played on a tree structure with n nodes. The tree has exactly two leaves, which makes it sort of like an array because in an array, the endpoints are like leaves in a tree. The game is played over t rounds, but in this specific version, t is always 1, so I only need to handle one round.

In each round, the game starts with a stone on one node, which is activated, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor. Ron starts first, then Hermione, and they alternate until someone can't make a move, meaning they lose.

The task is to determine who wins if both play optimally, given the starting node for each round. Since t=1, I only need to determine the winner for one starting node.

First, I need to understand the structure of the tree. It's mentioned that the tree has exactly two leaves. In a tree, leaves are nodes with only one edge. So, in this case, there are exactly two such nodes. This is important because it affects how the game progresses.

Given that the tree has only two leaves, it must be a straight path connecting these two leaves, with possibly some branches along the way. But since it's a tree, there are no cycles, so it's a connected acyclic graph.

Wait, but the problem says it's "array-like," which suggests it's more linear, like a path graph, where each node is connected in a straight line, similar to an array.

But it also says "it has exactly two leaves," which is true for a path graph, as only the endpoints have degree one.

However, it also says "it can thus be seen as an array," which reinforces the idea that it's essentially a linear structure.

So, I can probably model this tree as a linear structure, like an array, where each node is connected to its neighbors in a sequence.

Given that, the game is about moving a stone along this path, activating nodes as we go.

Now, the game is turn-based, with Ron moving first, then Hermione, and so on, alternately.

The player who cannot make a move loses.

I need to determine, for a given starting node, who wins if both play optimally.

Since t=1, I only need to handle one starting node.

First, I need to represent the tree structure based on the input.

The input consists of:

- n (number of nodes, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5)

- t (number of rounds, but t=1)

- n-1 lines of edges, each with two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n)

- t integers corresponding to the starting nodes for each round

But since t=1, there's only one starting node.

So, I need to read n, t, then n-1 edges, and then one starting node.

Wait, actually, the last line contains t integers, but t=1, so it's one integer.

Alright.

Now, the problem is to determine who wins the game for this starting node.

Given that the tree is like an array, with two leaves, I can think of it as a linear path.

In such a structure, the game is similar to moving along this path, activating nodes as we go.

But wait, in the game, you can only move to an inactive neighbor.

So, it's like moving along the path, but you can't revisit nodes.

Also, the game alternates between Ron and Hermione, with Ron starting first.

I need to find out who wins if both play optimally.

Optimal play typically means that each player makes the best possible move to ensure they win.

In games like these, it's often about the parity of the number of moves available.

For example, if the total number of moves is even, and Ron starts, then Hermione would make the last move, but since the player who cannot move loses, it's about who runs out of moves first.

Wait, let's think differently.

In this game, the total number of moves is equal to the number of nodes minus one, because starting from one node, you can move to n-1 other nodes.

But, in reality, since the tree is not necessarily a straight path, but has branches, the number of moves depends on the structure.

Wait, but the problem says the tree has exactly two leaves, meaning it's essentially a straight path with two endpoints.

So, in that case, it's like a path graph, where each node is connected in a sequence.

So, the total number of moves would be n-1, as you start from one node and move to n-1 other nodes.

But, since the players alternate turns, the player who makes the last move is the one who moves on the (n-1)-th step.

If n-1 is even, then Ron makes the last move, because he starts first and they alternate.

If n-1 is odd, then Hermione makes the last move.

Wait, no.

Let's think about it differently.

Total moves = n-1.

Ron makes the first move, then Hermione, then Ron, and so on.

So, if n-1 is even, Ron makes the last move.

If n-1 is odd, Hermione makes the last move.

But, the player who cannot make a move loses.

So, if n-1 is even, Ron makes the last move, and Hermione cannot move after that, so Hermione loses.

Similarly, if n-1 is odd, Hermione makes the last move, and Ron cannot move after that, so Ron loses.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Is it really dependent only on the total number of moves, regardless of the starting position?

Wait, no, because the starting position might affect the number of moves possible.

Wait, in a straight path, starting from different positions might change the number of moves.

Wait, no, in a straight path, starting from any position, the total number of moves is still n-1, because you have to activate all nodes.

Wait, but in this game, you can only move to an inactive neighbor.

So, from the starting node, you can move to one neighbor, then to another, and so on, but you can't move back to a node you've already visited because it's already active.

Wait, actually, in this game, once a node is active, you can't move back to it.

So, it's not like traversing the entire tree; it's more like moving along the path, activating nodes one by one, without being able to go back.

So, in a straight path with two leaves, the game is essentially moving from the starting node towards one of the leaves, activating nodes along the way.

But, since the tree has only two leaves, and it's a tree with no cycles, it's a single path.

Wait, but actually, the tree can have branches, but with only two leaves, it must be a straight path.

Wait, no, in a tree with only two leaves, it must be a straight path, because any branch would create additional leaves.

Wait, no, in a tree, leaves are nodes with degree one.

If there are only two leaves, it must be a straight path.

So, it's essentially a path graph.

So, the tree is a path with n nodes.

Now, the game is played by moving along this path, activating nodes one by one, starting from the given starting node.

Ron moves first, then Hermione, and so on.

The player who cannot make a move loses.

I need to determine who wins, given optimal play.

In such a game, it's similar to the game of Nim with one heap, where the number of moves is n-1.

The player who makes the last move wins, because the opponent cannot move after that.

Wait, but in this problem, the player who cannot make a move loses.

So, it's the same as the standard impartial games where the last move wins.

So, in impartial games, the first player wins if the number of moves is odd, and loses if it's even, assuming optimal play.

Wait, but in standard Nim, with one heap, the first player wins if the heap size is positive.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the game's Grundy number or mex rule.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating.

In this specific case, since the tree is a straight path, and the game is about moving along the path, activating nodes one by one, without being able to go back, it's similar to moving along a line.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose the path is node 1 connected to node 2, to node 3, and so on up to node n.

The two leaves are node 1 and node n.

The game starts with the stone on some node u.

Players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.

So, from u, you can move to u-1 or u+1, provided they are inactive.

But, since the tree is a path, each node has at most two neighbors.

So, it's like moving left or right along the path.

However, once a node is activated, you can't move back to it.

So, the game is about moving along the path, activating nodes one by one, until you reach a leaf node, where you can't move further.

Wait, but the game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when the stone is on a leaf node, and the only neighbor is already active.

Wait, but in the initial state, all nodes are inactive, except the starting node.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says "the stone is on exactly one node, which is considered as activated."

So, the starting node is activated, and the game proceeds by moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.

So, the game continues until there are no inactive neighbors left for the current node.

Now, in a path graph, starting from node u, you can move to u-1 or u+1, provided they are inactive.

But, as you move, you activate nodes one by one.

This seems similar to a game where you're trying to force the opponent into a position where they have no moves.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Wait, in the provided program, it seems to calculate distances from the starting node to both leaves and then checks if either distance is even.

If either distance is even, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

Let me look at the provided program to understand their approach.

The program reads n and t, then reads n-1 edges to build the tree, then reads the starting node.

Then, it defines a function func_1 that takes n, edges, and start, and proceeds as follows:

- Builds the tree adjacency list.

- Finds the two leaves (nodes with degree one).

- Computes the distance from the starting node to both leaves using BFS.

- Checks if either distance is even; if so, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

So, their approach is based on calculating the distances from the starting node to both leaves and checking the parity of these distances.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, since the tree is a path with two leaves, let's consider the path as a straight line.

Let's number the nodes from 1 to n, where 1 and n are the leaves.

Suppose the starting node is u.

Then, the distances from u to leaf 1 and from u to leaf n are d1 and d2, respectively.

Now, the game involves moving along this path, activating nodes one by one.

The game ends when the stone is on a node with no inactive neighbors.

Since the tree is a path, this would be when the stone is on a leaf node, because leaves have only one neighbor.

Wait, but in the middle of the path, nodes have two neighbors.

So, if the stone is on a non-leaf node, it can move to either neighbor, provided they are inactive.

But, as nodes get activated, eventually, the stone will be on a leaf node, and since the leaf node has only one neighbor, which would already be active, the player cannot move and loses.

So, the game is essentially about moving towards one of the leaves, and the player who moves to the leaf loses.

This seems similar to the game of Nim on a path, where the last player to move to the leaf loses.

In such a game, the winner depends on the parity of the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Let me think about it.

Suppose the starting node is a leaf. Then, the starting player (Ron) cannot make a move, so he loses immediately. So, Hermione wins.

If the starting node is one step away from a leaf, Ron can move to the leaf, and then Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

If the starting node is two steps away from a leaf, Ron moves to the node one step away, then Hermione moves to the leaf and loses. So, Ron wins.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with the previous thought.

Wait, let's consider a small example.

Example 1:

Input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

Output:

Ron

So, n=3, t=1, edges are 2-3 and 3-1, so the tree is 1-3-2.

Leaves are 1 and 2.

Starting node is 3.

So, Ron starts on node 3.

He can move to node 1 or node 2.

If he moves to node 1, Hermione cannot move (node 1 is a leaf), so Ron wins.

Similarly, if he moves to node 2, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Hence, Ron wins.

Example 2:

Input:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

Output:

Hermione

So, n=5, t=1, edges form the path 1-2-3-4-5.

Leaves are 1 and 5.

Starting node is 5, which is a leaf.

Ron starts on node 5, but he cannot move anywhere because it's a leaf, so he loses immediately. Hence, Hermione wins.

From these examples, it seems that if the starting node is a leaf, Ron loses, because he cannot make a move.

If the starting node is not a leaf, Ron can move to a neighbor, and the game continues.

I need to generalize this.

In a path graph with n nodes and two leaves, the game can be analyzed based on the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Let me define the distance from the starting node to each leaf.

If the distance to at least one leaf is even, then Ron can win; otherwise, Hermione wins.

This seems to be the logic in the provided program.

Wait, in the first example, starting from node 3, distances to leaves are:

- Distance to leaf 1: 1

- Distance to leaf 2: 1

Both are odd, but according to the program, it checks if either distance is even, which is not the case here. But according to the output, Ron wins.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back, the program checks if dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0, then Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, dist1 = 1 (odd), dist2 = 1 (odd), so neither is even, so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

This contradicts the program's logic.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the distances.

Wait, in the first example:

n=3, edges are 2-3 and 3-1, so the tree is 1-3-2.

Starting at 3, distance to leaf 1 is 1, distance to leaf 2 is 1.

Both are odd, so according to the program, Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the program.

Looking back, the program defines func_1, which builds the tree, finds the leaves, computes distances from start to both leaves using BFS, and then checks if either distance is even.

If so, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, distances are both 1, which is odd, so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the distance calculation.

Wait, perhaps the distance should include the starting node.

Wait, in BFS, the distance from start to itself is 0.

Wait, in the first example, starting at node 3, distance to leaf 1 is 1, distance to leaf 2 is 1.

But in BFS, distance from 3 to 1 is 1, from 3 to 2 is 1.

So, according to the program, since neither distance is even, Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

So, perhaps the program is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the logic is inverted.

Wait, in the program, if dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0, then Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

But in the first example, both distances are 1, which is odd, so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the distances should be calculated differently.

Wait, maybe the distance includes the starting node as 0, and moving to neighbors is distance 1, and so on.

In that case, in the first example, distances are indeed 1 to both leaves.

But according to the program's logic, since neither is even, Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

So, perhaps the logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct logic is that if the sum of distances is even, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

But in the first example, sum is 2, which is even, so Ron wins.

Wait, but in the second example, n=5, starting at 5, distance to leaf 1 is 4, distance to leaf 5 is 0 (if starting at leaf 5).

Wait, distance from 5 to leaf 1 is 4, distance from 5 to leaf 5 is 0.

So, dist1 = 4 (even), dist2 = 0 (even), so Ron wins, but the output is Hermione.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the number of moves is equal to the number of nodes minus one, and the player who makes the last move wins.

But in this problem, the player who cannot make a move loses, which is standard.

In impartial games, if the total number of moves is even, the second player wins; if odd, the first player wins.

But in this case, the total number of moves is n-1.

So, if n-1 is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, n=3, n-1=2, which is even, so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

Wait, but that contradicts.

In the second example, n=5, n-1=4, which is even, so Hermione wins, which matches the output.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the game ends when a player cannot move, which happens when the stone is on a leaf.

So, the number of moves depends on the path from the starting node to the nearest leaf.

Wait, perhaps it's about the maximum distance to a leaf.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think in terms of game theory and impartial games.

Each position in the game can be assigned a Grundy number, and the game is won by leaving a position with a Grundy number of 0 to the opponent.

But perhaps that's too complicated for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think recursively.

Define the winner for each node as the starting position.

If a node is a leaf, the winner is the player who is forced to move there and cannot move further, so they lose.

If a node has neighbors, the player can choose to move to any inactive neighbor.

But keeping track of which nodes are active complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of moves from the starting node to the leaves.

In the first example, starting at node 3, Ron can choose to move to node 1 or node 2.

If he moves to node 1, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Similarly, if he moves to node 2, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Hence, Ron wins.

In the second example, starting at node 5, Ron moves to node 4.

Hermione moves to node 3.

Ron moves to node 2.

Hermione moves to node 1 and cannot move further, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, n-1 is even, so Hermione wins.

Wait, in the second example, n=5, n-1=4, which is even, so Hermione wins.

In the first example, n=3, n-1=2, which is even, so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

This contradicts.

So, perhaps the earlier logic is wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's about the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf.

In the first example, distance to both leaves is 1, which is odd.

In the second example, distance from 5 to leaf 1 is 4, which is even.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that if the distance to at least one leaf is even, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, distances are both 1 (odd), so Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

So, this contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the distances differently.

Wait, perhaps it's about the XOR of the distances or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the game as a sum of two games: the distance to one leaf and the distance to the other leaf.

But since it's a tree with two leaves, maybe that's not necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf.

If that distance is even, Ron can force Hermione into a losing position; else, Hermione can force Ron into a losing position.

But in the first example, distance is 1 (odd), and Ron wins, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to invert the logic.

Wait, perhaps if the distance to the nearest leaf is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, distance is 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second example, distance is 4 (even), Hermione wins.

This seems consistent.

So, perhaps the correct condition is: if the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Let me test this with another example.

Suppose n=4, t=1, tree is 1-2-3-4, starting at node 2.

Distance to leaf 1 is 1 (odd), distance to leaf 4 is 2 (even).

According to the condition, since the nearest leaf has an odd distance, Ron wins.

But let's simulate the game.

Ron starts at node 2, can move to node 1 or node 3.

If he moves to node 1, Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

If he moves to node 3, Hermione moves to node 4 and cannot move further, so Ron wins.

Hence, Ron wins.

But according to the condition, since the distance to leaf 1 is odd, Ron wins.

Even though the distance to leaf 4 is even, but the nearest leaf has odd distance.

Wait, but in this case, both distances are considered.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that if any distance to a leaf is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, both distances are odd, Ron wins.

In the second example, one distance is even, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but in the previous test case, n=4, starting at node 2, distance to leaf 1 is 1, distance to leaf 4 is 2.

According to this condition, since one distance is odd, Ron wins.

Which matches the simulation.

Another test case: n=2, t=1, edges 1-2, starting at node 1.

Distance to leaf 2 is 1 (odd), so Ron wins.

But in reality, starting at leaf, Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

Wait, this contradicts.

So, perhaps the condition is incorrect.

Wait, in this test case, starting at leaf 1, Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

But according to the condition, distance to leaf 2 is 1 (odd), so Ron should win, which is incorrect.

Hence, the condition is wrong.

So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the correct condition is that if the distance from the starting node to the nearest leaf is odd, Hermione wins; else, Ron wins.

In the test case above, starting at leaf 1, distance to leaf 2 is 1 (odd), so Hermione wins, which matches the actual outcome.

In the first example, distance is 1 (odd), Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

Wait, contradiction.

So, perhaps that's not correct either.

I'm getting confused.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of moves.

In the first example, n=3, n-1=2 moves.

Ron moves first, then Hermione, then Ron again.

Wait, no, n-1=2 moves means Ron moves first, then Hermione, and then there are no more moves.

So, Hermione makes the last move, and Ron cannot move, so Ron loses.

But in the output, it's Ron who wins.

So, perhaps the earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the total number of moves is the number of nodes minus one, and the player who makes the last move wins.

But in this problem, the player who cannot move loses, which is standard.

So, if the total number of moves is odd, Ron makes the last move and wins; if even, Hermione makes the last move and wins.

But in the first example, n=3, n-1=2, which is even, so Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

Contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the total number of moves is different based on the starting position.

Wait, in the first example, starting at node 3, Ron can choose to move to node 1 or node 2.

Suppose he moves to node 1, then Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Suppose he moves to node 2, then Hermione cannot move, so Ron wins.

Hence, Ron wins.

In the second example, starting at node 5, Ron moves to node 4, Hermione moves to node 3, Ron moves to node 2, Hermione moves to node 1, and cannot move further, so Hermione wins.

So, in the first example, Ron has a winning strategy, while in the second, Hermione wins.

But according to the earlier logic, based on n-1 being even or odd, it doesn't hold.

So, perhaps I need to consider something else.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the maximum distance from the starting node to any leaf.

If that distance is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, distance is 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second example, distance is 4 (even), Hermione wins.

This seems consistent.

In the test case with n=4, starting at node 2, distance to leaf 1 is 1 (odd), distance to leaf 4 is 2 (even). The maximum distance is 2 (even), so Hermione wins, but earlier simulation shows Ron wins.

Contradiction again.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimum distance to a leaf.

In the first example, min distance is 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second example, min distance is 4 (even), Hermione wins.

In the n=4 example, min distance is 1 (odd), Ron wins, which matches the output.

In the n=2 example, min distance is 1 (odd), but in reality, Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

Contradiction again.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to think recursively.

Define a function W(x), which is true if the player to move from node x can force a win.

Then, W(x) = not all neighbors y: W(y)

Meaning, the player can choose a neighbor y where not W(y), i.e., leave the opponent in a losing position.

This is the standard way to compute winning positions in impartial games.

But implementing this for large n (2e5 nodes) is not feasible without optimization.

Wait, perhaps since the tree is a path, I can compute W(x) for each node x in linear time.

Let me try.

Define W(x) as true if the player to move from x can force a win.

If x is a leaf, W(x) = false, because the player cannot move.

For non-leaf nodes, W(x) = not all y: W(y), where y are inactive neighbors.

But in this game, once a node is active, its neighbors' possibilities change.

This seems too involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the game as moving towards one of the leaves, and the player who is forced to move to a leaf loses.

This is similar to the game of Kayles or Nim, where the last player to move wins.

In such games, the winner depends on the parity of the number of moves.

But earlier attempts to correlate it with n-1 being even or odd didn't hold.

Perhaps the provided program's logic is flawed, as it doesn't match the first example's output.

Wait, in the first example, starting at node 3, distances to leaves are both 1, which are odd.

According to the program, if either distance is even, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In this case, both are odd, so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played on a tree with specific properties. The tree has exactly two leaves and is essentially a straight path. The game is played optimally by both players, Ron and Hermione, who alternate turns starting with Ron.

### Approach

1. **Tree Structure Analysis**:
   - The tree is a straight path with two leaves, similar to an array.
   - We need to determine the winner based on the starting position of the stone.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculate distances from the starting node to both leaves.
   - Use these distances to determine who can force a win.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - Ron wins if he can force Hermione into a position where she cannot move.
   - Hermione wins if she can force Ron into such a position.

### Solution Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]

    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0], tree)
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1], tree)
    if dist1 % 2 == 1 and dist2 % 2 == 1:
        return 'Hermione'
    else:
        return 'Ron'

def bfs(start, target, tree):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        if current == target:
            return dist
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    return -1

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
    starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start = starts[0]
    print(func_1(n, edges, start))
```

### Explanation

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - We build the tree using an adjacency list from the given edges.

2. **Identifying Leaves**:
   - Leaves are nodes with only one edge.

3. **BFS for Distances**:
