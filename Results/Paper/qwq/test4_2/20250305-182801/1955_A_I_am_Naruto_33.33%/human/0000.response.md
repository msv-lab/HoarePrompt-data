Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: buying them individually at price a per yogurt, or buying them in pairs at price b for two yogurts. The goal is to find the minimum amount of money Maxim needs to spend to buy exactly n yoguruts.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which indicates how many test cases there are. For each test case, there's a line with three integers: n, a, and b, representing the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the price per yogurt if bought individually, and the price for two yogurts if bought as a promotion, respectively.

The output should be the minimum cost for each test case, each on a separate line.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

So, for the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9. Buying two yogurts using the promotion costs 9 burles, which is less than buying them individually for 10 burles (5 each). So, the minimum cost is 9.

In the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9. Here, Maxim can buy two yogurts with the promotion for 9 and one individually for 5, totaling 14 burles.

In the third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11. If he buys two yogurts with the promotion for 11 and one individually for 5, that's 16 burles. But apparently, it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts in a way that costs 15 burles, but looking at the options, perhaps buying one promotion and one individual yogurt is the only way, which would be 11 + 5 = 16, but the output is 15. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the promotion can be used in a different way, but the problem says "buy two yogurts for b burles," so I think the output might have a typo, but I'll trust the example for now.

Wait, no, the explanation says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5." So, perhaps there's an implicit assumption that buying three yogurts can be done in a way that's cheaper than the sum of individual promotions and individual purchases. But the problem doesn't specify any such option. Wait, no, the problem says: "When buying two yogurts, he can choose to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price." It doesn't mention any option for buying three yogurts together. So, maybe the example has a mistake, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back, the problem says: "but there is a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles." So, the only promotion is for pairs of yogurts. So, for n=3, you can buy one pair with the promotion and one individually.

But in the example, for n=3, a=5, b=11, the output is 15, which is less than 11 + 5 = 16. So, how is that possible? Maybe the promotion can be applied differently, but the problem doesn't specify any other promotions. Perhaps the store allows buying multiple promotions, but in this case, buying one promotion (two yogurts for 11) and one yogurt individually (5) totals 16, which is more than buying three yogurts for 15 in some unknown way.

Wait, perhaps the promotion can be applied to overlapping pairs, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe buying multiple promotions allows a discount, but that's not stated. I think there might be a misunderstanding here.

Looking back at the problem statement: "When buying two yogurts, he can choose to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price." It seems that the only options are to buy yogurts individually at price a each or in pairs at price b per pair.

So, for n=3, the possible ways are:

- Buy one pair at promotion price b and one individually at price a: total cost is b + a.

- Buy all three individually: total cost is 3 * a.

But in the example, for n=3, a=5, b=11, the output is 15, which is less than b + a = 16. So, perhaps there's a better way to buy three yogurts that isn't immediately obvious from the problem statement. Maybe buying two pairs and discarding one yogurt, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the promotion can be applied in a way that effectively reduces the cost when buying an odd number of yogurts, but again, the problem doesn't specify that.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that buying two yogurts for b burles can be seen as buying two yogurts for b, and then buying the third one individually for a, but there might be a better combination.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cost per yogurt in the promotion and compare it to the individual price.

Let me calculate the cost per yogurt in the promotion: b / 2.

If b / 2 < a, then it's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible.

Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy individually.

But in the example where n=3, a=5, b=11, b / 2 = 5.5, which is greater than a=5, so it should be cheaper to buy individually.

But buying three individually would cost 15 burles, which matches the output.

Wait, but in the earlier case where n=3, a=5, b=9, the output is 14, which is less than 15.

Wait, b / 2 = 4.5, which is less than a=5, so it's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible.

So, for n=3, buy one pair for 9 and one individual for 5, totaling 14.

In the case where n=3, a=5, b=11, b / 2 = 5.5, which is greater than a=5, so it's cheaper to buy all individually for 15.

But according to the example, the output is 15, which aligns with this reasoning.

So, perhaps the general approach is:

- Determine the cost per yogurt in the promotion: b / 2.

- If b / 2 < a, then it's cheaper to buy as many pairs as possible, and buy the remaining yogurt(s) individually.

- If b / 2 >= a, then it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually.

But wait, in the third test case, b / 2 = 5.5 >= a=5, so buy all individually for 15.

In the second test case, b / 2 = 4.5 < a=5, so buy one pair for 9 and one individual for 5, totaling 14.

This seems consistent.

But let's think about n=4, a=5, b=11.

b / 2 = 5.5 >= a=5, so buy all individually for 20, which matches the example output.

Alternatively, buy two pairs for 11 each, totaling 22, which is more than 20, so buying individually is cheaper.

In another case, n=4, a=5, b=9.

b / 2 = 4.5 < a=5, so buy two pairs for 9 each, totaling 18, which is less than buying individually for 20.

But in the example where n=4, a=5, b=11, it's cheaper to buy individually.

So, the general approach seems valid.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n > 1:

ans1 = a * n

ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)

print(min(ans1, ans2))

else:

print(a)

So, the function reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads n, a, b.

Then, if n > 1:

- Calculate ans1 as a * n (buying all individually)

- Calculate ans2 as b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2) (buy as many pairs as possible and the remaining yogurt(s) individually)

- Print the minimum of ans1 and ans2

If n == 1:

- Simply print a, since he can only buy one individually.

This seems to align with the approach I just thought of.

Let me verify with the example cases:

First test case: n=2, a=5, b=9

ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10

ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (0) = 9 * 1 + 0 = 9

min(10, 9) = 9, which matches the example.

Second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9

ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15

ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (1) = 9 * 1 + 5 = 14

min(15, 14) = 14, matches the example.

Third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11

ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15

ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (1) = 11 * 1 + 5 = 16

min(15, 16) = 15, matches the example.

Fourth test case: n=4, a=5, b=11

ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20

ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (0) = 11 * 2 + 0 = 22

min(20, 22) = 20, matches the example.

So, the program seems correct.

But wait, in the initial confusion, I thought that for n=3, a=5, b=11, buying one pair for 11 and one individual for 5 totals 16, but the program correctly calculates ans2 as 11 * 1 + 5 = 16, and ans1 as 15, so it chooses 15, which matches the example.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
