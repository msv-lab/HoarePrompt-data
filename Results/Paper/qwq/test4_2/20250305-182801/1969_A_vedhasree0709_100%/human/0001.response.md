Alright, I have this problem to solve. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are specific conditions about who comes to the party based on who gets invited. Let's break this down.

First, Monocarp has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, denoted by p_i, where p_i is the index of their best friend. The problem says that all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, meaning no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

The goal is to send invitations to some friends such that at least two friends actually come to the party. The condition for a friend to come is that both they and their best friend receive an invitation.

I need to find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least two friends come to the party.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

3

5

3 1 2 5 4

4

2 3 4 1

2

2 1

Output:

2

3

2

In the first test case, n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4]. Monocarp sends invitations to friends 4 and 5, and both come because each other is their best friend.

In the second test case, n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1]. Sending invitations to friends 1,2, and 3 results in friends 1 and 2 coming to the party.

In the third test case, n=2 and p=[2,1]. Inviting both friends results in both coming.

From these examples, it seems like the minimum number of invitations needed is either 2 or 3, depending on the structure of the best friendships.

I need to generalize this.

First, observe that the best friendships form a permutation since all p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. This means that the best friendships form a collection of cycles.

For example, in the first test case:

p = [3,1,2,5,4]

So, friend 1's best friend is 3, friend 3's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 1. This forms a cycle: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1.

Friend 4's best friend is 5, and friend 5's best friend is 4, forming another cycle: 4 -> 5 -> 4.

In the second test case:

p = [2,3,4,1]

Friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 3, friend 3's best friend is 4, and friend 4's best friend is 1, forming a single cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

In the third test case:

p = [2,1]

Friend 1's best friend is 2, and friend 2's best friend is 1, forming a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 1.

So, in general, the best friendships form cycles.

Now, to have at least two friends come to the party, we need to have at least two pairs where both friends and their best friends are invited.

Let's think about how to minimize the number of invitations.

Consider the cycles:

- In a cycle of length 2: say A and B are best friends of each other. To have both come, we need to invite both A and B.

- In a cycle of length 3: A's best friend is B, B's best friend is C, C's best friend is A. To have all three come, we need to invite all three, because each pair needs both to be invited.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

In a cycle of length 2: A and B are best friends.

To have A come, both A and B need to be invited.

Similarly, to have B come, both B and A need to be invited.

So, inviting both A and B results in both A and B coming.

In a cycle of length 3: A, B, C, where A's best friend is B, B's best friend is C, C's best friend is A.

If we invite A and B, then A and B are invited, but C is not invited, so C doesn't come. However, for A to come, both A and B need to be invited, which they are, so A comes. For B to come, both B and C need to be invited, but C is not invited, so B does not come. For C to come, both C and A need to be invited, but C is not invited, so C does not come.

So, only A comes, which is not enough since we need at least two friends to come.

If we invite A, B, and C, then:

- A comes because A and B are invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited.

- C comes because C and A are invited.

So, all three come.

Thus, for a cycle of length 3, we need to invite all three to have all three come.

Similarly, in a cycle of length 4: A, B, C, D, where A's best friend is B, B's best friend is C, C's best friend is D, D's best friend is A.

If we invite A, B, and C:

- A comes because A and B are invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited.

- C comes because C and D are invited, but D is not invited, so C does not come.

- D does not come because D is not invited.

So, only A and B come.

That satisfies the condition of having at least two friends come, with three invitations.

Alternatively, is there a way to have only two invitations and have at least two friends come?

Suppose we invite A and C:

- A comes because A and B are invited? Wait, B is not invited, so A does not come.

- C comes because C and D are invited, but D is not invited, so C does not come.

- B does not come because B is not invited.

- D does not come because D is not invited.

So, no one comes.

That doesn't work.

Another try: invite A and D.

- A comes because A and B are invited? B is not invited, so A does not come.

- D comes because D and A are invited. Both are invited, so D comes.

- B does not come because B is not invited.

- C does not come because C is not invited.

Only D comes, which is insufficient.

Another try: invite B and D.

- A does not come because A is not invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited, but C is not invited, so B does not come.

- C comes because C and D are invited, both are invited, so C comes.

- D comes because D and A are invited, D is invited, A is not invited, so D does not come.

Only C comes, which is insufficient.

Another try: invite B, C, and D.

- A does not come because A is not invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited.

- C comes because C and D are invited.

- D comes because D and A are invited, but A is not invited, so D does not come.

So, only B and C come, with three invitations.

Seems similar to before.

It seems that in a cycle of length 4, to have at least two friends come, we need to invite at least three friends.

Is there a way to do it with fewer?

It doesn't seem so.

Similarly, in a cycle of length 5, I think we'd need to invite at least three friends to have at least two come.

Wait, let's consider a cycle of length 5: A->B->C->D->E->A.

If we invite A, B, C:

- A comes because A and B are invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited.

- C comes because C and D are invited, but D is not invited, so C does not come.

- D does not come because D is not invited.

- E does not come because E is not invited.

So, only A and B come.

If we invite A, C, E:

- A comes because A and B are invited? B is not invited, so A does not come.

- C comes because C and D are invited, but D is not invited, so C does not come.

- E comes because E and A are invited, but A does not come because B is not invited.

Wait, the condition is that both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation, and the best friend doesn't necessarily have to come, just that they are invited.

So, for E to come, E and A must be invited. E is invited, but A is invited, but A does not come because B is not invited. Does that affect E's attendance?

Wait, no. The condition is that both E and A are invited, which they are, so E comes.

Similarly, A does not come because B is not invited, but that doesn't affect E's attendance.

Wait, but the problem says: "the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation".

So, for E to come, both E and A must be invited, which they are, so E comes.

Similarly, A comes if both A and B are invited, which they are not, so A does not come.

Similarly, C comes if both C and D are invited, but D is not invited, so C does not come.

So, only E comes, which is insufficient.

So, inviting A, C, E results in only E coming.

Not enough.

Another try: invite A, B, D.

- A comes because A and B are invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited, but C is not invited, so B does not come.

- C does not come because C is not invited.

- D comes because D and E are invited, but E is not invited, so D does not come.

- E does not come because E is not invited.

Only A comes, which is insufficient.

Another try: invite B, D, E.

- A does not come because A is not invited.

- B comes because B and C are invited, but C is not invited, so B does not come.

- C comes because C and D are invited, both are invited, so C comes.

- D comes because D and E are invited, both are invited, so D comes.

- E comes because E and A are invited, E is invited, A is not invited, so E does not come.

So, C and D come, with three invitations.

That works.

Seems consistent with before.

So, in cycles of length 4 and above, it seems that inviting three friends is sufficient to have at least two come.

Is there a cycle where inviting only two friends is sufficient?

In cycles of length 2, inviting both friends results in both coming, which satisfies the condition of at least two coming.

In cycles of length 3 and above, inviting two friends is not sufficient because:

- In a cycle of 3: inviting any two would result in only one coming, since the third is not invited.

- In a cycle of 4: inviting any two would likely result in only one coming, similar to above.

Wait, let's check a cycle of 4 again.

Consider cycle: A->B->C->D->A.

Invite A and C.

- A comes if both A and B are invited. B is not invited, so A does not come.

- C comes if both C and D are invited. D is not invited, so C does not come.

- B does not come because B is not invited.

- D does not come because D is not invited.

No one comes.

Not sufficient.

Invite A and B.

- A comes if both A and B are invited. Both are invited, so A comes.

- B comes if both B and C are invited. C is not invited, so B does not come.

- C does not come because C is not invited.

- D does not come because D is not invited.

Only A comes, which is insufficient.

Invite A and D.

- A comes if both A and B are invited. B is not invited, so A does not come.

- D comes if both D and A are invited. Both are invited, so D comes.

- B does not come because B is not invited.

- C does not come because C is not invited.

Only D comes, which is insufficient.

Invite B and D.

- A does not come because A is not invited.

- B comes if both B and C are invited. C is not invited, so B does not come.

- D comes if both D and A are invited. A is not invited, so D does not come.

No one comes.

Invite B and C.

- A does not come because A is not invited.

- B comes if both B and C are invited. Both are invited, so B comes.

- C comes if both C and D are invited. D is not invited, so C does not come.

- D does not come because D is not invited.

Only B comes, which is insufficient.

Invite C and D.

- A does not come because A is not invited.

- C comes if both C and D are invited. Both are invited, so C comes.

- D comes if both D and A are invited. A is not invited, so D does not come.

- B does not come because B is not invited.

Only C comes, which is insufficient.

So, in a cycle of 4, inviting only two friends is not sufficient to have at least two come.

Similarly, in cycles of length 3 and above, inviting only two friends is insufficient.

Therefore, for cycles of length 2, inviting two friends is sufficient, and for cycles of length 3 and above, inviting three friends is necessary.

Wait, but in the second test case, which is a cycle of length 4, the solution invited three friends, and in the first test case, which has two cycles of length 2 and 3, inviting two friends from the cycle of 2 is sufficient.

Wait, in the first test case, there are two cycles: one of length 3 (1-3-2) and one of length 2 (4-5).

Inviting two friends from the cycle of length 2 is sufficient.

In the second test case, which is a single cycle of length 4, inviting three friends is necessary.

So, the minimal number of invitations depends on the cycles present.

If there is a cycle of length 2, inviting two friends from that cycle is sufficient.

If there are only cycles of length 3 or more, inviting three friends is necessary.

Therefore, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there is at least one cycle of length 2, otherwise 3.

Looking back at the examples:

First test case: cycles of length 3 and 2 → invite 2.

Second test case: cycle of length 4 → invite 3.

Third test case: cycle of length 2 → invite 2.

This seems consistent.

So, the strategy is:

- Identify all cycles in the permutation p.

- If there is at least one cycle of length 2, then the minimal number of invitations is 2.

- If all cycles have length greater than 2, then the minimal number of invitations is 3.

Therefore, to solve the problem, we need to detect if there is any cycle of length 2 in the permutation.

If yes, output 2; else, output 3.

Wait, but in the third test case, which has only one cycle of length 2, the output is 2.

In the first test case, which has cycles of lengths 3 and 2, the output is 2.

In the second test case, which has a single cycle of length 4, the output is 3.

This seems correct.

Is there any case where having only cycles of length greater than 2 would require more than 3 invitations?

Well, according to our earlier analysis, in cycles of length 3 and above, inviting three friends is sufficient to have at least two come.

For example, in a cycle of 3: inviting all three to have all three come.

In a cycle of 4: inviting three to have at least two come.

In a cycle of 5: inviting three to have at least two come.

So, in such cases, 3 invitations are sufficient.

And if there is a cycle of length 2, 2 invitations are sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there is at least one cycle of length 2, otherwise 3.

Wait, but in the second test case, which has a cycle of length 4, inviting three friends is sufficient to have at least two come.

But is there a way to have fewer than three invitations in cycles of length greater than 2?

From earlier attempts, it seems not.

Hence, the minimal number of invitations is 2 if there is at least one cycle of length 2, else 3.

Therefore, to implement this, we need to check if the permutation has any cycle of length 2.

If yes, output 2; else, output 3.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

Program code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

i = 0

j = 0

while i <= n - 1:

p = l[i]

q = l[p - 1]

if q == i + 1:

print(2)

j = 1

break

i += 1

if j == 0:

print(3)

This program reads t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and the list l of length n.

- Iterate through each index i from 0 to n-1.

- For each i, set p = l[i], which is the best friend of i+1.

- Then set q = l[p - 1], which is the best friend of p.

- Check if q == i + 1, meaning that the best friend of p is i+1, forming a cycle of length 2.

- If such a pair is found, print 2 and break.

- If no such pair is found after checking all i, print 3.

So, this program checks if there is at least one cycle of length 2 in the permutation.

If yes, it prints 2; else, it prints 3.

This aligns with the logic we derived earlier.

Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send to ensure that at least two friends come to the party, given the constraints of their best friendships.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Each friend has a unique best friend (denoted by `p_i`), and this forms a permutation.
   - A friend comes to the party only if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations to ensure that at least two friends come to the party.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The best friendships form cycles.
   - For cycles of length 2, inviting both friends in the cycle is sufficient to have both come.
   - For cycles of length greater than 2, inviting three friends is necessary to have at least two come.

3. **Solution Strategy**:
   - Detect if there is at least one cycle of length 2 in the permutation.
   - If such a cycle exists, the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.
   - If no cycle of length 2 exists, the minimum number of invitations needed is 3.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Reading**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read the number of friends `n` and the list `p` representing each friend's best friend.

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - Iterate through each friend to check for cycles of length 2.
  - For each friend `i`, check if their best friend's best friend is themselves (`p[p_i] == i`).
  - If such a pair is found, print 2 and break.

- **Default Case**:
  - If no cycle of length 2 is found, print 3.

This approach efficiently determines the minimum number of invitations required by checking for the presence of cycles of length 2 in the permutation, ensuring optimality and correctness.
