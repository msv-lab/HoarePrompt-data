Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting array is one that can be divided into more than one part where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to understand what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. So, for example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

Now, the problem is about subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. So, for a given range [l, r], I need to check if the subarray from index l to r can be split into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way to handle XOR queries efficiently is by using prefix XORs. If I precompute the prefix XOR up to each index, then the XOR of any subarray [l, r] can be found by XORing the prefix XOR at r with the prefix XOR at l-1.

So, I'll compute the prefix XOR array first. Let's denote this as pf[], where pf[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i].

Now, for a subarray [l, r], its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

But the problem is not just to find the XOR of [l, r], but to see if it can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR.

Let's think about what it means for a subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR. Suppose the XOR of the entire subarray [l, r] is X. If I can split this subarray into k parts where each part has XOR equal to Y, then k*Y should equal X in XOR terms. But XOR isn't additive in the same way as sum, so this might not hold directly.

Wait, actually, in XOR, if I have k parts with XOR Y each, then the total XOR would be Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even, because XORing Y with itself even number of times cancels out to 0.

But the problem states that k > 1, so if k is 2, XOR would be 0; if k is 3, XOR would be Y; and so on. This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach. If I can find at least one way to split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR, then it's interesting with k=2. But the problem allows k > 1, so k=2 is sufficient.

Wait, but the problem allows any k > 1, not necessarily just k=2. So, maybe there are subarrays that can't be split into two parts with equal XOR but can be split into three or more parts.

Hmm, that complicates things. I need a way to check for any k > 1.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. If I have a subarray [l, r] with XOR X, and I can find an index m in [l, r] such that the XOR from l to m is equal to the XOR from m+1 to r, then I can split it into two parts with equal XOR.

But wait, the XOR from l to m is pf[m] XOR pf[l-1], and the XOR from m+1 to r is pf[r] XOR pf[m]. So, I need pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m].

Simplifying this:

pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m]

Applying XOR pf[m] on both sides:

pf[l-1] = pf[r]

Wait, that can't be right. Because if pf[l-1] = pf[r], then the XOR of [l, r] is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = 0, which means the subarray [l, r] has XOR 0.

So, in this case, any split where the XOR of both parts is 0 would satisfy the condition.

But the problem allows for any Y, not just 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for the subarray [l, r], if its XOR is X, and I can find a split at m where the XOR from l to m is Y and from m+1 to r is also Y, then Y XOR Y = X.

But Y XOR Y is 0, so X must be 0.

Wait, that can't be right.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose the XOR of the entire subarray [l, r] is X.

If I can split this subarray into k parts where each part has XOR Y, then:

- If k is even, X = 0 (since Y XOR Y = 0)

- If k is odd, X = Y

So, for k >= 2:

- If k is even, X must be 0

- If k is odd and k >= 3, X must be Y

But Y is the XOR of each part, and since each part has XOR Y, and there are k parts, the total XOR is Y if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, to satisfy the condition for k >= 2:

- If k is even: X must be 0

- If k is odd: X can be any value, but k >= 3

Wait, but k >= 3 is odd, so X would be Y, but Y is the XOR of each part.

This seems confusing.

Maybe I need to consider that for the subarray to be split into k >= 2 parts with equal XOR, the total XOR X must satisfy:

- If k is even: X = 0

- If k is odd: X = Y

But Y can be any value, so for odd k, X can be any value.

But the problem allows k > 1, which includes both even and odd k.

So, for a subarray to be interesting:

- If it can be split into even k parts with X = 0

- Or into odd k parts with X = Y

But Y must be equal for all parts.

Wait, perhaps I need to focus on the fact that the subarray can be split into at least two parts with equal XOR.

So, for k=2:

- Split into two parts with equal XOR, which implies that each part has XOR equal to X/2, but XOR doesn't have division.

Wait, maybe better to think in terms of the total XOR being the XOR of the XORs of the parts.

Wait, let's look at an example.

In the first example:

a = [1,1,2,3,0]

Query 1: [1,5] = [1,1,2,3,0]

We can split it into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

So, k=3, which is odd, and total XOR X = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1.

Which matches Y=1.

Query 2: [2,4] = [1,2,3]

We can split it into [1,2],[3], each with XOR 3.

So, k=2, even, and total XOR X = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, which matches X=0.

Query 3: [3,5] = [2,3,0]

We can't split it into k >=2 with equal XOR.

So, in this case, it's not interesting.

Wait, but according to the output, it's NO.

Similarly, query 4 and 5 are NO.

So, from this example, it seems that:

- For even k, X must be 0

- For odd k >=3, X can be any value

But in the first query, X=1, and k=3 (odd), and it's allowed.

Second query, X=0, k=2 (even), allowed.

Third query, X=1, k >=2, but not allowed.

Wait, but in the first query, X=1, and k=3, which is allowed.

In the second query, X=0, k=2, allowed.

In the third query, X=1, and k=2, not allowed.

Wait, so for k=2, X must be 0.

For k=3, X can be any value.

But in the first query, k=3, X=1, allowed.

Second query, k=2, X=0, allowed.

Third query, k=2, X=1, not allowed.

So, it seems that for k=2, X must be 0.

For k >=3, X can be any value.

Is that the general rule?

Wait, but in the first query, X=1, and k=3, which is allowed.

But is it possible to have k=3 with X=1?

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, for a subarray to be interesting, it must be possible to split it into k >=2 parts with equal XOR, regardless of what k is.

So, for a given subarray, I need to check if there exists a k >=2 such that I can split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR.

But checking all possible k is not efficient.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if I can split the subarray into two parts with equal XOR, then it's interesting with k=2.

Similarly, if I can split it into three parts with equal XOR, it's interesting with k=3, and so on.

So, perhaps I can find the minimal possible XOR value Y that can be used to split the subarray into multiple parts, and check if it can be split into at least two parts with that Y.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can look at the occurrences of the prefix XOR values.

Let me recall that pf[i] is the XOR of the first i elements.

So, pf[0] = 0, pf[1] = a[1], pf[2] = a[1] XOR a[2], and so on.

Now, for a subarray [l, r], its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, suppose I want to split [l, r] into k parts with equal XOR.

Let me consider that between l and r, I need to place k-1 split points such that each segment has the same XOR.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps, I can think in terms of the differences in prefix XORs.

Wait, maybe I can look for repeated XOR values in the subarray.

Let me consider that if pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m], then the two parts [l, m] and [m+1, r] have equal XOR.

But as I saw earlier, this leads to pf[l-1] = pf[r], meaning X=0.

So, for k=2, it's only possible if X=0.

But in the first example, for [1,5], X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

So, perhaps for k >=3, it's possible even if X != 0.

But in the second query, [2,4], X=0, and k=2 is allowed.

So, maybe the rule is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into even k parts with Y=0.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into odd k parts with Y=X.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider that for a subarray with XOR X:

- If X=0, then it can be split into even k parts with Y=0.

- If X !=0, then it can be split into odd k parts with Y=X.

But in the first query, X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

Similarly, in the second query, X=0, and k=2 is allowed.

So, perhaps the condition is that:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k.

But in the first query, X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

But in the third query, X=1, and k=2 is not allowed.

Wait, but k=2 is even, and X=1 !=0, so it's not allowed.

Similarly, in the first query, X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

So, perhaps the general condition is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

But in the first query, X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

Wait, but can I split [1,5] into k=4 parts with equal XOR?

If k=4 is even, and X=1 !=0, then it should not be allowed.

But in our earlier thought, for X=1, only odd k >=3 are allowed.

But in the first query, it's allowed for k=3.

So, perhaps the minimal k for which it's allowed is 3, and then any larger k of the same parity.

But I need to confirm this.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times the prefix XOR value appears.

Let me consider that if the subarray [l, r] has XOR X, and there are multiple indices where the prefix XOR equals pf[l-1] XOR X at positions within [l, r], then I can split at those positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for positions where the prefix XOR up to that position is equal to pf[l-1] XOR Y, where Y is the desired XOR for each part.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that for a subarray [l, r], with XOR X, I need to find if there exists at least one split point m in [l, r-1] such that the XOR from l to m is equal to the XOR from m+1 to r.

As we saw earlier, this requires pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m], which simplifies to pf[l-1] = pf[r].

So, only when pf[l-1] = pf[r], which means X=0, can I split into two parts with equal XOR.

So, for k=2, it's only possible when X=0.

But the problem allows k >1, including k=3,4, etc.

So, perhaps for k=3, it's possible even when X !=0.

But I need a general way to check for any k >1.

Let me consider that for a subarray [l, r], with XOR X, I need to check if there exists at least one Y such that Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = X, for some k >=2.

Given that Y XOR Y =0 for even k, and Y for odd k, as we saw earlier.

So:

- If k is even, then X must be 0.

- If k is odd, then X must be Y.

But Y can be any value, so for odd k, X can be any value.

But in the problem, k can be any value >=2, as long as it's possible to split the subarray into k parts with equal XOR.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for a subarray [l, r], with XOR X:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

Is that correct?

Wait, but in the first example, for [1,5], X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

For [2,4], X=0, and k=2 is allowed.

For [3,5], X=1, and k=2 is not allowed.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

But I need to confirm if this is always true.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a = [1,1,1,1], n=4.

Consider subarray [1,4], X=1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 1=0.

So, can I split it into k=2 parts with equal XOR?

Yes, [1,2] and [3,4], each with XOR 0.

Can I split it into k=3 parts with equal XOR?

Well, k=3 is odd, and X=0, so Y must be 0.

But [1,1,1,1] split into three parts would require two split points.

For example, [1,1],[1,1], each with XOR 0.

But that's k=2, not k=3.

Wait, to have k=3, I need to split into three parts.

For example, [1],[1],[1,1], but XORs are 1,1,0, which are not equal.

So, it's not possible to split into k=3 parts with equal XOR.

So, in this case, for X=0, it's possible to split into even k=2, but not into odd k=3.

This contradicts my earlier assumption.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Let me think again.

Maybe the condition is that for a subarray with XOR X:

- It can be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, where Y is such that Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = X.

Given that:

- If k is even, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y = 0.

- If k is odd, Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y = Y.

So:

- If k is even, X must be 0.

- If k is odd, X must be Y.

But Y is the XOR of each part, and Y must be equal for all parts.

So, for k even, X must be 0.

For k odd, X can be any value, but Y must be equal to X.

Wait, but in the first example, [1,5], X=1, and k=3 (odd), which matches X=Y.

In the second example, [2,4], X=0, and k=2 (even), which requires X=0.

In the third example, [3,5], X=1, and k=2 (even), which requires X=0, but X=1, so not allowed.

Similarly, in my additional example, [1,4], X=0, and k=2 (even) is allowed, but k=3 (odd) is not possible because there is no Y such that Y=0 and I can split into three parts with Y=0.

Wait, in my additional example, [1,4]=[1,1,1,1], X=0.

If I try to split into k=3 parts with Y=0:

I need to find splits where each part has XOR 0.

For [1,1,1,1], possible splits:

- [1],[1],[1,1]: XORs are 1,1,0 → not equal.

- [1,1],[1],[1]: XORs are 0,1,1 → not equal.

- [1],[1,1],[1]: XORs are 1,0,1 → not equal.

So, it's impossible to split into three parts with equal XOR.

Hence, for X=0, it's only possible to split into even k where X=0.

For X !=0, it's only possible to split into odd k where X=Y.

But in the first example, [1,5], X=1, and it's possible to split into k=3 with Y=1.

Wait, but in that case, the total XOR is X=1, and k=3 (odd), so X=Y=1.

Similarly, in [1,4], X=0, and I can split into k=2 with Y=0.

But in [3,5], X=1, and I can't split into k=2 with Y=1 because k is even and X must be 0.

Wait, but in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and it's allowed with k=3.

For [2,4], X=0, allowed with k=2.

For [3,5], X=1, not allowed with k=2.

So, it seems that:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into odd k >=3.

But in my additional example, [1,4], X=0, and it's possible to split into k=2, but not into k=3.

So, perhaps for X=0, it's possible to split into any even k >=2, but not necessarily into odd k >=3.

Similarly, for X !=0, it's possible to split into any odd k >=3, but not into even k >=2.

But in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and it's possible to split into k=3, but not into k=2.

For [2,4], X=0, and it's possible to split into k=2.

For [3,5], X=1, and it's not possible to split into k=2.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- For a subarray with XOR X:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a = [1,2,3], n=3.

Subarray [1,3], X=1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0.

So, X=0, and I can split into k=2 parts with Y=0.

Possible splits:

- [1,1],[2,3]: XORs are 1, 2 XOR 3=1 → equal.

- [1,2],[3]: XORs are 1 XOR 2=3, 3 → not equal.

- [1],[2,3]: XORs are 1, 2 XOR 3=1 → equal.

So, it's possible to split into k=2 parts with equal XOR Y=1.

Wait, but X=0, and Y=1.

Wait, but 1 XOR 1 =0, which matches X=0.

So, it's allowed.

Similarly, can I split into k=3 parts with Y=1?

Possible splits:

- [1],[2],[3]: XORs are 1,2,3 → not equal.

- [1,1,1],[2,3]: Wait, can't have overlapping elements.

So, it's not possible to split into k=3 parts with equal XOR.

Hence, for X=0, it's possible to split into even k=2, but not into odd k=3.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

But in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and it's possible to split into k=3.

For [2,4], X=0, and it's possible to split into k=2.

For [3,5], X=1, and it's not possible to split into k=2.

So, this seems consistent.

Hence, the condition for a subarray to be interesting is:

- If X=0, then k must be even >=2.

- If X !=0, then k must be odd >=3.

But in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and k=3 is allowed.

For [2,4], X=0, k=2 is allowed.

For [3,5], X=1, k=2 is not allowed.

So, perhaps the final condition is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

Hence, to determine if a subarray [l,r] is interesting, we just need to check:

- If X=0, then it's possible (YES).

- If X !=0, then it's not possible (NO), because we can't split into even k with X !=0.

Wait, but in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and it's allowed with k=3.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my condition.

Wait, maybe:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3, provided that there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point is equal to X.

But this seems vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray [l,r] with XOR X.

If X=0, then I can split it into two parts with XOR 0.

If X !=0, then I need to split it into at least three parts with XOR Y=X.

But how do I check if such a split is possible?

Perhaps, I need to check if there exists at least one index m in [l,r] such that the XOR from l to m is equal to X, and the XOR from m+1 to r is also equal to X.

But the XOR from l to m is pf[m] XOR pf[l-1], and the XOR from m+1 to r is pf[r] XOR pf[m].

So, I need pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = X and pf[r] XOR pf[m] = X.

From the first equation: pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X.

From the second equation: pf[m] = pf[r] XOR X.

So, pf[l-1] XOR X must equal pf[r] XOR X.

Which implies pf[l-1] = pf[r].

But pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR X, since X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

So, pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r] XOR X ⇒ pf[l-1] = pf[r].

Wait, but pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR X.

So, pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[l-1] XOR X.

This is always true.

But I need to find m such that pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and m is in [l,r].

Similarly, pf[m] = pf[r] XOR X.

But pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR X, so pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X XOR X = pf[l-1].

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try to rephrase.

To split [l,r] into two parts with equal XOR, I need to find m in [l, r-1] such that pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m].

Which simplifies to pf[l-1] = pf[r].

So, for k=2, it's only possible if pf[l-1] = pf[r], which implies X=0.

For k=3, I need to find two split points m1 and m2 such that pf[m1] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[m2] XOR pf[m1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m2].

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for the number of times pf[l-1] XOR X appears between l and r.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for the subarray [l,r], with XOR X, I can split it into k parts with each part having XOR Y, where Y is such that Y XOR Y XOR ... XOR Y (k times) = X.

Given that:

- If k is even, Y XOR Y ... XOR Y =0, so X must be 0.

- If k is odd, Y XOR Y ... XOR Y = Y, so Y =X.

Hence, for the subarray to be interesting:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3.

But in practice, I need to check if such splits exist.

But in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and it's possible to split into k=3 with Y=1.

Similarly, in [2,4], X=0, and it's possible to split into k=2 with Y=0.

In [3,5], X=1, and it's not possible to split into k=2 with Y=0.

But in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1, and it's possible to split into k=3 with Y=1.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3, provided that there exists at least one way to split the subarray into three parts with each part having XOR X.

But checking for three parts is still complicated.

Is there a simpler way?

Let me consider that for a subarray [l,r], with XOR X:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into any even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into any odd k >=3, but only if there exists at least one split point where the XOR up to that point is equal to X.

But I need a way to check this efficiently.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to handle queries.

Let me consider precomputing the prefix XORs and storing their positions.

So, I can create a dictionary where each XOR value maps to the list of positions where it appears.

Then, for a query [l,r], I can find pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = X.

Then:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then I need to check if there exists at least one m in [l,r] such that pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[m] = pf[r] XOR X.

Wait, but pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[m] = pf[r] XOR X.

But pf[r] = pf[l-1] XOR X, so pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r] XOR X.

So, pf[m] must be pf[l-1] XOR X.

Hence, I need to check if there exists m in [l,r] such that pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X.

Since pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r], as X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

So, pf[m] = pf[r].

Therefore, I need to check if pf[r] appears in pf[m] for some m in [l,r].

But pf[r] is already pf[r], so I need to check if pf[r] appears in the prefix XORs between l and r.

But m must be >=l and <=r.

So, I need to check if there exists m in [l,r] such that pf[m] = pf[r].

But m must be <=r, and pf[r] is included.

So, if pf[r] appears in pf[m] for some m in [l,r], then it's possible to split into two parts with equal XOR.

Wait, but earlier we saw that for k=2, it's only possible if pf[l-1] = pf[r], which implies X=0.

So, perhaps I need to consider that for X !=0, it's only possible to split into odd k >=3, and for that, I need to check if there exists at least one m in [l,r] such that pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X.

But pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r].

So, I need to check if pf[r] appears in the prefix XORs between l and r.

But pf[r] is already in pf[r], but m must be <r.

Wait, m must be in [l,r-1].

So, I need to check if pf[r] appears in pf[m] for some m in [l,r-1].

If such an m exists, then I can split into at least three parts.

Wait, perhaps not.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some XOR problems, we can use the fact that if a value appears multiple times in the prefix XOR array, then the subarrays between those occurrences have XOR 0.

But in this problem, we need to consider subarrays with XOR X, and split them into multiple parts with equal XOR.

Perhaps I need to consider the number of times pf[r] appears in the prefix XOR from l to r-1.

If pf[r] appears at least once in pf[m] for m in [l,r-1], then I can split the subarray into [l,m] and [m+1,r], with both having XOR equal to pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[m] = X.

Wait, but if pf[m] = pf[r], then pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = X.

And pf[r] XOR pf[m] = pf[r] XOR pf[r] =0.

So, unless X=0, this doesn't hold.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix l and r.

Compute X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If X=0, then it's possible to split into even k >=2.

If X !=0, then it's possible to split into odd k >=3.

Hence, for X=0, answer YES.

For X !=0, answer NO.

But in the first test case, for [1,5], X=1 !=0, but it's allowed with k=3.

But according to this, I should answer NO.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps for X !=0, it's possible to split into odd k >=3, provided that there exists at least one m in [l,r-1] such that pf[m] XOR pf[l-1] = X.

Which is pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r].

So, I need to check if pf[r] appears in pf[m] for m in [l,r-1].

If yes, then it's possible to split into k=3 parts with Y=X.

Hence, for X !=0, if pf[r] appears at least once in pf[m] for m in [l,r-1], then answer YES; else, NO.

In the first test case, for [1,5], pf[r] = pf[5] = pf[4] XOR a[5] = ... (I need to compute it).

Wait, but in the first test case, a = [1,1,2,3,0].

Compute pf:

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 0 XOR 1 =1

pf[2] =1 XOR 1=0

pf[3] =0 XOR 2=2

pf[4] =2 XOR 3=1

pf[5] =1 XOR 0=1

So, pf = [0,1,0,2,1,1]

For [1,5], l=1, r=5.

pf[r] =1, pf[l-1]=0.

X=1 XOR 0=1.

Check if pf[r]=1 appears in pf[m] for m in [1,4].

Looking at pf[1]=1, pf[2]=0, pf[3]=2, pf[4]=1.

So, pf[r]=1 appears at m=1 and m=4.

Hence, it's possible to split into k=3 parts with Y=1.

For example, [1],[2,3,4],[5], but need to check XORs.

Wait, [1]:1, [2,3,4]:1 XOR 2 XOR 3=0, [5]:0 → not equal.

Wait, doesn't work.

Another split: [1,2],[3],[4,5]: XORs are 0,2,1 → not equal.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the explanation, it's split as [1],[1],[2,3,0], which corresponds to [1],[2],[3,4,5].

Wait, indices are 1-based.

a[1]=1, a[2]=1, a[3]=2, a[4]=3, a[5]=0.

So, [1],[2],[3,4,5]: XORs are 1,1,2 XOR 3 XOR 0=1 → equal.

Yes, that works.

So, in this case, pf[r]=1 appears at m=1 and m=4.

Hence, it's possible to split into k=3 parts with Y=1.

Similarly, for [2,4], l=2, r=4.

pf[r]=1, pf[l-1]=pf[1]=1.

X=1 XOR 1=0.

Since X=0, answer YES.

For [3,5], l=3, r=5.

pf[r]=1, pf[l-1]=pf[2]=0.

X=1 XOR 0=1.

Check if pf[r]=1 appears in pf[m] for m in [3,4].

pf[3]=2, pf[4]=1 → yes, at m=4.

Hence, it should be YES, but in the sample output, it's NO.

Wait, contradiction.

So, according to my logic, for [3,5], X=1, and pf[r]=1 appears at m=4 in [3,4], so it should be YES, but the sample output is NO.

Hence, my logic is flawed.

What's happening?

Looking back, in the first test case, queries:

1. [1,5]: YES

2. [2,4]: YES

3. [3,5]: NO

4. [1,3]: NO

5. [3,4]: NO

But according to my logic, [3,5] should be YES, but it's NO.

So, perhaps my condition is not sufficient.

Let me check the split for [3,5]:

Subarray [3,5]: [2,3,0]

Possible splits:

- k=2: [2,3],[0]: XORs 2 XOR 3=1, 0 → not equal.

- k=3: [2],[3],[0]: XORs 2,3,0 → not equal.

Hence, it's not possible to split into any k >=2 with equal XOR.

Hence, it should be NO, which aligns with the sample output.

But according to my earlier logic, since X=1, and pf[r]=1 appears in pf[m] for m in [3,4], specifically at m=4, so pf[4]=1.

So, I thought it should be YES, but actually, it's NO.

Hence, my condition is incorrect.

What's the issue?

Looking back, having pf[r] appear in pf[m] for some m in [l,r-1] is necessary, but not sufficient.

I need to ensure that the split is valid, meaning that the XOR of each part is equal to Y=X.

In the case of [3,5], pf[r]=1 appears at m=4, but the split [3,4],[5] has XORs 2 XOR 3=1 and 0, which are not equal.

Hence, just having pf[r] appear in pf[m] is not enough; I need to ensure that there exists at least one m in [l,r-1] where pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[r] XOR pf[m] = X.

Which simplifies to pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[m] = pf[r] XOR X.

But pf[l-1] XOR X = pf[r], and pf[r] XOR X = pf[l-1].

So, pf[m] needs to be pf[r], and pf[m] needs to be pf[l-1].

But pf[r] and pf[l-1] may be different unless X=0.

Hence, only when X=0, pf[r] = pf[l-1], and pf[m] can be pf[r]=pf[l-1].

So, perhaps the condition should be:

- If X=0, then it's possible to split into even k >=2.

- If X !=0, then it's possible to split into odd k >=3 only if there exists at least one m in [l,r-1] where pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[m] >= pf[l-1].

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for X !=0, it's possible to split into odd k >=3 only if there exists at least one m in [l,r-1] where pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[m] > pf[l-1].

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

I recall that in some problems involving XOR, the number of occurrences of a particular XOR value can be used to determine the number of subarrays with a certain property.

Perhaps I can precompute the frequency of each prefix XOR value and use that to determine if a subarray can be split into multiple parts with equal XOR.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a subarray [l,r], with XOR X, to be split into k parts with equal XOR Y, the following must hold:

- If k is even, X must be 0.

- If k is odd, X must be Y.

Hence, for X !=0, it's only possible to split into odd k >=3 if Y=X.

So, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one way to split the subarray into three parts with each part having XOR X.

But checking for three parts is still time-consuming for the given constraints.

Given that n and q can be up to 2e5, I need an O(n log n) or O(n) solution.

Perhaps I can precompute the positions where each prefix XOR value appears, and then, for each query, compute X and check the conditions based on X.

So, in code, I can have a dictionary where each XOR value maps to a list of positions where it appears.

Then, for each query [l,r], compute X = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Then:

- If X=0, answer YES.

- If X !=0, check if pf[r] appears in pf[m] for some m in [l,r-1].

If yes, answer YES; else, NO.

But in the earlier example, for [3,5], X=1, and pf[r]=1 appears at m=4 in [3,4], but it's not a valid split.

Hence, this condition is not sufficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for X !=0, it's possible to split into odd k >=3 only if there exists at least one m in [l,r-1] such that pf[m] = pf[l-1] XOR X and pf[r] XOR pf[m] = X.

Which simplifies to pf[m] =
