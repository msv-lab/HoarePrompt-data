Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n disks in a plane, each with integer coordinates for centers and positive integer radii. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent.

2. I need to check if it's possible to adjust the radii of these disks such that:

   a. Disks that were tangent remain tangent.

   b. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

And the new radii can be any positive real numbers, not necessarily integers, and the centers stay fixed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. Two disks are tangent if the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. So, if two disks are tangent, their boundaries touch at exactly one point.

Now, the problem allows me to change the radii as long as the tangent relationships are preserved, and no new overlaps are created. Additionally, the total sum of radii should decrease.

I need to think about how changing the radii affects these conditions.

Let's consider two disks that are tangent. If I change their radii, I need to ensure that the sum of their new radii equals the distance between their centers, so they remain tangent.

For disks that were not tangent, I need to ensure that the sum of their new radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers, so they don't overlap.

The goal is to adjust all radii such that the sum decreases, while maintaining these conditions.

This sounds like a system of equations and inequalities.

Let me try to model this mathematically.

Let’s denote the original radii as r1, r2, ..., rn.

The proposed new radii are r1', r2', ..., rn', all positive reals.

Constraints:

1. For each pair of tangent disks, say disks i and j, we have:

   ri' + rj' = distance between centers of i and j.

2. For each pair of non-tangent disks, say disks i and j, we have:

   ri' + rj' ≤ distance between centers of i and j.

3. The sum r1' + r2' + ... + rn' < r1 + r2 + ... + rn.

My task is to check if such a set of ri' exists satisfying all these conditions.

This seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to express the ri' in terms of each other using the tangent constraints, and then check if the sum can be made strictly less than the original sum.

Let's think about the tangent constraints first.

If two disks are tangent, their radii must sum to the distance between their centers in the new configuration.

If there are multiple tangent disks, these constraints might be interdependent.

For example, if disk A is tangent to disk B, and disk B is tangent to disk C, then the radii of A, B, and C are linked through their tangent conditions.

This sounds like a system of linear equations for the tangent pairs.

I can model this as a graph where each disk is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if their disks are tangent.

Each edge represents an equation of the form ri' + rj' = d_ij, where d_ij is the distance between centers of i and j.

Then, the problem reduces to solving this system of equations and inequalities.

In graph theory terms, this graph might have multiple connected components.

Within each connected component, the radii are related through the tangent constraints.

So, I can process each connected component separately.

Within a connected component, I can fix the radius of one disk and solve for the others.

But since the radii must be positive, there might be constraints on how much I can adjust them.

Moreover, I need to ensure that for non-tangent pairs within the component, the sum of radii is less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

Wait, but within a connected component defined by tangent relationships, all disks are tangent to each other through a chain of tangencies.

So, for non-tangent pairs within the component, the sum of their radii must be less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

But given that they are connected through tangent disks, there might be implicit relationships.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize it.

Consider a connected component of the graph where nodes are disks and edges are tangent relationships.

In this component, I can choose one disk as a reference and express the radii of all other disks in terms of this reference radius using the tangent constraints.

Then, I can check if I can adjust the reference radius in a way that the sum of all radii decreases, while satisfying the non-overlapping conditions for non-tangent pairs.

This seems feasible.

Let's try to work through an example.

Take the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Let's plot these disks.

Disk 1: center (0,2), radius 1

Disk 2: center (0,0), radius 1

Disk 3: center (4,-3), radius 4

Disk 4: center (11,0), radius 3

Disk 5: center (11,5), radius 2

First, check which disks are tangent.

Calculate the distance between centers and see if it equals the sum of radii.

Distance between disk 1 and 2: sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2

Sum of radii: 1 + 1 = 2 → tangent.

Distance between disk 1 and 3: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (2-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5 < 6.403 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 1 and 4: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4 < 11.180 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 1 and 5: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 9) = sqrt(130) ≈ 11.402

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3 < 11.402 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 2 and 3: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5 → tangent.

Distance between disk 2 and 4: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4 < 11 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 2 and 5: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) ≈ 12.083

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3 < 12.083 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 3 and 4: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

Sum of radii: 4 + 3 = 7 < 7.616 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 3 and 5: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-5)^2) = sqrt(49 + 64) = sqrt(113) ≈ 10.630

Sum of radii: 4 + 2 = 6 < 10.630 → not tangent.

Distance between disk 4 and 5: sqrt((11-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 3 + 2 = 5 → tangent.

So, the tangent pairs are:

1-2, 2-3, 4-5.

Now, I need to adjust the radii such that:

- 1 and 2 remain tangent: r1' + r2' = 2

- 2 and 3 remain tangent: r2' + r3' = 5

- 4 and 5 remain tangent: r4' + r5' = 5

- No other pairs overlap: r1' + r3' ≤ sqrt(41), r1' + r4' ≤ sqrt(125), etc.

- Sum of radii decreases: r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' < 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 11

Looking at the connected components:

- Disks 1,2,3 are connected through tangent relationships (1-2 and 2-3)

- Disks 4,5 are connected through tangent relationship (4-5)

- Disk 6 is not mentioned, but n=5, so only 1 through 5.

So, there are two connected components: {1,2,3} and {4,5}.

Within each component, I can express the radii in terms of one reference disk.

Let's take disk 1 as reference in component {1,2,3}.

Let’s set r1' = r1 - d, where d is a positive value to be determined, aiming to decrease the sum.

Then, from r1' + r2' = 2, we have r2' = 2 - r1'

Similarly, from r2' + r3' = 5, r3' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (2 - r1') = 3 + r1'

So, r3' = 3 + r1'

Now, I need to ensure that for non-tangent pairs, r1' + r3' ≤ sqrt(41), which is approximately 6.403.

But r1' + r3' = r1' + (3 + r1') = 2*r1' + 3

We need 2*r1' + 3 ≤ 6.403 → 2*r1' ≤ 3.403 → r1' ≤ 1.7015

Also, radii must be positive, so r1' > 0

Similarly, check other non-tangent pairs:

r1' + r4' ≤ sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

r1' + r5' ≤ sqrt(130) ≈ 11.402

r2' + r4' ≤ sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

r2' + r5' ≤ sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) ≈ 12.083

r3' + r4' ≤ sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

r3' + r5' ≤ sqrt(113) ≈ 10.630

r4' + r5' = 5 (since they are tangent)

In component {4,5}, similar approach.

Set r4' = r4 - e, where e is to be determined.

Then r5' = 5 - r4'

Now, in component {1,2,3}, we have:

r1' = r1 - d

r2' = 2 - r1' = 2 - (r1 - d) = 2 - r1 + d

r3' = 3 + r1' = 3 + (r1 - d) = 3 + r1 - d

Now, sum of radii:

s' = r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' = (r1 - d) + (2 - r1 + d) + (3 + r1 - d) + (r4 - e) + (5 - r4 + e)

Simplify:

s' = r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e

Combine like terms:

s' = (r1 - r1 + r1) + (-d + d - d) + (2 + 3 + 5) + (r4 - r4) + (-e + e)

s' = r1 - d + 10 - d

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's recalculate:

s' = (r1 - d) + (2 - r1 + d) + (3 + r1 - d) + (r4 - e) + (5 - r4 + e)

Let's group terms:

r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e

Combine like terms:

r1 - r1 + r1 + (-d + d - d) + (2 + 3 + 5) + r4 - r4 + (-e + e)

This simplifies to:

r1 - d + 10 - d

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's try again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in assigning variables.

Let me try a different approach.

Let’s consider that in each connected component, I can express all radii in terms of one reference radius.

For component {1,2,3}, let's set r1' = r1 - d, where d is the decrease in radius for disk 1.

Then, r2' = 2 - r1' = 2 - (r1 - d) = 2 - r1 + d

Similarly, r3' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (2 - r1 + d) = 3 + r1 - d

Now, for component {4,5}, set r4' = r4 - e, where e is the decrease for disk 4.

Then, r5' = 5 - r4' = 5 - (r4 - e) = 5 - r4 + e

Now, the sum of radii is:

s' = r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5'

= (r1 - d) + (2 - r1 + d) + (3 + r1 - d) + (r4 - e) + (5 - r4 + e)

Simplify:

= r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e

Combine like terms:

= r1 - r1 + r1 + (-d + d - d) + (2 + 3 + 5) + r4 - r4 + (-e + e)

= r1 - d + 10 - d

Wait, that still seems off.

Wait, r1 - r1 cancels out, but there's another r1 remaining.

Wait, let's carefully group the terms:

r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e

Grouping:

(r1 - r1 + r1) + (-d + d - d) + (2 + 3 + 5) + (r4 - r4) + (-e + e)

= r1 - d + 10 - d

Wait, that doesn't make sense because r1 - d + 10 - d should be r1 - 2d + 10

But the original sum is s = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 + r5 = 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 11

We need s' < 11

So, r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' < 11

Which is r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e < 11

Simplify:

r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e < 11

Combine like terms:

r1 - r1 + r1 + (-d + d - d) + (2 + 3 + 5) + r4 - r4 + (-e + e) < 11

Which simplifies to:

r1 - d + 10 - d < 11

Wait, that's r1 - 2d + 10 < 11

Given that r1 = 1, this becomes:

1 - 2d + 10 < 11 → 11 - 2d < 11 → -2d < 0 → d > 0

Which is always true since d > 0.

Wait, that can't be right because it suggests that any d > 0 would work, but that's not necessarily the case because we have to satisfy the non-tangent constraints.

For example, in component {1,2,3}, we have r1' + r3' ≤ sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403

But r1' + r3' = (r1 - d) + (3 + r1 - d) = 2*r1 + 3 - 2*d

Given r1 = 1, this is 2*1 + 3 - 2*d = 5 - 2*d

We need 5 - 2*d ≤ 6.403, which is always true since 5 < 6.403, regardless of d.

But we also need to ensure that all radii are positive.

So, r1' = r1 - d > 0 → d < r1 = 1

r2' = 2 - r1' = 2 - (1 - d) = 1 + d > 0, which is always true for d > 0

r3' = 3 + r1' = 3 + (1 - d) = 4 - d > 0 → d < 4

But since d < 1 from r1', this is already satisfied.

Similarly, in component {4,5}, set r4' = r4 - e = 3 - e > 0 → e < 3

r5' = 5 - r4' = 5 - (3 - e) = 2 + e > 0, which is always true for e > 0

Now, check non-tangent pairs between components.

For example, disk 1 and disk 4:

r1' + r4' ≤ sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

Which is (1 - d) + (3 - e) ≤ 11.180

But (1 - d) + (3 - e) = 4 - d - e ≤ 11.180, which is always true since 4 < 11.180

Similarly, check disk 1 and disk 5:

r1' + r5' = (1 - d) + (5 - r4' + e) = (1 - d) + (5 - (3 - e) + e) = 1 - d + 5 - 3 + e + e = 3 - d + 2e

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, r5' = 5 - r4' = 5 - (3 - e) = 2 + e

So, r1' + r5' = (1 - d) + (2 + e) = 3 - d + e ≤ sqrt(130) ≈ 11.402, which is always true.

Similarly, check other non-tangent pairs.

It seems that in this particular case, as long as d < 1 and e < 3, and d > 0, e > 0, the sum s' = r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' + r5' = r1 - d + 2 - r1 + d + 3 + r1 - d + r4 - e + 5 - r4 + e = r1 - d + 2 + 3 + r1 - d + 5 - e + e = 2*r1 + 10 - 2*d - e + e = 2*r1 + 10 - 2*d

Given r1 = 1, s' = 2*1 + 10 - 2*d = 12 - 2*d

Original sum s = 11

We need s' < s → 12 - 2*d < 11 → -2*d < -1 → d > 0.5

So, d > 0.5 and d < 1

Similarly, e can be any value between 0 and 3.

So, choosing d = 0.6, e = 0.1, for example, satisfies d > 0.5 and d < 1.

Thus, it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining the tangent relationships and no positive area overlaps.

Hence, the answer is "YES", which matches the first sample output.

Now, let's look at the second sample.

Input:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

Let's plot these disks.

Disk 1: (2,2), r=2

Disk 2: (7,2), r=3

Disk 3: (7,7), r=2

Disk 4: (2,7), r=3

Calculate distances:

Distance between 1 and 2: sqrt((2-7)^2 + (2-2)^2) = sqrt(25 + 0) = 5

Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5 → tangent.

Distance between 1 and 3: sqrt((2-7)^2 + (2-7)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071

Sum of radii: 2 + 2 = 4 < 7.071 → not tangent.

Distance between 1 and 4: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2-7)^2) = sqrt(0 + 25) = 5

Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5 → tangent.

Distance between 2 and 3: sqrt((7-7)^2 + (2-7)^2) = sqrt(0 + 25) = 5

Sum of radii: 3 + 2 = 5 → tangent.

Distance between 2 and 4: sqrt((7-2)^2 + (2-7)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071

Sum of radii: 3 + 3 = 6 < 7.071 → not tangent.

Distance between 3 and 4: sqrt((7-2)^2 + (7-7)^2) = sqrt(25 + 0) = 5

Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5 → tangent.

So, tangent pairs are:

1-2, 1-4, 2-3, 3-4.

This forms one connected component: all disks are connected through tangent relationships.

So, in this case, the entire graph is connected.

Now, I need to express all radii in terms of one reference disk.

Let’s choose disk 1 as reference, with r1' = r1 - d = 2 - d, where d > 0.

From 1-2 tangent: r1' + r2' = 5 → r2' = 5 - r1' = 5 - (2 - d) = 3 + d

From 2-3 tangent: r2' + r3' = 5 → r3' = 5 - r2' = 5 - (3 + d) = 2 - d

From 3-4 tangent: r3' + r4' = 5 → r4' = 5 - r3' = 5 - (2 - d) = 3 + d

Now, check non-tangent pairs:

1-3: r1' + r3' ≤ sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071

Which is (2 - d) + (2 - d) = 4 - 2*d ≤ 7.071, always true.

1-4: r1' + r4' = (2 - d) + (3 + d) = 5 ≤ sqrt(25 + 25) ≈ 7.071, always true.

2-4: r2' + r4' = (3 + d) + (3 + d) = 6 + 2*d ≤ sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071

So, 6 + 2*d ≤ 7.071 → 2*d ≤ 1.071 → d ≤ 0.5355

Also, all radii must be positive:

r1' = 2 - d > 0 → d < 2

r2' = 3 + d > 0 → always true for d > 0

r3' = 2 - d > 0 → d < 2

r4' = 3 + d > 0 → always true for d > 0

So, d must satisfy:

d > 0 and d ≤ 0.5355

Now, check if the sum decreases.

Original sum: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10

New sum: s' = r1' + r2' + r3' + r4' = (2 - d) + (3 + d) + (2 - d) + (3 + d) = 2 - d + 3 + d + 2 - d + 3 + d = 10

So, s' = 10, which is not less than 10.

Therefore, it's impossible to decrease the sum while maintaining the tangent relationships and no overlaps.

Hence, the answer is "NO", matching the second sample output.

From these examples, it seems that the key is to check if the sum of radii can be made strictly less than the original sum while satisfying the tangent constraints and non-overlap conditions for non-tangent pairs.

In the first sample, it was possible because the sum could be decreased by choosing appropriate d.

In the second sample, it was not possible because the sum remained the same regardless of d.

This suggests that in some connected components, the sum of radii is fixed up to a certain variable, and in other components, it's not.

So, perhaps the problem reduces to checking if there exists at least one connected component where the sum of radii is not fixed, meaning it can be decreased.

In the first sample, the sum could be decreased in the component {1,2,3}, while in the second sample, the sum couldn't be decreased in the single connected component {1,2,3,4}.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one connected component where the sum of radii is not fixed, otherwise "NO".

But in the second sample, even though the sum didn't change, perhaps there is a way to decrease it.

Wait, in the second sample, s' = 10, which is not less than 10, so it's impossible to decrease the sum while maintaining the constraints.

Hence, "NO".

So, how can I generalize this?

I need to model the system of equations from the tangent constraints and see if the sum of radii can be made strictly less than the original sum, while satisfying all constraints.

This sounds like a system of linear equations with some inequalities.

In graph terms, model the disks as nodes, and tangent relationships as edges.

In each connected component, solve the system of equations defined by the tangent edges.

Then, check if the sum of radii can be decreased while satisfying the inequalities for non-tangent pairs.

This seems complex, but perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the rank of the system.

In each connected component, the number of variables (radii) is equal to the number of disks in the component, and the number of equations is equal to the number of tangent edges in the component.

If the number of equations is less than the number of variables, then there are free variables, meaning I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum.

Otherwise, if the number of equations equals the number of variables, the radii are fully determined, and the sum is fixed.

Hence, if there exists at least one connected component where the number of tangent edges is less than the number of disks minus one (i.e., the component is not a tree), then I might be able to decrease the sum.

Wait, in linear algebra terms, the system of equations from the tangent relationships defines a linear space for the radii.

If the system has free variables, then I can adjust the radii accordingly.

So, if the number of independent equations is less than the number of variables, there are free variables.

Each connected component forms a graph, and the number of independent equations is equal to the number of tangent edges minus the number of disks plus one (similar to the formula for the number of independent cycles in a graph).

Wait, more precisely, the number of independent equations is equal to the number of tangent edges minus the number of connected components plus the number of disks.

But I need to recall the rank of the system.

Actually, in a system of equations where each equation is of the form ri' + rj' = ci,j, this can be modeled as a system of linear equations.

The solution space is affine, and the number of free variables is equal to the number of disks minus the number of independent equations.

If there are free variables, then I can adjust the radii to decrease the sum.

Hence, for each connected component, if the number of tangent edges is less than the number of disks in the component, then there are free variables, and I can potentially decrease the sum.

Otherwise, if the number of tangent edges equals the number of disks minus one (i.e., the component is a tree), then the radii are fully determined, and the sum is fixed.

Hence, the overall sum can be decreased if there exists at least one connected component where the number of tangent edges is less than the number of disks minus one.

In other words, if there exists a connected component that is not a tree.

Wait, in graph theory, a connected component with n disks and m tangent edges is a tree if m = n - 1.

If m < n - 1, it's a forest with more than one tree, but since it's a connected component, m = n - 1 for a tree.

If m > n - 1, it has cycles.

So, if m < n - 1, it's not fully connected, but since it's a connected component, m >= n - 1.

Wait, no, in a connected component, m >= n - 1, with m = n - 1 for a tree.

So, if m > n - 1, it has cycles, meaning there are dependent equations.

In this case, there might be constraints that allow adjusting the radii to decrease the sum.

Hence, for each connected component, if the number of tangent edges > number of disks - 1, then it's possible to decrease the sum.

Otherwise, if m = n - 1, the sum is fixed.

Hence, if there exists at least one connected component with m > n - 1, then it's possible to decrease the sum.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

So, in the first sample, component {1,2,3} has 2 tangent edges (1-2 and 2-3), with 3 disks: m = 2, n = 3, m = n - 1, which is a tree, sum is fixed.

Component {4,5} has 1 tangent edge, 2 disks: m = 1, n = 2, m = n - 1, sum is fixed.

Wait, but in the first sample, it was possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, maybe my earlier analysis was incorrect.

Wait, in the first sample, I was able to decrease the sum, but according to this, both components are trees, so sums are fixed.

But in the first sample, I did decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me revisit the first sample.

In the first sample, component {1,2,3} has tangent edges 1-2 and 2-3, which is a tree (m = n - 1).

Component {4,5} has one tangent edge, which is also a tree.

Yet, I was able to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the specific equations.

Wait, in the first sample, the sum s' = 12 - 2*d, which can be made less than 11 by choosing d > 0.5.

So, even though the component {1,2,3} is a tree, the sum is not fixed because there is a degree of freedom in choosing d.

Wait, but according to graph theory, in a tree, the system should be fully determined.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Let me model it properly.

In component {1,2,3}, with tangent edges 1-2 and 2-3.

Equations:

r1' + r2' = 2

r2' + r3' = 5

This gives two equations with three variables.

Hence, one free variable.

So, I can express r1' and r3' in terms of r2'.

Or, set one variable as a parameter.

Hence, there is one degree of freedom.

Similarly, in component {4,5}, one equation, two variables: one degree of freedom.

Hence, in components with m = n - 1, there is one degree of freedom.

In components with m > n - 1, there are more constraints, which might make the system inconsistent unless the constraints are compatible.

But in our case, since all constraints are distance equals sum of radii for tangent pairs, and non-overlapping for non-tangent pairs, it's a matter of checking if the system allows for a decrease in the sum.

In the first sample, even though each component is a tree, I could decrease the sum by adjusting d.

Hence, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's possible to decrease the sum if there is at least one connected component with m >= n - 1 and certain conditions.

Wait, maybe it's possible to decrease the sum if there is at least one connected component with m >= n - 1 and the system of equations allows for it.

But in the second sample, the component has m = 4 tangent edges and n = 4 disks: m = n - 1 + 1, which means it has a cycle.

But in that case, the sum is fixed, as seen in the calculations.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, s' = 10, which is not less than 10.

Hence, even though there is a cycle, the sum cannot be decreased.

So, perhaps having m > n - 1 doesn't necessarily allow decreasing the sum.

Hence, perhaps the condition is more nuanced.

Let me consider another approach.

Let’s consider that in each connected component, the sum of radii is determined up to a constant.

In other words, in a connected component, I can adjust the radii by adding or subtracting a constant value to all radii, while maintaining the tangent constraints.

But, I need to ensure that all radii remain positive.

Hence, the minimal sum is achieved when one of the radii is as small as possible, given the constraints.

So, in each connected component, I can find the minimal possible sum of radii by solving the system.

Then, if this minimal sum is less than the original sum, answer "YES", else "NO".

But this seems too time-consuming for a programming problem.

Is there a simpler way to check this?

Looking back at the first sample, I could decrease the sum by decreasing d, but in the second sample, no matter what d I choose, the sum remains the same.

Hence, perhaps in components where the sum is not fixed, I can decrease the sum.

But in the first sample, even in components where m = n - 1, I could decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the sum can be decreased in any connected component.

In the first sample, in component {1,2,3}, I could decrease d and make s' < s.

In component {4,5}, similarly, I could choose e to decrease the sum.

Hence, overall sum can be decreased.

In the second sample, in the single connected component, s' remains equal to s no matter what d I choose.

Hence, cannot decrease the sum.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that in a connected component, if it has at least one cycle (m > n - 1), then the sum is fixed, else it's not fixed.

But in the first sample, components have m = n - 1, and I could decrease the sum.

In the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1, and sum is fixed.

Wait, perhaps in components with m = n - 1, the sum is not fixed, and in components with m > n - 1, the sum is fixed.

Hence, if there exists at least one component with m = n - 1, then it's possible to decrease the sum.

But in the first sample, both components have m = n - 1, and I could decrease the sum.

In the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1, and sum is fixed.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that if there exists at least one connected component with m <= n - 1, then it's possible to decrease the sum.

But in the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1, so m > n - 1, sum is fixed.

In the first sample, m = n - 1 for each component, so it's possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, but according to this, in the second sample, m > n - 1, which should mean sum is fixed.

In the first sample, m = n - 1 for each component, which should mean sum is not fixed.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that if there exists at least one connected component with m <= n - 1, then it's possible to decrease the sum.

Hence, "YES" if any component has m <= n - 1, else "NO".

But in the first sample, m = n - 1 for both components, so "YES".

In the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1, so "NO".

This seems consistent.

Hence, the algorithm is:

1. Build a graph where disks are nodes, and tangent pairs are edges.

2. For each connected component, let n be the number of disks, m be the number of tangent edges.

3. If for any connected component, m <= n - 1, then answer "YES".

Else, answer "NO".

Wait, but in the first sample, m = n - 1 for both components, which satisfies m <= n - 1, so "YES".

In the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1, which is m > n - 1, so "NO".

Hence, this seems to work.

But let's verify with another example.

Suppose n=3, with tangent pairs 1-2 and 2-3, so m=2, n=3, m = n - 1, so "YES".

If n=3, m=3, which is m > n - 1, then "NO".

Hence, seems correct.

Hence, the condition is: if any connected component has m <= n - 1, then "YES", else "NO".

Now, in terms of implementing this, I need to:

1. Read n, read the disks' centers and radii.

2. Build a graph where disks are nodes, and edges exist between tangent pairs.

3. For each connected component, count the number of disks (n) and the number of tangent edges (m).

4. If for any component, m <= n - 1, then "YES", else "NO".

But in the first sample, m = n - 1 for both components, so "YES".

In the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1 for the single component, so "NO".

Hence, this seems to be the correct approach.

Now, to implement this efficiently, since n can be up to 1000, and m can be up to C(n,2) which is large, but since m <= C(n,2), and n=1000, it's manageable.

But, to optimize, I need to find a way to count m and n for each component efficiently.

I can use DFS or BFS to traverse each connected component, counting the number of nodes and edges.

Hence, the plan is:

- Build the adjacency list based on tangent pairs.

- For each unvisited disk, perform DFS to traverse the component, counting nodes and edges.

- Check if m <= n - 1 for any component.

- If yes, "YES", else "NO".

But, in the first sample, m = n - 1 for both components, so "YES".

In the second sample, m = n - 1 + 1 for the single component, so "NO".

Hence, this should work.

But, to confirm, let's think about a case where m < n - 1.

Suppose n=4, m=1.

Then, m < n - 1, so "YES".

Hence, "YES" if any component has m <= n - 1.

Now, considering that, perhaps I can rephrase it as:

If any connected component is not a tree (m > n - 1), then "NO", else "YES".

But, in the first sample, components are trees, and "YES".

In the second sample, component is not a tree, and "NO".

Hence, actually, "YES" if all components are trees, else "NO".

Wait, but in the first sample, both components are trees, so "YES".

In the second sample, the single component is not a tree, so "NO".

Hence, perhaps it's "YES" if all connected components are trees, else "NO".

But, wait, in the first sample, it was "YES" even though components are trees.

In the second sample, the component is not a tree, so "NO".

Hence, perhaps it's "YES" if all components are trees, else "NO".

But, according to earlier analysis, in the first sample, it was possible to decrease the sum even when components are trees.

Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a tree, the sum of radii is not fixed, meaning I can adjust it.

In a graph with cycles, the sum is fixed.

Hence, if there exists at least one component that is a tree (m = n - 1), then "YES", else "NO".

But in the first sample, components are trees, so "YES".

In the second sample, the component has m = n - 1 + 1, so it's not a tree, hence "NO".

Hence,
