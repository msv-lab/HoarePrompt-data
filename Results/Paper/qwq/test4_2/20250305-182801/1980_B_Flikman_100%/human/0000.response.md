Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows a value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order relative to each other.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is removed or not. The tricky part is that since cubes with the same value can be arranged in any order, we need to consider all possible arrangements of cubes with the same value and see if the favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or it could go either way.

Okay, let's think about this step by step.

First, I need to understand the input and what needs to be done. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I have n (number of cubes), f (index of the favorite cube), and k (number of cubes to remove). Then, there's a list of n integers representing the values on the cubes.

My task is to determine, for each test case, whether the favorite cube is always removed, never removed, or it could go either way, and print "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" accordingly.

Alright, so the key here is that when sorting in non-increasing order, cubes with the same value can be arranged in any order. That means that if there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, the favorite cube could be anywhere among them after sorting.

Let me consider an example to understand this better.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 5, f = 2, k = 2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

The favorite cube is at position 2, which has value 3.

After sorting in non-increasing order, the array could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] or [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], etc., as long as it's sorted in non-increasing order.

If the sorted array is [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], the favorite cube (value 3) is in position 2, which is removed since k=2.

If the sorted array is [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], the favorite cube could be in position 2 or position 4. If it's in position 2, it's removed; if it's in position 4, it's not removed.

Therefore, it's possible that the favorite cube is removed or not removed, depending on the arrangement of cubes with value 3.

Hence, the answer is "MAYBE".

Another example:

n = 5, f = 5, k = 3

a = [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]

Favorite cube is at position 5, value 5.

After sorting in non-increasing order: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The first k=3 cubes are [5, 4, 3], so the favorite cube is removed.

Since there's only one cube with value 5, its position is fixed, so it will always be removed.

Hence, the answer is "YES".

Another case:

n = 5, f = 5, k = 2

a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]

Favorite cube is at position 5, value 3.

After sorting: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

The first k=2 cubes are [5, 4], which don't include the favorite cube.

However, if there were another cube with value 3, its position could vary.

But in this case, there's only one cube with value 3, so it's always in position 3, which is not among the first k=2 removed cubes.

Hence, the answer is "NO".

From these examples, I can see that the key factors are:

1. The value of the favorite cube.

2. How many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.

3. Where the favorite cube could be positioned after sorting, considering that cubes with the same value can be in any order.

4. The number of cubes removed, k.

So, to generalize:

- Find the value of the favorite cube.

- Count how many cubes have this value.

- After sorting in non-increasing order, determine the possible positions of the favorite cube.

- Check if, in all possible arrangements, the favorite cube is always within the first k cubes, always not within the first k cubes, or it could be either.

To implement this, I need to:

- Read the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case:

- Read n, f, k.

- Read the list a of n integers.

- Find the value of the favorite cube: favorite_value = a[f-1]

- Count how many cubes have this value: count = a.count(favorite_value)

- Sort the list in non-increasing order: sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)

- Find the positions where the favorite value could be after sorting.

- Since cubes with the same value can be in any order, the favorite cube could be in any of the positions where the value appears in the sorted list.

- Determine the range of positions where the favorite cube could be.

- If all possible positions are within the first k, then "YES".

- If none of the possible positions are within the first k, then "NO".

- Otherwise, "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the sorted list, the positions of cubes with the same value are arbitrary. So, the favorite cube could be in any position among the ones with its value.

For example, if after sorting, the list is [5,4,3,3,3,2], and the favorite cube has value 3, which appears in positions 3,4,5.

Then, the favorite cube could be in any of positions 3,4,5.

If k=2, removing positions 1 and 2, which are 5 and 4, so the favorite cube is not removed, regardless of its position.

Hence, "NO".

But in the first example, with [4,3,3,3,2], k=2, favorite cube is 3, positions 2,3,4.

Removing positions 1 and 2, which are 4 and 3, so if the favorite cube is in position 2 (value 3), it's removed; if in position 3, it's not removed.

Hence, "MAYBE".

Wait, but in this case, the sorted list is [4,3,3,3,2], and the favorite cube is one of the 3's.

So, the favorite cube could be in position 2,3, or 4.

Removing positions 1 and 2.

If it's in position 2, it's removed; if in position 3 or 4, it's not removed.

Hence, it could be removed or not, depending on its exact position among the 3's.

Therefore, "MAYBE".

Another way to think about it is:

- Find the number of cubes that have values greater than the favorite cube.

- Find the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube.

- Determine the possible positions of the favorite cube based on these counts.

For example, in the sorted list, the cubes with values greater than the favorite cube will be before those with the favorite value.

The cubes with the favorite value can be arranged in any order among themselves.

So, if there are m cubes with values greater than the favorite value, then the favorite cube can be in positions m+1 to m + count.

Then, if k <= m, none of the favorite cubes are removed.

If k > m, then some or all of the favorite cubes are removed, depending on k.

Specifically:

- The number of cubes removed that have values greater than the favorite value is min(k, m).

- The remaining removed cubes, if any, will be among the favorite value cubes.

So, the number of favorite cubes removed is max(0, k - m).

Then, since the favorite cube can be in any position among the favorite value cubes, the probability or the possibility of it being removed depends on this.

Wait, but we don't need probability; we need to determine if it's always removed, never removed, or sometimes removed.

So, let's think in terms of positions.

Let me define:

- Let greater_count be the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite value.

- Let same_count be the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

Then, after sorting, the favorite cube can be in any position from greater_count + 1 to greater_count + same_count.

Now, the first k cubes are removed.

So, if k <= greater_count, none of the favorite cubes are removed, since they start at position greater_count + 1.

Hence, answer is "NO".

If k >= greater_count + same_count, all favorite cubes are removed, since they are all within the first k cubes.

Hence, answer is "YES".

If greater_count < k < greater_count + same_count, then some of the favorite cubes are removed, specifically k - greater_count of them.

Since the favorite cube can be in any position from greater_count + 1 to greater_count + same_count, it could be among the removed ones or not, depending on its exact position.

Therefore, answer is "MAYBE".

Wait, but in this case, since some of the favorite cubes are removed and some are not, depending on their positions, and the favorite cube could be in any of these positions, it's possible that it's removed or not.

Hence, "MAYBE".

So, to summarize:

- If k <= greater_count: "NO"

- If k >= greater_count + same_count: "YES"

- Else: "MAYBE"

This seems like a correct approach.

Now, how to implement this.

I need to:

- Find the favorite value: favorite_value = a[f-1]

- Count the number of cubes with value greater than favorite_value: greater_count = sum(1 for x in a if x > favorite_value)

- Count the number of cubes with the same value as favorite_value: same_count = sum(1 for x in a if x == favorite_value)

- Then:

- If k <= greater_count: print("NO")

- Elif k >= greater_count + same_count: print("YES")

- Else: print("MAYBE")

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Let me test this logic with the first example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

favorite_value=3

greater_count = number of cubes with value >3: only 4, so greater_count=1

same_count = number of cubes with value=3: three cubes

k=2

Since greater_count < k < greater_count + same_count (1 < 2 < 4), answer is "MAYBE" - matches the example.

Second example:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

favorite_value=5

greater_count = number of cubes with value >5: none, so 0

same_count = number of cubes with value=5: one

k=3

Since k >= greater_count + same_count (3 >= 1), answer is "YES" - matches the example.

Third example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

favorite_value=3

greater_count = number of cubes with value >3: 5 and 4, so 2

same_count = number of cubes with value=3: one

k=2

Since k <= greater_count (2 <= 2), answer is "NO" - matches the intuition.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=5

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

favorite_value=5

greater_count=4

same_count=1

k=5

Since k >= greater_count + same_count (5 >= 5), answer is "YES".

Another one:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

favorite_value=5

greater_count=4

k=4

Since k <= greater_count (4 <=4), answer is "NO".

Wait, but in this case, greater_count=4, same_count=1, k=4.

According to the rule, since k <= greater_count, answer is "NO", which means the favorite cube is not removed.

But wait, in the sorted list, it would be [5,4,3,2,1], so removing first k=4 cubes: [5,4,3,2], which includes the favorite cube.

But according to the rule, since k <= greater_count, answer should be "NO", meaning not removed, but in this case, it is removed.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

Wait, let's recast the rule.

Wait, perhaps my initial logic is flawed.

Wait, in this case, with n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

favorite_value=5

greater_count=number of cubes with value >5: none, so 0

same_count=1

k=4

Since k >= greater_count + same_count (4 >=1), answer should be "YES", meaning the favorite cube is always removed.

But in reality, in the sorted list [5,4,3,2,1], the first 4 cubes are [5,4,3,2], which includes the favorite cube.

Hence, it's always removed, which matches "YES".

Wait, but earlier I thought of another case:

n=5, f=5, k=4

a=[3,1,2,4,5]

favorite_value=5

greater_count=number of cubes with value >5: none, so 0

same_count=1

k=4

According to the rule, since k >= greater_count + same_count (4 >=1), answer is "YES", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I mistakenly thought greater_count was 4, which is wrong.

No, in this case, greater_count is 0 because no cube has value greater than 5.

Wait, in the array [3,1,2,4,5], values are 3,1,2,4,5.

Only 5 is equal to favorite_value=5, and none are greater than 5.

Wait, hold on, 4 > 5? No, 4 < 5.

Wait, I must have miscounted.

In this case, favorite_value=5

Values greater than 5: none

Values equal to 5: one

So, greater_count=0, same_count=1

Hence, since k=4 >= greater_count + same_count (0 +1 =1), answer is "YES", which is correct, because the favorite cube is always among the first 4 removed cubes.

Another test case:

n=5, f=3, k=1

a=[2,1,3,4,5]

favorite_value=3

greater_count=2 (4 and 5)

same_count=1 (3)

k=1

Since k <= greater_count (1 <=2), answer is "NO", meaning the favorite cube is not removed.

Indeed, after sorting [5,4,3,2,1], the first cube removed is 5, which is not the favorite cube.

Hence, correct.

Another test case:

n=5, f=4, k=2

a=[2,1,3,5,4]

favorite_value=4

greater_count=1 (5)

same_count=1 (4)

k=2

Since k > greater_count (2 >1), but k < greater_count + same_count (2 < 2), wait, 2 < 2 is false, so k >= greater_count + same_count, answer is "YES"

Indeed, after sorting [5,4,3,2,1], the first two removed are 5 and 4, so the favorite cube is always removed.

Hence, correct.

Another test case:

n=5, f=3, k=3

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

favorite_value=3

greater_count=0 (no value >3)

same_count=5

If k=3, then since k <= greater_count + same_count (3 <=5), and k > greater_count (3 >0), answer is "MAYBE"

Because the favorite cube could be in positions 1,2,3,4,5 after sorting, and the first 3 are removed, so it could be removed or not, depending on its position.

Wait, but in this case, all cubes are 3, so after sorting, it's [3,3,3,3,3], and the favorite cube could be in any of the positions.

Hence, "MAYBE" is correct.

Another test case:

n=1, f=1, k=1

a=[42]

favorite_value=42

greater_count=0

same_count=1

k=1

Since k >= greater_count + same_count (1 >=1), answer is "YES", which is correct, as the only cube is removed.

Edge case:

n=1, f=1, k=0

a=[100]

favorite_value=100

greater_count=0

same_count=1

k=0

Since k <= greater_count (0 <=0), answer is "NO", which is correct, as no cubes are removed.

Another edge case:

n=2, f=1, k=1

a=[1,1]

favorite_value=1

greater_count=0

same_count=2

k=1

Since k > greater_count and k < greater_count + same_count (1 < 2), answer is "MAYBE", which is correct, as the favorite cube could be in position 1 or 2, and only position 1 is removed.

Another case:

n=3, f=2, k=2

a=[2,1,2]

favorite_value=1

greater_count=2 (two 2's)

same_count=1 (one 1)

k=2

Since k <= greater_count (2 <=2), answer is "NO", which is correct, as the favorite cube is in position 2, which is after the first two cubes removed.

Wait, but after sorting, it's [2,2,1], so removing the first two cubes: [2,2], favorite cube is not removed.

Hence, correct.

Wait, but if favorite_value is 1, then greater_count is the number of cubes with value >1, which are the two 2's.

same_count is one (1).

k=2 <= greater_count (2 <=2), so answer is "NO".

Hence, correct.

Seems like the logic holds for various cases.

Therefore, the implementation should be:

- Read t

- For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read list a

- favorite_value = a[f-1]

- greater_count = sum(1 for x in a if x > favorite_value)

- same_count = sum(1 for x in a if x == favorite_value)

- if k <= greater_count:

print("NO")

elif k >= greater_count + same_count:

print("YES")

else:

print("MAYBE")

This seems efficient and correct.

Now, looking at the given code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

favorite_value = a[f - 1]

sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)

removed_count = 0

for i in range(k):

if sorted_a[i] == favorite_value:

removed_count += 1

favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)

if removed_count == favorite_count:

print('YES')

elif removed_count == 0:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

Wait, this seems different from my approach.

In this code:

- It sorts the array in non-increasing order.

- Then, it counts how many favorite_value cubes are in the first k removed cubes.

- Then, it counts the total number of favorite_value cubes.

- If all favorite_value cubes are in the first k, print "YES"

- If none are in the first k, print "NO"

- Else, print "MAYBE"

But this doesn't account for the fact that cubes with the same value can be in any order among themselves.

Wait, in the sorted list, the favorite_value cubes are together, but their order among themselves is arbitrary.

So, the favorite cube could be in any position among those favorite_value cubes.

Hence, if all favorite_value cubes are in the first k, then the favorite cube is always removed.

If none are in the first k, it's never removed.

If some are in the first k and some are not, then it could be removed or not, depending on its position.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I didn't sort the array; I just counted the number of cubes greater than the favorite value and the number with the same value.

Then, based on those counts, determined the possible positions of the favorite cube.

Both approaches should be equivalent, but this one sorts the array to determine how many favorite_value cubes are in the first k.

However, since cubes with the same value can be in any order, this should still work.

Let me check with an example.

Take the first example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

favorite_value=3

sorted_a=[4,3,3,3,2]

first k=2: [4,3]

removed_count=1 (one 3)

favorite_count=3

Since removed_count=1 < favorite_count=3, and removed_count !=0, answer is "MAYBE" - correct.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

favorite_value=5

sorted_a=[5,4,3,2,1]

first k=3: [5,4,3]

removed_count=1 (one 5)

favorite_count=1

removed_count == favorite_count, so "YES" - correct.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

favorite_value=3

sorted_a=[5,4,3,2,1]

first k=2: [5,4]

removed_count=0

favorite_count=1

removed_count ==0, so "NO" - correct.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

But my initial approach didn't sort the array; it just counted the number of cubes greater than the favorite value and the number with the same value.

I think my initial approach is more efficient, as it avoids sorting and directly counts the required values.

Let me implement it and see.

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n, f, k = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

favorite_value = a[f-1]

greater_count = sum(1 for x in a if x > favorite_value)

same_count = sum(1 for x in a if x == favorite_value)

if k <= greater_count:

print("NO")

elif k >= greater_count + same_count:

print("YES")

else:

print("MAYBE")

This should work.

Let me test it with the same examples.

First example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

favorite_value=3

greater_count=1 (only 4 >3)

same_count=3

k=2

Since greater_count < k < greater_count + same_count (1 <2 <4), answer is "MAYBE" - correct.

Second example:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a=[4,2,1,3,5]

favorite_value=5

greater_count=0

same_count=1

k=3

Since k >= greater_count + same_count (3 >=1), answer is "YES" - correct.

Third example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a=[5,2,4,1,3]

favorite_value=3

greater_count=2 (5 and 4)

same_count=1

k=2

Since k <= greater_count (2 <=2), answer is "NO" - correct.

Hence, both approaches yield correct answers.

However, my initial approach is more efficient, as it avoids sorting the array each time and just counts the required values.

But the given code sorts the array and counts the number of favorite_value in the first k.

This should also work, as it effectively determines how many favorite_value cubes are in the first k positions after sorting.

Given that, I need to determine if the given program is correct.

From the analysis above, it seems correct, as it handles the cases where the favorite cube could be in any position among those with the same value.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
