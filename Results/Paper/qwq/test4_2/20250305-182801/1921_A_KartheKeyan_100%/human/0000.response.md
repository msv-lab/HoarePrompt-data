Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. My job is to calculate the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed to have a positive area.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that alignment.

Given that, I can think about how the coordinates of the square's corners are related. In a square with sides parallel to the axes, opposite sides are equal, and the angles are right angles. So, the coordinates should consist of two distinct x-values and two distinct y-values, each repeated twice among the four points.

For example, if I have points like (1,2), (4,2), (4,5), and (1,5), these form a square with sides parallel to the axes. Here, x-values are 1 and 4, and y-values are 2 and 5.

Given that, the area of the square should be the product of the differences in the x-values and y-values. Wait, but since it's a square, the lengths of the sides should be equal, so the difference in x-values should be equal to the difference in y-values.

Wait, actually, in a square, all sides are equal, so the difference in x-values between adjacent points should equal the difference in y-values between adjacent points.

But, since the sides are parallel to the axes, the horizontal sides will have the same y-coordinate, and the vertical sides will have the same x-coordinate.

So, to find the area, I need to find the length of one side and then square it.

But, in the problem, it's given that the square has a positive area, and the coordinates are guaranteed to form such a square, so I don't need to handle degenerate cases.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it's doing.

The function `func` is defined, and it seems to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the input integer `n`.

Inside the loop for each test case, it reads four lines of input, each containing two integers, which are the coordinates of the corners.

It stores these coordinates in a list called `coord`.

Then, it sorts the list of coordinates. Sorting coordinates could be useful to standardize their order, making it easier to calculate distances.

After sorting, it calculates two quantities `p1` and `p2`, which seem to be squared distances between certain pairs of points.

Specifically, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second points in the sorted list, and `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth points.

Then, it calculates the area as the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, and prints the rounded result.

Wait a minute, in a square, all sides are equal, so the distances between adjacent points should all be the same. But here, it's calculating distances between the first and second points and between the third and fourth points, and then multiplying their square roots to get the area.

Is this the correct approach?

Let me think about this.

In a square with sides parallel to the axes, the sides are either horizontal or vertical. So, the horizontal sides have the same y-coordinate, and the vertical sides have the same x-coordinate.

If I sort the coordinates, say in increasing order of x, and then within x, by y, then the sorted list would have points like (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2), assuming x1 < x2 and y1 < y2.

In this case, the horizontal sides would be between (x1,y1) and (x2,y1), and between (x1,y2) and (x2,y2). The vertical sides would be between (x1,y1) and (x1,y2), and between (x2,y1) and (x2,y2).

So, the length of the horizontal sides would be |x2 - x1|, and the length of the vertical sides would be |y2 - y1|.

Since it's a square, these lengths should be equal, i.e., |x2 - x1| should equal |y2 - y1|.

Given that, the area would be (side length)^2, which is |x2 - x1|^2.

Now, looking back at the code, it calculates `p1` as the squared distance between the first and second points, and `p2` as the squared distance between the third and fourth points.

In the sorted list I imagined earlier, the first and second points are (x1,y1) and (x1,y2), so their squared distance is (y2 - y1)^2.

Similarly, the third and fourth points are (x2,y1) and (x2,y2), so their squared distance is also (y2 - y1)^2.

Then, it takes the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, which would be |y2 - y1| and |y2 - y1|, and multiplies them to get the area, which would be |y2 - y1|^2.

But in a square, this is correct because |y2 - y1| equals |x2 - x1|, so the area is indeed |x2 - x1|^2.

Wait, but is this always the case?

Let me consider the sorting order.

If I sort the coordinates, I need to ensure that the points are ordered in a way that makes sense for this calculation.

In the example I gave, sorting gives (x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2).

In this case, the first and second points are vertically aligned, as are the third and fourth points.

So, calculating the distances between these pairs gives the vertical side length squared.

Then, multiplying the square roots of these distances gives the area, which is correct.

But, what if the sorting order is different?

For instance, if the sorted list is (x1,y1), (x2,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y2).

In this case, the first and second points are horizontally aligned, so the distance between them is |x2 - x1|^2.

The third and fourth points are also horizontally aligned, with the same distance.

Then, taking the square roots and multiplying them would give |x2 - x1|^2, which is again the area.

So, regardless of whether the sorted pairs are horizontal or vertical sides, as long as they are opposite sides, the calculation should work.

But, I need to confirm if sorting the coordinates always results in pairs that are opposite sides.

Let me consider the sorting process.

Sorting tuples in Python sorts primarily by the first element, and then by the second if the first elements are equal.

So, in the list [(x1,y1), (x1,y2), (x2,y1), (x2,y2)], with x1 < x2 and y1 < y2, sorting would indeed give that order.

In this case, the first and second points share the same x, meaning they are vertically aligned.

Similarly, the third and fourth points share the same x.

So, the distances between the first and second, and third and fourth, give the vertical side lengths.

Then, multiplying their square roots gives the area.

Alternatively, if the sorted list has the first and second points horizontally aligned, their distance would give the horizontal side length.

Either way, in a square, both side lengths are equal, so the area calculation holds.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Let me check the example provided.

First test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

Sorting these points:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

So, sorted order is:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

p1 is distance between (1,2) and (1,5): (1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

p2 is distance between (4,2) and (4,5): (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Then, area is sqrt(9) * sqrt(9) = 3 * 3 = 9, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

Sorting these points:

(-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

p1 is distance between (-1,-1) and (-1,1): 0 + 4 = 4

p2 is distance between (1,-1) and (1,1): 0 + 4 = 4

Area is sqrt(4) * sqrt(4) = 2 * 2 = 4, matching the sample output.

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Sorting these points:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

p1 is distance between (17,11) and (17,39): 0 + 784 = 784

p2 is distance between (45,11) and (45,39): 0 + 784 = 784

Area is sqrt(784) * sqrt(784) = 28 * 28 = 784, matching the sample output.

So, in all sample cases, this approach works correctly.

Is there any edge case where this might fail?

Let me think about a square with side length 1.

For example:

0 0

0 1

1 0

1 1

Sorting gives:

(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

p1 = (0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1

p2 = (1-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1

Area = sqrt(1) * sqrt(1) = 1 * 1 = 1, which is correct.

Another case: side length 0, but the problem says the area is strictly greater than 0, so we don't need to handle that.

What if the coordinates are not integers?

The problem states that the coordinates are integers, within the range -1000 to 1000, so no need to worry about non-integer coordinates.

What if the square is degenerate, i.e., all points are the same, but again, the problem guarantees a valid square with positive area.

Also, the problem mentions that it's guaranteed that there is a square with the given properties, so we don't need to handle invalid inputs.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

An alternative approach could be to find the unique x and y values, compute their differences, and square that.

For example, in the first test case, unique x values are 1 and 4, difference is 3, unique y values are 2 and 5, difference is 3, area is 3^2 = 9.

Similarly, in the second test case, x values -1 and 1, difference 2, y values -1 and 1, difference 2, area 4.

This is essentially what the code is doing, indirectly, by calculating the distances between vertically or horizontally aligned points.

So, the code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{9} \]

\[ \boxed{4} \]

\[ \boxed{784} \]

**Correctness:** **True**
