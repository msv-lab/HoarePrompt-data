Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" along with the number of stalls and their prices. If not, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with values of n and k, both can be up to 10^18. The number of test cases, t, is up to 1000, which isn't too bad in terms of performance.

Let me look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 7, k = 3

Bob sets up 10 stalls with prices 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

Alice starts with 7 coins.

- At stall 1 (price 2): she can buy 7 // 2 = 3 jewels, but she'll have 1 coin left.

- Since 1 coin is less than the price of any other stall, she stops here, having bought 3 jewels.

This matches the desired k = 3.

In the third test case:

n = 255, k = 8

Stalls: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

Perfect, that makes sense.

Now, I need to figure out a general strategy for any n and k.

Constraints:

- Up to 60 stalls

- Each stall has a price between 1 and 10^18

- Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence

- She continues to the next stall only if she has coins left

Goal: Make sure she buys exactly k jewels.

First thoughts:

- If k = 1, I can set one stall with price n, so she buys one jewel.

- If n = k, set one stall with price 1, so she buys n jewels, but if n != k, that's not helpful.

- If n < k, it's impossible because she can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

Wait, no. If n < k, it's still possible if I set some stalls with price >1, so she buys fewer jewels with more coins.

But in this problem, since each jewel costs at least 1 coin, she can't buy more jewels than coins if each jewel costs at least 1 coin. So, if n < k, it's impossible.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=7, k=3: 7 coins, buy 3 jewels. That's possible because jewels cost more than 1 coin each, so she buys fewer jewels.

Wait, but in that case, the total cost is 3*2=6 coins, and she has 7, so she has 1 coin left, which is fine.

But if n=3, k=4: she can't buy 4 jewels with 3 coins, even if some jewels cost less than 1 coin, but since prices are at least 1, it's impossible.

So, n >= k is a necessary condition.

Is it sufficient?

Not necessarily. For example, n=3, k=3: set one stall with price 1, she buys 3 jewels.

n=4, k=2: set one stall with price 2, she buys 2 jewels.

n=5, k=2: set one stall with price 3, she buys 1 jewel, needs another stall.

Set second stall with price 2, she buys 1 jewel from there, total 2 jewels.

So, seems possible.

Wait, but in this approach, I need to ensure that she buys exactly k jewels, not more, not less.

So, I need to control the number of jewels she buys.

I need a way to make her buy exactly k jewels by setting up s stalls (s <= 60) with appropriate prices.

I need to find a sequence of s prices such that when she buys jewels from each stall, the total number of jewels is exactly k.

I need to think about how the number of jewels bought at each stall affects the total.

Let me think about the minimal number of stalls required.

If I set s=1, then she buys floor(n / p1) jewels, where p1 is the price.

This equals k only if n / p1 = k, i.e., p1 = n / k, but only if n is divisible by k.

So, for s=1, it's only possible if n is divisible by k and p1 = n / k.

But in the first example, n=7, k=3: 7 is not divisible by 3, so s=1 is not possible.

For s=2:

First stall: p1

She buys floor(n / p1) jewels, let's say m1.

Then, she has n - m1 * p1 coins left.

Second stall: p2

She buys floor((n - m1 * p1) / p2) jewels, m2.

Total jewels: m1 + m2 = k.

I need to choose p1 and p2 such that m1 + m2 = k.

This seems tricky to generalize.

Is there a better way to approach this?

Maybe I can think in terms of the remaining coins after each stall.

Let me consider the general case with s stalls.

Let p1, p2, ..., ps be the prices.

She buys m1 = floor(n / p1) jewels at the first stall.

Then, she has n1 = n - m1 * p1 coins left.

At the second stall, she buys m2 = floor(n1 / p2) jewels.

Then, n2 = n1 - m2 * p2 coins left.

And so on, until the s-th stall.

Total jewels: m1 + m2 + ... + ms = k.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that this sum is exactly k.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a pattern or a strategy to choose the prices.

Let me consider the greedy approach.

If I set p1 to be as large as possible, then m1 is minimized, which might help in controlling the total jewels.

Wait, but I need to make m1 + m2 + ... + ms = k.

Alternatively, if I set p1 to be small, m1 is large, which might make it harder to reach exactly k.

I need to find a balance.

Maybe I can start by setting p1 such that m1 is as close as possible to k, then adjust subsequent stalls accordingly.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set p1 = n - k + 1.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems to do something similar.

Let me look at the provided code.

def func_1(n, k):

if n == k:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(1)

return

if n < k:

print('NO')

return

costs = [n - k + 1, 1]

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

if h < k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(*costs)

So, the approach here is:

- If n == k, set one stall with p=1, so she buys n jewels.

- If n < k, impossible, print 'NO'

- Otherwise, set two stalls: p1 = n - k + 1, p2 = 1

- Calculate how many jewels she buys from each stall, sum them up, and if the sum is at least k, print 'YES' and the stall prices.

Wait, but in the example, they have multiple stalls, up to 60.

But in this function, they only use 2 stalls.

Is this sufficient for all cases?

In the first test case: n=7, k=3

p1 = 7 - 3 + 1 = 5

p2 = 1

She buys floor(7/5)=1 jewel from stall 1, remaining coins: 7 - 1*5 = 2

Then, buys floor(2/1)=2 jewels from stall 2.

Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k=3.

Good.

In the third test case: n=255, k=8

p1 = 255 - 8 + 1 = 248

p2 = 1

She buys floor(255/248)=1 jewel from stall 1, remaining coins: 255 - 1*248 = 7

Then, buys floor(7/1)=7 jewels from stall 2.

Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k=8.

Good.

But in the second test case: n=6, k=4

p1 = 6 - 4 + 1 = 3

p2 = 1

She buys floor(6/3)=2 jewels from stall 1, remaining coins: 6 - 2*3 = 0

Then, can't buy anything from stall 2.

Total jewels: 2 < 4

So, h=2 < k=4, hence 'NO'

Which matches the sample output.

So, this approach seems to work for these cases.

But is it general?

Let me think about another case.

Suppose n=10, k=5

p1 = 10 - 5 + 1 = 6

p2 = 1

She buys floor(10/6)=1 jewel from stall 1, remaining coins: 10 - 6 = 4

Then, buys floor(4/1)=4 jewels from stall 2.

Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k=5.

Good.

Another case: n=5, k=2

p1 = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4

p2 = 1

She buys floor(5/4)=1 jewel from stall 1, remaining coins: 5 - 4 =1

Then, buys floor(1/1)=1 jewel from stall 2.

Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k=2.

Good.

Another case: n=4, k=3

p1 = 4 - 3 +1 =2

p2 =1

She buys floor(4/2)=2 jewels from stall 1, remaining coins: 4 - 4 =0

Then, can't buy anything from stall 2.

Total jewels: 2 < 3

So, 'NO'

Which makes sense because with n=4, k=3, it's impossible to make her buy exactly 3 jewels.

Wait, is it really impossible?

Let me think.

If I set p1=2, p2=1, as above, she buys 2 jewels from p1 and 0 from p2, total 2 <3.

If I set p1=3, p2=1

She buys floor(4/3)=1 jewel from p1, remaining 1 coin.

Then, buys 1 jewel from p2.

Total: 1 +1 =2 <3

If I set p1=1, p2=1

She buys 4 jewels from p1, and doesn't go to p2.

Total:4 >3

Not exactly 3.

Seems like it's impossible.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Another case: n=10, k=3

p1=10-3+1=8

p2=1

She buys floor(10/8)=1 jewel from p1, remaining 2 coins.

Then, buys floor(2/1)=2 jewels from p2.

Total:1+2=3, which matches k=3.

Good.

Seems like this approach works.

But is there any case where h >=k, but we need exactly k?

In the function, if h >=k, it prints 'YES' and the two prices.

But in the explanation, it seems that h should be exactly k.

Wait, in the function, it's checking if h <k, then 'NO', else 'YES'

But in reality, h could be greater than k, but we need exactly k.

Wait, but in the examples provided, h equals k.

In the first test case: h=3, k=3

Third test case: h=8, k=8

In the second test case: h=2 <4, so 'NO'

But what if h >k?

Look at n=10, k=3: h=3, which is equal to k

Another example: n=10, k=4

p1=10-4+1=7

p2=1

She buys floor(10/7)=1 jewel from p1, remaining 3 coins.

Then, buys floor(3/1)=3 jewels from p2.

Total:1+3=4, which matches k=4.

Good.

Another example: n=10, k=5

p1=10-5+1=6

p2=1

She buys 1 jewel from p1, remaining 4 coins.

Then, buys 4 jewels from p2.

Total:5, which matches k=5.

But what if n=10, k=6

p1=10-6+1=5

p2=1

She buys floor(10/5)=2 jewels from p1, remaining 0 coins.

Then, can't buy from p2.

Total:2 <6

So, 'NO'

Correct.

Seems like this approach covers cases where h >=k, but in practice, h equals k.

So, it seems to work.

But in the function, it's printing 'YES' if h >=k, but according to the problem, we need exactly k.

Is there any case where h >k?

Let me see.

n=10, k=4

p1=10-4+1=7

p2=1

She buys 1 jewel from p1, 3 from p2, total 4.

n=10, k=5

p1=10-5+1=6

p2=1

She buys 1 from p1, 4 from p2, total 5.

n=10, k=2

p1=10-2+1=9

p2=1

She buys 1 from p1, 1 from p2, total 2.

n=10, k=1

She can set p1=10, buy 1 jewel.

n=10, k=10

Set p1=1, buy 10 jewels.

Seems like h always equals k with this approach.

So, perhaps this approach is correct.

But let's think about a case where n is much larger than k.

n=1000, k=10

p1=1000-10+1=991

p2=1

She buys floor(1000/991)=1 jewel from p1, remaining 9 coins.

Then, buys floor(9/1)=9 jewels from p2.

Total:1+9=10, which matches k=10.

Good.

Another case: n=1000, k=500

p1=1000-500+1=501

p2=1

She buys floor(1000/501)=1 jewel from p1, remaining 499 coins.

Then, buys floor(499/1)=499 jewels from p2.

Total:1+499=500, which matches k=500.

Good.

Seems consistent.

But what if n=1000, k=700

p1=1000-700+1=301

p2=1

She buys floor(1000/301)=3 jewels from p1, remaining 1000-3*301=77 coins.

Then, buys floor(77/1)=77 jewels from p2.

Total:3+77=80, which is less than 700.

Wait, that's less than k.

So, h=80 <700, so 'NO'

But is there a way to set up stalls to make her buy exactly 700 jewels with 1000 coins?

Let's see.

If s=1, p1= floor(1000/700)=1, but 1000//1=1000 >700, so too many.

s=2:

p1=?

p2=?

Not sure.

Maybe it's impossible, so 'NO'

Hence, the function correctly outputs 'NO' in this case.

Seems correct.

Another angle: what if k=1?

Then, set p1=n, so she buys one jewel.

Good.

What if k=0?

But k is a positive integer, according to the problem.

So, k >=1.

Alright.

Edge cases:

- n=k: set p1=1, she buys n jewels.

But in the function, it has a separate condition for n==k, setting p1=1.

- n=k+1, k=1: p1= n -1 +1 =n, p2=1

She buys 1 jewel from p1, remaining 1 coin.

Buys floor(1/1)=1 jewel from p2.

Total:2 >k=1, which is not desired.

Wait, but according to the function, it would set p1=n -1 +1 =n, p2=1

Then, m1 = floor(n / n)=1, remaining 0 coins.

Can't buy from p2.

Total:1, which equals k=1.

Good.

Wait, in n=2, k=1

p1=2-1+1=2

p2=1

m1= floor(2/2)=1, remaining 0 coins.

Total:1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another edge case: n=1, k=1

p1=1-1+1=1

p2=1

m1= floor(1/1)=1, remaining 0 coins.

Total:1, which matches k=1.

Good.

Another edge case: n=1, k=2

p1=1-2+1=0, but p1 should be at least 1, so invalid.

Hence, 'NO'

But according to the function, if n <k, print 'NO'

Wait, n=1 <k=2, so 'NO'

Good.

Seems covered.

So, overall, this approach seems correct.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, while this function only uses 2 stalls.

Is it possible that for some n and k, we need more than 2 stalls?

In the example provided, in the third test case, they used 8 stalls.

But according to this function, it seems that 2 stalls are sufficient in the cases I've checked.

Is there any case where 2 stalls are not sufficient, but more stalls are needed?

Let me think.

Suppose n=10, k=4

As above, with p1=7, p2=1, h=4, which matches k=4.

Good.

Another case: n=10, k=3

p1=8, p2=1

m1=1, remaining 2 coins.

m2=2, total 3.

Good.

Another case: n=10, k=2

p1=9, p2=1

m1=1, remaining 1 coin.

m2=1, total 2.

Good.

Seems consistent.

Hence, it seems that 2 stalls are sufficient for cases where h >=k.

But according to the problem, s can be up to 60.

In the provided function, s=2, which is less than 60, so it's acceptable.

Hence, the function seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's check another case.

n=1000, k=500

p1=1000-500+1=501

p2=1

m1=1, remaining 499 coins.

m2=499

Total:500.

Good.

Another case: n=1000, k=1001

p1=1000-1001+1=0, which is invalid.

But according to the function, since n <k, it prints 'NO'

Wait, n=1000 <k=1001? No, n=1000 >=k=1001?

Wait, n=1000 >=k=1001?

Wait, n=1000 <k=1001, so 'NO'

Hence, correct.

Seems like the function handles this correctly.

Another case: n=1000, k=1000

Set p1=1, she buys 1000 jewels.

Good.

Another case: n=1000, k=999

p1=1000-999+1=2

p2=1

She buys floor(1000/2)=500 jewels from p1, remaining 0 coins.

Total:500 <999, so 'NO'

But is there a way to make her buy exactly 999 jewels?

If s=2, p1= something, p2= something else.

Wait, with p1=2, p2=1, m1=500, m2=0, total 500.

With p1=3, p2=1, m1=333, m2=1, total 334 <999.

With p1=1, p2=1, m1=1000, m2=0, total 1000 >999.

No combination seems to reach exactly 999.

Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Seems like the function handles this correctly.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correct}} \]
