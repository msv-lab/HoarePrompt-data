Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are two players, Alice and Bob, who are playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find the sum of the array after both have played optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and constraints. Each test case starts with three integers: n, k, and x, where n is the number of elements in the array, k is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and x is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. Then there's the array itself, consisting of n integers.

The problem says that there are multiple test cases, and the sum of n across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which means I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) at worst.

Let me think about how Alice and Bob should play optimally.

Alice goes first and can remove up to k elements. Since she wants to maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest elements if Bob doesn't change any signs, because removing negative numbers would increase the sum. But Bob will be changing some signs, so I need to consider that.

Wait, the array elements are given as positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), so initially, all elements are positive. But Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1, making some positive elements negative or negative elements positive, but since they start positive, multiplying by -1 makes them negative.

Wait, no. The problem says "multiply at most x elements of the array by -1". So if an element is positive, multiplying by -1 makes it negative, and vice versa. But since all elements are initially positive, Bob can choose to make up to x of them negative.

Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she wants as many positive numbers as possible, especially the largest ones. Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he wants to make as many positive numbers negative as he can, up to x times.

But Alice can remove up to k elements first. So she needs to remove some elements in a way that after Bob potentially flips up to x elements, the sum is still maximized.

This seems like a two-player game where each player makes decisions to optimize their own goal.

Let me try to model this.

First, Alice removes up to k elements. Then Bob chooses up to x elements to flip their signs.

I need to consider all possible combinations of Alice's removals and Bob's flips and find the optimal combination where Alice maximizes the sum and Bob minimizes it.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice chooses a removal strategy to maximize the sum assuming Bob will choose the best flip strategy to minimize it.

To approach this, perhaps I can consider sorting the array and then deciding which elements to remove and which to flip.

Let's think about sorting the array in ascending order. So the smallest elements are first, and the largest are last.

Alice can remove up to k elements. To maximize the sum, she should probably remove the smallest elements, but I need to consider Bob's moves.

Wait, if Alice removes the smallest elements, then the remaining elements are larger, which is good for maximizing the sum. Then Bob will choose up to x elements to flip to negative, which would decrease the sum.

So Alice needs to anticipate Bob's moves and perhaps remove some elements that would be vulnerable to Bob's flips.

This is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I can think in terms of the final sum after both players have made their moves.

Let me consider that after Alice removes k elements, there are n - k elements left. Then Bob can flip up to x of them to negative.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to have as many positive elements as possible, especially the largest ones. Bob, on the other hand, wants to flip the largest positive elements to negative to reduce the sum.

So, if Alice removes the smallest elements, the remaining elements are larger, but Bob can flip the largest ones to negative.

Alternatively, maybe Alice should remove some of the elements that Bob would likely flip.

Wait, perhaps it's better for Alice to remove the elements that, if flipped by Bob, would cause the most damage to the sum.

In other words, Alice should remove the elements that are large and positive, to prevent Bob from flipping them to negative.

But that seems counterintuitive because removing large elements decreases the sum.

Wait, no. Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she wants to keep the large positive elements. But Bob can flip up to x elements to negative, so he would choose to flip the largest positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Therefore, Alice needs to remove some elements in such a way that the elements Bob can flip are minimized in impact.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let's consider that after Alice removes k elements, there are n - k elements left. Bob will then flip up to x of them to negative.

To find the optimal sum, I need to consider that Bob will flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

Therefore, Alice should remove the elements that, if left, would be flipped by Bob, causing the greatest decrease in the sum.

In other words, Alice should remove the x largest elements, so that Bob cannot flip them to negative.

But if Alice removes the x largest elements, then Bob cannot flip them, and the remaining elements are smaller, but all positive.

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize the sum, so removing the smallest elements would leave the largest elements, but Bob can flip up to x of them to negative.

So perhaps a better strategy is for Alice to remove the elements that are smallest in magnitude, i.e., the smallest positive elements, because Bob would prefer to flip the largest positive elements to negative.

Wait, but all elements are positive, so "smallest in magnitude" is the same as smallest positive elements.

So, Alice removes the smallest k elements, leaving the largest n - k elements.

Then Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative.

Therefore, the sum would be the sum of the largest n - k elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements among them (because flipping them to negative effectively subtracts twice their value from the sum).

Wait, let's see:

- Sum of remaining elements: sum of largest n - k elements.

- Bob flips x of them to negative, which subtracts 2 * sum of the x largest among them.

Therefore, the final sum is: sum of largest n - k elements - 2 * sum of the x largest among them.

But Alice can choose which k elements to remove to maximize this sum.

Wait, but if Alice removes the smallest k elements, then the remaining elements are the largest n - k elements.

Then Bob flips the x largest among them to negative, which minimizes the sum.

So, in this strategy, the sum would be sum(Largest n - k) - 2 * sum(Largest x among them).

But maybe Alice can do better by removing some other elements.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them to negative.

But that seems counterproductive because removing large positive elements decreases the sum.

Wait, no, Alice wants to maximize the sum, so she wants to keep as many large positive elements as possible, but Bob will flip up to x of them to negative.

So, by removing some of the elements that Bob would flip, Alice can prevent the sum from decreasing as much.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let S be the set of elements after Alice removes k elements.

Bob will then flip up to x elements in S to negative.

Alice wants to choose S to maximize the minimum possible sum after Bob's flip.

This is a minimax problem: maximize over S (min over Bob's choices).

To solve this, Alice should choose S such that the sum minus twice the sum of the x largest elements in S is maximized.

In other words, sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S) is maximized.

This can be rewritten as sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, think of it as sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S) = sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S) = sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

That seems redundant.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after flipping the top x elements to negative, the sum becomes sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

So Alice wants to maximize this quantity: sum(S) - 2 * sum(top x in S).

This can be rewritten as sum(S) - sum(top x in S) - sum(top x in S).

But perhaps a better approach is to consider different choices of S and compute this quantity.

But this seems inefficient. I need a better way.

Let me consider that Alice can choose which elements to remove, up to k.

She needs to choose which k elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements.

Assuming the array is sorted in ascending order, the smallest elements are first.

If Alice removes the smallest k elements, then the remaining elements are the largest n - k elements.

Then Bob will flip the x largest among them to negative.

So the sum would be sum(largest n - k) - 2 * sum(largest x among them).

But maybe Alice can do better by removing some of the larger elements that Bob would flip.

Wait, suppose Alice removes some of the larger elements that Bob would flip.

Then, the remaining elements would have fewer large elements for Bob to flip.

But removing large elements decreases the sum.

It's a trade-off.

Perhaps Alice should remove the smallest elements and accept that Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better strategy.

Let me consider different values of k.

If k = 0, Alice cannot remove any elements, so she has to keep all elements, and Bob will flip the x largest elements to negative.

So the sum is sum(all elements) - 2 * sum(top x elements).

If k = n, Alice can remove all elements, and the sum is 0.

But k can be anywhere from 0 to n.

I need to find, for each possible k from 0 to k, what is the sum after Bob flips up to x elements, and choose the one that maximizes this sum.

Wait, no. Alice can choose to remove up to k elements, so she can choose any number from 0 to k elements to remove.

For each possible number of elements removed, from 0 to k, calculate the sum after Bob flips up to x elements, and choose the maximum among these sums.

Wait, but Bob can only flip up to x elements, so I need to consider that.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let’s sort the array in ascending order.

For each possible number of elements Alice removes, say r, where 0 ≤ r ≤ k, Alice removes the smallest r elements.

Then, the remaining elements are the largest n - r elements.

Bob will then flip up to x of them to negative.

To minimize the sum, Bob will flip the x largest among these n - r elements to negative.

Therefore, the sum after Bob's move is sum(largest n - r elements) - 2 * sum(top x of the largest n - r elements).

Alice needs to choose r between 0 and k to maximize this sum.

So, Alice should choose r that maximizes [sum(largest n - r elements) - 2 * sum(top x of the largest n - r elements)].

I need to compute this for each r from 0 to k and take the maximum.

But computing this directly might be too slow if n is large.

I need a more efficient way.

Let’s think about the array being sorted in ascending order.

Let’s denote the sorted array as a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n.

Then, for a given r, the largest n - r elements are a_{r+1}, ..., a_n.

Bob will flip the x largest among them, which are a_{n - x + 1}, ..., a_n, assuming n - r ≥ x.

Wait, no. The largest n - r elements are a_{r+1} to a_n.

The x largest among them are a_{n - x + 1} to a_n, provided that n - r ≥ x.

If n - r < x, then Bob can flip all n - r elements to negative.

So, in general, the sum after Bob's move is:

sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=max(r + 1, n - x + 1)} to n a_i.

Wait, let's see:

- Sum of largest n - r elements: sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i.

- Sum of the x largest among them: if n - r ≥ x, then sum_{i=n - x + 1 to n} a_i; else, sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i.

Therefore, the sum after Bob's move is:

sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * min(sum_{i=n - x + 1 to n} a_i, sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i).

Wait, more precisely:

If n - r ≥ x, then sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=n - x + 1 to n} a_i.

Else, sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i = - sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i.

So, the sum after Bob's move is:

if n - r ≥ x:

sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=n - x + 1 to n} a_i

else:

sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i = - sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i.

Alice needs to choose r between 0 and k to maximize this sum.

So, for each r from 0 to k, calculate this sum and take the maximum.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to precompute prefix sums.

Let me sort the array in ascending order and compute prefix sums.

Let prefix[r] = sum of first r elements (a_1 to a_r).

Then, sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i = total_sum - prefix[r].

Similarly, sum_{i=n - x + 1 to n} a_i = total_sum - prefix[n - x].

So, if n - r ≥ x, sum after Bob's move is (total_sum - prefix[r]) - 2 * (total_sum - prefix[n - x]) = - total_sum - prefix[r] - 2 * (total_sum - prefix[n - x]).

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's define prefix sums correctly.

Let’s define prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = a_1

prefix[2] = a_1 + a_2

...

prefix[r] = a_1 + ... + a_r

Then, sum from r+1 to n = prefix[n] - prefix[r]

Sum from n - x + 1 to n = prefix[n] - prefix[n - x]

So, if n - r ≥ x, sum after Bob's move is (prefix[n] - prefix[r]) - 2 * (prefix[n] - prefix[n - x]) = - prefix[r] - prefix[n] + 2 * prefix[n - x]

Else, sum after Bob's move is (prefix[n] - prefix[r]) - 2 * (prefix[n] - prefix[r]) = - prefix[n] + prefix[r]

Therefore, for each r from 0 to k, calculate:

if n - r >= x:

sum = - prefix[r] - prefix[n] + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

sum = - prefix[n] + prefix[r]

Then, take the maximum over these sums.

Wait, but prefix[n] is the total sum.

So, let’s denote total = prefix[n]

Then, if n - r >= x:

sum = - prefix[r] - total + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

sum = - total + prefix[r]

Alice needs to choose r to maximize this sum.

I need to find max over r=0 to k of:

if n - r >= x:

- prefix[r] - total + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

- total + prefix[r]

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Let me consider that for each r, the sum after Bob's move is:

if n - r >= x:

sum = sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{n - x +1 to n} a_i

else:

sum = sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{r+1 to n} a_i = - sum_{r+1 to n} a_i

But sum_{r+1 to n} a_i = total - prefix[r]

sum_{n - x +1 to n} a_i = total - prefix[n - x]

So, if n - r >= x:

sum = (total - prefix[r]) - 2 * (total - prefix[n - x]) = - prefix[r] - total + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

sum = - (total - prefix[r])

So, Alice needs to maximize over r=0 to k:

if n - r >=x:

- prefix[r] - total + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

- total + prefix[r]

This seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I can factor out some terms.

Notice that total is a constant for a given test case.

So, I can write the expression as:

if n - r >=x:

- prefix[r] - total + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

- total + prefix[r]

Alice wants to maximize this over r from 0 to k.

I can factor out -total from both cases:

if n - r >=x:

- prefix[r] + 2 * prefix[n - x] - total

else:

prefix[r] - total

Wait, maybe it's better to consider that total is constant and focus on the variable parts.

Let me consider defining:

if n - r >=x:

sum = - prefix[r] + 2 * prefix[n - x] - total

else:

sum = prefix[r] - total

Alice wants to maximize this over r from 0 to k.

I can think of it as:

sum(r) = if n - r >=x: - prefix[r] + C else: prefix[r] - total

where C = 2 * prefix[n - x] - total

But this still seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that Bob will always flip the x largest remaining elements after Alice's removal.

So, if Alice removes r elements (smallest r elements), the remaining elements are a_{r+1} to a_n.

Bob will flip the x largest among them, which are a_{n - x +1} to a_n.

Therefore, the sum after Bob's move is:

sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=n - x +1 to n} a_i

But only if n - r >=x.

If n - r < x, then Bob flips all n - r elements to negative.

So, sum = sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i = - sum_{i=r+1 to n} a_i

Therefore, the sum after Bob's move is:

if n - r >=x:

sum = sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{n - x +1 to n} a_i

else:

sum = - sum_{r+1 to n} a_i

Alice needs to choose r between 0 and k to maximize this sum.

So, for each r from 0 to k, calculate:

if n - r >=x:

sum = sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_{n - x +1 to n} a_i

else:

sum = - sum_{r+1 to n} a_i

And choose the maximum among these sums.

Now, to compute this efficiently, I can precompute prefix sums.

Let’s sort the array in ascending order.

Compute prefix[r] = sum of first r elements.

Then:

sum_{r+1 to n} a_i = prefix[n] - prefix[r]

sum_{n - x +1 to n} a_i = prefix[n] - prefix[n - x]

So, if n - r >=x:

sum = (prefix[n] - prefix[r]) - 2 * (prefix[n] - prefix[n - x]) = - prefix[r] - prefix[n] + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

sum = - (prefix[n] - prefix[r])

So, for each r from 0 to k, calculate:

if n - r >=x:

sum = - prefix[r] - prefix[n] + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

sum = - prefix[n] + prefix[r]

Then, take the maximum over these sums.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I can precompute prefix sums.

Let’s implement this step by step.

First, sort the array in ascending order.

Compute prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = a[0]

prefix[2] = a[0] + a[1]

...

prefix[n] = sum of all elements.

Then, for each r from 0 to k:

if n - r >=x:

sum_r = - prefix[r] - prefix[n] + 2 * prefix[n - x]

else:

sum_r = - prefix[n] + prefix[r]

Collect all sum_r and take the maximum.

This should work.

Let me verify this with the first test case.

Test case 1:

1

1 1 1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1

Array: [1]

Alice can remove up to 1 element, so she can remove the 1.

Then, Bob has no elements to flip, so sum is 0.

Alternatively, if Alice removes nothing, she has to keep 1, Bob can flip it to -1.

So sum is -1.

Alice会选择移除1，使得和为0，比-1要大，所以最优和是0。

按照上面的公式：

Sort array: [1]

prefix[0] = 0

prefix[1] = 1

total = 1

For r=0:

n - r =1 >=1, so sum = -prefix[0] - total + 2 * prefix[n - x] = -0 -1 + 2*prefix[0] = -1

For r=1:

n - r =0 <1, so sum = -total + prefix[1] = -1 +1 =0

Maximum of -1 and 0 is 0, which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Sorted: 1,2,3,4

prefix: 0,1,3,6,10

total=10

For r=0:

n - r =4 >=1, sum=-0-10+2*prefix[3]= -0-10+2*6=2

For r=1:

n - r=3 >=1, sum=-1-10+2*6=-1-10+12=1

So maximum is 2, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

6 6 3

1 4 3 2 5 6

Sorted:1,2,3,4,5,6

prefix:0,1,3,6,10,15,21

total=21

x=3

Possible r from 0 to 6.

For r=0:

n - r=6 >=3, sum=-0-21+2*prefix[3]=-0-21+2*6=-21+12=-9

For r=1:

n - r=5 >=3, sum=-1-21+2*prefix[3]=-1-21+12=-10

For r=2:

n - r=4 >=3, sum=-3-21+2*10=-3-21+20=-4

For r=3:

n - r=3 >=3, sum=-6-21+2*10=-6-21+20=-7

For r=4:

n - r=2 <3, sum=-21+prefix[4]=-21+10=-11

For r=5:

n - r=1 <3, sum=-21+15=-6

For r=6:

n - r=0 <3, sum=-21+21=0

Maximum is 0, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Sorted:2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9

prefix:0,2,5,8,11,16,21,30,40

total=40

x=3

Possible r from 0 to 5.

For r=0:

n - r=8 >=3, sum=-0-40+2*prefix[5]=-0-40+2*21=-40+42=2

For r=1:

n - r=7 >=3, sum=-2-40+2*prefix[5]=-2-40+42=0

For r=2:

n - r=6 >=3, sum=-5-40+2*prefix[5]=-5-40+42=-3

For r=3:

n - r=5 >=3, sum=-8-40+2*prefix[5]=-8-40+42=-6

For r=4:

n - r=4 >=3, sum=-11-40+2*prefix[5]=-11-40+42=-9

For r=5:

n - r=3 >=3, sum=-16-40+2*prefix[5]=-16-40+42=-14

So maximum is 2.

But in the sample input, the output is -5.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, sample input is:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Output: -5

But according to my calculation, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, in the note for the fifth test case:

"In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then multiply 5,5,3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 ."

Wait, according to my earlier calculation, sum should be 2, but sample output is -5.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose r=5, even though sum is -14, but in the note, they choose r=5, but sum is -5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

Wait, the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", so Bob can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

But in my earlier approach, I assumed Bob flips exactly x elements.

Wait, but the problem says "at most x elements", which means Bob can choose to flip fewer.

So, in the sum after Bob's move, it's the sum after flipping up to x elements.

So, Bob will choose to flip elements to minimize the sum.

So, if flipping fewer than x elements gives a larger sum, Bob might choose to flip fewer.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I assumed Bob flips exactly x elements.

I need to adjust for the fact that Bob can choose to flip fewer elements, up to x.

So, for each r, the sum after Bob's move is sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum of the x largest elements among them.

But if n - r < x, Bob can only flip up to n - r elements.

Wait, more precisely, Bob will flip the x largest elements among the remaining to minimize the sum.

But if he can choose to flip fewer, he will choose the number that minimizes the sum.

Wait, but the problem says "multiply at most x elements by -1", which means Bob can choose to flip any number from 0 to x elements.

So, for each r, the sum after Bob's move is sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * min(sum of any up to x elements among them).

But minimizing sum_{r+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum_of_flipped, where sum_of_flipped is up to x elements.

To minimize this, Bob will choose to flip the x largest elements.

Wait, no. To minimize sum - 2 * sum_flipped, Bob wants to make sum_flipped as large as possible.

Wait, sum after Bob's move is sum - 2 * sum_flipped.

To minimize this, Bob wants to make sum_flipped as large as possible, up to x elements.

Wait, yes, because sum - 2 * sum_flipped is minimized when sum_flipped is maximized.

So, Bob will choose to flip the x largest elements.

Therefore, in my earlier approach, assuming Bob flips the x largest elements is correct.

So, in the fifth test case, according to my calculation, the maximum sum is 2, but the sample output is -5.

There must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input, for the fifth test case:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Output: -5

But according to my calculation, for r=0 to 5:

r=0: sum=2

r=1: sum=0

r=2: sum=-3

r=3: sum=-6

r=4: sum=-9

r=5: sum=-14

Maximum is 2, but sample output is -5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when n - r < x, Bob cannot flip more than n - r elements.

In my earlier calculation, for r=5:

n - r=3 >=3, so sum=-16-40+2*21=-16-40+42=-14

But according to the note, Alice removes two 9's, so remaining elements are [2,3,3,3,5,5,9], but wait, n=8, r=5, so remaining n - r=3 elements, which are the largest three:9,9,5.

Wait, sorted array is [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

Removing the smallest 5 elements:2,3,3,3,5, leaving [5,9,9]

Then Bob can flip up to 3 elements.

But n - r=3 >=x=3, so he flips all three to negative: -5-9-9=-23

Wait, but sum is -23, but according to the note, it's -5.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"Alice removes 9,9, so remaining elements are [1,4,3,2,5,6], but in this test case, it's [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9].

Wait, in the note, it says "remove 9,9", but according to my earlier approach, for r=5, Alice removes the smallest 5 elements, which are 2,3,3,3,5, leaving [5,9,9].

Then Bob flips the x=3 largest elements, which are 9,9,5, to negative: -9,-9,-5, sum=-23.

But sample output is -5.

Wait, perhaps I misread the note.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"Alice removes 9,9, so the remaining elements are [5,5,3,3,3,2], sum=5+5+3+3+3+2=21.

Bob multiplies 5,5,3 by -1, so sum= -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5."

Wait, but in the array [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9], removing 9 and 9 leaves [5,5,3,3,3,2], sum=21.

Bob flips the x=3 largest elements, which are 5,5,3, to negative: -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5.

So, in my earlier approach, I mistakenly thought that for r=5, Alice removes the smallest 5 elements, but in reality, Alice can choose which elements to remove, not necessarily the smallest.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I assumed that Alice removes the smallest r elements, but perhaps she can choose to remove different elements to optimize the sum.

Wait, the problem says "remove up to k elements", meaning she can choose any subset of up to k elements to remove.

In my earlier approach, I assumed she removes the smallest r elements, but perhaps she can choose differently.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, Alice removes the two largest elements (9 and 9), leaving [5,5,3,3,3,2], and then Bob flips the x=3 largest elements, which are 5,5,3, to negative.

So, in this case, sum is -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5.

In my earlier approach, assuming Alice removes the smallest r elements led to a different result.

So, perhaps my assumption was wrong.

Alice doesn't necessarily have to remove the smallest elements; she can remove any elements to maximize the sum after Bob's moves.

In this case, by removing the two largest elements, Alice ensures that Bob cannot flip them to negative, and the remaining sum is 21, and Bob flips the next largest elements to minimize the sum to -5.

In my earlier approach, I assumed Alice removes the smallest r elements, but perhaps she should remove different elements.

This complicates things.

I need to find a way for Alice to choose which elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements from the remaining ones.

This seems more involved.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider that after Alice removes k elements, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, Alice should prevent Bob from flipping the largest possible elements.

So, Alice should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But removing large positive elements decreases the sum.

So, it's a trade-off between removing small elements to keep large elements for the sum, and removing large elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

This is tricky.

In the sample explanation, Alice removes the two largest elements (9 and 9), leaving [5,5,3,3,3,2], and Bob flips the x=3 largest elements, which are 5,5,3, to negative, resulting in sum=-5.

If Alice had removed different elements, say removes two 3's, leaving [5,5,3,3,2,9,9], but n=8, k=5, so she can remove up to 5 elements.

Wait, n=8, k=5, so she removes 5 elements.

To maximize the sum, she needs to choose which 5 elements to remove.

In the sample explanation, she removes two 9's, which are the largest elements, to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But in doing so, she leaves larger elements for the sum, but Bob can flip the next largest elements.

Wait, in that case, perhaps removing the smallest elements is better.

Wait, in the sample explanation, removing the two largest elements leads to a sum of -5, but in my earlier approach, removing the smallest 5 elements leads to sum=-23.

So, clearly, removing the smallest elements is worse.

Therefore, my earlier approach is flawed.

I need to find a better way for Alice to choose which elements to remove.

This seems more complicated than I initially thought.

Perhaps I need to consider the difference between the elements that Bob can flip and the ones that Alice removes.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting a subset of elements to keep, such that the sum after flipping up to x of them is maximized.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, and Bob flips up to x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to maximize the sum of the remaining elements after Bob flips up to x of them.

Given that Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative to minimize the sum, Alice needs to minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Therefore, to maximize the sum after Bob's flip, Alice needs to minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, let's see.

The final sum is sum(remaining elements) - 2 * sum(top x remaining elements).

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

So, sum(remaining) - 2 * sum(top x remaining).

To maximize this, Alice needs to maximize sum(remaining) and minimize 2 * sum(top x remaining), but she can't control both directly.

It's a trade-off.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to consider different strategies for Alice.

One strategy is to remove the smallest k elements, assuming that Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements.

Another strategy is to remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

I need to find which strategy gives the best sum.

Perhaps the optimal strategy is to remove the elements with the highest difference between their positive and negative values, but since all elements are positive, that difference is 2 * a_i.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the cost of flipping an element.

Each element that Bob flips reduces the sum by 2 * a_i.

So, to minimize the sum, Bob will flip the elements with the highest a_i.

Therefore, Alice should prevent Bob from flipping the largest elements by removing them.

But removing them also reduces the sum.

So, Alice needs to decide which elements to remove to balance between keeping the sum high and preventing Bob from flipping the largest elements.

This seems like a knapsack problem, where Alice chooses which elements to remove to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

But that might be too slow for the time constraints.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, and Bob flips x elements from the remaining n - k.

To maximize the sum, Alice wants to maximize sum - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements.

This can be rewritten as sum - 2 * sum(top x remaining).

Alice wants to maximize this, which means maximizing sum and minimizing sum(top x remaining).

These objectives are conflicting because minimizing sum(top x remaining) might require removing some large elements, which decreases sum.

Therefore, Alice needs to find a balance.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, even though that decreases the sum.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that, if flipped by Bob, would cause the most damage.

These are the x largest elements.

Wait, but if Alice removes them, they are not included in the sum at all.

So, it's better for Alice to keep as many large elements as possible, but also prevent Bob from flipping the largest ones.

This is confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements.

Then, Bob flips the x largest remaining elements to negative.

The sum is sum of remaining elements -
