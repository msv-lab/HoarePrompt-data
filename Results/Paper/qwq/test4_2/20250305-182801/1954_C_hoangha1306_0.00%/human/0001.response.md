Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, both of the same length, and consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. I can perform operations where I swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, possibly zero. My goal is to maximize the product of x and y after performing these operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations allow me to do. Since I can swap the i-th digits of x and y any number of times, it means that for each position, I can choose whether to swap or not, independently of the other positions. So, for each digit position, I have two choices: keep it as it is or swap it.

My aim is to maximize the product of x and y. To maximize the product, I need to maximize both x and y as much as possible, considering that they are interdependent through these swap operations.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to consider that for each position, I have two options: either keep the digits as they are or swap them. I need to choose for each position whether to swap or not, in a way that maximizes the overall product.

But since the product depends on all digits, it's not straightforward to make a decision for each position independently. Maybe there's a smarter way to decide when to swap and when not to.

Let me consider an example to get some intuition. Take the first example from the problem:

x = 73

y = 31

If I swap the first digits:

x becomes 33

y becomes 71

Product: 33 * 71 = 2343

If I swap the second digits:

x becomes 71

y becomes 33

Product: 71 * 33 = 2343

If I swap both digits:

x becomes 31

y becomes 73

Product: 31 * 73 = 2263

If I swap none:

x remains 73

y remains 31

Product: 73 * 31 = 2263

So, the maximum product is 2343, achieved by swapping either the first or the second digits.

Another example:

x = 2

y = 5

Options:

- Swap: x = 5, y = 2; product = 10

- Don't swap: x = 2, y = 5; product = 10

So, both options give the same product.

Last example:

x = 3516

y = 3982

Options:

- Swap all digits where x[i] != y[i]

Let's see:

First digit: 3 == 3, no swap

Second digit: 5 != 9, swap or not?

If swap: x = 3916, y = 3582; product = 3916 * 3582 = ?

If don't swap: x = 3516, y = 3982; product = 3516 * 3982 = ?

Calculate both:

3916 * 3582 = 14047392

3516 * 3982 = 13997392

So, swapping gives a larger product.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's:

3912

3586

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated or misread.

Wait, in the sample input, x=3516, y=3982, and sample output is x=3912, y=3586.

Wait, let's check:

x=3516, y=3982

Swap first digit: 3 and 3, same, no change.

Swap second digit: 5 and 9, swap to get 3916 and 3582

Swap third digit: 1 and 8, swap to get 3986 and 3512

Swap fourth digit: 6 and 2, swap to get 3982 and 3516

Wait, but sample output is x=3912 and y=3586.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to approach it.

Looking back at the problem, it says: "print any of them" if multiple answers exist.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the maximum product.

But I need to find a general approach that works for all cases.

Let me think about the general case.

Given that I can swap digits position-wise, I need to decide for each position whether to swap or not, to maximize the product of the two numbers.

Since the product of two numbers is maximized when both numbers are as large as possible, I need to make both x and y as large as possible.

But there's a trade-off because swapping a digit in x increases x in one way and y in another.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the impact of swapping on the overall product.

Let me consider the mathematical perspective.

Let’s denote x = x1 x2 ... xn and y = y1 y2 ... yn, where xi and yi are the digits at position i.

After possible swaps, x becomes x1' x2' ... xn' and y becomes y1' y2' ... yn', where for each i, either (x1', y1') = (xi, yi) or (yi, xi).

The product P = x * y.

I need to maximize P.

To maximize P, I need to maximize the overall values of x and y, considering their multiplication.

But multiplication is not straightforward to optimize digit by digit.

Maybe I can consider that for positions where xi > yi, I should keep them as is, and where xi < yi, I should swap them.

Wait, but in the first example:

x=73, y=31

For first digit: 7 > 3, keep as is.

For second digit: 3 > 1, keep as is.

But in the sample, swapping gives a better product.

Wait, but 71 * 33 = 2343, while 73 * 31 = 2263.

So, in this case, swapping gives a better product.

Wait, but according to my previous logic, since 7 > 3 and 3 > 1, I should keep both as is, but swapping gives a better product.

So, my previous logic is incorrect.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think about the overall magnitude of x and y.

To maximize x * y, I need to maximize (x + y)/2, but also consider their difference.

Wait, actually, for two numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal.

But in this case, x and y are of the same length, and I can only swap digits position-wise.

So, I need to make x and y as large as possible, but also consider balancing them to some extent.

Wait, but in the first example, swapping one digit increases both numbers, leading to a higher product.

Wait, in that case, swapping makes x = 71 and y = 33, both larger than original x=73 and y=31.

Wait, 71 and 33 have a higher product than 73 and 31.

Similarly, in the second example, x=2 and y=5: swapping gives x=5 and y=2, which has the same product as x=2 and y=5.

In the third example, x=3516 and y=3982: swapping certain digits increases the product.

So, perhaps the general rule is to swap digits where swapping increases the overall product.

But that's too vague.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each position, if swapping that digit increases the overall product, I should swap it.

But checking all possible combinations is not feasible for large n.

I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can consider the following:

For each position, if swapping makes the overall sum of x and y larger, or in a way that maximizes their product.

Wait, but that's still not clear.

Let me consider the contribution of each digit position to the overall product.

The product P = x * y = sum over all i and j of x_i * y_j * 10^{i+j}.

But that seems too complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider each digit's place value and decide based on that.

Wait, maybe I can consider greedy approach: for each position, choose the option (swap or not) that maximizes the product for that position, assuming other positions are fixed.

But that might not lead to the global optimum.

Alternatively, maybe I can sort the digits in x and y in some way.

Wait, but I can't rearrange digits within x or y, only swap corresponding digits between x and y.

So, the digits within x and y must stay in their original order, just possibly swapped with the corresponding digit in y and x respectively.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says: swap the i-th digit in x and the i-th digit in y.

So, for each position i, I can choose to swap x_i with y_i, or not.

So, the digits within x and y remain in their original order, but for each position, the digits can be swapped.

So, it's like for each position, I have two choices: keep as is or swap.

I need to make a choice for each position independently.

Given that, I need to choose for each position whether to swap or not, to maximize the product.

Since the choices are independent for each position, maybe I can make a local decision for each position.

But is that correct?

Wait, in the first example, if I swap both positions, I get x=31 and y=73, which has a product of 31*73=2263, which is less than swapping only one position.

So, local decisions might not lead to the global optimum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the effect of swapping on the overall product.

Let me consider two digits, a and b, at a certain position.

If I don't swap, x gets a and y gets b.

If I swap, x gets b and y gets a.

So, for that position, the contribution to the product is either a*10^k * y_rest + x_rest*10^k*b, where k is the digit's place value.

Wait, this seems too involved.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think about the overall magnitude.

To maximize x*y, I need to make both x and y as large as possible, but also consider their difference.

Wait, actually, for fixed sum, the product is maximized when the numbers are equal.

But in this case, I can only swap digits position-wise, so I can't arbitrarily make x and y equal; I have to work within the constraints of swapping corresponding digits.

So, perhaps I should aim to make x and y as equal as possible, within the constraints of the swaps.

But in the first example, swapping one digit makes x=71 and y=33, which are not equal, but their product is higher than making them more equal by swapping both digits to x=31 and y=73.

Wait, but 71 and 33 have a larger product than 31 and 73.

So, maybe making them as equal as possible isn't always the best strategy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should aim to make the higher place values have higher digits.

Wait, but that would suggest not swapping, which contradicts the first example.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I consider the difference in digits at each position.

If a_i > b_i, then keeping a_i in x and b_i in y is better.

If a_i < b_i, then swapping to have b_i in x and a_i in y is better.

But in the first example, a=73, b=31.

First digit: 7>3, keep as is.

Second digit: 3>1, keep as is.

But swapping one digit gives a better product.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I should swap digits where a_i < b_i, or something like that.

Wait, in the first example, swapping the second digit gives x=71 and y=33, which is better.

So, perhaps I should swap digits where a_i + y_i is maximized.

Wait, not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that for each position, I can choose to swap or not.

I need to make a choice for each position to maximize the overall product.

Since the product is multiplicative, maybe I can consider the ratio of the products when swapping vs not swapping.

Wait, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the logarithm of the product, which would be additive.

Log(P) = log(x) + log(y)

To maximize log(P), I need to maximize the sum of log(x) and log(y).

So, I need to maximize sum of log(x_i * 10^{p_i}) + log(y_i * 10^{p_i}), where p_i is the place value.

But log(x_i * 10^{p_i}) = log(x_i) + p_i * log(10)

So, log(P) = sum (log(x_i) + p_i * log(10)) + sum (log(y_i) + p_i * log(10))

= sum (log(x_i) + log(y_i)) + 2 * sum (p_i * log(10))

Since sum (p_i * log(10)) is a constant for a given number of digits, I need to maximize sum (log(x_i) + log(y_i))

Which is equivalent to maximizing product of x_i * y_i for all i.

So, for each position i, I need to maximize x_i * y_i.

Given that, for each position where a_i and b_i are different, I should choose to swap if b_i * a_i > a_i * b_i, which is always true.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, a_i * y_j vs b_i * x_j.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

If I choose to swap at position i, then x_i becomes b_i and y_i becomes a_i.

So, the contribution to the product P is x * y = product over all positions of (x_i * 10^{p_i}) * (y_i * 10^{p_i})

Wait, that's not correct.

Actually, x is sum over i of x_i * 10^{p_i}, and y is sum over i of y_i * 10^{p_i}.

So, P = (sum x_i * 10^{p_i}) * (sum y_i * 10^{p_i})

This is a complex expression to optimize directly.

Maybe I need to accept that it's too complicated and look for a different approach.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs again.

First sample:

Input:

3

73

31

2

5

3516

3982

Output:

71

33

5

2

3912

3586

So, for the first test case, x=73 and y=31, output is x=71 and y=33.

As we calculated earlier, 71*33=2343, which is higher than 73*31=2263.

For the second test case, x=2 and y=5, output is x=5 and y=2.

Both have the same product, 10.

For the third test case, x=3516 and y=3982, output is x=3912 and y=3586.

Let's verify:

3912 * 3586 = ?

Calculate 3912*3586:

First, 3912*3000=11736000

3912*500=1956000

3912*80=312960

3912*6=23472

Sum: 11736000 + 1956000 = 13692000

13692000 + 312960 = 14004960

14004960 + 23472 = 14028432

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I thought it was 14047392.

似乎我之前算错了。不过，重点是样本输出是x=3912和y=3586。

所以，程序需要输出这样的结果。

现在，来看给定的程序，看看它是否实现了这个逻辑。

程序代码：

def func():

t = int(input())

for q in range(t):

a = input()

b = input()

kq1 = ''

kq2 = ''

vt = 0

for i in range(len(a)):

if a[i] == b[i]:

kq1 = kq1 + a[i]

kq2 = kq2 + a[i]

continue

else:

(x, y) = (min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i])))

if vt == 0:

vt = 1

if a[i] > b[i]:

kq1 = kq1 + str(x)

kq2 = kq2 + str(y)

else:

kq1 = kq1 + str(y)

kq2 = kq2 + str(x)

else:

kq1 = kq1 + str(y)

kq2 = kq2 + str(x)

print(kq1)

print(kq2)



So, the program reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads two strings a and b, representing x and y.

It initializes kq1 and kq2 as empty strings, which will hold the final x and y after operations.

It also has a variable vt initialized to 0.

Then, it iterates through each digit position i in a and b.

If a[i] == b[i], it appends a[i] to both kq1 and kq2.

Else, it sets x and y to the minimum and maximum of int(a[i]) and int(b[i]), respectively.

Then, if vt == 0, it sets vt to 1 and:

- If a[i] > b[i], it appends str(x) to kq1 and str(y) to kq2.

- Else, it appends str(y) to kq1 and str(x) to kq2.

Otherwise (vt != 0), it appends str(y) to kq1 and str(x) to kq2.

Finally, it prints kq1 and kq2.

Let's see how this works with the first sample input:

x=73, y=31

So, a='73', b='31'

First iteration, i=0:

a[0]='7', b[0]='3' → different.

x=min(7,3)=3, y=max(7,3)=7

vt=0, so set vt=1

Since a[i]=7 > b[i]=3, append '3' to kq1 and '7' to kq2.

Second iteration, i=1:

a[1]='3', b[1]='1' → different.

x=min(3,1)=1, y=max(3,1)=3

vt !=0, so append '3' to kq1 and '1' to kq2.

So, kq1='3''3'='33', kq2='7''1'='71'

But in the sample output, it's x=71 and y=33.

Wait, but in the program, it prints kq1 and kq2, which would be 33 and 71, but in the sample output, it's 71 and 33.

So, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Looking back at the sample output, for x=73 and y=31, it's printing x=71 and y=33.

But according to the program, it's producing x=33 and y=71.

However, both pairs (71,33) and (33,71) give the same product, so it's acceptable since the problem says "print any of them" if multiple answers exist.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's printed as x=71 and y=33, but the program would print x=33 and y=71.

But since the problem allows any of the valid pairs, this should be acceptable.

Let's check the second test case:

x=2, y=5

a='2', b='5'

Only one digit, which is different.

x=min(2,5)=2, y=max(2,5)=5

vt=0, set vt=1

Since a[i]=2 < b[i]=5, append '5' to kq1 and '2' to kq2.

So, kq1='5', kq2='2'

Which matches the sample output: x=5, y=2

Good.

Third test case:

x=3516, y=3982

a='3516', b='3982'

First digit: '3' == '3', same. Append '3' to kq1 and '3' to kq2.

vt remains 0.

Second digit: '5' != '9'

x=min(5,9)=5, y=max(5,9)=9

vt=0, set vt=1

Since a[i]=5 < b[i]=9, append '9' to kq1 and '5' to kq2.

Now, kq1='3''9'='39', kq2='3''5'='35'

Third digit: '1' != '8'

x=min(1,8)=1, y=max(1,8)=8

vt !=0, so append '8' to kq1 and '1' to kq2.

Now, kq1='39''8'='398', kq2='35''1'='351'

Fourth digit: '6' != '2'

x=min(6,2)=2, y=max(6,2)=6

vt !=0, so append '6' to kq1 and '2' to kq2.

Final kq1='398''6'='3986', kq2='351''2'='3512'

But in the sample output, it's x=3912 and y=3586.

So, the program outputs x=3986 and y=3512.

But in the sample output, it's x=3912 and y=3586.

Now, let's check the products:

3986 * 3512 = ?

3986*3000=11958000

3986*500=1993000

3986*10=39860

3986*2=7972

Total: 11958000 + 1993000 = 13951000; 13951000 + 39860 = 13990860; 13990860 + 7972 = 13998832

Sample output's product: 3912*3586 = ?

3912*3000=11736000

3912*500=1956000

3912*80=312960

3912*6=23472

Total: 11736000 + 1956000 = 13692000; 13692000 + 312960 = 13994960; 13994960 + 23472 = 14018432

So, 3912*3586=14018432, while the program's output gives 3986*3512=13998832

So, the sample output has a higher product.

Does that mean the program is incorrect?

Wait, but the problem says "print any of them" if multiple answers exist.

In this case, both pairs give different products, so only one is maximized.

But the program is producing a pair with a lower product.

Is the program incorrect in this case?

Wait, perhaps not always.

Let me see what the program is doing.

It seems that the program decides based on the first differing digit whether to swap or not, and then for all subsequent differing digits, it always swaps in the same direction.

In the third test case, for the first differing digit (second position: '5' and '9'), since a[i]=5 < b[i]=9, it chooses to append '9' to kq1 and '5' to kq2.

Then, for all subsequent differing digits, it always appends the larger digit to kq1 and the smaller to kq2.

So, in this case, it's trying to make kq1 as large as possible and kq2 as small as possible, except for the first differing digit where it makes a decision based on whether a[i] > b[i] or not.

But in the sample output, it seems that a different strategy was used to achieve a higher product.

So, perhaps this program is not always correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, it gives a valid pair, even though different from the sample output.

In the second test case, both pairs give the same product.

In the third test case, it gives a lower product than the sample output.

So, perhaps the program is not always producing the maximum product.

Hence, it might be incorrect.

But let's think about the logic behind the program.

The variable vt seems to track whether it's the first differing digit.

If vt == 0, it means it's the first differing digit
