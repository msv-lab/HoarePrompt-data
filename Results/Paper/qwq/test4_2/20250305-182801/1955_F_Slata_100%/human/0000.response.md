Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Then, Eve removes one number at a time, and they play again with the remaining numbers, each time determining who wins based on the XOR of the current sequence. This continues until there are no numbers left.

My task is to figure out, for given counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, how many times Bob can win if Eve removes the numbers in an optimal order to maximize Bob's wins.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which we XOR the numbers doesn't matter. The XOR of a sequence is just the cumulative XOR of all its elements.

I need to find out when the XOR of the sequence is zero, which is when Bob wins. So, for each subset of the sequence (created by Eve removing some numbers), I need to see if the XOR of that subset is zero.

But waiting a minute, the problem is not about all possible subsets; it's about specific subsets created by sequentially removing one number at a time. So, starting with all n numbers, then n-1, n-2, down to 0.

Eve gets to choose which number to remove at each step, and she wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which happens when the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

I need to think about how the XOR changes as Eve removes numbers. Since XOR is associative, removing a number is like XORing the current XOR with that number again. Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If I have the current XOR of the sequence, and I remove a number, the new XOR will be the current XOR XOR the removed number. Because XORing a number twice cancels it out.

Wait, actually, if I have the XOR of all numbers, and I remove one number, say x, then the new XOR should be the old XOR XOR x, because I'm effectively removing x from the XOR calculation.

So, if I have XOR of a sequence S is XOR(S), and I remove an element x, then the new XOR is XOR(S) XOR x.

Now, Bob wins when XOR(S) is zero. So, Eve wants to choose which x to remove such that the new XOR is zero as often as possible.

But this seems a bit tricky to track manually for large n. I need to find a pattern or a formula based on the counts of each number.

Looking at the input, it's given as counts of 1,2,3,4 in the sequence. So, p0=number of 1s, p1=number of 2s, p2=number of 3s, p3=number of 4s.

I need to maximize the number of times Bob wins, which is when the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

First, I need to understand the XOR of the entire sequence initially. Since all numbers are 1,2,3,4, and each of these numbers in binary is:

1: 0001

2: 0010

3: 0011 (which is 1|2)

4: 0100

So, the XOR of the sequence will be the XOR of p0 ones, p1 twos, p2 threes, and p3 fours.

But since XOR is associative and commutative, I can think of it as XOR of p0*1 XOR p1*2 XOR p2*3 XOR p3*4.

Wait, but p0, p1, p2, p3 are counts, so I need to consider the XOR of each number repeated its count times.

But actually, since XOR is associative and commutative, XORing a number with itself even number of times cancels out to zero, and odd number of times leaves the number itself.

So, the overall XOR of the sequence is going to be the XOR of the numbers that appear an odd number of times.

Because XORing a number with itself an even number of times results in zero, which has no effect on the XOR.

So, only the numbers that appear an odd number of times contribute to the final XOR.

Given that, I can simplify the initial XOR to be the XOR of all numbers that have odd counts.

Now, Eve removes numbers one by one, and at each step, the XOR changes based on the number removed.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as many times as possible.

This seems like a problem that can be optimized based on the parity of the counts of the numbers.

But I need to think differently. Maybe I can think in terms of how many subsets have XOR zero.

But no, it's not about all subsets, it's about specific sequences of removals.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as a graph where each node represents the current sequence and its XOR, and edges represent removal of one number.

Then, Eve chooses a path through this graph to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

But that seems too complicated for practical implementation, especially since n can be up to the sum of p0 to p3, which could be up to 200*4 = 800, and t can be up to 10^4.

So, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the properties of XOR and how it behaves with the numbers 1,2,3,4.

First, note that 1 XOR 2 = 3, 1 XOR 3 = 2, 2 XOR 3 = 1, 1 XOR 4 = 5, but since we're dealing with XOR, and higher bits don't overlap in this case, maybe I can find some pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the XOR of all numbers in the sequence and see how it changes when I remove numbers.

But I need to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

Another approach: Since XOR is its own inverse, maybe I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too complex for this problem.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the binary representations:

1: 0001

2: 0010

3: 0011 (1 + 2)

4: 0100

So, in terms of binary vectors, these are vectors in a 3-dimensional vector space over GF(2), since 4 is 0100, which is independent of 1 and 2.

Wait, 4 is 0100, 2 is 0010, 1 is 0001, and 3 is 0011 (which is 1 + 2).

So, the set {1,2,4} forms a basis for the vector space, and 3 is a linear combination of 1 and 2.

So, the XOR of the sequence can be seen as the sum of the vectors in this vector space.

Now, the problem reduces to finding how many subsets of the sequence have XOR zero, but again, it's not about all subsets, but about a specific sequence of removals.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently. Since Eve removes one number at a time, and chooses which one to remove, she can choose in a way that manipulates the XOR to be zero as often as possible.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Wait, maybe I should consider pairing numbers in such a way that their XOR is zero.

But since XOR is not zero for pairs like 1 and 1, 2 and 2, etc., maybe that's not helpful.

Wait, actually, XOR of two identical numbers is zero, so pairing identical numbers makes their XOR zero.

But in this problem, we have different numbers, and their XORs are different.

Let me think again.

Given that, perhaps I can group the numbers into pairs that XOR to zero, but since no two different numbers XOR to zero, the only way to get XOR zero is to have an even number of each number in terms of their contributions.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the XOR of the entire sequence and see how it changes as numbers are removed.

Let me denote the initial XOR of the sequence as XOR_all.

Then, when Eve removes a number x, the new XOR becomes XOR_all XOR x.

Then, if XOR_all XOR x == 0, then Bob wins that round.

So, Bob wins if XOR_all == x.

Wait, that means that Bob wins if the number removed is equal to the current XOR.

But that's only for that specific step.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

At each step, Eve chooses which number to remove to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, Eve wants to choose a number to remove such that the current XOR is zero, and also set up the next XOR in a way that Bob can win again.

This seems complicated to track manually.

Maybe there's a pattern based on the counts of each number.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

1 1 1 0 → Alice and Bob play with 1,2,3 → XOR(1,2,3)=0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining 2,3 → XOR(2,3)=1, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 2, remaining 3 → XOR(3)=3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, sequence empty.

So, only one Bob win.

Second test case:

1 0 1 2 → numbers are 1,3,4,4 → XOR(1,3,4,4)=1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 2, Alice wins.

Then, remove one number, say 1, remaining 3,4,4 → XOR(3,4,4)=3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 3, remaining 4,4 → XOR(4,4)=0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one 4, remaining 4 → XOR=4, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last 4, sequence empty.

So, only one Bob win.

Third test case:

2 2 2 0 → numbers are two 1s, two 2s, two 3s.

XOR(1,1,2,2,3,3)=0, so Bob wins.

Then, remove one number, say 1, remaining 1,2,2,3,3 → XOR=1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =1 XOR 0 XOR 0 =1, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 1, remaining 2,2,3,3 → XOR=0, Bob wins.

Remove one 2, remaining 2,3,3 → XOR=2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =2 XOR 0 =2, Alice wins.

Remove another 2, remaining 3,3 → XOR=0, Bob wins.

Remove one 3, remaining 3 → XOR=3, Alice wins.

Remove the last 3, sequence empty.

So, Bob wins three times.

Fourth test case:

3 3 2 0 → three 1s, three 2s, two 3s.

XOR(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3)=1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =1 XOR 0 XOR 0 =1, Alice wins.

Then, remove one number, say 1, remaining two 1s, three 2s, two 3s → XOR=1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =0 XOR 2 XOR 0 =2, Alice wins.

Remove another 2, remaining two 1s, two 2s, two 3s → XOR=1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =0 XOR 0 XOR 0 =0, Bob wins.

Remove one 1, remaining one 1, two 2s, two 3s → XOR=1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =1 XOR 0 XOR 0 =1, Alice wins.

Remove another 1, remaining two 2s, two 3s → XOR=2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =0 XOR 0 =0, Bob wins.

Remove one 2, remaining one 2, two 3s → XOR=2 XOR 3 XOR 3 =2 XOR 0 =2, Alice wins.

Remove another 2, remaining two 3s → XOR=3 XOR 3 =0, Bob wins.

Remove one 3, remaining one 3 → XOR=3, Alice wins.

Remove the last 3, sequence empty.

So, Bob wins three times.

Fifth test case:

0 9 9 9 → no 1s, nine 2s, nine 3s, nine 4s.

XOR of nine 2s, nine 3s, nine 4s.

Since 2 XOR 3 = 1, and 4 is 4, we need to compute the XOR of these.

Wait, nine 2s: since XOR of even number of 2s is 0, and nine is odd, so XOR of nine 2s is 2.

Similarly, nine 3s: XOR of nine 3s is 3, since 3 XOR 3 is 0, and so on.

So, XOR of nine 2s, nine 3s, nine 4s: 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 7, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, remove one number, say a 2, remaining eight 2s, nine 3s, nine 4s → XOR of eight 2s is 0, nine 3s is 3, nine 4s is 4 → XOR(0,3,4)=7, Alice wins.

Remove another 2, but there are only eight left, but wait, I think I miscalculated.

Wait, after removing one 2, there are eight 2s left, which is even, so XOR of eight 2s is 0.

Nine 3s is odd, so XOR of nine 3s is 3.

Nine 4s is odd, so XOR of nine 4s is 4.

So, total XOR is 0 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 7, which is non-zero, Alice wins.

Then, remove another 2, but there are only eight left, so can't remove another 2.

Wait, perhaps I should remove a 3 instead.

Remove one 3, remaining eight 2s, eight 3s, nine 4s.

XOR of eight 2s is 0, eight 3s is 0, nine 4s is 4 → XOR(0,0,4)=4, Alice wins.

Remove another 3, remaining eight 2s, seven 3s, nine 4s.

XOR of eight 2s is 0, seven 3s is 3, nine 4s is 4 → XOR(0,3,4)=7, Alice wins.

Remove a 4, remaining eight 2s, seven 3s, eight 4s.

XOR of eight 2s is 0, seven 3s is 3, eight 4s is 0 → XOR(0,3,0)=3, Alice wins.

Continue this way until all numbers are removed.

It seems in this case, Bob might win only when the XOR is zero, which might happen less frequently.

But according to the sample output, Bob wins 12 times in this test case.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())

print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))

It's computing floor division of each count by 2, summing them up, and adding 1 if the sum of the remainders of a, b, c is equal to 3.

So, it's a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + (1 if a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3 else 0)

I need to see if this formula correctly computes the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

First test case:

a=1, b=1, c=1, d=0

So, 1//2 + 1//2 + 1//2 + 0//2 + int(1%2 + 1%2 + 1%2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + int(1 + 1 + 1 == 3) = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the sample output of 1.

Second test case:

a=1, b=0, c=1, d=2

1//2 + 0//2 + 1//2 + 2//2 + int(1%2 + 0%2 + 1%2 == 3) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + int(1 + 0 + 1 == 3) = 1 + int(2 == 3) = 1 + 0 = 1

Which matches the sample output of 1.

Third test case:

a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0

2//2 + 2//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + int(0 + 0 + 0 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + int(0 == 3) = 3 + 0 = 3

Which matches the sample output of 3.

Fourth test case:

a=3, b=3, c=2, d=0

3//2 + 3//2 + 2//2 + 0//2 + int(1 + 1 + 0 == 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + int(2 == 3) = 3 + 0 = 3

Which matches the sample output of 3.

Fifth test case:

a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9

0//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + 9//2 + int(0 + 1 + 1 == 3) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 + int(2 == 3) = 12 + 0 = 12

Which matches the sample output of 12.

So, the formula seems to work for the sample inputs.

But I need to understand why this formula gives the correct number of times Bob can win.

Looking back at the pairing idea: a//2 + b//2 + c//2 + d//2 gives the number of pairs we can make from each count.

Adding int(a%2 + b%2 + c%2 == 3) might be accounting for some leftover odd counts.

But I need to see how this relates to Bob winning.

Perhaps, Bob wins when the XOR is zero, which happens when the number of elements is even, or when the XOR of the remaining elements is zero.

Wait, but XOR being zero doesn't necessarily relate to the number of elements being even; it relates to the combination of their values.

Given that, perhaps there's a pattern based on the counts.

Alternatively, perhaps Eve can pair numbers in such a way that their XOR is zero, and thus maximize Bob's wins.

Wait, but XOR of two identical numbers is zero, but in this problem, we have different numbers.

So, pairing 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4 would give XOR zero for each pair.

So, for each pair of the same number, their XOR is zero, which contributes to Bob's win.

But in the sequence, Eve removes one number at a time, so she can't directly remove pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of pairs and the leftover elements.

Looking back at the formula, a//2 + b//2 + c//2 + d//2 gives the number of pairs for each number.

Then, int(a%2 + b%2 + c%2 == 3) might be accounting for the case when there are three leftover numbers, whose XOR could be zero.

Wait, for example, if a%2 + b%2 + c%2 == 3, meaning there are odd counts for a, b, c, and perhaps their XOR is zero.

But in reality, 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, since 1^2=3, 3^3=0.

Wait, 1^2^3=0, yes.

So, if a, b, c are all odd, then their XOR is zero, which could be another Bob win.

Hence, adding 1 in that case makes sense.

So, the total number of Bob's wins is the sum of the pairs (since each pair XORs to zero) plus one if there are an odd number of each of 1,2,3, and their XOR is zero.

But in the fifth test case, a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9.

a%2 + b%2 + c%2 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 != 3, so no additional 1.

So, total Bob wins are 12, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the third test case, a=2, b=2, c=2, d=0.

a%2 + b%2 + c%2 = 0 + 0 + 0 != 3, so no additional 1.

Total Bob wins are 3, which matches.

In the fourth test case, a=3, b=3, c=2, d=0.

a%2 + b%2 + c%2 = 1 + 1 + 0 != 3, so no additional 1.

Total Bob wins are 3, which matches.

In the second test case, a=1, b=0, c=1, d=2.

a%2 + b%2 + c%2 =1 + 0 +1 =2 !=3, so no additional 1.

Total Bob wins are 1, which matches.

In the first test case, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=0.

a%2 + b%2 + c%2 =1 +1 +1=3, so add 1.

Total Bob wins are 0 +1=1, which matches.

So, the formula seems consistent with the sample inputs.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the correct approach.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Each number can be represented in binary as:

1: 0001

2: 0010

3: 0011 (1|2)

4: 0100

So, in terms of binary vectors, these are:

1: (0,0,1)

2: (0,1,0)

3: (0,1,1)

4: (1,0,0)

So, the XOR of the sequence is the vector sum modulo 2.

Bob wins when this vector sum is (0,0,0).

Eve wants to maximize the number of times this happens.

Given that, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But no, it's not about all subsets; it's about a specific sequence of removals.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times the cumulative XOR is zero at each step.

But Eve removes numbers one by one, and chooses which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

This seems like a dynamic process that depends on the current XOR.

I need to think about how the XOR changes as numbers are removed.

Let me consider that the sequence of removals forms a path, where at each step, Eve chooses which number to remove, and the XOR updates accordingly.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero after a removal.

This sounds like a graph where nodes represent the current XOR and the counts of each number, and edges represent removing a number and updating the XOR.

But this seems too complicated for practical implementation.

Perhaps there's a better way to model this.

Looking back at the formula, it seems to be based on pairing numbers to make their XOR zero and considering the leftover numbers.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of Bob's wins is equal to the number of pairs (since each pair XORs to zero) plus one if the leftover numbers XOR to zero.

But in the fifth test case, a=0, b=9, c=9, d=9.

So, pairs are b//2 + c//2 + d//2 =4 +4 +4=12, and a%2 + b%2 + c%2 =0 +1 +1=2 !=3, so no additional 1.

Total Bob wins:12, which seems correct based on the sample output.

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is counting the number of times the XOR is zero when removing pairs of numbers.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is calculating the number of times the total count minus the number of odd counts divided by 2.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each pair of identical numbers removes their XOR, contributing to Bob's win.

So, for each type of number, the number of pairs is count//2.

Then, if there are odd counts for a, b, c, and their XOR is zero, that's an additional Bob win.

But in the formula, it's a//2 + b//2 + c//2 + d//2 + int(a%2 + b%2 + c%2 == 3)

Wait, but d is not included in the int condition.

Wait, but d is included in the pairs: d//2.

So, perhaps the idea is that pairs of identical numbers can be removed to make the XOR zero.

But in reality, pairs of identical numbers XOR to zero, but in the sequence, Eve removes one number at a time.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Eve can remove numbers in such a way that the XOR is zero as often as possible.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of Bob's wins is equal to the number of pairs plus one if the leftover numbers XOR to zero.

But in the formula, it's a//2 + b//2 + c//2 + d//2 + int(a%2 + b%2 + c%2 == 3)

Wait, but d is not considered in the int condition.

Perhaps because d (count of 4) is handled in the pairs.

Wait, 4 is 0100, and there are no other numbers with the 4th bit set, so it's independent.

But in reality, 4 XOR 4 =0, so pairs of 4s cancel out.

Similarly, 2 and 3 involve lower bits.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the XOR contributions separately.

Let me consider that the total XOR is the XOR of the counts of each number type.

Wait, no, it's the XOR of the numbers themselves, considering their counts.

Wait, more precisely, it's the XOR of all the numbers in the sequence.

Given that, the XOR of the sequence is equal to the XOR of (a*1 XOR b*2 XOR c*3 XOR d*4)

But since XOR is associative and commutative, and XOR of a number with itself even times is zero, and odd times is the number itself.

So, the total XOR is (1 if a is odd else 0) XOR (2 if b is odd else 0) XOR (3 if c is odd else 0) XOR (4 if d is odd else 0)

So, only the numbers with odd counts contribute to the total XOR.

So, the total XOR is the XOR of the numbers that have odd counts.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the XOR updates.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

So, Eve can choose to remove a number that makes the XOR zero.

But she can only do this if there exists a number to remove such that the current XOR XOR that number equals zero.

Wait, no.

Actually, when Eve removes a number x, the new XOR becomes the old XOR XOR x.

So, to make the new XOR zero, Eve needs to remove a number x that is equal to the current XOR.

So, if the current XOR is equal to one of the remaining numbers, Eve can choose to remove that number to make the XOR zero.

Otherwise, she can't.

So, Eve's strategy is to, at each step, if possible, remove a number that is equal to the current XOR, to make the XOR zero.

If not, she removes any number.

She wants to maximize the number of times she can make the XOR zero.

This seems like a greedy approach.

So, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of pairs, as each pair removal can set the XOR to zero.

But, in reality, Eve removes one number at a time, not pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times Eve can make the XOR zero by removing a number that equals the current XOR.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of Bob's wins is equal to the number of times Eve can find a number equal to the current XOR.

This seems complex to calculate directly.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula based on the counts.

Looking back at the formula in the program:

a//2 + b//2 + c//2 + d//2 + int(a%2 + b%2 + c%2 == 3)

Which is essentially sum of floor divisions by 2 plus 1 if the sum of remainders of a, b, c is 3.

Given that this formula matches the sample inputs, and seems to work for the test cases, I can conclude that it's correct.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **True**
