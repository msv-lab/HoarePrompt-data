Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game that Bodya and Sasha are playing with a permutation and an array. The game lasts for k turns, and in each turn, both players can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation. The goal is to see who ends up with a higher score after k turns.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n. Both players start at specific positions, P_B for Bodya and P_S for Sasha. In each turn, each player can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation p.

If a player stays, their score increases by the value of a at their current position. If they move, they go to p[x], where x is their current position.

The game lasts for exactly k turns, and both players are trying to maximize their own scores.

I need to determine, for each test case, who wins the game: Bodya or Sasha, or if it's a draw.

Looking at the constraints, t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 2*10^5, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 2*10^5. Also, k can be up to 10^9, which seems quite large.

This suggests that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case or better.

First, I need to model the game. Since both players make decisions simultaneously and independently, their choices don't affect each other directly. So, I can consider each player's strategy separately.

Each player has to decide at each turn whether to stay or move. Since they're both trying to maximize their scores, I need to find the optimal strategy for each player.

Let's consider one player's perspective. At each turn, the player can choose to stay and add a[x] to their score or move to p[x].

But, the catch is that moving to p[x] affects future choices because the permutation defines a kind of graph where each position points to another position.

Wait, permutations can be decomposed into cycles. So, the permutation p defines a set of disjoint cycles.

If a player is on a cycle, moving according to p will cycle through the positions in that cycle.

So, perhaps I can analyze the cycles separately.

But, in this game, players can choose to stay or move at each turn, so it's not just following the cycle.

Wait, but the problem allows players to choose independently at each turn whether to stay or move.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position and each turn, we calculate the maximum score achievable.

However, with k up to 10^9, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose a player is on a cycle of length m.

If the player keeps moving, they will cycle through the positions in the cycle, repeating every m turns.

But the player can choose to stay at any point, adding a[x] to their score.

So, perhaps I can model the optimal strategy based on the cycle structure.

Wait, but the permutation might have multiple cycles, and the player can be on different cycles.

But in this game, since the players choose independently, I can treat each player separately.

Let me consider one player.

Suppose the player starts at position x.

At each turn, they can choose to stay and add a[x], or move to p[x].

If they stay, their score increases by a[x], and they remain at x for the next turn.

If they move, their score doesn't increase that turn, but they move to p[x] for the next turn.

Wait, no, according to the problem: first, the score increases by a[x], then they choose to stay or move.

So, in each turn:

1. Score increases by a[x].

2. Then, choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

Wait, no, the problem says:

"On each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, in each turn:

- Score increases by a[x].

- Then choose to stay or move.

So, effectively, the player always adds a[x] to their score, and then chooses to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in terms of decision-making, it's about whether to stay or move after adding a[x] to the score.

Wait, but if they move, do they add a[p[x]] in the same turn?

No, according to the problem: "the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, in the same turn:

- Score increases by a[x].

- Then, if stay, remain at x for the next turn.

- If move, go to p[x] for the next turn.

So, effectively, in each turn:

- Add a[x] to the score.

- Then choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in the next turn, if stayed, x remains the same; if moved, x becomes p[x].

This is a Markov decision process, where at each state (position), there are two choices: stay or move.

Given that, for each player, I need to find the optimal strategy over k turns.

But with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

I need to find a way to model this process efficiently.

Let me consider that the permutation defines a set of cycles, and the players can be on different cycles.

Within a cycle, the positions are connected in a loop.

But since the players can choose to stay or move independently, the cycle structure might not directly help.

Wait, perhaps I can find the optimal strategy for each player independently, considering the permutation as a graph.

But with such large n and k, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the game can be modeled as a graph where each node is a position, and there is an edge from x to p[x].

Since p is a permutation, this graph consists of disjoint cycles.

Within a cycle, the player can choose to stay or move around the cycle.

I need to find, for each player, the maximum possible score over k turns.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute the maximum score for each player by considering the cycle they are in and the choices they make.

But I need to think differently because k can be up to 10^9, and n is up to 2*10^5.

I need an O(n) per test case solution or better.

Let me consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay forever, adding a[x] each turn, or move around the cycle, adding a[p[x]], a[p[p[x]]], etc.

But since they can choose to stay at any point, they can decide to stay at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle.

Wait, but it's more nuanced because they can choose to stay or move each turn independently.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle.

But, if the cycle has varying a[x], maybe it's better to stay at a position with higher a[x], but sometimes move to another position if a[p[x]] is higher.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

Because by staying, you keep adding that maximum a[x] each turn.

But, if there are multiple cycles, or if the cycle has varying a[x], maybe moving to another position in the cycle could be beneficial in some turns.

But, since the player can choose to stay or move each turn independently, perhaps the best strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose a player is in a cycle, and the cycle has positions x1, x2, ..., xm, where p[x1] = x2, p[x2] = x3, ..., p[xm] = x1.

The player can choose, in each turn, to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the cycle.

To maximize the score, the player should stay at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle for as many turns as possible.

So, find the maximum a[x] in the cycle, and add that value for each of the k turns.

But, is this always possible?

Wait, no. Because if the player is not initially at the position with the maximum a[x], they need to move to it first.

But, since they can choose to move or stay each turn independently, they can choose to move towards the position with the maximum a[x] and then stay there.

Wait, but moving takes a turn without adding a[x], because the move happens after adding a[x].

Wait, no, according to the problem, in each turn:

- Add a[x] to the score.

- Then choose to stay or move.

So, moving to another position doesn't prevent adding a[x].

So, in each turn, the player always adds a[x], and then chooses to stay or move.

So, if they choose to move, they go to p[x], and in the next turn, they add a[p[x]], and so on.

Therefore, the player can choose, in each turn, whether to stay and continue adding a[x], or move to p[x] and add a[p[x]] in the next turn.

So, the decision is whether to stay and continue adding a[x], or to move and potentially add a[p[x]] in the next turn.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where dp[x][k] represents the maximum score achievable from position x with k turns.

However, with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that, for each position x, the maximum score is a[x] plus the maximum of staying or moving.

If the player stays, the score is a[x] + dp[x][k-1].

If the player moves, the score is a[x] + dp[p[x]][k-1].

Wait, no, in the move case, they move to p[x], so in the next turn, they will be at p[x], adding a[p[x]].

But according to the problem, in each turn:

- Add a[x].

- Then choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, if they choose to stay, in the next turn, they are still at x.

If they choose to move, in the next turn, they are at p[x].

Therefore, dp[x][k] = a[x] + max(dp[x][k-1], dp[p[x]][k-1])

But with k up to 10^9, this is too slow.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that, for each position x, the optimal strategy is to stay at x for some number of turns, and then possibly move to p[x], and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that, for each position x, the maximum score is k * a[x], if the player chooses to stay at x for all k turns.

Alternatively, if the player chooses to move at some point, the score would be a[x] + a[p[x]] + ... for the turns they move.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each position x, the maximum a[y] where y is reachable from x by following the permutation.

But, since p is a permutation, it forms cycles, and from any position, following p repeatedly will eventually lead back to the starting position.

So, in a cycle, all positions are reachable from each other.

Therefore, in a cycle, the maximum a[y] is the same for all positions in the cycle.

So, for each cycle, find the maximum a[y], and then the optimal strategy is to stay at that position for all remaining turns.

Therefore, for each player, find the maximum a[y] in their cycle, and set their score to k * maximum a[y].

But wait, the player might need to move to reach that position.

So, it's not exactly k * maximum a[y].

Wait, no, because the player can choose to move or stay each turn independently.

So, even if they are not at the position with maximum a[y], they can choose to move towards it in some turns.

But, considering that in each turn, they can choose to stay or move, independently of previous choices, perhaps the optimal strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in their cycle for all k turns.

But, to do that, they might need to move to that position first.

Wait, no, because they can choose to move in one turn, add a[x], and then move to p[x], and in the next turn, add a[p[x]], and so on.

But, if they choose to stay at the position with the maximum a[x], they can achieve k * maximum a[x].

But, if they are not at that position, they need to move to it.

But, moving doesn't prevent them from adding a[x].

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose a player is at position x, and the maximum a[y] in the cycle is a[m].

If a[x] >= a[m], then they can stay at x and achieve k * a[x].

If a[x] < a[m], then they might want to move to p[x] to potentially get a higher a[p[x]].

But, since they can choose to stay or move each turn independently, perhaps the best strategy is to stay at the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle for all k turns.

Wait, but to do that, they might need to move to that position first.

But, since in each turn they can choose to move, they can move to p[x], add a[x], and then in the next turn, be at p[x], and so on.

But, to maximize the score, perhaps the best is to find the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle and plan to stay there for as many turns as possible.

But, moving takes a turn during which they add a[x], and then they are at p[x].

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- Identify the position x_max in the cycle with the maximum a[x].

- Determine the minimum number of moves required to reach x_max from the starting position.

- Then, stay at x_max for the remaining turns.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

For each player:

1. Identify the cycle that contains their starting position.

2. Find the position x_max in that cycle with the maximum a[x].

3. Compute the minimum number of moves required to reach x_max from the starting position.

4. Then, stay at x_max for the remaining k - moves turns, adding a[x_max] each turn.

5. The total score would be the sum of a[x] for each move plus (k - moves) * a[x_max].

But, I need to make sure that this is indeed the optimal strategy.

Wait, but in this strategy, the player chooses to move towards x_max and then stay there.

But, perhaps there are better strategies where the player moves to other positions before reaching x_max.

But, intuitively, this seems optimal: reach the best position as quickly as possible and then stay there.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, positions are 0-based: p[0]=4, p[1]=1, p[2]=2, p[3]=3

Wait, but in Python, indices start at 0, but in the problem, positions are 1-based.

So, p[1]=4, p[2]=1, p[3]=2, p[4]=3

Wait, but in the code, p is 0-based.

Wait, no, in the code, p is 1-based.

Wait, in the problem, p is 1-based.

Wait, in the problem statement, p is 1-based, but in the code, it's being read as 0-based.

I need to make sure about the indexing.

In the problem, p is 1-based, so p_1 to p_n are positions 1 to n.

But in the code, p is being read and indices are adjusted to 0-based.

In the code:

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b -= 1

s -= 1

So, p is 1-based, but for programming, it's being treated as 0-based by subtracting 1 from P_B and P_S.

So, in the code, p[0] corresponds to position 1, p[1] to position 2, and so on.

I need to be careful with this.

Continuing with the example:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3] (1-based: p1=4, p2=1, p3=2, p4=3)

a = [7,2,5,6] (a1=7, a2=2, a3=5, a4=6)

In 0-based indexing: p[0]=4 (which is position 4), p[1]=1 (position 1), p[2]=2 (position 2), p[3]=3 (position 3)

But in code, p is adjusted to 0-based, so p[2] = 2 (position 3 maps to position 2), p[2]-1 =1

Wait, no, p[2] =2, which corresponds to position 2 in 1-based, which is index 1 in 0-based.

This is getting confusing.

Let me clarify:

Given p is 1-based in the problem, but in code, it's read into a 0-based list by subtracting 1 from each p_i.

So, p[i] = p_{i+1} -1 (since it's 0-based)

Wait, no.

In code:

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

Then, b -=1 and s -=1, so p is still 1-based internally.

Wait, no, p is read as 1-based, but indices are adjusted by subtracting 1 for programming.

Wait, no, in the code:

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b -=1

s -=1

So, p is read as 1-based, and b and s are adjusted to 0-based.

So, p[0] = p1 =4, p[1]=p2=1, p[2]=p3=2, p[3]=p4=3

So, in 0-based indexing, p[0]=4, p[1]=1, p[2]=2, p[3]=3

But positions in code are 0-based, so p[0]=4 means position 0 points to position 3 (since 4-1=3).

Wait, no, p[i] is read as 1-based, so p[0]=4 means p1=4, which corresponds to position 4 in 1-based, which is index 3 in 0-based.

This is confusing; perhaps I should treat p as 1-based in my reasoning.

In the problem, p is 1-based, so p1=4, p2=1, p3=2, p4=3

So, positions and p are 1-based.

In code, p is read into a 0-based list, with p[i] = p_{i+1} -1

So, p[0] =4-1=3, p[1]=1-1=0, p[2]=2-1=1, p[3]=3-1=2

So, in code, p = [3,0,1,2]

Then, b=3-1=2, s=2-1=1

So, b=2 (position 3), s=1 (position 2)

a = [7,2,5,6] (a1=7, a2=2, a3=5, a4=6)

So, in code, a[0]=7, a[1]=2, a[2]=5, a[3]=6

Now, in the first turn:

- Bodya is at position 3, adds a3=5 to his score, then chooses to stay or move to p3=2.

- Sasha is at position 2, adds a2=2 to his score, then chooses to stay or move to p2=1.

Let's say Bodya chooses to stay at position 3, and Sasha chooses to move to position 1.

After first turn:

- Bodya: position 3, score=5

- Sasha: position 1, score=2

Second turn:

- Bodya is at position 3, adds a3=5, chooses to stay or move to p3=2.

- Sasha is at position 1, adds a1=7, chooses to stay or move to p1=4.

Let's say Bodya chooses to stay at position 3, and Sasha chooses to stay at position 1.

After second turn:

- Bodya: position 3, score=5+5=10

- Sasha: position 1, score=2+7=9

So, Bodya wins with 10 > 9.

In this case, it seems that staying at position 3 (a3=5) for both turns is better for Bodya, while Sasha could have moved to position 1 (a1=7) and stayed there.

So, for Bodya, position 3 has a3=5, and position 2 has a2=2.

Wait, but p3=2, which has a2=2 < a3=5, so Bodya prefers to stay at position 3.

For Sasha, position 2 has a2=2, and position 1 has a1=7, so it's better to move to position 1 and stay there.

Hence, Bodya's score: 5 + 5 =10

Sasha's score: 2 +7=9

Bodya wins.

Now, in terms of cycles, the permutation p1=4, p2=1, p3=2, p4=3 forms two cycles:

- 1 ->4 ->3 ->2 ->1 (cycle length 4)

Wait, p1=4, p4=3, p3=2, p2=1, so 1->4->3->2->1.

So, one cycle of length 4.

In this cycle, the maximum a[x] is a1=7.

So, according to my earlier strategy, each player should try to reach the position with a[x]=7 and stay there.

But, in the example, Bodya stays at position 3 (a3=5), while Sasha moves to position 1 (a1=7).

So, Sasha reaches the position with a[x]=7, while Bodya stays at a[x]=5.

Hence, Sasha's score is 2 (first turn) +7 (second turn) =9

Bodya's score is 5 +5=10

So, Bodya still wins.

But, according to my strategy, both should try to reach position 1.

Wait, but Bodya cannot reach position 1 directly from position 3.

From position 3, moving to p3=2, then from position 2, moving to p2=1.

So, it takes two moves to reach position 1 from position 3.

But, in k=2 turns, Bodya can only reach position 1 in the second turn.

But, in the first turn, Bodya adds a3=5 and moves to position 2.

Then, in the second turn, adds a2=2 and moves to position 1.

Total score: 5 +2 +7 =14

Wait, but in the example, it was different.

Wait, no, according to the problem, in each turn:

- Add a[x].

- Then choose to stay or move.

So, if Bodya chooses to move in the first turn, he adds a3=5 and moves to p3=2.

In the second turn, he is at position 2, adds a2=2, and chooses to move to p2=1.

In the third turn, he is at position 1, adds a1=7, and so on.

But, in this example, k=2, so only two turns.

So, in two turns:

- Turn 1: Bodya at 3, adds 5, moves to 2.

- Turn 2: Bodya at 2, adds 2, moves to 1.

Total score: 5 +2 =7

Wait, but in the example, it was different.

Wait, in the example, it seems that Bodya stayed at position 3 for both turns, adding 5 each time, total 10.

Sasha moved to position 1 in the first turn, adding a2=2, then stayed at position 1 in the second turn, adding a1=7, total 9.

Hence, Bodya wins with 10 >9.

But, according to my earlier strategy, if Bodya moves to position 1, his total would be 5 (first turn, moving from 3 to 2) +2 (second turn, moving from 2 to 1) =7, which is less than staying at 3 and getting 5 +5=10.

Hence, in this case, staying at position 3 is better for Bodya than trying to reach position 1.

But, according to the cycle, position 1 has a[x]=7, which is greater than a3=5.

But, because Bodya would have to spend turns moving to position 1, which involves adding lower a[x] values along the way, it might not be worth it.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is not just to reach the position with the maximum a[x], but to calculate the maximum possible score considering the cost of moving.

This seems more involved.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose, for each player, I compute the maximum possible score they can achieve in k turns, given their starting position and the choices they make.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as finding the maximum score by choosing, for each turn, whether to stay or move.

But with k up to 10^9, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that, in the long run, the player will eventually reach a position where a[x] is maximum in their cycle and stay there forever.

But, in the short run, they might have to move through some positions to reach that position.

Hence, perhaps I can compute the optimal score by considering the maximum a[x] in the cycle and the minimal number of moves required to reach it.

But, in the example above, even though position 1 has a[x]=7, which is higher than a3=5, Bodya can achieve a higher score by staying at position 3.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is:

For each player, find the maximum a[x] in their cycle.

Then, compute the minimal number of moves required to reach that position.

Then, the optimal score is the sum of a[x] for each move plus (k - moves) * maximum a[x].

But, in the example, moves would be 2 for Bodya to reach position 1, but in k=2 turns, he can only reach position 1 in the second turn, adding a3=5 in the first turn and a2=2 in the second turn, then a1=7 in the third turn, but k=2, so only two turns: 5 +2 =7, which is less than staying at position 3 and getting 5 +5=10.

Hence, staying at position 3 is better.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is to stay at the position with the local maximum a[x].

In other words, if a[x] >= a[p[x]], then it's a local maximum, and the player should stay there.

Otherwise, the player should move to p[x].

Hence, in the example, for Bodya starting at position 3, a3=5 < a[p3]=a2=2 is false, so he can choose to stay or move.

Wait, no, a3=5 > a2=2, so it's a local maximum, so he should stay.

For Sasha starting at position 2, a2=2 < a[p2]=a1=7, so he should move to position 1 and stay there.

Hence, Bodya stays at position 3, adding 5 each turn.

Sasha moves to position 1 in the first turn, adding a2=2, then stays at position 1 in the second turn, adding a1=7.

Total:

- Bodya: 5 +5=10

- Sasha:2 +7=9

Hence, Bodya wins.

This seems consistent with the example.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is:

For each player:

- If a[x] >= a[p[x]], then it's a local maximum; stay at x for all k turns, adding a[x] each turn.

- Else, move to p[x], and repeat the process.

But, in cycles, there might be multiple local maxima.

Wait, in a cycle, there can be multiple positions where a[x] >= a[p[x]].

But, in practice, in a cycle, there is at least one local maximum.

Wait, in any cycle, there is always at least one local maximum.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- For each player, find the local maximum a[x] in their cycle.

- Compute the minimal number of moves required to reach such a position.

- Then, stay at that position for the remaining turns.

Hence, for each player, find the minimal number of moves to reach a position where a[x] is maximum among all such positions in the cycle.

Wait, perhaps more precisely, find the position with a[x] >= a[p[x]], which is a local maximum.

Then, the minimal number of moves to reach such a position.

Then, the optimal score is the sum of a[x] for each move plus (k - moves) * a[x_max].

In the example:

For Bodya starting at position 3:

- a3=5 >= a2=2, so it's a local maximum. Hence, stay at position 3 for all k turns.

- Score: k * a3 =2 *5=10

For Sasha starting at position 2:

- a2=2 < a1=7, so not a local maximum. Move to position 1.

- At position 1, a1=7 >= a4=6, since p1=4, a4=6.

- Hence, position 1 is a local maximum.

- To reach it, Sasha needs to move once.

- Hence, score: a2=2 (first turn, moving to position 1) + (k-1) * a1=1*7=7

- Total:2 +7=9

Hence, Bodya wins with 10 >9.

This seems correct.

Hence, the strategy is:

For each player:

- If the current position is a local maximum (a[x] >= a[p[x]]), stay there for all k turns.

- Else, move to p[x], and repeat.

- Find the minimal number of moves to reach a local maximum, then stay there.

- The score is the sum of a[x] for each move plus (k - moves) * a[x_max]

But, in practice, since in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, independently, perhaps the optimal strategy is to move towards a local maximum as quickly as possible and then stay there.

But, in the example, Bodya is already at a local maximum, so he stays.

Sasha is not, so he moves to position 1, which is a local maximum, and stays there.

Hence, in that case, it's straightforward.

Hence, perhaps for each player, I can find the minimal number of moves to reach a local maximum, and then stay there for the remaining turns.

But, to implement this efficiently, I need to find, for each position, the minimal number of moves to reach a local maximum in their cycle.

Given that, I can precompute for each position, the minimal number of moves to reach a local maximum.

Then, for each player, compute the sum of a[x] for each move plus (k - moves) * a[x_max]

But, with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to handle this differently.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b -= 1

s -= 1

sp = a[s]

bp = a[b]

bm = a[b] * k

sm = a[s] * k

for i in range(n):

k -= 1

if k == 0:

break

b = p[b] -1

s = p[s] -1

bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)

sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)

sp += a[s]

bp += a[b]

if bm > sm:

print('Bodya')

elif bm < sm:

print('Sasha')

else:

print('Draw')



So, in the code:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, k, P_B, P_S

- Read permutation p (1-based, adjusted to 0-based)

- Read array a (0-based)

- Initialize b and s to P_B-1 and P_S-1

- Initialize sp = a[s], bp = a[b]

- Initialize bm = a[b] * k, sm = a[s] * k

- Then, loop for i in range(n):

- k -=1

- if k ==0: break

- b = p[b]-1

- s = p[s]-1

- bm += max(bm, a[b]*k + bp)

- sm += max(sm, a[s]*k + sp)

- sp += a[s]

- bp += a[b]

- Finally, compare bm and sm to decide who wins.

I need to understand what this code is doing.

It seems that it's simulating some kind of process for up to n steps, updating bm and sm based on some maximum choices.

But, I need to understand the logic behind it.

Looking at bm and sm:

Initially, bm = a[b] * k, which is Bodya staying at his starting position for all k turns.

Similarly, sm = a[s] * k for Sasha.

Then, in each iteration of the loop:

- k -=1

- b = p[b]-1 (move Bodya to p[b])

- s = p[s]-1 (move Sasha to p[s])

- bm += max(bm, a[b]*k + bp)

- sm += max(sm, a[s]*k + sp)

- sp += a[s]

- bp += a[b]

This seems confusing.

Perhaps the idea is to consider the maximum between staying at the current position for the remaining k turns or moving to p[x] and then following some strategy.

But, I'm not sure about the exact logic here.

Let me try to see with the first example:

n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3] (1-based, adjusted to 0-based: p=[3,0,1,2])

a = [7,2,5,6]

b=2, s=1

Initialize:

sp = a[1] =2

bp = a[2] =5

bm =5*2=10

sm =2*2=4

Loop for i in range(4):

k=1

b = p[2]-1=1-1=0

s = p[1]-1=0-1=-1 (Wait, p[1]=1, p[1]-1=0, which is position 1 in 0-based)

Wait, p=[4,1,2,3], so p[0]=4-1=3, p[1]=1-1=0, p[2]=2-1=1, p[3]=3-1=2

Hence, p=[3,0,1,2]

So, b = p[2]-1=1-1=0

s = p[1]-1=0-1=-1 (Wait, p[1]=1, which is position 0 in 0-based)

Wait, p[1]=1, which corresponds to position 1 in 1-based, which is index 0 in 0-based.

Hence, s = p[1] -1 =0

So, b=0, s=0

Then:

bm += max(bm, a[0]*1 + bp) = max(10, 7*1 +5)=max(10,12)=12

sm += max(sm, a[0]*1 + sp)=max(4,7*1 +2)=max(4,9)=9

sp += a[0]=2+7=9

bp += a[0]=5+7=12

Now, bm=10 +12=22

sm=4 +9=13

But, according to the example, Bodya's score should be 10, Sasha's 9.

But here, bm=22 and sm=13.

This doesn't match.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

bm = a[b] * k # initially 5*2=10

sm = a[s] * k # 2*2=4

Then, in the loop:

k -=1 # k=1

b = p[b]-1 = p[2]-1=1-1=0

s = p[s]-1 = p[1]-1=0-1=-1 (Wait, p[1]=1, which is position 1 in 1-based, which is index 0 in 0-based)

Hence, s=0

Then:

bm += max(bm, a[b]*k + bp)

a[b] = a[0]=7

k=1

bp=5

So, bm += max(10,7*1 +5)=max(10,12)=12

Hence, bm=10 +12=22

Similarly, sm += max(4, a[s]*k + sp)=max(4, a[0]*1 +2)=max(4,7+2)=9

sm=4 +9=13

Then, sp += a[s]=2+7=9

bp += a[b]=5+7=12

Then, k=0, so break.

Finally, bm=22, sm=13, which doesn't match the expected scores.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the code.

Looking back, maybe bm and sm are accumulated scores.

Wait, initially, bm = a[b] *k =5*2=10

sm = a[s] *k=2*2=4

Then, in the loop:

k=1

b=p[b]-1=p[2]-1=1-1=0

s=p[s]-1=p[1]-1=0-1=-1 (Wait, p[1]=1, which is position 1 in 0-based)

Wait, p[1]=1, which is position 1 in 0-based.

Hence, s=p[1]-1=0

Then:

bm += max(bm, a[b]*k + bp)=max(10, a[0]*1 +5)=max(10,7+5)=12

Hence, bm=10 +12=22

Wait, but according to the example, Bodya's score should be 10, not 22.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the logic.

Wait, perhaps bm and sm are not the total scores, but something else.

I need to understand what bm and sm represent.

Looking back, perhaps bm and sm are the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

But, in the example, Bodya's score is 10, Sasha's is 9, but according to the code, bm=22 and sm=13, which doesn't match.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misapplying the logic.

Wait, perhaps bm and sm are accumulative, and the initial bm and sm are set to a[b]*k and a[s]*k, assuming staying at the starting position.

Then, in each iteration, they consider moving to p[x] and staying there for the remaining k-1 turns, and take the maximum between staying or moving.

But, in the example, Bodya's best is staying at position 3 (adding 5 each turn, total 10), while moving to position 2 would lead to a lower score (5 +2=7).

Hence, the code should reflect that.

But in the code, bm=10 +12=22, which doesn't make sense.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is intended to simulate some kind of DP, where bm and sm are being updated based on the maximum between staying or moving.

But, in the example, it's giving incorrect results.

Hence, I suspect that the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
