Alright, I've got this problem here about three friends playing chess, and I need to figure out the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on their final scores. The scores are p1, p2, and p3, and they're sorted in non-decreasing order, so p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

First, I need to understand how the scoring works. In each game, two players play against each other. If one wins, the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0. If it's a draw, both players get 1 point each. Also, the same pair can play multiple times, and it's possible that no games were played at all.

So, the total points distributed in each game are either 2 (in case of a win and loss) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, in both cases, it's 2 points per game. That's interesting. So, regardless of whether it's a win/loss or a draw, each game contributes 2 points to the total points.

Let me denote the total points as P = p1 + p2 + p3. Since each game contributes exactly 2 points, the total number of games G is P / 2, assuming P is even. If P is odd, then it's impossible to have such a distribution because you can't have half a game. So, if P is odd, the answer should be -1.

Looking back at the sample input, in the first case, p1=0, p2=0, p3=0. Total P=0, which is even, so G=0, and the number of draws can be 0.

In the second case, p1=0, p2=1, p3=1. Total P=2, which is even, so G=1. Now, to maximize draws, we need to have as many draws as possible. In this case, if the second and third players play and draw, both get 1 point each, matching p2=1 and p3=1, and p1=0 remains. So, one draw is possible.

In the third case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=1. Total P=3, which is odd. So, it's impossible, and the answer is -1.

Fourth case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. Total P=4, which is even, so G=2. Now, to maximize draws, let's see. If the second and third players play and draw once, both get 1 point. Then, they play again, and one wins and the other loses. But wait, that would make one of them have 2 points and the other have 1 point, matching p2=1 and p3=2, with p1=1 remaining. But p1=1 didn't play any game, which is fine. So, in this case, the number of draws is 1.

Wait, but the output is 2. So, I must be missing something.

Let me think differently. Suppose p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. Total P=4, G=2.

Option 1: Two draws between different pairs.

For example, first and second draw, both get 1 point: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, first and third draw, both get 1 point: p1=2, p3=1.

But that doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Option 2: First and second draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, second and third draw once: p2=2, p3=1.

Still, p1=1, p2=2, p3=1, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Option 3: First and third draw once: p1=1, p3=1.

Then, second and third play and second wins: p2=2, p3=1.

Now, p1=1, p2=2, p3=1, which again doesn't match.

Option 4: First and second play and first wins: p1=2, p2=0.

Then, first and third draw: p1=3, p3=1.

Not matching.

Option 5: First and second play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, second and third play and third wins: p2=1, p3=2.

This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

In this scenario, there is one draw between first and second, and one win between second and third, which is one draw.

But the output is 2. So, I must be missing a way to have two draws.

Wait, maybe if the same pair plays multiple times.

Suppose first and second play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, first and second play again and draw again: p1=2, p2=2.

Then, first and third play and third wins: p1=2, p3=2.

Not matching.

Alternatively, first and second play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, second and third play and draw: p2=2, p3=2.

But p2=2, p3=2, p1=1, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's impossible to have two draws and still have p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. Maybe the maximum number of draws is one.

But according to the sample output, it's 2. So, I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps if the same pair plays multiple times.

Suppose first and second play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, second and third play and draw: p2=2, p3=2.

But that doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Wait, p2=2 now, which is higher than desired.

Alternatively, first and second play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, first and third play and draw: p1=2, p3=1.

Not matching.

Wait, maybe first and second play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, first and third play and third wins: p1=2, p3=2.

Not matching.

Alternatively, first and second play and first wins: p1=2, p2=0.

Then, second and third play and draw: p2=1, p3=1.

Now, p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, which doesn't match.

Another option: first and third play and draw: p1=1, p3=1.

Then, second and third play and second wins: p2=2, p3=1.

Now, p1=1, p2=2, p3=1, which again doesn't match.

I'm not seeing a way to have two draws and end up with p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Maybe it's impossible, and the sample output is wrong.

Wait, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the maximum number of draws is 2, even if it's not possible to achieve exactly p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws, but it is possible with one draw.

But the output is 2, so maybe it's the total possible draws, not necessarily leading to the exact scores.

Wait, no, the problem says: "Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain p1, p2 and p3 as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print -1 instead."

So, it must be possible to achieve the scores with that number of draws.

I'm getting confused.

Let me look at another sample input.

Fifth case: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3. Total P=9, which is odd, so impossible, output -1.

Sixth case: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5. Total P=12, which is even, so G=6.

Now, to maximize draws, we need to have as many draws as possible while still achieving the scores.

One way to approach this is to note that in a draw, both players get 1 point, whereas in a win/loss, the winner gets 2 and the loser gets 0.

So, to maximize draws, we should maximize the number of times both players in a game get 1 point each.

Given the scores, we need to see how many such draws can happen without exceeding the individual scores.

Another way is to consider that the total points from draws would be twice the number of draws, since each draw gives 1 point to each player involved.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads three integers p1, p2, p3.

Then, it checks if the sum (p1 + p2 + p3) is odd. If it is, it prints -1, which makes sense because the total points must be even.

If the sum is even, it calculates the result as (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2 and prints it.

Wait, v[2] is p3, v[0] is p1, v[1] is p2.

So, it's calculating (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

I need to understand why this formula gives the maximum number of draws.

Let me try to derive it.

First, total points P = p1 + p2 + p3.

As each game contributes 2 points, total games G = P / 2.

Now, in each draw, both players get 1 point, so it's like distributing 1 point to each player in the draw.

In a win/loss, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

To maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of times both players in a game get 1 point each.

Another way to think about it is to maximize the number of times the total points increase by 2 through draws.

Wait, but in both win/loss and draw, the total points increase by 2 per game.

So, the total points don't distinguish between win/loss and draw.

But the individual scores do.

In a draw, both players get 1 point each.

In a win/loss, one player gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

So, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of times two players share 1 point each without exceeding their individual scores.

Let me consider the minimal number of wins needed to reach the scores.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimal number of wins, and the rest are draws.

Because each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, while a draw contributes 1 point to each.

So, to maximize draws, we need to minimize the number of wins.

Let me try to find the minimal number of wins required to reach the scores.

The minimal number of wins would be when as much of the points as possible come from draws.

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful.

Another approach: let's consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many pairs as possible have their points coming from draws.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G, where G is the number of games.

Now, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of times a pair of players drew against each other.

Each draw increases both players' scores by 1.

Each win/loss increases the winner's score by 2 and the loser's by 0.

So, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of times both players in a pair get 1 point each.

Let me consider the total points that need to come from draws.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the minimal number of wins needed.

Each win allows one player to gain 2 points.

So, to maximize draws, minimize wins.

The minimal number of wins is determined by how much 2-point increments are needed to reach the scores.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the excess points over what can be achieved with only draws.

In a draw, a player gains 1 point per draw.

So, if a player has p points, and all points came from draws, they would have played p draws.

But in reality, some points come from wins, which give 2 points per win.

So, the minimal number of wins for a player is ceil(p / 2).

Wait, but that doesn't account for the interactions between players.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look back at the formula in the provided program: (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

I need to understand what this represents.

First, p1 + p2 + p3 is the total points, which must be even; otherwise, it's invalid.

Then, max(0, p3 - p1 - p2):

- If p3 ≤ p1 + p2, then max(0, p3 - p1 - p2) = 0.

- If p3 > p1 + p2, then it's p3 - p1 - p2.

So, the result is (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

Which simplifies to:

- If p3 ≤ p1 + p2, then (p1 + p2 + p3 - 0) // 2 = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2.

- If p3 > p1 + p2, then (p1 + p2 + p3 - (p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2 = (p1 + p2 + p3 - p3 + p1 + p2) // 2 = (2*p1 + 2*p2) // 2 = p1 + p2.

So, the formula becomes:

- If p3 ≤ p1 + p2, then G = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2.

- If p3 > p1 + p2, then G = p1 + p2.

Now, in the context of the problem, what does this represent?

Let me consider the constraints.

In any set of games, the sum of points is twice the number of games, as each game contributes 2 points.

Also, in any set of games, no player can have more points than the sum of the points of the other two players, because in the worst case, that player wins all games against the other players.

Wait, actually, that might not hold.

Wait, if p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible, because p3 cannot have more points than the sum of p1 and p2, since all points are distributed among the three players, and p3 cannot get points without playing against p1 or p2.

Wait, but in the problem, it's possible that p3 plays against p1 and p2, and wins all those games.

Wait, no, p3 cannot have more points than p1 + p2, because all points are distributed among the three players, and p3 cannot get points without the others losing or drawing.

Wait, actually, p3 can have more points than p1 + p2 if p3 plays against p1 and p2 and wins all those games.

Wait, no, if p3 plays against p1 and wins, p3 gets 2 points and p1 gets 0.

Similarly, if p3 plays against p2 and wins, p3 gets 2 points and p2 gets 0.

So, p3 can have points up to 2 times the number of games it played.

But, p1 and p2 can also play against each other, gaining points independently of p3.

Wait, but p3's points can exceed p1 + p2 if p3 wins all its games against p1 and p2, and p1 and p2 draw among themselves.

Wait, for example, p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, p3 plays against p1 and wins: p3=2, p1=1.

Then, p3 plays against p2 and wins: p3=4, p2=1.

Now, p1=1, p2=1, p3=4, which has p3 > p1 + p2 (4 > 1 + 1).

But according to the formula, if p3 > p1 + p2, then the result is p1 + p2.

In this case, p1 + p2 = 2, so the maximum number of draws is 2.

But in reality, in the scenario above, p1 and p2 drew once, and p3 played two wins against p1 and p2.

So, number of draws is 1.

But according to the formula, it's p1 + p2 = 2.

So, it's higher than the actual number of draws.

Wait, but the problem asks for the maximum possible number of draws that could have happened.

In the scenario above, with p1=1, p2=1, p3=4, the maximum number of draws is 1, but the formula gives 2.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, the output is 2.

But in my earlier attempt, I couldn't find a way to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws.

So, perhaps the formula is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there is a way to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws that I'm missing.

Let me try again.

Suppose p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, p1 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p3=1.

But that doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Option 2: p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, p2 and p3 draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

Now, p1=1, p2=2, p3=2, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Option 3: p1 and p3 draw once: p1=1, p3=1.

Then, p2 and p3 play and p3 wins: p2=0, p3=3.

Not matching.

Option 4: p1 and p2 play and p1 wins: p1=2, p2=0.

Then, p2 and p3 play and draw: p2=1, p3=1.

Now, p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, which doesn't match.

Option 5: p1 and p3 play and p3 wins: p1=0, p3=2.

Then, p2 and p3 play and draw: p2=1, p3=3.

Not matching.

Option 6: p1 and p2 play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Then, p1 and p3 play and p1 wins: p1=3, p3=1.

Not matching.

Option 7: p1 and p2 play and p1 wins: p1=2, p2=0.

Then, p1 and p3 play and draw: p1=3, p3=1.

Not matching.

Option 8: p1 and p3 play and draw: p1=1, p3=1.

Then, p2 and p3 play and p3 wins: p2=0, p3=3.

Not matching.

Option 9: p2 and p3 play and draw: p2=1, p3=1.

Then, p1 and p3 play and p3 wins: p1=0, p3=3.

Not matching.

Option 10: p1 and p2 play and p2 wins: p1=0, p2=2.

Then, p2 and p3 play and p3 wins: p2=2, p3=2.

Now, p1=0, p2=2, p3=2, which doesn't match.

Option 11: p1 and p3 play and p3 wins: p1=0, p3=2.

Then, p1 and p2 play and draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Now, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches.

In this scenario, there is one draw between p1 and p2, and one win for p3 against p1.

So, only one draw, but according to the sample output, it's 2.

So, perhaps the formula is counting something else.

Wait, maybe it's counting the maximum possible draws without considering the individual constraints.

In this case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

According to the formula, since p3 > p1 + p2 (2 > 1 + 1 is false), so result = (1 + 1 + 2) // 2 = 2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe it's counting the minimal number of wins.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me denote:

- Let D be the number of draws.

- Let W be the number of win/loss games.

Then, total games G = D + W.

Each draw contributes 2 points (1 to each player), and each win/loss game contributes 2 points (2 to the winner, 0 to the loser).

So, total points P = 2G.

Also, in terms of individual scores:

Each draw increases the scores of the two participating players by 1 each.

Each win/loss game increases the winner's score by 2 and the loser's by 0.

Our goal is to maximize D, given p1, p2, p3.

To maximize D, we need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing W.

The minimal number of wins W is determined by how much the individual scores require wins.

Specifically, for each player, their score can be achieved through a combination of draws and wins.

Let me think about the minimal number of wins needed for each player.

For a player with score p, the minimal number of wins needed is ceil(p / 2), because each win gives 2 points, and draws give 1 point each.

But this doesn't account for the interactions between players.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system of equations.

Let me denote:

- Let x be the number of draws between p1 and p2.

- Let y be the number of draws between p1 and p3.

- Let z be the number of draws between p2 and p3.

- Let a be the number of win/loss games between p1 and p2.

- Let b be the number of win/loss games between p1 and p3.

- Let c be the number of win/loss games between p2 and p3.

Then, the total points for each player can be expressed as:

p1 = x + y + 2a + 2b

p2 = x + z + 2a + 2c

p3 = y + z + 2b + 2c

Our goal is to maximize the total number of draws, which is D = x + y + z.

Subject to the constraints that a, b, c, x, y, z are non-negative integers.

This seems complicated to solve directly.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that the total points P = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2(G), where G is the total number of games.

Each draw contributes 2 points to P, and each win/loss game also contributes 2 points to P.

So, P = 2(D + W), where D is the number of draws and W is the number of win/loss games.

Therefore, D + W = P / 2.

Our goal is to maximize D, which is equivalent to minimizing W.

To minimize W, we need to maximize D, but we are already trying to maximize D.

Wait, this seems circular.

Perhaps I need to find the maximum D such that the individual scores can be achieved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have D draws and W win/loss games, with D + W = G = P / 2.

We need to distribute these draws and win/loss games among the pairs of players in a way that matches the individual scores.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that in a tournament with draws, the sum of the scores is equal to twice the number of games, which holds here.

Also, in a tournament, the number of draws can be calculated based on the individual scores.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula for the number of draws.

In a game between two players, if they draw, both get 1 point.

If one wins, the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0.

Let me consider the total points contributed by each pair.

For example, between p1 and p2, if they play G12 games, with D12 draws and W12 win/loss games, then:

p1 += D12 + 2W12 (if p1 is the winner)

p2 += D12 + 2L12 (if p2 is the loser)

Wait, more precisely:

For each game between p1 and p2:

- If draw: p1 +=1, p2 +=1

- If p1 wins: p1 +=2, p2 +=0

- If p2 wins: p1 +=0, p2 +=2

Similarly for other pairs.

Our goal is to maximize the total number of draws across all games.

This seems complex to model directly.

Perhaps I can look for an upper bound on the number of draws.

An upper bound on the number of draws is the minimum of p1, p2, p3, because each draw increases two players' scores by 1.

Wait, but it's possible that not all draws can be achieved simultaneously due to the constraints of the individual scores.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2, but only if p1 + p2 >= p3, p1 + p3 >= p2, and p2 + p3 >= p1.

This seems similar to the triangle inequality.

In fact, in a valid set of scores, the sum of any two players' scores must be at least the third player's score.

Because, if p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible, since p3 cannot gain points without playing against p1 or p2, and p1 and p2 can only provide so many points.

Wait, but in reality, p3 can play against p1 and p2 and win all those games, accumulating 2 points per win.

So, p3 can have up to 2*(number of games against p1 and p2).

But p1 and p2 can also play against each other and affect their scores.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me consider the formula in the provided program again: (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

From earlier analysis, this simplifies to:

- If p3 <= p1 + p2, then (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2.

- Else, p1 + p2.

In the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, p3 <= p1 + p2 (2 <= 2), so result = (1 + 1 + 2) // 2 = 2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the formula overestimates the number of draws.

Hence, it might be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe it's acceptable to have more draws than actually possible, but in the context of the problem, we need to ensure that the scores are achievable.

Wait, but the problem says to print -1 if it's impossible to achieve the scores through any valid set of games.

In the case where p3 > p1 + p2, the formula uses p1 + p2 as the result.

But in reality, p3 cannot have more points than p1 + p2, because p3 can only gain points from playing against p1 and p2, and the points gained are limited by the points that p1 and p2 can give up.

Wait, but p3 can gain 2 points per win against p1 or p2.

So, if p3 plays against p1 and p2 and wins all those games, p3 can have up to 2*(number of games against p1 and p2).

But p1 and p2 can also play against each other and affect their scores.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that in order for the scores to be achievable, the following inequalities must hold:

p1 + p2 >= p3

p1 + p3 >= p2

p2 + p3 >= p1

These are similar to the triangle inequality.

If any of these inequalities do not hold, then it's impossible to achieve the scores.

So, in the program, if p3 > p1 + p2, then the result is p1 + p2.

Otherwise, it's (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2.

In the case where p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so the program outputs p1 + p2, but according to the problem, it should output -1 if it's impossible.

But in the sample input, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which has p3 = p1 + p2, so it's on the boundary.

According to the formula, since p3 <= p1 + p2, result = (1 + 1 + 2) // 2 = 2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is calculating something else.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the total number of games, and then the number of draws is equal to the total games minus the number of win/loss games.

But I'm getting lost.

Let me look for an alternative way to compute the maximum number of draws.

Suppose we try to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of win/loss games.

Each win/loss game contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

So, to minimize the number of win/loss games, we need to maximize the points coming from draws.

Each draw contributes 1 point to each of two players.

So, the maximum number of draws is limited by the smallest p among p1, p2, p3, because each draw increases two players' scores by 1.

Wait, but it's possible that not all draws can be achieved simultaneously due to the constraints.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is min(p1, p2, p3).

But in the sample input, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, min is 1, but the output is 2.

So, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of (p1 + p2 - p3)/2, etc.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that the total points from draws is 2*D, since each draw contributes 2 points.

The total points from win/loss games is also 2*W.

So, P = 2*(D + W).

Hence, D + W = P / 2.

Our goal is to maximize D, which is equivalent to minimizing W.

The minimal W is the excess points that cannot be achieved through draws.

Wait, perhaps W is the sum of (p_i - D), for all i, divided by something.

This seems messy.

Let me try to think in terms of the sum of p_i.

We have P = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(D + W).

So, D + W = P / 2.

Now, to maximize D, we need to minimize W.

The minimal W is determined by the constraints on individual p_i.

Specifically, each p_i must be less than or equal to D (from draws) plus 2*(number of win/loss games where the player won).

This is getting too involved.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of draws is related to the sum of the scores minus the maximum score.

Wait, in the program, it's (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

In the case where p3 <= p1 + p2, it's (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2.

In the case where p3 > p1 + p2, it's p1 + p2.

But in reality, if p3 > p1 + p2, it's impossible to achieve the scores, so we should output -1.

Looking back at the sample input, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which has p3 = p1 + p2, so it's on the boundary.

According to the formula, (1 + 1 + 2) // 2 = 2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is calculating the total number of games, not the number of draws.

Wait, in the program, it's named 'result', but perhaps it's the total number of games, and then we need to subtract the number of win/loss games to get the number of draws.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that the total number of games is G = P / 2.

Then, the number of draws D is G minus the number of win/loss games W.

To maximize D, we need to minimize W.

The minimal W is determined by the constraints on the individual scores.

Specifically, for each player, their score must be achievable given the number of draws they participated in.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to find another way.

I found that in some similar problems, the maximum number of draws is (sum of p_i - sum of ceil(p_i / 2)).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's (sum of p_i - sum of floor(p_i / 2)).

But this doesn't seem to fit.

Let me consider that each draw increases two p_i by 1, and each win/loss increases one p_i by 2.

So, to maximize draws, we need to maximize the number of times two p_i are increased by 1, without exceeding their individual scores.

This seems similar to maximizing the number of times we can add (1,1,0), (1,0,1), or (0,1,1), and the rest by (2,0,0), (0,2,0), or (0,0,2).

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is equal to the total points minus the sum of the minimal wins needed for each player.

Where the minimal wins for a player is ceil(p_i / 2).

But in the sample input, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(1/2)=1, ceil(2/2)=1.

Sum of ceil is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Total points P=4.

So, draws would be 4 - 3 =1, which matches my earlier manual calculation.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

So, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor(p_i / 2).

Floor(1/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(2/2)=1.

Sum is 0 + 0 + 1 =1.

Total points P=4.

So, draws would be 4 - 1 =3, which is not matching.

This isn't working.

I'm stuck.

Maybe I should accept that I don't know how to solve this and trust the provided program.

But I need to verify its correctness.

Looking back at the program:

result = (p1 + p2 + p3 - max(0, p3 - p1 - p2)) // 2.

In the case where p3 <= p1 + p2, result = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2.

In the case where p3 > p1 + p2, result = p1 + p2.

In the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, p3 = p1 + p2, so result = (1+1+2)//2 = 2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is calculating something else.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the total number of games, and then the number of draws is total games minus the number of win/loss games.

But I need to see.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, because p3 can't have more points than p1 + p2.

In that case, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, p1 + p2 =2, which matches the sample output of 2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible, so perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is calculating the minimal number of win/loss games.

Wait, I'm getting too confused.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, when p3 <= p1 + p2.

Because p3 can't have more points than p1 + p2.

So, the maximum draws would be p1 + p2.

In the sample input, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, so p1 + p2 =2, which matches the output.

But in reality, only one draw is possible, so perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is calculating the total number of games, and then the number of draws is total games minus the number of win/loss games.

But I need to see.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is p1 + p2, and the number of win/loss games is (p3 - p1 - p2)/2.

But in the sample input, p3 - p1 - p2 =0, so W=0, and D=2.

But in reality, only one draw is possible.

So, perhaps the formula is overestimating the number of draws.

Hence, it might be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, and my understanding is wrong.

Let me consider another sample input.

Take p1=3, p2=4, p3=5. Total P=12, which is even.

p3=5 <= p1 + p2=7, so result=(3+4+5)//2=6.

Is it possible to have 6 draws with p1=3, p2=4, p3=5?

Each draw increases two players' scores by 1.

So, with 6 draws:

- p1 can get up to 6 points (but only has 3).

- p2 can get up to 6 points (has 4).

- p3 can get up to 6 points (has 5).

But in reality, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, perhaps the number of draws is limited by the minimal p_i.

Wait, but p1=3, which is less than 6.

So, perhaps the maximum number of draws is p1=3.

But according to the formula, it's 6.

But in reality, p1 can only participate in 3 draws, giving him 3 points.

Similarly, p2 can participate in up to 4 draws, but p1 limits it to 3.

Similarly, p3 can participate in up to 5 draws, but p1 limits it to 3.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, the output is 6.

But according to my reasoning, only 3 draws are possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me think differently.

If there are 6 draws:

- Each draw increases two players' scores by 1.

- So, total points from draws would be 12 points.

- But p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, which sums to 12.

- So, it's possible if p1 participates in 3 draws, p2 in 4 draws, and p3 in 5 draws, but some draws are counted multiple times.

Wait, but in reality, each draw involves two players, so the sum should be twice the number of draws.

Wait, no, each draw increases the sum by 2.

Wait, total points from draws would be 2*D.

But in this case, D=6, so total points from draws would be 12, which matches p1 + p2 + p3=12.

But in reality, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, which are their individual scores.

If p1 participates in 3 draws, he gets 3 points.

Similarly, p2 participates in 4 draws, getting 4 points.

But p3 participates in 5 draws, getting 5 points.

But in reality, each draw is between two players, so the sum of participations should be twice the number of draws.

Wait, but p1 participates in 3 draws, p2 in 4 draws, p3 in 5 draws, sum=12, which should be twice the number of draws, which is 12=2*6, which holds.

So, it's possible.

Now, is there a way to arrange the draws such that p1=3, p2=4, p3=5?

Let me try:

- p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- p1 and p3 draw once: p1=2, p3=1.

- p2 and p3 draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

- p2 and p3 draw again: p2=3, p3=3.

- p2 and p3 draw again: p2=4, p3=4.

- p2 and p3 draw again: p2=5, p3=5.

Wait, now p2=5, which is more than desired p2=4.

So, this doesn't work.

Alternative approach:

- p1 and p2 draw three times: p1=3, p2=3.

- p2 and p3 draw once: p2=4, p3=4.

- p3 and p1 draw once: p1=4, p3=5.

Now, p1=4, p2=4, p3=5, which doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Another approach:

- p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- p1 and p3 draw twice: p1=3, p3=2.

- p2 and p3 draw three times: p2=4, p3=5.

This matches p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, in this case, there are 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 draws, which matches the formula's output.

So, in this case, it's possible to have 6 draws.

Earlier, I thought only one draw was possible, but that was a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Hence, the formula seems correct in this case.

Going back to the earlier confusion with p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

According to the formula, result=2.

But I thought only one draw was possible.

However, perhaps there is a way to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 with two draws.

Let me try:

- p1 and p2 draw once: p1=1, p2=1.

- p2 and p3 draw once: p2=2, p3=2.

Now, p1=1, p2=2,
