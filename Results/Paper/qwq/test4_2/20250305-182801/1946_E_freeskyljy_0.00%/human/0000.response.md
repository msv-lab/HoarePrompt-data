Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a permutation of length n, and I have the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. I need to figure out how many different permutations could have these specific prefix and suffix maximum indices. And finally, I have to output this number modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what prefix and suffix maximums are. A prefix maximum at position i means that the element at that position is greater than all the elements before it. Similarly, a suffix maximum at position i means that the element at that position is greater than all the elements after it.

So, given the indices of these prefix and suffix maximums, I need to determine how many permutations satisfy these conditions.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the second test case:

n = 4, m1 = 2, m2 = 3

prefix maximum indices: 1, 2

suffix maximum indices: 2, 3, 4

The suitable permutations are:

[1, 4, 3, 2]

[2, 4, 3, 1]

[3, 4, 2, 1]

So, there are 3 possible permutations that match these prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Looking at these permutations, I can see that in all of them, the element at position 1 is a prefix maximum, and the element at position 2 is also a prefix maximum. Similarly, the elements at positions 2, 3, and 4 are suffix maximums.

I need to find a general way to calculate the number of such permutations for any given n, m1, m2, and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Let me think about the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.

For prefix maximums, since they are in increasing order of their indices, the values at these positions must be greater than all previous elements. Similarly, for suffix maximums, the values at these positions must be greater than all subsequent elements.

Moreover, the prefix maximums and suffix maximums must overlap in a specific way. For instance, the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum should be the same, as they both represent the maximum element in the permutation.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me check the example:

In the second test case, L = [1, 2], R = [2, 3, 4]. So, L[-1] = 2 and R[0] = 2. They are the same.

In the first test case, n=1, L=[1], R=[1]. They are the same.

In the third test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[3]. Again, L[-1]=3 and R[0]=3.

In the fourth test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[2,3,4,5]. L[-1]=3 and R[0]=2, which are different, and the output is 0. So, indeed, if L[-1] != R[0], there are no valid permutations.

So, it seems like a necessary condition is that L[-1] == R[0].

Similarly, in the fifth test case, L=[1,2,3,4,12], R=[12,13,18,20], L[-1]=12 and R[0]=12, which are equal.

In the sixth test case, L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6], L[-1]=3 and R[0]=3, which are equal.

So, it seems like a necessary condition is that the last prefix maximum index equals the first suffix maximum index.

Moreover, in the third test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[3]. This seems to make sense because in a permutation of length 3, if all positions are prefix maximums, and only the last position is a suffix maximum, it implies that the permutation is strictly increasing, and only the last element is greater than all elements after it (which are none, except itself).

Wait, in a permutation of length 3, if L=[1,2,3], it means that each position is a prefix maximum, which implies that each element is greater than all before it, meaning the permutation is strictly increasing. And R=[3] means only the last element is greater than all after it, which is trivially true since there are no elements after it.

So, in this case, the only permutation that satisfies this is [1,2,3], which matches the output of 1.

In the fourth test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[2,3,4,5], and n=5. Here, L[-1]=3 and R[0]=2, which are different, so no valid permutations exist, and the output is 0.

So, the condition L[-1] == R[0] seems crucial.

Additionally, in the second test case, L=[1,2], R=[2,3,4], and n=4. Here, L[-1]=2 and R[0]=2, which match, and there are 3 valid permutations.

In the sixth test case, L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6], n=6, L[-1]=3 and R[0]=3, which match, and there are 10 valid permutations.

So, it seems like when L[-1] == R[0], there might be some way to calculate the number of valid permutations, and when they don't match, it's impossible.

But, in the fifth test case, n=20, L=[1,2,3,4,12], R=[12,13,18,20], L[-1]=12 and R[0]=12, which match, and the output is 317580808, which is a large number modulo 10^9+7.

So, I need to find a general approach to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximum indices.

Let me try to think about how to construct such permutations.

First, the maximum element in the permutation must be at the index that is both the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum, i.e., L[-1] == R[0].

Let's denote this index as M = L[-1] = R[0].

So, the maximum element n is at position M.

Now, for the prefix maximums before M, they must be strictly increasing up to M, because each prefix maximum is greater than all previous elements.

Similarly, for the suffix maximums after M, they must be strictly decreasing up to the end, because each suffix maximum is greater than all subsequent elements.

Wait, actually, suffix maximums are defined as elements that are greater than all elements after them. So, in the suffix, they don't necessarily have to be strictly decreasing, but in this context, given that they are suffix maximums, they must be greater than all that come after them.

Wait, no. In a suffix, if an element is a suffix maximum, it means it's greater than all elements to its right. But the next suffix maximum to its right must be greater than all elements to its right, including this element.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the suffix, the suffix maximums are in increasing order of their indices because they are given in increasing order.

Wait, no, they are given in increasing order of their indices, but in the suffix, the suffix maximums should be decreasing in value as we move from left to right.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the values at these positions.

Actually, perhaps it's better to consider the structure of the permutation based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

Let me consider dividing the permutation into three parts:

1. The prefix before M.

2. The position M.

3. The suffix after M.

At position M, the value is n, the maximum.

In the prefix before M, the prefix maximums must be strictly increasing up to M, and the non-prefix maximums must be less than the next prefix maximum.

In the suffix after M, the suffix maximums must be strictly decreasing, because each suffix maximum must be greater than all that follow, including the next suffix maximum.

Wait, no. Actually, in the suffix, the suffix maximums are in increasing order of their indices, but their values must be decreasing.

Wait, no, their values must be greater than all that follow, so the next suffix maximum must be greater than all that follow, including the current suffix maximum.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall the definition.

A suffix maximum at position i means that a_i > a_j for all j > i.

So, in the suffix starting at position i, a_i is greater than all a_j where j > i.

Similarly, in the suffix starting at position i+1, a_{i+1} > a_j for all j > i+1.

If position i is a suffix maximum and position i+1 is also a suffix maximum, then a_i > a_{i+1}, because a_i > a_j for all j > i, including j = i+1.

Therefore, in the suffix maximums, their values must be decreasing as we move from left to right.

Similarly, in the prefix maximums, their values must be increasing as we move from left to right.

Because each prefix maximum is greater than all before it.

So, in the prefix, the prefix maximums have increasing values, and in the suffix, the suffix maximums have decreasing values.

Moreover, between the prefix and suffix, at position M, the value is n, the maximum.

Now, for the elements that are not prefix or suffix maximums, their values can be anything as long as they don't violate the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.

Wait, but they do have constraints.

For example, in the prefix, non-prefix maximums must be less than the next prefix maximum.

Similarly, in the suffix, non-suffix maximums must be less than the previous suffix maximum.

Wait, perhaps I need to formalize this.

Let me try to think recursively or in segments.

First, the maximum element n is at position M = L[-1] = R[0].

Now, in the prefix before M, the prefix maximums are at positions L[1] to L[-2], and their values must be strictly increasing up to n.

Similarly, in the suffix after M, the suffix maximums are at positions R[1] to R[-1], and their values must be strictly decreasing from n.

Now, for the positions between prefix maximums and suffix maximums, the values must be less than the preceding prefix maximum and the succeeding suffix maximum.

This seems a bit vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of choosing values for the prefix and suffix separately and then combining them.

Let me consider that the permutation is divided into blocks delimited by the prefix and suffix maximums.

For example, between prefix maximums, and between suffix maximums, the values have certain constraints.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or combinatorial counting could be applied here.

Looking at the code provided, it seems to be attempting to calculate the number of such permutations using combinatorial methods, specifically using combinations and multiplications modulo 10^9+7.

Let me try to understand the code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it calls func_1().

In func_1():

- It reads n, m1, m2.

- Then reads the lists L and R.

- Checks if L[-1] != R[0], returns 0.

- Checks if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n, returns 0.

- If m1 >1 and m2 >1 and L[-2] == R[1], returns 0.

- Then calculates ans = comb(N-1, L[-1]-1), which is the number of ways to choose L[-1]-1 elements out of N-1 to place before M.

- Then it seems to iterate through the prefix and suffix parts, multiplying ans by the number of choices for the non-maximum positions.

This seems to be on the right track, but I need to verify if this logic correctly counts the number of valid permutations.

Let me consider the second test case:

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

L=[1,2], R=[2,3,4]

So, M=2.

ans = comb(3,1) = 3.

Then, it seems to iterate through the prefix and suffix parts, but in this case, M1=2, M2=3.

It seems to handle the prefix and suffix separately, multiplying the number of choices for each non-maximum position.

In this case, the prefix has positions 1 and 2, with prefix maximums at 1 and 2.

The suffix has positions 2,3,4, with suffix maximums at 2,3,4.

But position 2 is both prefix and suffix maximum, which is where the maximum element n=4 is placed.

Then, for the prefix, between positions 1 and 2, position 1 must be less than position 2.

For the suffix, positions 3 and 4 must be less than position 2, and position 3 must be greater than position 4.

So, the values are constrained accordingly.

The code seems to calculate the number of ways to choose and arrange the values in these positions.

Given that the code outputs 3 for this case, which matches the example, it seems correct for this case.

Let me check another case.

Sixth test case:

n=6, m1=2, m2=3

L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6]

M=3.

ans = comb(5,2) = 10.

Then, it seems to iterate through the prefix and suffix parts.

In this case, the output is 10, which matches the example.

So, for this case, it seems correct.

Fifth test case:

n=20, m1=5, m2=4

L=[1,2,3,4,12], R=[12,13,18,20]

M=12.

ans = comb(19,11).

Then, it seems to iterate through the prefix and suffix parts, multiplying accordingly.

The output is 317580808, which is likely correct given the constraints.

Now, I need to ensure that the logic is correct in general.

Let me think about the general approach.

1. Verify that L[-1] == R[0] == M.

2. Verify that L[0] ==1 and R[0] ==n.

Wait, no, in the sixth test case, R[0] ==3, which is not n=6.

Wait, in the sixth test case, R=[3,4,6], so R[0]=3, which is not equal to n=6.

But according to the code, it checks if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n, returns 0.

But in this test case, R[0]=3 != n=6, but the output is 10, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back, the code has:

if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n:

return 0

But in the sixth test case, R[0]=3 != n=6, but the output is 10.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect then.

Wait, no, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, in the sixth test case:

6 2 3

1 3

3 4 6

So, n=6, m1=2, m2=3

L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6]

So, L[0]=1, R[0]=3 != n=6.

But according to the code, it returns 0 in this case, but the expected output is 10.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the code.

Wait, looking back, the code has:

if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n:

return 0

But in the sixth test case, R[0]=3 != n=6, so according to the code, it should return 0, but the expected output is 10.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the condition.

In the problem statement, it says:

"You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums."

Prefix maximums are defined as elements that are greater than all previous elements, and suffix maximums are elements that are greater than all subsequent elements.

In the sixth test case, L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6].

So, position 1 and 3 are prefix maximums, and positions 3,4,6 are suffix maximums.

The maximum element must be at position M = L[-1] = R[0] =3.

So, the maximum element is at position 3.

Now, in the prefix up to position 3, positions 1 and 3 are prefix maximums, so the values at positions 1 and 3 must be greater than all before them.

In the suffix from position 3 onwards, positions 3,4,6 are suffix maximums, so the values at these positions must be greater than all after them.

So, in this case, R[0]=3 != n=6.

But still, it's a valid scenario because the maximum is at position 3, which is included in both prefix and suffix maximums.

So, perhaps the condition in the code is too strict.

In the code, it has:

if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n:

return 0

But in the sixth test case, R[0]=3 !=n=6, but there are valid permutations.

So, this suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"the first line of each test case contains three integers n, m1, and m2 (1 ≤ m1, m2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively."

"the second line contains m1 integers p1 < p2 < … < pm1 (1 ≤ pi ≤ n) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing order."

"the third line contains m2 integers s1 < s2 < … < sm2 (1 ≤ si ≤ n) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order."

So, the suffix maximum indices are in increasing order of their indices.

Wait, but suffix maximums are positions where the element is greater than all elements to its right, and they are given in increasing order of their indices.

In the sixth test case, R=[3,4,6], which are in increasing order.

But in this case, R[0]=3, which is not equal to n=6.

So, perhaps the condition in the code is incorrect.

Looking back at the first test case:

n=1, m1=1, m2=1

L=[1], R=[1]

This is valid.

Second test case:

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

L=[1,2], R=[2,3,4]

Here, R[0]=2 !=n=4, but it's still valid.

Third test case:

n=3, m1=3, m2=1

L=[1,2,3], R=[3]

Here, R[0]=3 ==n=3, which is valid.

Fourth test case:

n=5, m1=3, m2=4

L=[1,2,3], R=[2,3,4,5]

Here, R[0]=2 !=n=5, and output is 0.

But according to the code, if R[0] !=n, it returns 0.

But in the second test case, R[0]=2 !=n=4, but there are valid permutations.

So, the condition in the code seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the condition.

Looking back at the code:

if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n:

return 0

But in the second test case, R[0]=2 !=n=4, but there are valid permutations.

So, this suggests that the condition is wrong.

Perhaps the condition should only check if L[0]==1 and L[-1]==R[0].

Because in the second test case, L[0]=1, L[-1]=2==R[0]=2, which is valid.

But in the fourth test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[2,3,4,5], L[-1]=3 != R[0]=2, so it's invalid.

In the sixth test case, L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6], L[-1]=3 == R[0]=3, which is valid.

So, perhaps the condition should only be L[-1]==R[0], and L[0]==1.

Because L[0] should always be 1, as the first element is always a prefix maximum.

Wait, is that true?

In a permutation, the first element is always a prefix maximum of the prefix of length 1.

So, L[0] should always be 1.

Similarly, the last suffix maximum should be n, so R[-1]=n.

Wait, but in the second test case, R=[2,3,4], R[-1]=4==n=4.

In the sixth test case, R=[3,4,6], R[-1]=6==n=6.

So, perhaps the condition should be L[0]==1 and R[-1]==n.

But in the code, it checks L[0]==1 and R[0]==n, which is incorrect, as in the sixth test case, R[0]=3 !=n=6, but it's still valid.

Wait, no, in the sixth test case, R=[3,4,6], R[-1]=6==n=6.

So, perhaps the condition should be L[0]==1 and R[-1]==n.

But in the code, it's checking R[0]==n, which is too strict.

So, the code is incorrect in this regard.

Looking back, in the fourth test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[2,3,4,5], L[-1]=3 != R[0]=2, which is invalid.

In the sixth test case, L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6], L[-1]=3 == R[0]=3, which is valid.

So, the condition should be L[-1] == R[0], and L[0]==1 and R[-1]==n.

Wait, in the second test case, L=[1,2], R=[2,3,4], L[-1]=2 == R[0]=2, L[0]=1, R[-1]=4==n=4, which is valid.

In the third test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[3], L[-1]=3 == R[0]=3, L[0]=1, R[-1]=3==n=3, which is valid.

In the fifth test case, L=[1,2,3,4,12], R=[12,13,18,20], L[-1]=12 == R[0]=12, L[0]=1, R[-1]=20==n=20, which is valid.

So, the conditions should be:

- L[0] ==1

- R[-1] ==n

- L[-1] == R[0]

If these conditions are not met, there are no valid permutations.

So, the code should check if L[0]==1 and R[-1]==n and L[-1]==R[0]. If not, return 0.

But in the code, it checks if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n, return 0.

This is incorrect because it should check R[0] == L[-1], not R[0] == n.

So, the code has a mistake in this condition.

It should be:

if L[0] !=1 or R[-1] !=n or L[-1] != R[0]:

return 0

Instead of:

if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=n:

return 0

So, the code is incorrect in this regard.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
