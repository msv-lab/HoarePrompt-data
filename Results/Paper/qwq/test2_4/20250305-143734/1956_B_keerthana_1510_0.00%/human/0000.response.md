Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating, with me starting first. Each turn, the player plays one card from their hand and places it on the table. If the card's number is already on the table, the player gets a point.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she minimizes my points. So, I need to figure out, given my cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better. There are 2n turns, with each of us playing n turns alternately, starting with me. So, I play turn 1, Nene plays turn 2, I play turn 3, and so on.

Each time a player plays a card, they check if that card's number is already on the table. If it is, they get a point. Then, they place the card on the table.

Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, I need to anticipate her moves based on the cards on the table and the possible cards she has.

Given that each integer appears exactly twice in the deck, and I know my cards, I can figure out which cards Nene has by subtracting my cards from the full deck.

But wait, the problem says that it's guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in my cards at most twice, which makes sense since each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

So, for each test case, I have:

- An integer n, the number of cards each player has.

- A list of n integers, representing the cards in my hand.

I need to compute the maximum number of points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me try to understand the example provided.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1, 1, 2, 3

So, the full deck is [1,1,2,3, x,x,x,x], but since each number appears exactly twice, the full deck is [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

Therefore, Nene's cards are [2,3,4,4]

Now, let's simulate the game:

- Turn 1: I play one of my 1's. Table: [1]

- Turn 2: Nene plays one of her cards. She wants to maximize her points and minimize mine. So, she should play a card that isn't already on the table, to avoid giving me a point later. So, she plays 4. Table: [1,4]

- Turn 3: I play my other 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1]

- Turn 4: Nene plays her 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4]

- Turn 5: I play my 2. Since 2 isn't on the table yet, no point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2]

- Turn 6: Nene plays her 2. Since 2 is now on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2]

- Turn 7: I play my 3. Since 3 isn't on the table yet, no point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3]

- Turn 8: Nene plays her 3. Since 3 is now on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,2,3,3]

So, I got 1 point, Nene got 3 points.

The problem says that in this case, the answer is 1, which matches what I got in this simulation.

But the problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, is there a way for me to get more than 1 point in this scenario?

Let's try a different play order.

- Turn 1: I play 2. Table: [2]

- Turn 2: Nene plays 4. Table: [2,4]

- Turn 3: I play 1. Table: [2,4,1]

- Turn 4: Nene plays 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [2,4,1,4]

- Turn 5: I play 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [2,4,1,4,1]

- Turn 6: Nene plays 3. Table: [2,4,1,4,1,3]

- Turn 7: I play 3. Since 3 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [2,4,1,4,1,3,3]

- Turn 8: Nene plays her remaining card, which is 4. But she already played both 4's, so this doesn't make sense.

Wait, Nene has only one 4 left if she played one already. Wait, in this scenario, Nene has [2,3,4,4]. If she played one 4 in turn 2, and another in turn 4, that's fine. But in this alternative play, if I play 2 in turn 1, and Nene plays 4 in turn 2, then I play 1 in turn 3, Nene plays 4 in turn 4, I play 1 in turn 5 (getting a point), Nene plays 3 in turn 6, I play 3 in turn 7 (getting a point), and Nene plays her last card, which is another 4, but she already played both 4's. Wait, she has [2,3,4,4]. If she played one 4 in turn 2 and another in turn 4, then in turn 6, she would play 2 or 3. Let's say she plays 2 in turn 6, then in turn 7, I play 3, getting a point, and in turn 8, she plays 3, getting a point.

So, in this case, I get 2 points, and Nene gets 2 points.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine. So, in the first scenario, she played 4 in turn 2, and in the second scenario, she played 4 in turn 2 again.

Wait, maybe in the second scenario, Nene would play differently to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me think again.

In the first turn, I play a card. Let's say I play 2.

Table: [2]

Nene's cards: [2,3,4,4]

Nene will choose to play a card that doesn't give me a point later. So, she might play 2, but if she plays 2, then in my next turn, I can play 1, and she has to play 3 or 4.

If she plays 2 in turn 2:

Table: [2,2]

Then in turn 3, I play 1. Table: [2,2,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays 3. Table: [2,2,1,3]

Turn 5: I play 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [2,2,1,3,1]

Turn 6: Nene plays 4. Table: [2,2,1,3,1,4]

Turn 7: I play 3. Since 3 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [2,2,1,3,1,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [2,2,1,3,1,4,3,4]

So, I got 2 points, Nene got 1 point.

Wait, but according to the problem, in this test case, the answer is 1, meaning I can get at most 1 point. But in this simulation, I got 2 points.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider Nene's optimal play more carefully.

Let's consider another play order.

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4]

Turn 5: I play 2. Table: [1,4,1,4,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,3]

Turn 7: I play 3. Since 3 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,4,1,4,2,3,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her last card, which is 4. But she already played both 4's, so this doesn't make sense.

Wait, Nene has [2,3,4,4]. If she plays one 4 in turn 2 and another in turn 4, then in turn 6, she plays 3, and in turn 8, she has no more cards, which is a mistake in my earlier simulation.

Wait, each player has n cards, which is 4 in this case. So, Nene has [2,3,4,4]. She plays one 4 in turn 2, another 4 in turn 4, and then 3 in turn 6. She doesn't have a fourth card to play in turn 8, which is a problem.

Wait, no, each player has n cards, and there are 2n turns, with each player playing n turns. So, me playing turn 1,3,5,7 and Nene playing turn 2,4,6,8.

So, in turn 8, it's Nene's turn, and she should play her last card, which is 3.

So, in this case, I got 2 points, and Nene got 2 points.

But according to the problem, the answer is 1, meaning I can get at most 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps Nene can play in a way to minimize my points.

Let's try another simulation.

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play 1. Since 1 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,2,1,4]

Turn 5: I play 3. Table: [1,2,1,4,3]

Turn 6: Nene plays 4. Since 4 is already on the table, she gets 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,4,3,4]

Turn 7: I play my last card, which is 3. Since 3 is already on the table, I get 1 point. Table: [1,2,1,4,3,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays her last card, which is 4. But she already played both 4's, so this is invalid.

Wait, Nene has [2,3,4,4]. If she plays 2 in turn 2, and 4 in turn 4, and 4 in turn 6, then in turn 8, she has no more cards, which is a problem.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the cards. Let's double-check.

Full deck: [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4]

My cards: [1,1,2,3]

Nene's cards: [2,3,4,4]

So, in turn 8, Nene should play her last card, which is 4.

But she already played two 4's, so perhaps she can't play another 4. Wait, she has only two 4's, so she plays them in turn 4 and turn 6.

So, in turn 8, she has no more cards, which is impossible.

Wait, no, she has [2,3,4,4]. If she plays 2 in turn 2, 4 in turn 4, and 4 in turn 6, then in turn 8, she plays 3.

So, in this case:

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play 1. Table: [1,2,1] (I get 1 point)

Turn 4: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,2,1,4]

Turn 5: I play 3. Table: [1,2,1,4,3]

Turn 6: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,2,1,4,3,4] (Nene gets 1 point)

Turn 7: I play 3. Table: [1,2,1,4,3,4,3] (I get 1 point)

Turn 8: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,2,1,4,3,4,3,3] (Nene gets 1 point)

Wait, but Nene only has one 3 left if she plays one in turn 6, but she has [2,3,4,4]. So, in turn 2, she plays 2; turn 4, plays 4; turn 6, plays 4; turn 8, plays 3.

So, in turn 8, she plays 3, and since 3 is already on the table, she gets 1 point.

So, final points: I have 2 points, Nene has 2 points.

But according to the problem, the answer is 1, meaning I can get at most 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps there's a better strategy for Nene to minimize my points.

Let's consider another simulation.

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,3]

Turn 3: I play 1. Table: [1,3,1] (I get 1 point)

Turn 4: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,3,1,4]

Turn 5: I play 2. Table: [1,3,1,4,2]

Turn 6: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,3,1,4,2,4] (Nene gets 1 point)

Turn 7: I play 3. Table: [1,3,1,4,2,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,3,1,4,2,4,3,4] (Nene gets 1 point)

Wait, but Nene only has one 3 and two 4's. So, in turn 2, she plays 3; turn 4, plays 4; turn 6, plays 4; turn 8, she has no more cards, which is a problem.

Wait, Nene has [2,3,4,4]. If she plays 3 in turn 2, 4 in turn 4, 4 in turn 6, and then in turn 8, she has no more cards, which is impossible. So, perhaps in turn 8, she plays 2.

Wait, Nene has [2,3,4,4]. She plays 3 in turn 2, 4 in turn 4, 4 in turn 6, and 2 in turn 8.

So, in turn 8, she plays 2, and since 2 is already on the table (I played it in turn 5), she gets 1 point.

So, final points: I have 1 point, Nene has 3 points.

This matches the problem's example output of 1.

So, in this case, by playing 3 in turn 2, Nene can limit my points to 1.

This suggests that Nene can choose to play in a way that minimizes my points, even if it doesn't maximize her points.

Wait, but in the previous simulation, when I played 1 in turn 1, and Nene played 2 in turn 2, I ended up with 2 points.

But in this simulation, when I play 1 in turn 1 and Nene plays 3 in turn 2, I end up with 1 point.

So, Nene can choose to play 3 in turn 2 to minimize my points.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of a tie, minimize my points.

In the first simulation, where I end up with 1 point and Nene with 3 points, and in the second simulation where I end up with 2 points and Nene with 2 points, Nene prefers the first scenario because she gets more points (3 > 2).

Wait, but in the second scenario, she gets 2 points, which is less than 3.

So, perhaps playing 3 in turn 2 allows her to get more points.

Wait, in the first simulation where I have 1 point and she has 3 points, she plays 3 in turn 2.

In the second simulation where I have 2 points and she has 2 points, she plays 2 in turn 2.

So, by playing 3 in turn 2, she ends up with 3 points, which is better than 2 points.

So, in this case, playing 3 in turn 2 is better for her in terms of maximizing her points.

But in the simulation where she plays 2 in turn 2, she gets only 2 points.

Therefore, she chooses to play 3 in turn 2 to maximize her points.

Hence, in the first simulation, I get 1 point, and in the second simulation, I get 2 points.

But according to the problem, Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In the first simulation, she gets 3 points and I get 1 point.

In the second simulation, she gets 2 points and I get 2 points.

So, she prefers the first simulation because 3 > 2.

Hence, in this case, I can get at most 1 point if she plays optimally.

Therefore, the answer is 1.

So, the problem is to find, for each test case, the maximum number of points I can get assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Now, I need to generalize this to any n and any distribution of my cards.

First, I need to understand the game dynamics.

Each player has n cards, and there are 2n turns.

The key is that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of a tie in her points, minimize mine.

I need to find the maximum points I can get under these conditions.

To approach this, perhaps I need to model the game as a sequence of moves, considering the state of the table and the cards each player has left.

However, with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case or better.

First, I need to determine which cards Nene has, given my cards and the full deck.

Since each number appears exactly twice in the deck, I can count the occurrences in my cards and deduce Nene's cards.

For example, if a number appears once in my cards, it appears once in Nene's cards. If it appears twice in my cards, it doesn't appear in Nene's cards.

Wait, no. If a number appears twice in my cards, then Nene doesn't have that number. If it appears once in my cards, Nene has one card with that number.

Wait, actually, since each number appears exactly twice in the deck, if it appears twice in my cards, then Nene doesn't have that number. If it appears once in my cards, Nene has one card with that number. If it appears zero times in my cards, Nene has two cards with that number.

Wait, more precisely:

- For each number from 1 to n:

- If it appears twice in my cards, Nene has zero cards with that number.

- If it appears once in my cards, Nene has one card with that number.

- If it appears zero times in my cards, Nene has two cards with that number.

So, I can count the frequency of each number in my cards and determine how many of each number Nene has.

Now, the game proceeds with me playing first, then Nene, alternately, for a total of 2n turns.

Each turn, the player plays one card from their hand and places it on the table. If the number is already on the table, they get a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of a tie, minimize my points.

I need to play optimally to maximize my points, knowing Nene's strategy.

This seems like a complex game to model directly.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs each player has.

Wait, let's consider that each number appears exactly twice in the deck.

A number can be distributed in three ways between me and Nene:

1. Both cards are in my hand: then Nene has none of that number.

2. One card is in my hand and one in Nene's hand.

3. Both cards are in Nene's hand.

In the first case, since both cards are mine, I can play both without Nene having any, so I can't get a point from Nene's play.

In the second case, one card is mine and one is Nene's.

In the third case, both cards are Nene's.

Let me think about how points are scored.

A player gets a point if the number they play is already on the table.

So, for a number that appears twice in the deck, the second time it's played, the player gets a point.

Given that, for each number, there are two cards, and the second player to play that number gets a point.

Now, in the game, me and Nene are alternately playing cards.

I need to maximize the number of times I play a card whose number is already on the table.

Nene, on the other hand, wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems like a zero-sum game in some sense.

Let me try to think differently.

Let's consider that for each number that appears twice in the deck, the second time it's played, the player gets a point.

So, for each number, there is one point available, which goes to the player who plays the second card of that number.

Given that, the total number of points available is equal to the number of unique numbers, which is n.

Wait, no. Each number appears twice, and the second time it's played, a point is awarded.

But, since the first play of the number doesn't give a point, and the second play does, then for each number, there is one point available.

Therefore, the total number of points available is equal to the number of unique numbers, n.

Now, me and Nene are playing alternately, and we're trying to maximize our points.

But Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and, in case of a tie, minimize mine.

I need to maximize my points given Nene's strategy.

This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem.

Perhaps I can model it as a graph or use some kind of matching.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of which numbers have both cards with me, or one with me and one with Nene, etc.

Wait, let's categorize the numbers based on how their cards are distributed.

- Type A: Both cards are with me.

- Type B: One card with me, one with Nene.

- Type C: Both cards are with Nene.

For Type A numbers, since both cards are with me, I can play them in my turns, but since Nene doesn't have any, she can't play them, so I can't get a point from them.

For Type B numbers, one card is with me and one with Nene.

For Type C numbers, both cards are with Nene.

Wait, but in Type C, both cards are with Nene, so she can play both, and the second time she plays, she gets a point.

But I can't get any points from Type C numbers because I don't have any of those cards.

For Type B numbers, one card is with me and one with Nene.

So, for Type B numbers, whichever player plays the second card gets the point.

I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize the number of times I play the second card of a number.

But Nene is also playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a selection problem.

Let me think in terms of which numbers can give me a point.

For Type B numbers, if I play my card after Nene plays her card, then I get the point.

For Type C numbers, Nene will get the point when she plays the second card.

For Type A numbers, since both are with me, I can't get any points from them.

So, the only way for me to get points is from Type B numbers, by playing my card after Nene plays her card for that number.

Now, Nene can choose to play her Type B cards early or late to influence whether I can get the point from them.

Similarly, for Type C numbers, she will get the point anyway.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of Type B numbers where I play my card after Nene plays hers.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will try to arrange her plays to minimize my points from Type B numbers.

Wait, but in Type C numbers, she will get points anyway, so she might play them in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers.

Let me define:

- Let k be the number of Type B numbers.

- For each Type B number, Nene has one card, and I have one card.

- For Type C numbers, Nene has both cards.

- For Type A numbers, I have both cards.

Now, for Type C numbers, Nene will get points from them regardless of how I play, because she will play both cards.

For Type A numbers, since both are with me, I can't get any points from them.

For Type B numbers, I can potentially get a point if I play my card after Nene plays her card for that number.

But Nene can choose to play her Type B cards at times that minimize my ability to get points from them.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of Type B numbers and how many turns are left.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let a be the number of Type A numbers (both cards with me).

- Let b be the number of Type B numbers (one card with me, one with Nene).

- Let c be the number of Type C numbers (both cards with Nene).

Then, a + b + c = n, since there are n unique numbers.

Wait, no. Actually, a, b, and c are counts of how the numbers are distributed.

Wait, more precisely:

- a is the number of numbers where both cards are with me.

- b is the number of numbers where one card is with me and one with Nene.

- c is the number of numbers where both cards are with Nene.

Then, a + b + c = n.

Similarly, the total points available are n, since each number can give one point when the second card is played.

Now, points are distributed as follows:

- For Type A numbers: since both cards are with me, I play them, and since Nene doesn't have any, she can't play them, so no points are awarded for Type A numbers.

- For Type B numbers: the point goes to whoever plays the second card, either me or Nene.

- For Type C numbers: Nene plays both cards, so she gets one point from each Type C number.

Therefore, the total points Nene gets are c plus the number of Type B numbers where she plays the second card.

Similarly, my points are the number of Type B numbers where I play the second card.

Now, the total points sum up to c (from Type C numbers) plus the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays second plus the number of Type B numbers where I play second, which should be equal to c plus b, since each Type B number contributes one point.

Wait, no. For Type B numbers, whichever player plays the second card gets the point, so the points from Type B numbers are distributed between me and Nene based on who plays the second card.

Therefore, the total points are c (from Type C numbers) plus b (from Type B numbers), so c + b.

Wait, but each Type C number gives one point to Nene, and each Type B number gives one point to either me or Nene.

So, total points are c (from Type C) plus b (from Type B), which is c + b.

Now, I need to maximize the number of Type B numbers where I play the second card.

Nene, on the other hand, wants to minimize that.

So, it's a game where we alternate turns, and we choose which card to play each time.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points (which include points from Type C numbers and points from Type B numbers where she plays the second card) and, in case of a tie in her points, minimize my points.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers and how many turns are left.

Let me consider that I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

Each turn, we play one card.

For Type B numbers, the point goes to whoever plays the second card.

For Type C numbers, Nene gets the point when she plays the second card.

For Type A numbers, no points are awarded.

So, my goal is to maximize the number of Type B numbers where I play the second card.

Nene's goal is to minimize that.

This seems like a game where we're competing over the Type B numbers.

Let me think about it in terms of selecting which Type B number to play.

Suppose that for each Type B number, there is a potential point for me if I play second.

But Nene can play her Type B card at any time.

I need to arrange my plays such that for as many Type B numbers as possible, I play second.

But Nene can interfere by playing her Type B cards at times that make it difficult for me to play second.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a selection game where we have b Type B numbers, and we have n turns each.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to selecting which battles to fight in a game.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of graph matching or something similar.

But I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider that for each Type B number, I need to play my card after Nene plays her card.

So, for each Type B number, Nene needs to play her card before I play mine.

So, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays her card before I play mine.

Now, Nene can arrange her plays to minimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays her card before I play mine, given that I can arrange my plays accordingly.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to find a formula or a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that I have n turns, and Nene has n turns.

I play first, then Nene, and so on.

I need to choose, in my turns, which of my Type B cards to play.

Nene, in her turns, can choose to play her Type B cards or her Type C cards.

She wants to maximize her points, which include points from Type C numbers and points from Type B numbers where she plays second.

Additionally, she wants to minimize my points from Type B numbers where I play second.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers where I can play second.

Given that Nene plays optimally, she will try to play her Type B cards in a way that minimizes the number of Type B numbers where I can play second.

So, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers minus the number of Type B numbers where Nene can play second.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that there are b Type B numbers.

For each Type B number, Nene can choose to play her card early or late.

If she plays her card early, before I play mine, then if I play my card later, I get the point.

If she plays her card late, after I play my card, then she gets the point.

So, Nene wants to arrange her plays to minimize the number of Type B numbers where she plays her card before I play mine.

In other words, she wants to maximize the number of Type B numbers where she plays her card after I play mine.

Given that, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays her card before I play mine.

So, to maximize my points, I need as many Type B numbers as possible where Nene plays before me.

But Nene will try to minimize that.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, no.

Let me clarify.

For each Type B number, if Nene plays her card before I play mine, then I can play my card later and get the point.

If Nene plays her card after I play mine, then she plays second and gets the point.

Therefore, for each Type B number, I want Nene to play her card before I play mine, so that I can play mine later and get the point.

Nene, on the other hand, wants to play her Type B cards after I play mine, so that she can play second and get the point.

Given that, it's a scheduling problem where Nene chooses the order of her plays to minimize the number of Type B numbers where she plays before me.

I need to choose my plays to maximize the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays before me.

This seems complex.

Perhaps I can model it as a selection where Nene has to schedule her Type B cards in her turns, and I have to schedule mine in my turns.

Given that, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays before me.

Given that we have n turns each, and I play first, then Nene, and so on, up to 2n turns.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers and the number of turns.

Let me consider that in the sequence of 2n turns, I have n turns and Nene has n turns.

I need to maximize the number of Type B numbers where Nene's turn for that number comes before my turn for that number.

Nene wants to minimize that.

This seems like a scheduling problem.

Perhaps I can think in terms of matching the turns for Type B numbers.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers and the number of turns where Nene can play her Type B cards after I play mine.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the total points available from Type B numbers are b, since each Type B number can give one point to either me or Nene.

Nene wants to maximize her points, which include points from Type C numbers (c points) plus points from Type B numbers where she plays second.

So, her total points are c plus the number of Type B numbers where she plays second.

I want to maximize the number of Type B numbers where I play second.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the total Type B numbers minus the number of Type B numbers where Nene can secure playing second.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that Nene can choose to play her Type B cards at any time in her turns, and I can choose to play my Type B cards at any time in my turns.

Given that, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays her card before I play mine.

Given that, I need to maximize that number, and Nene wants to minimize it.

This seems like a classic game where the outcome depends on the scheduling of the plays.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of Type B numbers and the number of turns each has.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in the sequence of turns, I need to arrange my Type B plays after Nene's Type B plays as much as possible.

But Nene can arrange her plays to minimize that.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of Type B numbers where Nene plays before me.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the minimal number of Type B numbers where Nene plays before me.

But I need to maximize that number.

Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Let me try to look for a pattern or a formula based on the example.

In the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, a = 1 (number 1, both cards with me)

b = 2 (numbers 2 and 3, one card each with me)

c = 1 (number 4, both cards with Nene)

Total points: c + b = 1 + 2 = 3

Nene's points: c plus the number of Type B numbers where she plays second

My points: the number of Type B numbers where I play second

In the simulation, I can get at most 1 point.

So, in this case, with b = 2, I can get 1 point.

Is there a relationship here?

Perhaps I can get floor(b / 2).

Wait, floor(2 / 2) = 1, which matches the example.

In the second test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, a = 2 (numbers 8 and 5, both cards with me)

b = 4 (numbers 7,4,1,2, one card each with me)

c = 2 (numbers 3 and 6, both cards with Nene)

Total points: c + b = 2 + 4 = 6

In the example, the answer is 2, which would be floor(4 / 2) = 2.

Similarly, in the third test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, a = 0 (no number appears twice in my cards)

b = 6 (numbers 7,1,4,5,3,2, one card each with me)

c = 2 (numbers 8 and possibly another, but n=8, so c=2)

Wait, n=8, a=0, b=6, c=2

Total points: 6 + 2 = 8

In the example, the answer is 1.

Wait, floor(6 / 2) = 3, but the answer is 1, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps floor(b / 2) is not the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps it's min(b, n - c).

Wait, in the first test case, b=2, n=4, c=1, so n - c = 3, min(2,3)=2, but the answer is 1, which doesn't match.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's b - c.

In the first test case, b=2, c=1, b - c = 1, which matches the answer.

In the second test case, b=4, c=2, b - c = 2, which matches the answer.

In the third test case, b=4, c=2, b - c = 2, but the answer is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((b - c) / 2).

In the first test case, floor((2 - 1)/2) = floor(0.5) = 0, which doesn't match.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's more complex.

Let me consider that Nene can choose to play her Type B cards in a way that minimizes the number of Type B numbers where she plays before me.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers minus the number of Type C numbers.

But in the first test case, b=2, c=1, b - c =1, which matches the answer.

In the second test case, b=4, c=2, b - c =2, which matches the answer.

In the third test case, b=4, c=2, b - c =2, but the answer is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's min(b - c, 0).

No, in the first test case, min(2-1,0)=min(1,0)=0, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((b - c + 1)/2).

In the first test case, floor((2-1+1)/2)=floor(2/2)=1, which matches.

In the second test case, floor((4-2+1)/2)=floor(3/2)=1, but the answer is 2, which doesn't match.

No.

This isn't working.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider the number of Type B numbers and the number of turns each has.

Each player has n turns.

For Type C numbers, Nene will get points from them, and I can't do anything about it.

For Type B numbers, I can get a point if I play my card after Nene plays her card for that number.

So, for each Type B number, I need Nene to play her card before I play mine.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of Type B numbers where Nene plays before me.

Nene, on the other hand, wants to minimize that.

Given that, perhaps the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type B numbers minus the number of Type C numbers.

But in the first test case, b=2, c=1, b - c =1, which matches the answer.

In the second test case, b=4, c=2, b - c =2, which matches the answer.

In the third test case, b=4, c=2, b - c =2, but the answer is 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of (b - c) and something else.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of (b - c) and n - c.

Wait, in the third test case, b=4, c=2, b - c =2, n - c =6, min(2,6)=2, but the answer is 1, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait,
