Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to consider every possible subsegment of array a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for elements to match after rearrangement. Since rearrangement is allowed, it's about having at least k elements in common between the subsegment of a and array b, regardless of their positions.

Wait, but the problem says "match the elements of array b." Does that mean the values have to be the same, regardless of order? Yes, that seems to be the case. So, it's about having at least k elements in the subsegment that are present in array b.

But, looking back at the example, it seems a bit more nuanced. For instance, in the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

The subsegments of a of length 4 are:

[4,1,2,3] -> can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b with 4 matches, which is greater than k=2.

[1,2,3,4] -> already matches b with 4 matches.

[2,3,4,5] -> can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has 3 matches with b [1,2,3,4], so 3 >= 2.

[3,4,5,6] -> can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has 2 matches with b [1,2,3,4], so 2 >= 2.

So, all four subsegments are good.

In the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

[4,1,2,3] -> 4 matches, which is >=3

[1,2,3,4] -> 4 matches, >=3

[2,3,4,5] -> 3 matches, >=3

[3,4,5,6] -> 2 matches, which is <3

So, only the first three are good.

In the third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

Same a and b.

Subsegments:

[4,1,2,3] -> 4 matches, >=4

[1,2,3,4] -> 4 matches, >=4

[2,3,4,5] -> 3 matches, <4

[3,4,5,6] -> 2 matches, <4

So, only the first two are good.

From these examples, it seems that for each subsegment of length m in a, I need to count how many elements are present in b, regardless of order, and check if that count is at least k.

So, the problem reduces to, for each subsegment of a of length m, count the number of elements that are in b, and check if this count is >= k. If it is, then it's a good subsegment.

Now, to implement this efficiently, considering that n and m can be up to 2*10^5, and t (number of test cases) is up to 10^4, but with the sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5, same for m.

So, I need an efficient way to process each test case quickly.

First, I need to think about how to count, for each subsegment of a of length m, the number of elements that are present in b.

One way is to precompute for each position in a, how many of the last m elements are present in b.

To do this efficiently, I can use a sliding window approach.

I can iterate through a, maintaining a window of size m, and keep track of how many elements in the window are present in b.

To do this, I can use a frequency counter for b, and then as I slide the window, I add the new element and remove the oldest element, updating the count of matches accordingly.

Wait, but elements in b might be duplicates, so I need to handle frequencies properly.

So, I need to count the frequency of each element in b, and then, as I slide the window over a, keep track of how many elements in the window are in b, considering the frequencies.

Wait, but the problem allows rearrangement, so the order doesn't matter, and duplicates are considered only up to their frequency in b.

Wait, but in the example, b has duplicates allowed, but in the test cases provided, b doesn't have duplicates. I need to confirm if b can have duplicates.

Looking back at the problem statement: "Elements of the array b are not necessarily unique." So, b can have duplicates.

Similarly, a can have duplicates.

So, I need to handle frequencies properly.

Let me think about it.

I need to count, for each subsegment c of a of length m, the number of elements in c that are also in b, considering their frequencies.

Since rearrangement is allowed, it's about having at least k elements in c that are also in b, regardless of order.

So, I need to count the number of elements in c that are in b, with frequency counts.

This sounds like counting the number of common elements between c and b, considering frequencies.

In other words, it's the intersection of the two multisets c and b.

So, I need to compute the intersection size of c and b for each subsegment c of a of length m, and check if this size is >= k.

To compute the intersection size of two multisets, I can take the minimum frequency for each element present in both.

So, if I have frequency counters for c and b, the intersection size is the sum of the minimum of the frequencies for each element.

But in this problem, since we're dealing with counts, and we just need to know if this intersection size is >= k, we can keep track of the current intersection size as we slide the window.

So, I can precompute the frequency counter for b.

Then, for the first window of a, compute the intersection size with b.

Then, as I slide the window to the right, I remove the element that's leaving the window and add the new element entering the window, updating the intersection size accordingly.

Finally, for each window, check if the intersection size >= k, and count how many such windows exist.

This seems efficient, as it's O(n) per test case, and since the sum of n over all test cases is 2*10^5, it should be acceptable.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

Read n, m, k.

Read array a of n integers.

Read array b of m integers.

Then, compute the frequency counter for b.

Then, initialize a frequency counter for the first window of a of size m.

Compute the intersection size between this window and b.

If intersection size >= k, count it as good.

Then, slide the window to the right:

- When removing an element that was in the intersection, decrease the intersection size accordingly.

- When adding a new element, increase the intersection size accordingly.

Repeat until the end of a.

Finally, output the count of good windows.

I need to handle the frequency counts properly.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

Frequency counts:

b: 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1

First window: [4,1,2,3]

Counts in window: 4:1,1:1,2:1,3:1

Intersection: min(4:1,4:1) + min(1:1,1:1) + min(2:1,2:1) + min(3:1,3:1) = 1+1+1+1=4 >=2, good.

Next window: [1,2,3,4]

Counts: 1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1

Intersection: same as above, 4 >=2, good.

Next window: [2,3,4,5]

Counts: 2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1

Intersection: min(2:1,2:1) + min(3:1,3:1) + min(4:1,4:1) + min(5:1,0)=1+1+1+0=3 >=2, good.

Next window: [3,4,5,6]

Counts: 3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1

Intersection: min(3:1,3:1) + min(4:1,4:1) + min(5:1,0) + min(6:1,0)=1+1+0+0=2 >=2, good.

Total: 4 good windows.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

From above, intersection sizes were 4,4,3,2.

So, 4 >=3, 4 >=3, 3 >=3, 2 <3.

Total: 3 good windows.

Correct.

Third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

Intersection sizes: 4,4,3,2.

So, 4 >=4, 4 >=4, 3 <4, 2 <4.

Total: 2 good windows.

Correct.

Now, let's think about implementation.

I need to read t test cases.

For each test case:

Read n, m, k.

Read a as list of integers.

Read b as list of integers.

Compute frequency counter for b.

Then, for the first window of a of size m:

Compute frequency counter.

Compute intersection size as sum of min(count_a[e], count_b[e]) for each e in count_a.

If intersection size >= k, count as good.

Then, slide the window:

- When removing an element that was in the intersection, decrease intersection size by min(count_a[e], count_b[e]).

- Then decrease count_a[e] by 1.

- If count_a[e] becomes 0, remove it.

- When adding a new element, increase count_a[e] by 1.

- If e is in b, increase intersection size by min(count_a[e], count_b[e]).

- If e was already in count_a, but count_a[e] was less than count_b[e], then intersection size increases by 1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep separate counters.

Actually, to make it efficient, I can keep track of the current intersection size and update it as I slide the window.

Let me think differently.

Let me keep a counter for the window.

Initialize it with the first m elements.

Compute the intersection size.

Then, for each step:

- Remove the element that's leaving the window.

- Update the intersection size accordingly.

- Add the new element entering the window.

- Update the intersection size accordingly.

But to update efficiently, I need to know how much the intersection size changes when I remove or add an element.

When removing an element:

- If the element was in the intersection, decrease intersection size by min(count_a[e], count_b[e]).

- But need to handle frequencies properly.

Wait, maybe it's better to keep a set of elements that are in b, and keep track of how many times each such element appears in the current window, up to the frequency in b.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to use the sliding window approach with a frequency dictionary for b, and keep track of how many elements in the current window are in b, considering their frequencies.

Let me try to think in terms of counters.

Let me use collections.Counter in Python.

Compute counter for b.

Then, for the first window, compute counter for the first m elements in a.

Compute intersection as sum of min(count_a[e], count_b[e]) for all e in count_a.

If this sum >= k, count as good.

Then, for each step:

- Remove the element that's leaving the window from count_a.

- Update the intersection size: if the element was in b, and count_a[e] <= count_b[e], then intersection size decreases by 1.

- Add the new element entering the window to count_a.

- Update the intersection size: if the element is in b, and count_a[e] <= count_b[e], then intersection size increases by 1.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me formalize it.

Initialize:

count_b = Counter(b)

count_a = Counter(a[:m])

intersection = sum(min(count_a[e], count_b[e]) for e in count_a)

if intersection >= k, fnd = 1 else 0

Then, for each step from m to n-1:

- Element leaving the window: a[i - m]

- If a[i - m] in b:

- If count_a[a[i - m]] <= count_b[a[i - m]], then intersection -= 1

- count_a[a[i - m]] -= 1

- If count_a[a[i - m]] == 0, del count_a[a[i - m]]

- Element entering the window: a[i]

- count_a[a[i]] += 1

- If a[i] in b and count_a[a[i]] <= count_b[a[i]], then intersection += 1

- If intersection >= k, fnd += 1

Finally, print fnd.

Wait, but this might not handle frequencies correctly.

Wait, in the first test case, for example, when sliding from [4,1,2,3] to [1,2,3,4], the intersection size remains 4.

But according to this approach, when removing 4 and adding 4, intersection should remain the same.

Similarly, when sliding from [1,2,3,4] to [2,3,4,5], removing 1 and adding 5.

Since 1 is in b and count_a[1] was 1 <= count_b[1]=1, so intersection -=1.

Then adding 5, which is in b, and count_a[5]=1 <= count_b[5]=0, so intersection doesn't increase.

Wait, but count_b[5]=0, since 5 is not in b.

Wait, in the first test case, b is [1,2,3,4], so count_b={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}.

So, when adding 5, which is not in b, intersection doesn't change.

Similarly, when removing 1, which is in b and count_a[1]=1 <= count_b[1]=1, so intersection -=1.

But in reality, the intersection size should be 3, which is still >=2.

Wait, but in the first window [1,2,3,4], intersection=4.

Then, removing 1 and adding 5: intersection should be 3 (2,3,4), which is still >=2.

So, according to this approach, intersection -=1 when removing 1, so intersection=3.

Then, adding 5, which is not in b, so intersection remains 3.

So, it's correct.

Similarly, in the next step, removing 2 and adding 6:

Removing 2, which is in b, and count_a[2]=1 <= count_b[2]=1, so intersection -=1 to 2.

Adding 6, which is not in b, so intersection remains 2, which is >=2.

So, it's still good.

Wait, but in the first test case, all four subsegments are good, but according to this, the first three have intersection >=2, and the last one has intersection=2, which is still >=2.

Wait, in the first test case, the last subsegment [3,4,5,6] has intersection=2, which is >=2.

So, it's correct.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

First window [4,1,2,3], intersection=4.

Second window [1,2,3,4], intersection=4.

Third window [2,3,4,5], intersection=3.

Fourth window [3,4,5,6], intersection=2 <3.

So, only first three are good.

According to the approach:

Start with intersection=4.

Remove 4, which is in b, count_a[4]=1 <= count_b[4]=1, so intersection -=1 to 3.

Add 5, which is not in b, so intersection remains 3.

Good.

Next step:

Remove 1, which is in b, count_a[1]=1 <= count_b[1]=1, so intersection -=1 to 2.

Add 6, which is not in b, so intersection remains 2.

Which is <3, not good.

So, it matches.

Seems correct.

Therefore, this approach should work.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to be careful with the frequency counts.

I need to use integer types for counts.

Also, need to handle cases where elements are not in b.

Also, need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Also, since a and b can have large n and m, need to make sure that the program is efficient.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases is <= 2e5, and same for m, it should be fine.

I should use fast input methods, but in Python, reading from stdin is okay.

Also, using collections.Counter is efficient enough.

I need to make sure that I reset the counters for each test case.

Also, need to be careful with the indices when sliding the window.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

nabors = int(input())

for _ in range(nabors):

(n, m, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]

bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]

cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])

cnt_bb = Counter(bb)

D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb

pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())

E = cnt_aa - D

C = cnt_bb - D

fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0

for (in_aa, out_aa) in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):

if D[out_aa] > 0:

if E[out_aa] > 0:

E[out_aa] -= 1

else:

D[out_aa] -= 1

pairs_in_D -= 1

C[out_aa] += 1

else:

E[out_aa] -= 1

if C[in_aa] > 0:

D[in_aa] += 1

pairs_in_D += 1

C[in_aa] -= 1

else:

E[in_aa] += 1

fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0

print(fnd)

So, it's reading t (nabors), then for each test case, reading n, m, k, then array a (aa), and array b (bb).

It's reading aa and bb as lists of strings, which is okay since we're dealing with integers, but converting them to strings might not be necessary. But in Python, Counter works with strings or integers.

Then, it computes cnt_aa as Counter of the first m elements of aa.

cnt_bb as Counter of bb.

Then, D is the intersection of cnt_aa and cnt_bb, which is correct.

pairs_in_D is the sum of D.values(), which is the intersection size.

Then, E is cnt_aa - D, which is the elements in aa that are not in b or have higher frequency in aa than in b.

C is cnt_bb - D, which is the elements in b that are not in aa or have higher frequency in b than in aa.

Then, fnd is initialized to 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0, which makes sense for the first window.

Then, it slides the window by iterating over zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]), which gives the elements entering and leaving the window.

For each step:

- If D[out_aa] > 0:

- If E[out_aa] > 0:

E[out_aa] -= 1

- Else:

D[out_aa] -= 1

pairs_in_D -= 1

C[out_aa] += 1

- Else:

E[out_aa] -= 1

- If C[in_aa] > 0:

D[in_aa] += 1

pairs_in_D += 1

C[in_aa] -= 1

- Else:

E[in_aa] += 1

- fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0

This seems to be handling the frequency updates correctly.

D represents the intersection counts.

E represents the counts in aa that are not in b or exceed b's counts.

C represents the counts in b that are not in aa or exceed aa's counts.

When removing out_aa:

- If out_aa is in D (i.e., its count in aa is <= b's count), then:

- If E[out_aa] > 0, it means that out_aa was in aa but exceeding b's count, so just decrease E.

- Else, decrease D and pairs_in_D, and increase C.

- Else, out_aa is in E, so decrease E.

When adding in_aa:

- If C[in_aa] > 0, it means that b has some unused counts of in_aa, so increase D and pairs_in_D, and decrease C.

- Else, increase E.

Then, check if pairs_in_D >= k and increment fnd accordingly.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cnt_aa = Counter({'4':1, '1':1, '2':1, '3':1})

cnt_bb = Counter({'1':1, '2':1, '3':1, '4':1})

D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb = Counter({'4':1, '1':1, '2':1, '3':1})

pairs_in_D = 4

E = cnt_aa - D = Counter()

C = cnt_bb - D = Counter()

fnd = 1

Then, sliding window:

First step: in_aa='4', out_aa='4'

- D[out_aa]=1 > 0

- E[out_aa]=0, so D[out_aa]-=1, pairs_in_D-=1, C[out_aa]+=1

- D['4']=0

- pairs_in_D=3

- C['4']=1

- in_aa='4'

- C['4']=1 > 0, so D['4']+=1, pairs_in_D+=1, C['4']-=1

- D['4']=1

- pairs_in_D=4

- C['4']=0

- fnd +=1 (now 2)

Second step: in_aa='5', out_aa='1'

- D[out_aa]=1 > 0

- E[out_aa]=0, so D[out_aa]-=1, pairs_in_D-=1, C[out_aa]+=1

- D['1']=0

- pairs_in_D=3

- C['1']=1

- in_aa='5'

- C['5']=0, so E['5']+=1

- fnd +=1 (now 3)

Third step: in_aa='6', out_aa='2'

- D[out_aa]=1 > 0

- E[out_aa]=0, so D[out_aa]-=1, pairs_in_D-=1, C[out_aa]+=1

- D['2']=0

- pairs_in_D=2

- C['2']=1

- in_aa='6'

- C['6']=0, so E['6']+=1

- fnd +=1 (now 4)

So, total fnd=4, which matches the first test case.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

Initial window: D={'4':1,'1':1,'2':1,'3':1}, pairs_in_D=4

fnd=1

First step: in_aa='4', out_aa='4'

- D[out_aa]=1 > 0

- E[out_aa]=0, so D[out_aa]-=1, pairs_in_D-=1, C[out_aa]+=1

- D['4']=0

- pairs_in_D=3

- C['4']=1

- in_aa='4'

- C['4']=1 > 0, so D['4']+=1, pairs_in_D+=1, C['4']-=1

- D['4']=1

- pairs_in_D=4

- C['4']=0

- fnd +=1 (now 2)

Second step: in_aa='5', out_aa='1'

- D[out_aa]=1 > 0

- E[out_aa]=0, so D[out_aa]-=1, pairs_in_D-=1, C[out_aa]+=1

- D['1']=0

- pairs_in_D=3

- C['1']=1

- in_aa='5'

- C['5']=0, so E['5']+=1

- fnd +=1 (now 3)

Third step: in_aa='6', out_aa='2'

- D[out_aa]=1 > 0

- E[out_aa]=0, so D[out_aa]-=1, pairs_in_D-=1, C[out_aa]+=1

- D['2']=0

- pairs_in_D=2

- C['2']=1

- in_aa='6'

- C['6']=0, so E['6']+=1

- fnd +=0 (still 3)

Matches the second test case.

So, the program seems to be implementing the correct logic.

I don't see any errors in the approach or the implementation.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
