Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, there's a number n indicating the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a is the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and x is the value associated with that constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to first determine the range of k based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then subtract the numbers within that range that are excluded by the constraints of type 3.

So, for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among them because k needs to be greater than or equal to all of them. Similarly, for constraints of type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among them because k needs to be less than or equal to all of them.

Then, the possible values of k are between the maximum of type 1 and the minimum of type 2.

After that, I need to account for the constraints of type 3 (k != x), which means I have to exclude specific values within that range.

Wait, but the problem says that no two constraints are the same, so each constraint of type 3 will exclude a unique value.

Also, it's guaranteed that the range is finite, so the maximum of type 1 will be less than or equal to the minimum of type 2.

Wait, no. Actually, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, but it's possible that the maximum of type 1 is greater than the minimum of type 2, which would make the range empty. In that case, there are no possible k's.

So, first, I need to collect all the constraints of type 1 and find the maximum x among them. Let's call this bx (bottom x).

Similarly, collect all constraints of type 2 and find the minimum x among them. Let's call this ax (top x).

If bx > ax, then there are no possible k's because the range is empty.

Otherwise, the number of possible k's is ax - bx + 1, minus the number of constraints of type 3 that fall within this range.

Wait, but constraints of type 3 exclude specific values, but only if those values are within the range [bx, ax].

So, I need to collect all the x's from constraints of type 3 and see which ones fall within [bx, ax], and then subtract those from the total range.

But in the code provided, it seems to be doing something similar.

Let me look at the code.

The function reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads n, the number of constraints.

Then, it initializes a set cx to store the x values of constraints of type 3.

It also initializes ax to a large number (1000000000 + 7) and bx to -1.

Then, for each of the n constraints, it reads a and x.

If a == 1, it's k >= x, so it sets bx to the maximum of current bx and x.

If a == 2, it's k <= x, so it sets ax to the minimum of current ax and x.

If a == 3, it's k != x, so it adds x to the set cx.

After processing all constraints, it checks if bx >= ax. If so, it means the range is empty, so it appends 0 to the result list.

Otherwise, it counts how many values in cx are within the range [bx, ax], and subtracts that from the total number of integers in the range, which is ax - bx + 1.

Finally, it prints all the results for each test case.

Let me check if this logic is correct.

First, finding bx as the maximum of all x where a == 1 makes sense because k needs to be >= all of them.

Similarly, finding ax as the minimum of all x where a == 2 makes sense because k needs to be <= all of them.

Then, if bx > ax, the range is empty, so 0 is correct.

Otherwise, the total number of possible k's is ax - bx + 1.

Then, for constraints of type 3, we need to exclude the x's that are in the range [bx, ax].

So, counting how many x's in cx are within [bx, ax] and subtracting that from the total is correct.

Also, since it's guaranteed that no two constraints are the same, and that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, we don't have to worry about duplicates or invalid cases.

Let me consider the first example:

Input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

Output:

7

So, n=4

Constraints:

1. k >= 3

2. k <= 10

3. k != 1

4. k != 5

So, bx = max(3) = 3

ax = min(10) = 10

cx = {1,5}

Now, check if bx >= ax: 3 < 10, so not 0.

Then, count how many x in cx are within [3,10]: 5 is within [3,10], but 1 is not.

So, tmp = 1

Then, total k's = 10 - 3 + 1 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another sample:

2

1 5

2 4

Output:

0

Here, n=2

Constraints:

1. k >= 5

2. k <= 4

So, bx = 5

ax = 4

bx >= ax (5 >= 4), so output 0.

Correct.

Another sample:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

Output:

90

Let's see:

n=10

Constraints:

3. k != 6

3. k != 7

1. k >= 2

1. k >= 7

3. k != 100

3. k != 44

2. k <= 100

2. k <= 98

1. k >= 3

3. k != 99

So, bx = max(2,7,3) = 7

ax = min(100,98) = 98

cx = {6,7,100,44,99}

Now, which x in cx are within [7,98]: 7,44,99 (but 99 is >98, so only 7 and 44)

So, tmp = 2

Total k's = 98 - 7 + 1 - 2 = 92 - 2 = 90, which matches the sample output.

Great.

Now, looking at the code, it seems to implement this logic correctly.

It uses a set to store cx, which ensures uniqueness, and iterates through the constraints to find bx, ax, and cx.

Then, it checks if bx >= ax, and if so, outputs 0.

Otherwise, it counts the number of x in cx within [bx, ax] and subtracts that from ax - bx + 1.

Seems correct.

But I should think about possible edge cases.

Edge case 1: bx == ax

If bx == ax, then there's only one possible k, which is bx.

But if cx contains bx, then k != bx, so no possible k's.

Else, one possible k.

Looking at the code, if bx == ax, and bx is in cx, then tmp = 1, so ax - bx + 1 - tmp = 1 - 1 = 0.

If bx is not in cx, then tmp = 0, so 1 - 0 = 1.

Correct.

Edge case 2: bx < ax, but all k's in the range are excluded by cx.

For example:

n=3

1 1

2 3

3 1

3 2

3 3

So, bx = 1

ax = 3

cx = {1,2,3}

All k's in [1,3] are excluded, so answer should be 0.

Looking at the code, tmp = 3 (since 1,2,3 are all in [1,3]), so 3 - 3 + 1 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.

Wait, 3 - 1 + 1 - 3 = 3 - 3 = 0.

Yes, correct.

Edge case 3: bx < ax, but none of the k's in the range are excluded.

n=2

1 1

2 3

So, bx = 1

ax = 3

cx = {}

So, total k's = 3 - 1 + 1 = 3.

Correct.

Edge case 4: Large range with many exclusions.

n=6

1 5

2 10

3 5

3 6

3 7

3 8

3 9

3 10

So, bx = 5

ax = 10

cx = {5,6,7,8,9,10}

All k's in [5,10] are excluded, so answer should be 0.

Looking at the code, tmp = 6

10 - 5 + 1 = 6

6 - 6 = 0.

Correct.

Edge case 5: bx < ax, some k's excluded.

n=4

1 1

2 5

3 3

So, bx = 1

ax = 5

cx = {3}

tmp = 1

Total k's = 5 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4.

Correct, since k can be 1,2,4,5.

Seems like the code handles these cases correctly.

Also, the code uses a set for cx, which ensures that x's are unique, as per the problem's guarantee.

Time constraints: n can be up to 100, t up to 500, so total operations are acceptable.

Space constraints: Storing cx as a set is fine.

I think the code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
