Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have n mushrooms, each with a magic power v_i. Kirill wants to pick some mushrooms to make an elixir. The strength of the elixir is the product of the number of mushrooms picked and the minimum magic power among those mushrooms. So, if he picks k mushrooms, and the smallest among them has magic power m, then the strength is k * m.

But there's a catch. There's a permutation p of numbers from 1 to n, and if Kirill picks k mushrooms, then the magic power of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} becomes 0. He doesn't use mushrooms with zero magic power for the elixir.

So, I need to help Kirill pick mushrooms in such a way that he maximizes the elixir strength, and among all options that give the maximum strength, choose the one with the minimum number of mushrooms.

First, I need to understand the impact of the permutation p. The permutation determines which mushrooms have their magic power zeroed out based on how many mushrooms Kirill picks.

Let's consider that Kirill picks k mushrooms. Then, the mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero. So, the mushrooms he actually uses for the elixir are the k mushrooms he picks, minus any that have been zeroed out.

Wait, but the problem says: "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir." So, even if he picks a mushroom that has been zeroed out, he won't use it in the elixir.

Wait, but the zeroing out happens based on the positions in the permutation, not based on which mushrooms he picks. So, if he picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 positions in the permutation have their magic power set to zero, and he doesn't use those in the elixir.

But, the mushrooms he picks might include some of those first k-1 positions. So, he picks k mushrooms, but some of them might have been zeroed out by the permutation, and those won't be used in the elixir.

Wait, no. The zeroing out happens based on the positions in the permutation, not based on which mushrooms he picks. So, regardless of which mushrooms he picks, the first k-1 positions in the permutation have their magic power set to zero.

But, he picks k mushrooms, and among those k, some might correspond to positions that have been zeroed out. So, the actual mushrooms he uses are the ones he picks, excluding those whose positions have been zeroed out.

Wait, but the problem says: "The magic power of all mushrooms in positions p_1 through p_{k-1} will become 0." So, regardless of which mushrooms he picks, the mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

But, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and he can pick any k mushrooms, in any order. But the zeroing out depends on k and the permutation p.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe I need to consider that for each possible k, from 1 to n, I can compute the strength of the elixir if Kirill picks k mushrooms, considering that the first k-1 positions in the permutation have their magic power set to zero.

So, for a given k, I need to:

1. Set the magic power of mushrooms at positions p_1 through p_{k-1} to zero.

2. Pick k mushrooms from the remaining non-zero magic power mushrooms.

3. Compute the strength as k multiplied by the minimum magic power among the picked mushrooms.

4. Choose the option that maximizes this strength, and among those, choose the smallest k.

Wait, but Kirill picks k mushrooms, and the first k-1 positions in the permutation have their magic power set to zero, regardless of which mushrooms he picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the zeroing out happens before he picks the mushrooms. So, for a given k, positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero, and then Kirill picks k mushrooms from the remaining non-zero magic power mushrooms.

But, he can pick any k mushrooms, including those whose magic power has been set to zero, but he won't use them in the elixir.

Wait, no, the problem says: "Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir." So, he can pick them, but he won't use them.

So, perhaps it's better to think that, for a given k, positions p_1 through p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero, and then Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, some may have been zeroed out, and he won't use those in the elixir.

Wait, but the elixir is made from the mushrooms he picks, excluding those whose magic power has been set to zero.

So, the strength is k multiplied by the minimum magic power among the picked mushrooms that haven't been zeroed out.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe another approach.

Let's consider that for a given k, some mushrooms have their magic power set to zero based on the permutation p.

Specifically, if Kirill picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 positions in p have their magic power set to zero.

So, for a given k, positions p_1 through p_{k-1} are zeroed out.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, some may have been zeroed out.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible k and compute the strength accordingly.

Wait, maybe it's easier to iterate over the number of mushrooms picked, k, from 1 to n, and for each k, determine the set of mushrooms that are zeroed out (positions p_1 to p_{k-1}), and then pick k mushrooms, excluding those that are zeroed out, and find the minimum magic power among the picked mushrooms.

Wait, but he can pick any k mushrooms, regardless of whether they are zeroed out or not, but he won't use the zeroed out ones in the elixir.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of inclusion or exclusion.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let S be the set of mushrooms picked by Kirill, with |S| = k.

- Let Z_k be the set of positions p_1 to p_{k-1}, which are zeroed out.

- The elixir is made from S \ Z_k, i.e., the mushrooms in S that are not in Z_k.

- The strength is |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

Our goal is to maximize this strength over all possible S and k.

This seems complicated because S and Z_k are interdependent.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently.

Let’s fix the set S of k mushrooms.

Then, Z_k corresponds to p_1 to p_{k-1}.

But p is a permutation of positions, so p_i corresponds to the position of the i-th picked mushroom.

Wait, but actually, p is a given permutation, and k is the number of mushrooms picked.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the order in which Kirill picks the mushrooms.

Wait, but the problem says: "Kirill can gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of mushrooms."

So, I need to choose k and S such that the strength is maximized, and among those, choose the smallest k.

Wait, but the permutation p is fixed, and determines which mushrooms are zeroed out based on k.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over k from 1 to n, and for each k:

- Set Z_k = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}}

- For each S of size k, compute the strength as |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i

- Find the maximum strength for that k

Then, choose the k that gives the maximum strength, and among those, choose the smallest k.

But iterating over k and over all possible S for each k is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix k, and I want to pick k mushrooms, with the first k-1 positions in p being zeroed out.

Wait, but p is a permutation of positions, so p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions of mushrooms whose magic power is set to zero if Kirill picks k mushrooms.

So, for a given k, the positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, some may include positions from p_1 to p_{k-1}, which have zero magic power.

He won't use those in the elixir.

So, the elixir is made from the mushrooms in S \ Z_k, where S is the set of picked mushrooms, and Z_k is p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, the strength is |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

I need to maximize this over all S of size k, for all k from 1 to n.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the positions that are not zeroed out.

For a given k, the positions p_k to p_n have their magic power unchanged.

So, positions p_k to p_n are the ones that are not zeroed out when k mushrooms are picked.

Wait, but p is a permutation of positions, and k is the number of mushrooms picked.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for k mushrooms picked, positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out, and positions p_k to p_n are not zeroed out.

So, when Kirill picks k mushrooms, the positions p_k to p_n retain their original magic power, while positions p_1 to p_{k-1} have their magic power set to zero.

Then, the elixir is made from the picked mushrooms that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, i.e., those in p_k to p_n.

Wait, but Kirill picks k mushrooms, which can be any k mushrooms, not necessarily the ones from p_k to p_n.

Wait, but the zeroing out happens based on p_1 to p_{k-1}, regardless of which k mushrooms he picks.

So, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, some may be in p_1 to p_{k-1}, which have their magic power set to zero.

So, the elixir is made from the mushrooms in S \ Z_k, where Z_k = p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the positions that are not zeroed out.

Let me consider that for a given k, Z_k = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k-1}}

Then, the mushrooms that can be used in the elixir are those not in Z_k.

Wait, but Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, the ones not in Z_k have their original magic power.

So, the elixir is made from S \ Z_k, and the strength is |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible k and compute the maximum possible strength for that k, then choose the k that gives the maximum strength, and among those, choose the smallest k.

But I need a way to compute, for each k, the maximum strength achievable.

But this seems time-consuming for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me try to think about the optimal selection.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

Let’s denote the sorted list as v_{(1)} >= v_{(2)} >= ... >= v_{(n)}.

Now, suppose I pick the top m mushrooms with the highest magic power, i.e., v_{(1)} to v_{(m)}.

Then, the strength would be m * v_{(m)}.

But in this problem, due to the permutation p, some mushrooms may have their magic power zeroed out, depending on k.

So, I need to consider that.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of choosing a certain number of high-power mushrooms and ensuring that their positions are not among the first k-1 in the permutation.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the positions in the permutation.

Let’s consider that the permutation p defines the order in which mushrooms are zeroed out.

Wait, but it's not exactly that.

Wait, for a given k, the first k-1 positions in p have their magic power set to zero.

So, for a given k, positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, the ones that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} have their original magic power.

So, to maximize the strength, I need to maximize |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible m, and for each m, find the smallest k such that m mushrooms with the highest magic power are not zeroed out.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix m, the number of mushrooms with non-zero magic power that I want to include in the elixir.

Then, I need to choose m mushrooms with the highest magic power, and ensure that their positions are not among the first k-1 in the permutation.

Wait, but k is the number of mushrooms picked, which includes both zeroed out and non-zeroed out mushrooms.

This is getting messy.

Maybe I need to iterate over possible k and compute the best m for each k.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over k from 1 to n, and for each k, find the maximum possible min_value among the k picked mushrooms that are not zeroed out.

Then, the strength would be k * min_value.

But I need to maximize this over k.

Wait, but it's not straightforward.

Let me try to consider that for a given k, the positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out.

So, the mushrooms that can be used in the elixir are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for a given k, the available mushrooms are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, but only the ones that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} are used in the elixir.

Wait, but he can pick any k mushrooms, including those in p_1 to p_{k-1}, but those will be zeroed out and not used in the elixir.

So, for a given k, the maximum strength is achieved by picking the k mushrooms with the highest magic power among those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, but he can't necessarily pick those, because some of them might be in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, no, the available mushrooms are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for a given k, the available mushrooms are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms from all n mushrooms, but only the ones among those k that are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} are used in the elixir.

Wait, but p is a permutation of positions, not values.

Wait, perhaps I need to map positions to mushroom indices.

Let’s assume that p is a permutation of indices from 1 to n, corresponding to the positions of the mushrooms.

So, p_1 to p_{k-1} are positions of mushrooms whose magic power is set to zero when k mushrooms are picked.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, the ones not in p_1 to p_{k-1} have their original magic power.

So, the elixir is made from the mushrooms in S \ Z_k, where S is the set of picked mushrooms, and Z_k is p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, the strength is |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

I need to maximize this over all possible S and k.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over possible m, the number of mushrooms used in the elixir, and find the minimal k that allows for that m, and then maximize m * minimal_v among those m mushrooms.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that for a given m, I want to pick m mushrooms with the highest magic power, and find the minimal k such that those m mushrooms are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps.

Let’s think about it.

Suppose I have the m mushrooms with the highest magic power.

I need to ensure that when I pick k mushrooms, the positions p_1 to p_{k-1} do not include these m mushrooms.

Wait, actually, I need to ensure that these m mushrooms are not among the first k-1 positions in p.

So, the positions of these m mushrooms in p should be at least k.

Which means that p_{k} to p_{n} include these m mushrooms.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have m mushrooms that I want to include in the elixir, I need to make sure that their positions are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, for each of these m mushrooms, their positions should be >= k.

In other words, for each of these m mushrooms, p^{-1}(position) >= k, where p^{-1} is the inverse permutation.

Wait, p is a permutation of positions, so p_i is the position of the i-th element in the original list.

Wait, no, p is a permutation from 1 to n, but I need to clarify what p represents.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"As soon as everyone in the camp fell asleep, Kirill sneaked out of the tent and went to the Wise Oak to gather mushrooms.

It is known that there are n mushrooms growing under the Oak, each of which has magic power v_i. Kirill really wants to make a magical elixir of maximum strength from the mushrooms.

The strength of the elixir is equal to the product of the number of mushrooms in it and the minimum magic power among these mushrooms. To prepare the elixir, Kirill will sequentially pick one mushroom growing under the Oak. Kirill can gather mushrooms in any order.

However, it's not that simple. The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation p from 1 to n. If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k - 1} will become 0. Kirill will not use mushrooms with zero magic power to prepare the elixir.

Your task is to help Kirill gather mushrooms in such a way that he can brew the elixir of maximum possible strength. However, Kirill is a little scared to stay near the oak for too long, so out of all the suitable options for gathering mushrooms, he asks you to find the one with the minimum number of mushrooms."

So, p is a permutation of indices from 1 to n, representing the order in which the mushrooms are considered for zeroing out.

If Kirill picks k mushrooms, then the first k-1 positions in p have their magic power set to zero.

So, positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out when k mushrooms are picked.

Then, the elixir is made from the k picked mushrooms, excluding those whose positions are zeroed out.

Wait, but Kirill can pick any k mushrooms, not necessarily in any particular order.

But the zeroing out depends on k and p.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for a given k, positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out, and then Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, the ones whose positions are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} are used in the elixir.

So, for a given k, the available mushrooms for the elixir are those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, only those not in p_1 to p_{k-1} are used in the elixir.

Wait, but he can pick k mushrooms, some of which may be in p_1 to p_{k-1}, which are zeroed out and not used in the elixir.

So, the elixir is made from the mushrooms in S \ Z_k, where S is the set of picked mushrooms and Z_k is p_1 to p_{k-1}.

So, the strength is |S \ Z_k| * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

I need to maximize this over all S and k.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can iterate over possible k and compute the maximum possible strength for that k, then choose the k that gives the maximum strength, and among those, choose the smallest k.

But for each k, how do I compute the maximum possible strength?

Given that positions p_1 to p_{k-1} are zeroed out, and Kirill picks k mushrooms, using only those not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, the strength is the number of picked mushrooms not in p_1 to p_{k-1} multiplied by the minimum magic power among them.

Wait, but Kirill picks k mushrooms, and some of them may be in p_1 to p_{k-1}, which are zeroed out and not used in the elixir.

So, the elixir is made from the mushrooms in S \ Z_k, where |S \ Z_k| can range from 0 to k.

Wait, but I need to maximize k * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i.

Wait, but |S \ Z_k| can be less than k.

Wait, no, |S \ Z_k| is the number of mushrooms in S that are not in Z_k.

So, |S \ Z_k| can be from 0 to k.

But the strength is k * min_{i in S \ Z_k} v_i, where min is over the mushrooms in S \ Z_k.

Wait, but if |S \ Z_k| = 0, then there is no minimum, so perhaps strength is 0 in that case.

But in that case, strength is 0.

So, to maximize strength, we need to maximize k * min_v, where min_v is the smallest magic power among the mushrooms in S \ Z_k.

This seems tricky to maximize directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of choosing a certain number of mushrooms and ensuring that their positions are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible min_v and find the maximum k that allows for that min_v.

Wait, but min_v is the smallest magic power among the mushrooms used in the elixir.

Wait, maybe I can iterate over possible min_v and find the maximum k such that there are at least k mushrooms with magic power >= min_v, and among those, at least m mushrooms are not in p_1 to p_{k-1}, where m is the number of mushrooms used in the elixir.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I sort the mushrooms in decreasing order of their magic power.

Let’s denote the sorted list as v_{(1)} >= v_{(2)} >= ... >= v_{(n)}.

Now, suppose I pick the top m mushrooms with the highest magic power, i.e., v_{(1)} to v_{(m)}.

Then, the strength would be m * v_{(m)}.

But in this problem, some mushrooms may have their magic power zeroed out based on k.

So, I need to ensure that these m mushrooms are not among the first k-1 positions in p.

Wait, for a given m, I need to choose m mushrooms with the highest magic power, and find the minimal k such that their positions are not among p_1 to p_{k-1}.

In other words, for these m mushrooms, their positions should be among p_k to p_n.

So, the minimal k is the minimal position among p^{-1}(position) for these m mushrooms.

Wait, p is a permutation of positions, so p_i is the position of the i-th element in the original list.

Wait, no, p is a permutation from 1 to n, representing the order in which positions are zeroed out.

Wait, the problem says: "The Wise Oak informed Kirill of a permutation p from 1 to n. If Kirill picks only k mushrooms, then the magic power of all mushrooms with indices p_1, p_2, ..., p_{k - 1} will become 0."

So, p is a permutation of positions from 1 to n.

So, p_1 to p_{k-1} are the positions that are zeroed out when k mushrooms are picked.

Then, the positions p_k to p_n are not zeroed out.

So, for a given k, positions p_k to p_n are not zeroed out.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, only those whose positions are not in p_1 to p_{k-1} are used in the elixir.

So, the elixir is made from the intersection of the picked mushrooms and the not-zeroed-out positions.

Wait, but the picked mushrooms can include positions from p_1 to p_{k-1}, which are zeroed out and not used in the elixir.

So, to maximize the strength, I need to maximize the number of picked mushrooms that are not zeroed out, multiplied by the smallest magic power among those mushrooms.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider that for a given k, the not-zeroed-out positions are p_k to p_n.

So, the available mushrooms for the elixir are those in positions p_k to p_n.

Then, Kirill picks k mushrooms, and among those k, only those in
