Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has a binary square grid of n by n cells, and on this grid, there's either a triangle or a square drawn with '1's. I need to determine which shape is drawn based on the grid provided.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a triangle and a square in this context.

For a triangle:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), where each row has 2*i - 1 '1's, and these '1's are centered in one column.

- So, for k=2, the first row has 1 '1', and the second row has 3 '1's, all aligned in the center.

- Similarly, for k=3, rows have 1, 3, 5 '1's, and so on.

- There's also an "upside-down" triangle, which I assume means the triangle can be flipped, but it's still a triangle.

For a square:

- It's made up of k rows (k > 1), each with exactly k '1's, and these '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.

- So, it's a perfect square block of '1's, aligned to the left or right, but according to the description, they are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge, so likely aligned to the left.

Given that, I need to look at the grid and determine if the '1's form a square or a triangle.

Looking at the provided code:

```python

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for i in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        a = 0

        b = ''

        for j in range(n):

            s = input()

            if s.count('1') == 1:

                a = 'TRIANGLE'

            elif s.count('1') > 1:

                b = 'SQUARE'

        if a != 0:

            print(a)

        else:

            print(b)

```

Hmm, this seems too simplistic. Let's see what it's doing.

It reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- Reads n, the size of the grid.

- Initializes a to 0 and b to an empty string.

- Reads each row of the grid.

- For each row, counts the number of '1's.

- If a row has exactly one '1', sets a to 'TRIANGLE'.

- If a row has more than one '1', sets b to 'SQUARE'.

- After processing all rows, if a is not zero, prints 'TRIANGLE'; else, prints 'SQUARE'.

This seems to be making a decision based solely on whether there's any row with exactly one '1'. If there is, it's a triangle; otherwise, it's a square.

But is this sufficient?

Looking back at the problem:

- A triangle can have rows with varying numbers of '1's, starting from one '1' and increasing by two each row, or decreasing.

- A square has every row with the same number of '1's, specifically k '1's in each of the k rows.

So, in the triangle case, there will be rows with exactly one '1', which doesn't necessarily hold for the square.

Wait, but in the square description, it says "the i-th row has k consecutive characters '1'", so every row in the square has exactly k '1's.

In the triangle, rows have increasing or decreasing odd numbers of '1's, centered in one column.

So, if there's any row with exactly one '1', it's likely a triangle.

But, in the square case, every row has more than one '1' (since k > 1).

Therefore, if any row has exactly one '1', it's a triangle; otherwise, it's a square.

This seems to be the logic implemented in the code.

Let me verify this with the sample input and output.

Let's analyze the first test case:

n=3

Grid:

000

011

011

In this grid, the rows have 0 '1's, then 2 '1's, then 2 '1's.

Since no row has exactly one '1', according to the code, it should be a square, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=4

Grid:

0000

0000

0100

1110

Rows have 0, 0, 1, 3 '1's.

Since there's a row with exactly one '1', it's a triangle, matching the sample output.

Third test case:

n=2

Grid:

11

11

Rows have 2, 2 '1's.

No row with exactly one '1', so it's a square.

Fourth test case:

n=5

Grid:

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000

Rows have 3, 1, 0, 0, 0 '1's.

There's a row with exactly one '1', so it's a triangle.

Fifth test case:

n=10

Grid:

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

0000000000

1111111110

0111111100

0011111000

0001110000

0000100000

Rows have 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 '1's.

No row with exactly one '1', so it's a square. Wait, but the sample output says TRIANGLE.

Wait, this is test case 5, and the sample output for test case 5 is TRIANGLE.

But according to the code, it should print 'SQUARE' because there's no row with exactly one '1'.

This seems to be a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back:

n=10

Rows:

0000000000 → 0 '1's

0000000000 → 0 '1's

0000000000 → 0 '1's

0000000000 → 0 '1's

0000000000 → 0 '1's

1111111110 → 9 '1's

0111111100 → 8 '1's

0011111000 → 7 '1's

0001110000 → 6 '1's

0000100000 → 5 '1's

So, no row has exactly one '1'. According to the code, it should print 'SQUARE', but the sample output says 'TRIANGLE'.

This suggests that the code is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstanding the shape.

Looking at the grid:

Rows 1 to 5: all 0's

Rows 6 to 10: 9,8,7,6,5 '1's, decreasing by one each row.

This looks like a triangle: starting with 9 '1's and decreasing by one each row, which fits the triangle definition.

But according to the code, since there's no row with exactly one '1', it would print 'SQUARE', which contradicts the sample output 'TRIANGLE'.

Therefore, the code is incorrect in this case.

So, the code's logic is flawed.

It seems that the code assumes that if there's any row with exactly one '1', it's a triangle, else it's a square.

But in reality, triangles can have rows with more than one '1', and squares have multiple rows with the same number of '1's.

But the code doesn't account for the pattern of '1's in the rows, only the count per row.

This is insufficient to correctly identify the shape in all cases, as shown by test case 5.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
