Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before all the '1's. Like, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

Now, the operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing all other characters one position to the right. For example, if I have "101", a cyclic shift would turn it into "110". Each time I do this, there's a cost equal to the length of the substring I'm shifting.

I need to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted. So, I need to figure out the sequence of shifts that will result in a sorted string with the least possible sum of substring lengths shifted.

First, I need to understand what operations can achieve the sorting. Since I can perform any number of operations on any substring, I need to find an efficient way to move '0's to the front and '1's to the back.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5

10

0000

11000

101011

01101001

Output:

2

0

9

5

11

In the first test case, "10" can be transformed into "01" with one shift of the entire string, costing 2.

In the second test case, "0000" is already sorted, so cost is 0.

In the third test case, "11000" is transformed into "00011" with three shifts, each of length 3, costing 9 in total.

I need to see if there's a general approach that can achieve the sorting with minimum cost.

Let me think about the positions of '0's and '1's. Suppose I have a string like "101011". I need to move the '0's to the front. So, I need to find a way to swap '0's and '1's in such a way that the total cost is minimized.

One way to think about this is to consider the positions where '0's and '1's are out of order and find a way to shift them into place with the least cost.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to try to swap '1's and '0's when they are in the wrong order and keep track of the cost.

Let's look at the code:

t = int(input())

while t:

s = input()

print(func_1(s))

t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):

s = []

for i in sChar:

s.append(i)

left = 0

cost = 0

right = 1

while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):

if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':

(s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])

cost += right - left + 1

while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':

right += 1

while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':

left += 1

return cost

So, the function func_1 takes the string, converts it into a list for mutability, and then uses two pointers, left and right, to find positions where s[left] is '1' and s[right] is '0', and swaps them, adding the cost which is the distance between them plus one.

Then it moves the right pointer until it finds another '0', and moves the left pointer until it finds another '1', and repeats the process.

Is this the most efficient way? Let's see.

Take the first test case: "10"

- left starts at 0 (s[left] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[right] = '0')

- Swap s[0] and s[1], cost += 1 - 0 + 1 = 2

- Now s = ['0', '1']

- Move right: right = 2 (out of bounds), so stop

- Total cost: 2, which matches the expected output.

Second test case: "0000"

- left starts at 0 (s[left] = '0'), skip since s[left] != '1'

- left moves to 1, s[1] = '0', skip

- left moves to 2, s[2] = '0', skip

- left moves to 3, s[3] = '0', skip

- right starts at 1, but since left is already 3, and right is 1, the while condition fails

- Total cost: 0, which is correct.

Third test case: "11000"

- left starts at 0 (s[left] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[right] = '1'), no swap

- Move right to 2 (s[2] = '0')

- Now s[left] = '1' and s[right] = '0', swap s[0] and s[2], cost += 2 - 0 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '0']

- Move right: right = 3 (s[3] = '0')

- left = 1 (s[1] = '1'), swap s[1] and s[3], cost += 3 - 1 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '0']

- Move right: right = 4 (s[4] = '0')

- left = 2 (s[2] = '1'), swap s[2] and s[4], cost += 4 - 2 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1']

- Move right: right = 5 (out of bounds), stop

- Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the expected output.

Fourth test case: "101011"

- left starts at 0 (s[left] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[right] = '0'), swap s[0] and s[1], cost += 1 - 0 + 1 = 2

- Now s = ['0', '1', '1', '0', '1', '1']

- Move right: right = 2 (s[2] = '1'), no swap

- right = 3 (s[3] = '0'), left = 1 (s[1] = '1'), swap s[1] and s[3], cost += 3 - 1 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1']

- Move right: right = 4 (s[4] = '1')

- left = 2 (s[2] = '1'), no swap

- right = 5 (s[5] = '1'), no swap

- right = 6 (out of bounds), stop

- Total cost: 2 + 3 = 5, which matches the expected output.

Fifth test case: "01101001"

- left starts at 0 (s[left] = '0'), skip

- left moves to 1 (s[1] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[right] = '1'), no swap

- Move right to 2 (s[2] = '1'), no swap

- right = 3 (s[3] = '0'), swap s[1] and s[3], cost += 3 - 1 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '0', '1']

- Move right: right = 4 (s[4] = '1'), no swap

- right = 5 (s[5] = '0'), left = 2 (s[2] = '1'), swap s[2] and s[5], cost += 5 - 2 + 1 = 4

- Now s = ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '0', '1']

- Move right: right = 6 (s[6] = '0'), left = 3 (s[3] = '1'), swap s[3] and s[6], cost += 6 - 3 + 1 = 4

- Now s = ['0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1']

- Move right: right = 7 (s[7] = '1'), left = 4 (s[4] = '1'), no swap

- right = 8 (out of bounds), stop

- Total cost: 3 + 4 + 4 = 11, which matches the expected output.

So, in these examples, the program seems to be working correctly. But I need to think if this approach is generally correct and efficient.

Let me think about what this algorithm is doing. It's essentially finding the leftmost '1' and the rightmost '0' that are out of place and swapping them, then repeating this process until the string is sorted.

This seems similar to bubble sort, where you repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. However, in this case, the swap is not just between adjacent elements but between any '1' and '0' that are out of place, and the cost is the distance between them plus one.

But wait, the operation allowed is a cyclic shift on any substring, not just swapping two characters. So, the operation is more powerful than just swapping two characters.

In the provided program, it's doing swaps between '1's and '0's, but the problem allows cyclic shifts on substrings.

Is this approach equivalent to performing cyclic shifts?

Let's see: when you swap s[left] and s[right], it's like performing a cyclic shift on the substring from left to right.

For example, if you have "110" and you swap s[0] and s[2], it becomes "011", which is equivalent to a cyclic shift on the entire substring "110" -> "011".

So, in this sense, the swap is equivalent to a cyclic shift on that substring.

Therefore, the operations being performed in the program are valid operations as per the problem's allowance.

Now, is this the most efficient way in terms of cost?

In the examples, it seems to be working correctly and achieving the minimum cost.

But I need to think if there are cases where this approach might not give the minimum cost.

Let me think of a test case where this approach might not be optimal.

Consider the string "1010".

Using the program's approach:

- left starts at 0 (s[0] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[1] = '0'), swap s[0] and s[1], cost += 1 - 0 + 1 = 2

- Now s = ['0', '1', '1', '0']

- Move right to 2 (s[2] = '1'), no swap

- right = 3 (s[3] = '0'), left = 1 (s[1] = '1'), swap s[1] and s[3], cost += 3 - 1 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '0', '1', '1']

- Total cost: 2 + 3 = 5

Is there a way to sort "1010" with a lower cost?

Alternative approach:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "1010" -> "1001", cost = 3

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,3]: "1001" -> "1100", cost = 4

- Total cost: 3 + 4 = 7, which is higher than 5.

Another alternative:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,1]: "1010" -> "0110", cost = 2

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "0110" -> "0101", cost = 3

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [2,3]: "0101" -> "0110", cost = 2

- But "0110" is not sorted. Need to continue.

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "0110" -> "0101", cost = 3

- This seems to be going in circles without reaching "0011".

So, the initial approach seems better, with a cost of 5.

Wait, is there a better way?

Let's try:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,2]: "1010" -> "1100", cost = 3

- Now it's sorted as "0011".

Wait, that's "1100" which is not sorted. Wait, sorted would be "0011".

Wait, "1100" is not sorted because '1's come before '0's.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, cyclic shift on [0,2]: "1010" -> Take "101", shift it to "110", so the string becomes "1100", which is "0011", wait no.

Wait, cyclic shift on "101" is "110", so "1010" -> "1100".

But "1100" is not sorted because we want "0011".

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding how cyclic shift works.

Wait, cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front.

So, for substring [0,2]: "101" -> "110"

So, "1010" becomes "1100".

But "1100" is not sorted as "0011".

Alternatively, choose substring [1,3]: "010" -> "001", so "1010" -> "1001", cost = 3.

Then, choose substring [0,3]: "1001" -> "1100", cost = 4.

Total cost: 3 + 4 = 7, which is higher than 5.

Alternatively, choose substring [0,1]: "10" -> "01", so "1010" -> "0110", cost = 2.

Then, choose substring [1,3]: "110" -> "101", so "0110" -> "0101", cost = 3.

Then, choose substring [2,3]: "01" -> "10", so "0101" -> "0110", cost = 2.

Still not sorted.

This seems suboptimal.

Back to the original approach, which costs 5, seems better.

So, perhaps the program's approach is correct.

Let me think of another test case.

Consider "1001"

Using the program's approach:

- left starts at 0 (s[0] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[1] = '0'), swap s[0] and s[1], cost += 1 - 0 + 1 = 2

- Now s = ['0', '1', '0', '1']

- Move right to 2 (s[2] = '0'), left = 1 (s[1] = '1'), swap s[1] and s[2], cost += 2 - 1 + 1 = 2

- Now s = ['0', '0', '1', '1']

- Total cost: 2 + 2 = 4

Is there a better way?

Alternative approach:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "1001" -> "1100", cost = 3

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,1]: "1100" -> "1010", cost = 2

- Still not sorted.

Alternatively:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,2]: "1001" -> "1010", cost = 3

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "1010" -> "1100", cost = 3

- Total cost: 3 + 3 = 6, which is higher than 4.

So, the program's approach seems better.

Another test case: "11010"

Using the program's approach:

- left starts at 0 (s[0] = '1')

- right starts at 1 (s[1] = '1'), no swap

- right = 2 (s[2] = '0'), swap s[0] and s[2], cost += 2 - 0 + 1 = 3

- Now s = ['0', '1', '1', '1', '0']

- Move right to 3 (s[3] = '1'), no swap

- right = 4 (s[4] = '0'), left = 1 (s[1] = '1'), swap s[1] and s[4], cost += 4 - 1 + 1 = 4

- Now s = ['0', '0', '1', '1', '1']

- Total cost: 3 + 4 = 7

Is there a better way?

Alternative approach:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,3]: "11010" -> "11101", cost = 4

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,4]: "11101" -> "11110", cost = 5

- Total cost: 4 + 5 = 9, which is higher than 7.

Another alternative:

- Perform a cyclic shift on substring [2,4]: "11010" -> "11001", cost = 3

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,2]: "11001" -> "10101", cost = 3

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,1]: "10101" -> "01101", cost = 2

- Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [3,4]: "01101" -> "01110", cost = 2

- Total cost: 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10, which is higher than 7.

So, again, the program's approach seems better.

It seems that the program's approach of swapping '1's and '0's directly gives a lower cost than performing multiple cyclic shifts.

Therefore, I think the program is correct in achieving the minimum cost.

But to be thorough, let's consider the time complexity.

The program uses two pointers, left and right, and in the worst case, it might have to traverse the string multiple times, but since it's swapping elements and moving pointers, it should be O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the length of the string.

Given that the constraints allow strings up to 2*10^5 characters and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of all string lengths over all test cases up to 2*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

However, for very large strings, an O(n^2) approach might be too slow, but in practice, it might pass if the constant factors are small.

Alternatively, is there a more efficient way to calculate the minimum cost?

I recall that in problems involving sorting binary strings with specific operations, there might be linear time solutions.

But given that the problem allows multiple operations and the cost is based on the length of the substring shifted, it's not straightforward.

Given that the provided program seems to work correctly for the examples and the additional test cases I tried, and it's efficient enough for the constraints, I think it's correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
