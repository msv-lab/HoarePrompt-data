Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's an array `c` of length `n`, and each element is greater than zero. Then, there are `q` queries, each specifying a subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i`, and I need to determine if that subarray is "good" based on the conditions provided.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "good". According to the problem, a subarray `a` of length `m` is good if there exists another integer array `b` of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in `a` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.

2. For every index `i`, `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.

3. Every element in `b` is greater than zero.

So, I need to check for each query whether such a `b` array exists for the given subarray.

Let me try to rephrase this in my own words. Given a subarray, I need to see if I can create another array with different values but the same sum, and all values in this new array are positive integers.

Hmm, interesting. So, for the subarray, the sum should be distributable into different positive integers that add up to the same total.

Let me think about this. If I have a subarray with elements [1, 2, 1], for example, I need to find another array of the same length where none of the elements are the same as the original, and all are positive, and the sum is the same.

Let's try an example. Take subarray [1, 2, 1]. Sum is 4. I need to find another array of length 3, with all positive integers, none equal to the original, and sum to 4.

One possible `b` array could be [2, 1, 1], but that's not different from `a` in all positions. `a` is [1,2,1], `b` is [2,1,1]. Here, `a_1 != b_1`, `a_2 != b_2`, but `a_3 == b_3`. So, this doesn't satisfy condition 2.

Another try: [2,1,0]. Wait, but 0 is not positive, so this violates condition 3.

Hmm, what about [1,1,2]? Sum is 4, all positive. But `a_1 == b_3`, which might not be a problem, but `a_3 == b_1`. Wait, no, the positions have to be different. So, `a_i != b_i` for each `i`. So, `a_1 != b_1`, `a_2 != b_2`, `a_3 != b_3`. In this case, 1!=1, 2!=1, 1!=2. So, yes, this works.

Wait, but `a_1 == b_1` because both are 1, so that's not acceptable. So, this doesn't work.

Another attempt: [2,1,1]. Wait, that's the same as earlier, which fails because `a_3 == b_1`.

This is tricky. Maybe I need a more systematic approach.

Let me think about the minimal requirements for such a `b` array to exist.

First, since `b_i > 0` for all `i`, the minimal sum of `b` is `m` (since each `b_i >=1`). So, the sum of `a` must be at least `m`.

But wait, in the example above, [1,2,1], sum is 4, and m=3, so 4 >= 3 holds.

But in the query where l=4 and r=4, which is just [4], sum is 4, m=1, 4 >=1 holds, but the answer is "NO". So, there must be more to it.

Ah, looking back at the sample output, for the query 1 5 (the whole array [1,2,1,4,5]), it's "YES"; for 4 4 ([4]), it's "NO"; for 3 4 ([1,4]), it's "YES"; and for 1 3 ([1,2,1]), it's "NO".

So, in the case where m=1, it's "NO". Wait, why is that?

Because if m=1, then `a_1 != b_1`, but `b_1` has to be positive and not equal to `a_1`. So, if `a_1` is, say, 1, then `b_1` can be 2,3,4,... as long as it's positive and not 1. But the sum has to be equal, so `b_1 = a_1`, which is not allowed. So, it's impossible when m=1.

Wait, but in the sample input, for l=4 to r=4, which is m=1, it's "NO", which aligns with this.

So, for m=1, it's impossible because `b_1` has to be different from `a_1` but equal to it in sum, which is impossible.

Therefore, one condition is that m must be greater than 1.

But in the sample input, for m=2, it's "YES", and for m=3, sometimes "YES" and sometimes "NO".

Wait, in the query 1 3 ([1,2,1]), sum is 4, m=3, which is "NO"; whereas for query 3 4 ([1,4]), sum is 5, m=2, which is "YES".

So, for m=2, sum=5, which is greater than or equal to m=2.

Wait, but for m=3, sum=4, which is greater than or equal to m=3.

But in one case it's "YES" and the other "NO". So, there must be another condition.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have a subarray of length m, with sum s.

I need to find another array b of length m, with sum s, b_i >0, and b_i != a_i for all i.

One way to approach this is to ensure that s is at least m, which it is since all a_i >=1 and m >=1.

But that's not sufficient, as seen in the sample input.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that s > 2*m.

Wait, in the sample input, for m=2, sum=5, which is greater than 4, and it's "YES"; for m=3, sum=4, which is less than 6, and it's "NO".

Wait, but in the query 3 4, m=2, sum=5, which is greater than or equal to 2*m=4, so "YES"; for query 1 3, m=3, sum=4, which is less than 2*m=6, and it's "NO".

Wait, but in query 1 5, m=5, sum=1+2+1+4+5=13, which is greater than 2*m=10, and it's "YES"; for query 4 4, m=1, sum=4, which is less than 2*m=2, and it's "NO".

Wait, but m=1, sum=4, which is greater than 2*m=2, but it's still "NO". So, perhaps s >= 2*m is a necessary condition, but not sufficient by itself.

Wait, in query 3 4, m=2, sum=5 >= 4, "YES"; for m=3, sum=4 < 6, "NO"; for m=5, sum=13 >=10, "YES"; for m=1, sum=4 >=2, but still "NO".

So, s >= 2*m seems to be a condition, but for m=1, it's still "NO", so maybe there's an additional condition that m >1.

Wait, perhaps for m=1, it's always "NO", and for m>=2, if s >= 2*m, then "YES", else "NO".

Looking back at the sample input, that seems to hold.

For m=1, "NO"; for m=2, sum=5 >=4, "YES"; for m=3, sum=4 <6, "NO"; for m=5, sum=13 >=10, "YES".

Yes, that matches.

So, the condition seems to be:

- If m=1, then "NO"

- If m>=2 and sum >= 2*m, then "YES"

- Else, "NO"

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me try to see.

For m=1, it's impossible because b_1 must be different from a_1 but equal to it in sum, which is impossible.

For m>=2, as long as sum >= 2*m, it should be possible to find such a b array.

Let me try to construct such a b array.

Suppose I have a subarray of length m, with sum s >= 2*m.

I need to find b_i >0, b_i !=a_i, and sum of b_i =s.

One way to do this is to set b_i = a_i +1 for all i, but that would increase the sum by m, which might be too much if s < sum(a_i) +m.

But in this case, s >=2*m, which is not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to set b_i =1 for all i, which satisfies b_i >0 and b_i !=a_i if a_i !=1.

Wait, but a_i >=1, so if a_i=1, then b_i cannot be 1, since b_i !=a_i.

So, in that case, I need to set b_i to at least 2.

So, if there are elements in a_i that are 1, then b_i has to be at least 2, which would increase the sum.

But I need to ensure that the total sum remains s.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray with m elements, sum s.

I need to find another array b with m elements, b_i >0, b_i !=a_i, and sum b_i =s.

Let me consider the minimal sum for b.

If a_i >1, then b_i can be set to 1.

If a_i=1, then b_i has to be at least 2.

So, the minimal sum for b is m plus the number of a_i that are equal to 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, for each a_i >1, b_i can be set to 1 (sum contributes 1).

For each a_i=1, b_i has to be at least 2 (sum contributes at least 2).

So, the minimal sum for b is m plus the number of a_i that are equal to 1.

Because for a_i >1, b_i=1; for a_i=1, b_i >=2.

So, minimal sum for b is m + k, where k is the number of a_i that are equal to 1.

Similarly, the sum of a is sum a_i.

We need sum b_i = sum a_i.

So, sum a_i >= m + k.

But k is the number of a_i that are equal to 1.

Wait, sum a_i >= m + k, where k = number of a_i that are equal to 1.

But sum a_i >= m + k because a_i >=1 for all i, and for a_i >1, b_i=1, and for a_i=1, b_i >=2.

Wait, actually, a_i >=1, so sum a_i >= m.

But for b_i, sum b_i >= m + k, where k is the number of a_i that are equal to 1.

So, for sum a_i >= m + k, it might be possible.

But I need to ensure that sum a_i = sum b_i, and sum b_i >= m + k.

So, sum a_i >= m + k.

But in the earlier samples, for m=2, sum=5, and k=1 (since one a_i=1), so 5 >= 2 +1=3, which holds, and it's "YES".

For m=3, sum=4, and suppose k=2 (two a_i=1), so 4 >= 3 +2=5, which does not hold, so "NO".

For m=5, sum=13, k=2 (assuming two a_i=1), 13 >=5 +2=7, which holds, "YES".

For m=1, sum=4, k=1 (assuming a_i=1), 4 >=1 +1=2, which holds, but it's "NO".

Wait, but in the sample input, n=5, q=4, c=[1,2,1,4,5].

For query 1 5: subarray [1,2,1,4,5], sum=13, m=5, k=2 (two 1's), 13 >=5+2=7, "YES".

For query 4 4: subarray [4], sum=4, m=1, k=0 (since 4!=1), but in the sample, it's "NO".

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, sum a_i >= m + k, where k is number of a_i=1.

In this case, a_i=4, which is not 1, so k=0, 4 >=1+0=1, but it's "NO".

So, my earlier assumption is incomplete.

There must be another condition.

Let me check the problem again.

"Each element of this array is greater than 0."

So, a_i >=1 for all i.

So, for m=1, a_i >=1, b_i >=1, b_i != a_i.

But since b_i != a_i, and both are >=1, if a_i =1, b_i >=2; if a_i >1, b_i >=1 and !=a_i.

Wait, but for m=1, sum a_i = a_1, sum b_i = b_1, with b_1 != a_1.

So, for m=1, it's impossible because b_1 has to be different from a_1 but equal to it in sum, which is impossible.

Hence, for m=1, it's always "NO".

For m>=2, it's possible if sum a_i >= m + k, where k is the number of a_i=1.

Wait, but in the sample input, for m=2, sum=5, k=1 (one a_i=1), 5 >=2+1=3, "YES".

For m=3, sum=4, k=2 (two a_i=1), 4 >=3+2=5, which does not hold, "NO".

For m=5, sum=13, k=2, 13 >=5+2=7, "YES".

For m=1, sum=4, k=0 (assuming a_i !=1), but it's "NO".

Wait, but in the subarray [1,4], m=2, sum=5, k=1 (one a_i=1), "YES".

In subarray [1,2,1], m=3, sum=4, k=2, "NO".

Subarray [4], m=1, sum=4, k=0, "NO".

So, it seems that for m>=2, if sum a_i >= m + k, where k is the number of a_i=1, then "YES", else "NO".

For m=1, always "NO".

Wait, but in the subarray [1,4], m=2, sum=5, k=1, 5 >=2+1=3, "YES".

In subarray [1,2,1], m=3, sum=4, k=2, 4 >=3+2=5, which is false, "NO".

This seems consistent.

Hence, the condition is:

- If m=1, "NO"

- Else, if sum a_i >= m + k, where k is the number of a_i=1, then "YES", else "NO"

But in the subarray [1,4], k=1 (one a_i=1), sum=5 >=2+1=3, "YES".

In [1,2,1], k=2, sum=4 >=3+2=5, which is false, "NO".

Seems correct.

But in the subarray [4], m=1, k=0 (assuming a_i=4 !=1), but it's "NO".

Wait, but according to the condition, for m=1, always "NO", regardless of k.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

So, in the program, I need to compute for each query:

- m = r - l +1

- sum of a_i from l to r

- count of a_i=1 in that subarray

Then, if m=1, "NO"

Else if sum >= m + k, "YES", else "NO"

This seems efficient.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = []

c = 0

for x in l:

c += x

p.append(c)

for _ in range(m):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

s = p[b - 1]

if a - 2 >= 0:

s -= p[a - 2]

if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it's reading t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and q (n: length of array, q: number of queries)

- Read the array c of length n

- Precompute prefix sums in list p

- For each query, read l and r (1-based indices)

- Compute sum s of subarray from l to r using prefix sums

- If m = r - l +1 >1 and s >= 2*m, then "YES", else "NO"

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for m>=2, if s >= m + k, where k is the number of a_i=1, then "YES", else "NO".

But in the program, it's checking s >= 2*m.

Is this equivalent?

Wait, in general, m + k <= 2*m, because k <=m.

So, if s >= 2*m, then s >= m + k is automatically satisfied.

But s >= m + k could be weaker, allowing s to be between m + k and 2*m -1.

But in the program, it's checking s >= 2*m.

So, it's a stronger condition.

Looking back at the sample input, for m=2, sum=5 >=4, which holds, "YES".

For m=3, sum=4 >=6, which does not hold, "NO".

For m=5, sum=13 >=10, which holds, "YES".

So, it matches the sample output.

But is this always correct?

Wait, suppose we have m=2, sum=4, which is equal to 2*m=4, and k=1 (one a_i=1).

According to my earlier condition, s >= m + k => 4 >=2 +1=3, which holds, so "YES".

But according to the program, s >=2*m =>4 >=4, which holds, "YES".

So, in this case, it matches.

Another case: m=3, sum=5, k=1.

According to my condition, 5 >=3 +1=4, which holds, so should be "YES".

But according to the program, 5 >=6, which does not hold, so "NO".

But according to the sample input, for m=3, sum=4, which is less than 6, "NO".

So, in this case, it's consistent.

But wait, if m=3, sum=5, according to my condition, it should be "YES", but according to the program, it's "NO".

Is there a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Let me think about m=3, sum=5, k=1.

According to my earlier reasoning, s >= m + k =>5 >=3 +1=4, which holds, so it should be "YES".

But according to the program, s >=2*m =>5 >=6, which does not hold, so "NO".

Hence, the program would give "NO" in this case, which contradicts my earlier reasoning.

So, is my reasoning incorrect?

Let me try to construct such a subarray.

Suppose subarray [1,2,2], sum=5, m=3, k=1 (one a_i=1).

I need to find b_i >0, b_i !=a_i, sum b_i=5.

Possible b: [2,1,2], sum=5.

Check: b_1=2 !=a_1=1; b_2=1 !=a_2=2; b_3=2 !=a_3=2. Wait, b_3=2 ==a_3=2, which violates condition 2.

So, this doesn't work.

Another try: [2,1,2]. Same issue.

Wait, maybe [2,2,1], sum=5.

Check: b_1=2 !=1; b_2=2 !=2; b_3=1 !=1. Wait, b_3=1 ==a_3=1, which is invalid.

Another try: [2,1,2], same issue.

Hmm, seems tricky.

Maybe [3,1,1], sum=5.

Check: b_1=3 !=1; b_2=1 !=2; b_3=1 !=1. Wait, b_3=1 ==a_3=1, invalid.

Another try: [1,2,2], but b_1=1 ==a_1=1, invalid.

Wait, it seems impossible to find such a b array where all b_i !=a_i.

So, even though s >= m + k (5 >=3 +1=4), it's still impossible to find such a b array.

Hence, my earlier reasoning might be flawed.

Therefore, the program's condition s >=2*m is necessary, but perhaps not sufficient.

But in the sample input, for m=2, sum=5 >=4, "YES"; for m=3, sum=4 <6, "NO"; for m=5, sum=13 >=10, "YES"; for m=1, sum=4, but m=1 always "NO".

So, perhaps the condition s >=2*m is correct.

Wait, but in the case I just considered, m=3, sum=5 >=6 is false, which matches the program's "NO", even though according to my earlier condition, it should be "YES", but actually, it's impossible to find such a b array.

Hence, my earlier condition is incorrect.

So, the correct condition is m >=2 and s >=2*m, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but why is this the case?

Let me think differently.

Suppose m >=2.

To construct b_i >0, b_i !=a_i for all i, and sum b_i = sum a_i.

To ensure b_i !=a_i, for each i, b_i can be any positive integer except a_i.

To maximize flexibility, perhaps set b_i = a_i +1 for all i, but that would increase the sum by m, which might be too much.

But in reality, we need to adjust b_i such that the sum remains the same as a_i's sum.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of changing a_i to b_i, with b_i !=a_i, and sum remains the same.

So, for each a_i, b_i can be any positive integer except a_i.

We need to choose b_i such that sum b_i = sum a_i.

This is equivalent to finding a set of positive integers b_i !=a_i, with the same sum.

This seems similar to finding a rearrangement of the a_i's where no element remains in its position (derangement), but with the added constraint that the sum remains the same.

But derangements don't necessarily preserve the sum in this way.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of adjusting each a_i by some delta, ensuring that b_i !=a_i and b_i >0, and the sum of deltas is zero.

But this seems complicated.

An easier way is to note that for m >=2, to have b_i !=a_i for all i, and sum b_i = sum a_i, with b_i >0.

The minimal sum for b is m (if all b_i=1), but if a_i=1, then b_i cannot be 1, so b_i >=2.

So, for each a_i=1, b_i >=2, contributing at least 2 to the sum.

For a_i >1, b_i >=1, but b_i !=a_i.

Wait, but to minimize the sum, set b_i=1 for a_i >1, and b_i=2 for a_i=1.

Hence, the minimal sum for b is (number of a_i >1)*1 + (number of a_i=1)*2 = (m - k)*1 + k*2 = m - k + 2k = m + k.

So, the minimal sum for b is m + k.

Therefore, to have sum b_i = sum a_i, we need sum a_i >= m + k.

But earlier, I thought that s >= m + k is not sufficient, but perhaps it is.

Wait, in the earlier example, m=3, sum=5, k=1, 5 >=3 +1=4, which holds, but I thought it was impossible to find such a b array.

But perhaps I was wrong.

Let me try again.

Subarray [1,2,2], sum=5, m=3, k=1.

Set b_i as follows:

b_1=2 (a_1=1, b_1 !=1)

b_2=2 (a_2=2, b_2 !=2, but 2 is already set, conflict)

Wait, can't set b_2=2 since it must be different from a_2=2.

So, set b_2=1.

Then, b_3=2 (a_3=2, b_3 !=2, conflict again).

Wait, can't set b_3=2.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible.

Alternative approach: set b_1=2, b_2=1, b_3=2.

Sum is 5, but b_3=2 ==a_3=2, which violates condition 2.

Another try: set b_1=2, b_2=1, b_3=2, same issue.

Wait, perhaps set b_1=2, b_2=3, b_3=0, but b_3=0 is invalid.

Alternatively, b_1=2, b_2=2, b_3=1, but b_2=2 ==a_2=2, invalid.

Seems impossible.

Hence, even though sum >= m + k, it's still impossible.

So, perhaps my earlier condition is insufficient.

Looking back at the program, it uses s >=2*m as the condition.

In the earlier example, m=3, sum=5, 5 >=6 is false, so "NO", which matches the impossibility.

Similarly, for m=2, sum=5 >=4, "YES"; for m=5, sum=13 >=10, "YES".

So, perhaps s >=2*m is a safer condition, ensuring that it's possible.

But why 2*m?

Wait, 2*m is equal to m + k when k=m, which is the maximal k.

But in general, m + k <= 2*m, since k <=m.

So, s >=2*m implies s >=m + k, but not vice versa.

Hence, s >=2*m is a sufficient condition for s >=m + k, but not necessary.

So, if s >=2*m, then s >=m + k, and hence "YES".

If s <2*m, then s <m + k, so "NO".

But in the earlier example, m=3, sum=5 >=m +k=3+1=4, but 5 <6=2*m, which according to the program is "NO", which matches the impossibility.

Hence, perhaps s >=2*m is a stricter condition that ensures s >=m +k, and it's easier to compute.

Therefore, the program is correct in using s >=2*m for m>=2, and "NO" for m=1.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given subarray is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is considered good if there exists another array with different values but the same sum, and all values are positive integers.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - For a subarray to be good, it must satisfy the following:
     - The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array with different values.
     - All elements in the new array should be positive integers.
     - No element in the new array should be equal to the corresponding element in the original subarray.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a subarray of length `m`, if `m = 1`, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions because changing one element to a different positive integer would alter the sum.
   - For `m >= 2`, the subarray is good if the sum of its elements is at least `2 * m`. This ensures there is enough flexibility to adjust the elements while maintaining the sum and ensuring all new elements are positive and different from the original.

3. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - Precompute prefix sums to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.
   - For each query, check the length of the subarray and whether its sum meets the required condition.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [0] * n
        c_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            c_sum += c[i]
            p[i] = c_sum
        for _ in range(q):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            a -= 1
            b -= 1
            if a == 0:
                s = p[b]
            else:
                s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            m = b - a + 1
            if m == 1:
                print('NO')
            elif s >= 2 * m:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** We compute the prefix sums of the array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.
- **Query Processing:** For each query, determine the subarray sum and length:
  - If the subarray length `m` is 1, it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, so print "NO".
  - If `m >= 2` and the sum of the subarray is at least `2 * m`, print "YES"; otherwise, print "NO".

This approach ensures efficient handling of multiple queries and large input sizes by leveraging prefix sums for quick subarray sum calculations.
