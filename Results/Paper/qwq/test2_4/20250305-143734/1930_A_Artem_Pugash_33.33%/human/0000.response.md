Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is as large as possible. Since I have to perform exactly n moves, I'll be pairing up all the numbers into n pairs.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I want to maximize the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair, I should try to pair numbers in a way that the smaller numbers are paired with numbers that are as small as possible, but not smaller than themselves. Wait, that sounds a bit confusing.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding. Take the first test case: n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. So, I have to choose one pair, which is (2,3), and the minimum is 2. So, the score is 2. That seems straightforward.

The second test case: n=2, numbers are 1,1,2,1. So, 2n=4 numbers. I need to perform 2 moves. One possible way is to pair (1,1) and get min=1, then pair (1,2) and get min=1, total score=2. Another way could be pairing (1,2) and get min=1, then pair (1,1) and get min=1, total score still 2. Seems like no matter how I pair them, I get the same score.

Wait, but the note says that it's not possible to get a score greater than 2. So, in this case, 2 is the maximum achievable score.

The third test case: n=3, all numbers are 1. So, pairing any way will give min=1 for each pair, total score=3.

From these examples, it seems like no matter how I pair the numbers, the total score remains the same. Is that always the case?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think of another example. Suppose n=2, and numbers are 1,2,3,4. So, 2n=4 numbers.

If I pair (1,2) and (3,4), min of each pair is 1 and 3, total score=4.

If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), min of each pair is 1 and 2, total score=3.

If I pair (1,4) and (2,3), min of each pair is 1 and 2, total score=3.

So, in this case, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives a higher score than other pairings. So, the way I pair the numbers affects the total score.

Therefore, to maximize the score, I should pair the numbers such that the smallest numbers are paired together, and the larger numbers are paired together.

Wait, in the above example, pairing the smallest two together gave a higher score than pairing them with larger numbers.

Let me generalize this. Suppose I sort the numbers in non-decreasing order: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

If I pair (a1, a2), (a3, a4), ..., (a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}), then the min of each pair is a1, a3, ..., a_{2n-1}.

Alternatively, if I pair (a1, a3), (a2, a4), etc., the mins would be a1, a2, etc.

Wait, in the first approach, I'm pairing consecutive numbers in the sorted list.

But in the example I just thought of (1,2,3,4), pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives mins 1 and 3, total 4.

Pairing (1,3) and (2,4) gives mins 1 and 2, total 3.

So, pairing consecutive numbers in the sorted order gives a higher total.

Is this always the case?

Let me try another example: numbers = 1,2,3,4,5,6 (n=3).

If I pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), mins are 1,3,5, total=9.

If I pair (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), mins are 1,2,5, total=8.

If I pair (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), mins are 1,2,3, total=6.

So, again, pairing consecutive numbers in sorted order gives the maximum total.

It seems like the strategy is to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order and pair them consecutively.

But why does this work?

Well, by pairing the smallest numbers together, you're ensuring that the smaller numbers are being added to the score, but in a way that you're not wasting larger numbers by pairing them with much smaller ones.

In other words, by pairing consecutive numbers after sorting, you're pairing each number with the next smallest number, which maximizes the minimum in each pair.

Wait, no. Actually, in the pair (a1, a2), the min is a1. In the pair (a3, a4), the min is a3, and so on.

So, by pairing consecutive numbers after sorting, you're selecting the smallest available numbers for the mins, but in a way that you're pairing them with the next smallest number, which ensures that you're not leaving larger numbers to be paired with even larger ones, potentially missing out on higher mins.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me think differently. Suppose I sort the numbers in non-decreasing order: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

Then, the sum of the mins of the pairs would be a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this always the maximum possible?

Wait, in the first example, with numbers 1,1,2,1 sorted as 1,1,1,2. Pairing (1,1) and (1,2), mins are 1 and 1, total 2.

Alternatively, pairing (1,2) and (1,1), mins are 1 and 1, total 2.

Same total.

In the second example, 1,2,3,4 sorted as 1,2,3,4. Pairing (1,2) and (3,4), mins are 1 and 3, total 4.

Alternatively, pairing (1,3) and (2,4), mins are 1 and 2, total 3.

So, pairing consecutive numbers gives a higher total.

Similarly, in the third example, all ones, pairing any way gives total 3.

So, it seems that sorting and pairing consecutive numbers gives the maximum total.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Yes, I think so. When you sort the numbers and pair them consecutively, you're pairing each number with the next smallest number available, which ensures that the min of each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, actually, the min of each pair is the smaller number in the pair, which in the sorted list, is the first number in the pair.

But in the example with 1,2,3,4, pairing (1,2) and (3,4), mins are 1 and 3.

Alternatively, pairing (1,3) and (2,4), mins are 1 and 2.

So, in the first case, the mins are 1 and 3, total 4.

In the second case, mins are 1 and 2, total 3.

So, pairing consecutive numbers gives a higher total.

Similarly, in the case of 1,1,2,1 sorted as 1,1,1,2, pairing (1,1) and (1,2), mins are 1 and 1, total 2.

Alternatively, pairing (1,2) and (1,1), mins are 1 and 1, total 2.

Same total.

So, in some cases, it doesn't matter, but in cases where there are differences in numbers, pairing consecutive numbers gives a better total.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the numbers in non-decreasing order and pair them consecutively.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this strategy.

The program is:

def func():

numCases = int(input())

for i in range(numCases):

numInteger = int(input())

numbers = input().split()

numbers.sort(reverse=False)

suma = 0

while numbers != []:

a = int(numbers.pop(0))

b = int(numbers.pop(0))

suma += min(a, b)

print(suma)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads the 2n numbers, sorts them in non-decreasing order, and then pairs them consecutively, adding the min of each pair to the sum.

In the examples I considered, this seems to work correctly.

But wait, in the first test case, n=1, numbers=2,3.

Sorted: 2,3.

Pair (2,3), min=2, total=2.

Which matches the example.

In the second test case, n=2, numbers=1,1,2,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,2.

Pair (1,1) and (1,2), mins=1 and 1, total=2.

Which matches the example.

In the third test case, n=3, all ones.

Sorted:1,1,1,1,1,1.

Pair (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), mins=1,1,1, total=3.

Which matches the example.

So, in these cases, it works.

But let's consider another test case to verify.

Test case:

n=2

numbers=1,2,3,4

Sorted:1,2,3,4

Pair (1,2) and (3,4), mins=1 and 3, total=4.

Is this the maximum possible?

From earlier thinking, yes.

Alternatively, pairing (1,3) and (2,4), mins=1 and 2, total=3.

So, 4 is better.

Another test case:

n=3

numbers=1,2,3,4,5,6

Sorted:1,2,3,4,5,6

Pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), mins=1,3,5, total=9.

Alternative pairing: (1,3), (2,4), (5,6), mins=1,2,5, total=8.

Another alternative: (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), mins=1,2,3, total=6.

So, pairing consecutive numbers gives the highest total.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider a test case where all numbers are the same.

n=2

numbers=2,2,2,2

Sorted:2,2,2,2

Pair (2,2), (2,2), mins=2 and 2, total=4.

Any other pairing would give the same result.

So, correct.

Another test case:

n=1

numbers=10,10

Sorted:10,10

Pair (10,10), min=10, total=10.

Seems correct.

One more test case:

n=3

numbers=1,1,1,1,1,1

As in the example, total=3.

Seems correct.

So, based on these test cases, the program seems to be correctly implementing the strategy of sorting the numbers and pairing them consecutively to maximize the sum of their mins.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
