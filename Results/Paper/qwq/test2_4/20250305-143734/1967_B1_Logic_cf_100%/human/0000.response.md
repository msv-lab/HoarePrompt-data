Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. That sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand the condition: a + b should be a multiple of b * GCD(a, b). In mathematical terms, this means that b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b without leaving a remainder. So, (a + b) mod (b * GCD(a, b)) == 0.

I need to find all pairs (a, b) that satisfy this condition within the given ranges.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since n and m can be up to 2 million, and there are up to 10,000 test cases, efficiency is crucial. If I try to iterate over all possible pairs for each test case, that would be too slow because 2 million * 2 million is 4 trillion operations per test case, which is not feasible.

So, I need a smarter way to calculate the number of valid pairs without checking each one individually.

Let me consider the properties of GCD and how it relates to a and b.

Let’s denote G = GCD(a, b). Then, a = G * x and b = G * y, where x and y are coprime integers (since G is the greatest common divisor).

Substituting into the condition:

a + b = G*x + G*y = G*(x + y)

b * GCD(a, b) = G*y * G = G^2 * y

So, the condition becomes:

G*(x + y) is a multiple of G^2 * y

Simplifying, since G != 0, we can divide both sides by G:

x + y is a multiple of G * y

So, x + y ≡ 0 mod (G * y)

But x and y are coprime, and G = GCD(a, b).

Wait, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think differently. Let’s consider fixing b and seeing how many a satisfy the condition for that b.

So, for a fixed b, I need to find the number of a in [1, n] such that a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b).

Let’s denote G = GCD(a, b). Then, G divides both a and b, so G divides a + b.

Moreover, b * GCD(a, b) = b * G.

So, the condition is that a + b is a multiple of b * G.

Since G divides a, let’s write a = G * k, where k is an integer between 1 and n/G.

Then, a + b = G * k + b.

We need G * k + b ≡ 0 mod (b * G)

Which means G * k + b is divisible by b * G.

Let’s rearrange this:

G * k + b ≡ 0 mod (b * G)

This implies G * k ≡ -b mod (b * G)

But -b mod (b * G) is equivalent to (b * G - b) mod (b * G) = b*(G - 1) mod (b * G)

Wait, maybe there's a better way to handle this.

Let me consider that since G divides both a and b, and a = G * k, b = G * m, with GCD(k, m) = 1.

Then, a + b = G*(k + m)

And b * GCD(a, b) = G * m * G = G^2 * m

So, the condition is that G*(k + m) is a multiple of G^2 * m

Simplifying, k + m is a multiple of G * m

But since G = GCD(a, b), and a = G * k, b = G * m, with GCD(k, m) = 1.

So, k + m is a multiple of G * m.

But GCD(k, m) = 1, so k and m are coprime.

This seems a bit messy. Maybe I need to find another approach.

Let me try to look for a pattern or formula that can help me compute the number of valid pairs efficiently.

Looking at the sample input and output:

For n=1, m=1, output is 1. The only pair is (1,1).

For n=2, m=3, output is 3. Possible pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2).

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=2, m=3, the pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2), totaling 3 pairs.

Similarly, for n=10, m=8, the output is 14.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider fixing b and finding for each b, the number of a that satisfy the condition.

So, for a fixed b, I need to find the number of a in [1, n] such that a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b).

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to compute this without computing GCD for each pair.

Let me think about the condition again.

We have a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * GCD(a, b))

Which means that b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Let’s denote d = GCD(a, b). Then, d divides b, so d is a divisor of b.

Also, a is a multiple of d, so a = d * k, where k is an integer.

Then, a + b = d * k + b.

But since d divides b, let’s write b = d * m.

So, a + b = d * k + d * m = d * (k + m)

And b * GCD(a, b) = b * d = d * m * d = d^2 * m

So, the condition is that d * (k + m) is a multiple of d^2 * m.

Simplifying, k + m is a multiple of d * m.

But since k and m are coprime (because GCD(k, m) = 1), this seems tricky.

Wait, hold on.

Since a = d * k and b = d * m, and GCD(k, m) = 1.

So, k + m is a multiple of d * m.

But k and m are coprime, so k ≡ -m mod (d * m)

Since m and d are multiples of d (because b = d * m and d divides b), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me consider that for the condition to hold, a + b must be divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

Given that GCD(a, b) divides both a and b, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b only if b * GCD(a, b) divides GCD(a, b) * something.

Wait, perhaps I can divide both sides by GCD(a, b).

Let’s see:

a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b)

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(a, b):

(a + b)/GCD(a, b) is a multiple of b

So, (a + b)/GCD(a, b) ≡ 0 mod b

Which means (a + b)/GCD(a, b) is divisible by b.

But a/GCD(a, b) + b/GCD(a, b) = (a + b)/GCD(a, b)

Let’s denote a' = a/GCD(a, b) and b' = b/GCD(a, b)

So, a' + b' is divisible by b'

But b' = b/GCD(a, b)

Wait, since GCD(a, b) divides b, b' is an integer.

So, a' + b' ≡ 0 mod b'

Which implies a' ≡ -b' mod b'

But a' and b' are coprime because GCD(a', b') = 1.

Wait, this seems familiar.

Given that a' and b' are coprime, and a' ≡ -b' mod b', I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Maybe I need to consider the possible values of GCD(a, b) given b.

Let’s think about fixing b and iterating over possible divisors d of b.

For each divisor d of b, d could be the GCD of a and b.

Then, for each d that divides b, I can find the number of a in [1, n] such that GCD(a, b) = d and a + b is a multiple of b * d.

Wait, but if d = GCD(a, b), then a must be a multiple of d, and GCD(a/d, b/d) = 1.

So, for each d that divides b, I can set a = d * k, where k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/d), and GCD(k, b/d) = 1.

Then, the condition becomes:

a + b = d * k + b = d * k + d * (b / d) = d * (k + b / d)

And b * d = b * d

So, the condition is that d * (k + b / d) is a multiple of b * d.

Dividing both sides by d: k + b / d must be a multiple of b.

But b / d is an integer since d divides b.

So, k + b / d ≡ 0 mod b

Which means k ≡ -b / d mod b

Since k is positive and GCD(k, b/d) = 1, I need to find the number of k in [1, floor(n/d)] such that k ≡ -b / d mod b and GCD(k, b/d) = 1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can find a way to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to count the number of valid pairs.

Let me consider small values of b and see if I can find a pattern.

For b = 1:

Then, a + 1 must be a multiple of b * GCD(a, b) = 1 * GCD(a, 1) = 1.

Since GCD(a, 1) = 1 for any a, a + 1 must be a multiple of 1, which is always true.

So, for b = 1, all a in [1, n] are valid.

Thus, there are n pairs where b = 1.

For b = 2:

a + 2 must be a multiple of 2 * GCD(a, 2).

If a is even, GCD(a, 2) = 2, so a + 2 must be a multiple of 4.

If a is odd, GCD(a, 2) = 1, so a + 2 must be a multiple of 2.

So, for even a, a + 2 must be divisible by 4.

For odd a, a + 2 must be divisible by 2.

Wait, a + 2 being divisible by 2 is always true for even a, since both a and 2 are even.

For odd a, a + 2 is odd + even = odd, which is not divisible by 2, but according to the condition, it should be divisible by 2 * 1 = 2.

Wait, but odd + even is odd, which is not divisible by 2. So, there are no valid odd a for b = 2.

Wait, but that contradicts the sample input where for n=2, m=3, there are pairs (2,1), (2,2), and (1,1). So, for b=2, a=2 is valid.

Wait, for b=2, a=2: a + b = 4, b * GCD(a,b) = 2 * 2 = 4, and 4 is a multiple of 4, so it's valid.

For a=1, a + b = 3, b * GCD(a,b) = 2 * 1 = 2, and 3 is not a multiple of 2, so invalid.

So, only even a are valid for b=2.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for b=2, only even a where a + 2 is divisible by 4 are valid.

Wait, but in the sample, for b=2, a=2 is valid because 2 + 2 = 4 is divisible by 4.

But for a=4, a + 2 = 6, which is not divisible by 4, so it's invalid.

Wait, but in the sample, n=2, so a=2 is the only even a, and it's valid.

Wait, but in the sample, for n=2, m=3, the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), and (2,2). So, for b=2, only a=2 is valid, which matches my earlier conclusion.

So, for b=2, a must be even and a + 2 must be divisible by 4, which means a must be divisible by 2.

Wait, but a being even is already required, and a + 2 being divisible by 4 means a must be congruent to 2 mod 4.

Wait, a=2 satisfies this, a=4 would be 4 mod 4, which is 0, so 4 + 2 = 6, which is not divisible by 4, so a=4 is invalid.

So, for b=2, a must be congruent to 2 mod 4.

Wait, but in the sample, n=2, a=2 is valid.

Similarly, for b=3:

Let's consider b=3.

If a is a multiple of 3, then GCD(a,3)=3, so a + 3 must be a multiple of 3*3=9.

If a is not a multiple of 3, GCD(a,3)=1, so a + 3 must be a multiple of 3*1=3.

So, for multiples of 3, a + 3 must be divisible by 9.

For non-multiples of 3, a + 3 must be divisible by 3, which is always true since a is not divisible by 3 and 3 is divisible by 3.

Wait, a + 3 ≡ a mod 3 ≡ 0 mod 3, since a ≡ 0 mod 3 (if a is multiple of 3), but if a is multiple of 3, then a + 3 ≡ 0 mod 9.

If a is not multiple of 3, a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, then a + 3 ≡ a mod 3, which is not 0 if a is not multiple of 3.

Wait, but according to the condition, for a not multiple of 3, a + 3 must be divisible by 3*1=3.

But a + 3 ≡ a mod 3.

If a is not multiple of 3, a mod 3 is 1 or 2, so a + 3 mod 3 is 1 or 2, which is not 0.

So, only multiples of 3 satisfy the condition for b=3.

Wait, but in the sample input where n=3, m=5, the output is 4.

Looking back, for n=3, m=5, the valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and (3,3).

So, for b=1: all a=1,2,3 are valid.

For b=2: only a=2 is valid.

For b=3: only a=3 is valid.

For b=4: no valid a.

For b=5: no valid a.

Total valid pairs: 4.

So, for b=3, only a=3 is valid, which aligns with my earlier conclusion that only multiples of b are valid for b=3.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for b=3, only multiples of 3 satisfy the condition only if a + 3 is divisible by 9.

Wait, a=3: 3 + 3 = 6, which is not divisible by 9.

But in the sample, (3,3) is listed as valid.

Wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, 3 + 3 = 6, which is not divisible by 9, but according to the sample, (3,3) is valid.

Wait, perhaps my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Let me double-check.

For b=3, and a=3:

GCD(3,3)=3

b * GCD(a,b) = 3 * 3 = 9

a + b = 6

6 is not a multiple of 9, so according to the condition, it should not be valid.

But in the sample, it's listed as valid.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample or in my understanding.

Looking back at the sample explanation for n=10, m=8, the valid pairs include (10,2), but not (10,4).

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the condition.

Let me re-read the problem statement.

We need a + b to be a multiple of b * GCD(a,b).

For a=3, b=3:

a + b = 6

b * GCD(a,b) = 3 * 3 = 9

6 is not a multiple of 9, so it should not be valid.

But in the sample for n=3, m=5, output is 4, including (3,3).

Wait, perhaps the sample is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that GCD(a,b) is computed considering a and b.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that GCD(a,b) divides b, and b divides a + b if GCD(a,b) divides a.

Wait, this is getting too tangled.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that b * GCD(a,b) divides a + b.

Let’s denote d = GCD(a,b), so d divides both a and b.

Let’s write a = d * a' and b = d * b', where GCD(a', b') = 1.

Then, a + b = d * a' + d * b' = d * (a' + b')

And b * GCD(a,b) = d * b' * d = d^2 * b'

So, the condition is that d * (a' + b') is divisible by d^2 * b'

Simplifying, a' + b' must be divisible by d * b'

But a' and b' are coprime, so a' + b' and b' are coprime except for the factors they share.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Let me consider that since a' and b' are coprime, a' + b' and b' are also coprime.

Wait, no, a' + b' and b' share a common factor of b'.

Wait, a' and b' are coprime, so a' + b' and b' are coprime.

Wait, no, a' + b' and b' are not necessarily coprime.

For example, if b' is 2 and a' is 1, a' + b' = 3, which is coprime with b'.

If b' is 3 and a' is 2, a' + b' = 5, which is coprime with b'.

Wait, in general, since a' and b' are coprime, a' + b' and b' are coprime.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, a' + b' is divisible by d * b' implies that d * b' divides a' + b', but since a' + b' and b' are coprime, b' cannot divide a' + b' unless b' = 1.

Wait, but b' = 1 corresponds to b = d.

So, if b' = 1, then b = d, and a' + 1 is divisible by d.

But a' = a/d, and since a = d * a', a' is an integer.

So, a' + 1 is divisible by d.

But a' can be any integer >=1, since a >= d.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that d divides a' + b', but since d divides b', only if d divides a'.

Wait, no, b' = b/d, and d divides b, so b' is integer.

But a' = a/d, and a' is integer.

So, a' + b' is divisible by d * b'.

But a' and b' are coprime.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to find a mathematical formula or theorem that can help me here.

Alternatively, maybe I can look for patterns based on small values and try to generalize.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1:

n=1, m=1

Output:1

Only pair (1,1)

Test case 2:

n=2, m=3

Output:3

Pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)

Test case 3:

n=3, m=5

Output:4

Pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (3,3)

Test case 4:

n=10, m=8

Output:14

Pairs listed in the note.

Looking at these, perhaps for each b, the number of valid a is floor(n / something).

Wait, for b=1, number of valid a is n.

For b=2, number of valid a is floor(n / something).

Wait, in test case 2, for b=1: a=1,2 (2 pairs)

b=2: a=2 (1 pair)

Total: 3 pairs.

In test case 3, for b=1: a=1,2,3 (3 pairs)

b=2: a=2 (1 pair)

b=3: a=3 (1 pair)

Total: 5 pairs, but sample says 4. Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, sample for n=3, m=5 has output 4, but according to this, it should be 5.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the sample again.

Wait, in the note, for n=10, m=8, the valid pairs are listed, totaling 14.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample.

Looking back, in the problem statement, it says "In the fourth test case, (1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2) satisfy the conditions."

So, for n=10, m=8, there are 14 valid pairs.

Similarly, for n=3, m=5, output is 4.

Looking back, perhaps I need to find a formula that can compute the number of valid pairs efficiently.

Let me consider that for b=1, all a in [1,n] are valid.

For b >=2, perhaps the number of valid a is floor(n / something).

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for T in range(t):

[n, m] = input().split()

[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]

ans = n

for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):

ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)

print(ans)

So, the code initializes ans to n, which corresponds to b=1.

Then, for b from 2 to min(n, m), it adds (n + b) // (b * b) to ans.

Wait, let's see if this makes sense.

For b=1, it adds n.

For b >=2, it adds (n + b) // (b * b)

Is this correct?

Looking back at the sample input 2: n=2, m=3

ans = 2

for b=2: (2 + 2) // (4) = 4 // 4 = 1

ans = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the sample output.

For n=3, m=5:

ans = 3

for b=2: (3 + 2) // 4 = 5 // 4 = 1

b=3: (3 + 3) // 9 = 6 // 9 = 0

ans = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4, matching the sample.

For n=10, m=8:

ans = 10

b=2: (10 + 2)/4 = 12/4 = 3

b=3: (10 + 3)/9 = 13/9 = 1

b=4: (10 + 4)/16 = 14/16 = 0

b=5: (10 + 5)/25 = 15/25 = 0

b=6: (10 + 6)/36 = 16/36 = 0

b=7: (10 + 7)/49 = 17/49 = 0

b=8: (10 + 8)/64 = 18/64 = 0

Total ans = 10 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14, matching the sample.

So, it seems that this formula works.

But why?

Let me try to understand why (n + b) // (b * b) gives the number of valid a for each b >=2.

From earlier, for b >=2, the number of valid a is (n + b) // (b * b)

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical justification for this.

Let me consider that for each b, the number of a in [1, n] such that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

Given that GCD(a, b) divides b, and a is a multiple of GCD(a, b), perhaps there's a relationship that can be exploited to derive (n + b)
