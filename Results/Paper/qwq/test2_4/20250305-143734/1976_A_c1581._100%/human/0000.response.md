Alright, I have this problem to solve. I need to check if a given password is strong based on specific conditions. Let's understand the conditions first:

1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends).

3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Okay, so first, I need to make sure that the password only contains lowercase letters and digits. That seems straightforward. Then, I have to ensure that no digit comes after a letter, which means all digits should appear before any letters in the password. Also, within the digits and within the letters, they should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I can separate the digits and letters in the password. I can iterate through each character, check if it's a digit or a letter, and collect them separately.

Once I have the digits and letters separated, I need to ensure that all digits are before any letters in the password. Also, the digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and the letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but the problem says "all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order" and "all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order." So, I need to make sure that the digits in the password are sorted, and the letters are sorted.

Additionally, no digit should come after a letter, which implies that all digits are before any letters in the password.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first example from the test case:

4

12ac

Here, the password is "12ac". Digits are '1' and '2', letters are 'a' and 'c'. Digits are in non-decreasing order (1 <= 2), letters are in non-decreasing order (a <= c), and all digits come before any letters. So, this should be "YES".

Another example:

5

123wa

Password is "123wa". Digits are '1', '2', '3', letters are 'w', 'a'. Digits are in order (1 <= 2 <= 3), letters are 'a' and 'w', but 'w' comes before 'a' in the password, which is not sorted (a <= w). So, this should be "NO".

Another one:

9

allllmost

Password is "allllmost". All letters: 'a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't'. Are these sorted? 'a' <= 'l' <= 'l' <= 'l' <= 'l' <= 'm' <= 'o' <= 's' <= 't'. Yes, they are sorted. No digits are present, so only letters are there, and they are sorted. So, "YES".

Fourth example:

5

ac123

Password is "ac123". Letters are 'a', 'c', digits are '1', '2', '3'. But in the password, letters come before digits, which violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. So, "NO".

Last example:

6

011679

Password is "011679". All digits: '0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9'. They are sorted in non-decreasing order. No letters are present. So, "YES".

From these examples, I can see that the conditions are:

- Separate digits and letters.

- Digits should appear before letters.

- Digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

- Letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, in the code, I need to check these conditions.

Looking at the given program:

testCases = int(input())

while testCases:

length = int(input())

password = input()

print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')

testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):

digits = []

letters = []

for char in password:

if char.isdigit():

digits.append(char)

else:

letters.append(char)

digits.sort()

letters.sort()

for i in range(len(digits)):

if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:

return False

if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:

return False

sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)

if sortedPassword == password:

return True

else:

return False

Let's analyze this function.

First, it separates the digits and letters into two lists and sorts them.

Then, it checks two conditions in the for loop:

1. If any digit is greater than the next digit.

2. If any letter is less than the last digit.

Wait, but digits are already sorted, so the first condition should always be false.

Wait, no. digits.sort() is done earlier, so digits are sorted in ascending order.

Then, in the for loop, checking if digits[i] > digits[i+1] would always be false because they are sorted.

So, this check is redundant.

The second condition is checking if digits[-1] > letters[i].

This seems to be checking if the last digit is greater than any letter.

But, since digits should come before letters, and letters should come after digits, this seems like a way to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

But, I'm not entirely sure if this is the most straightforward way.

Then, it constructs sortedPassword by concatenating sorted digits and sorted letters and checks if it matches the original password.

This seems correct because if the password is correctly sorted with digits first in sorted order followed by letters in sorted order, then sortedPassword should match the original password.

But, let's consider the second test case:

5

123wa

password = "123wa"

digits = ['1', '2', '3']

letters = ['w', 'a']

After sorting:

digits = ['1', '2', '3']

letters = ['a', 'w']

sortedPassword = '123aw'

But the original password is "123wa", which is different from '123aw'. So, it should return False, which matches the expected output "NO".

Another test case:

5

ac123

password = "ac123"

digits = ['1', '2', '3']

letters = ['a', 'c']

sortedPassword = '123ac'

Original password is "ac123", which is different, so it should return "NO".

Seems correct.

Another test case:

4

12ac

password = "12ac"

digits = ['1', '2']

letters = ['a', 'c']

sortedPassword = '12ac'

which matches the original password, so "YES".

Seems correct.

Another test case:

9

allllmost

password = "allllmost"

digits = []

letters = ['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']

sortedPassword = 'allllmost'

which matches the original password, so "YES".

Correct.

Last test case:

6

011679

password = "011679"

digits = ['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']

letters = []

sortedPassword = "011679"

matches original password, so "YES".

Correct.

So, from these examples, it seems like the function is working correctly.

But, let me think if there are any edge cases where it might fail.

Edge case 1: All digits, sorted.

For example:

n=3

password="123"

digits=['1','2','3']

letters=[]

sortedPassword="123" == password -> "YES"

Edge case 2: All letters, sorted.

n=4

password="abcd"

digits=[]

letters=['a','b','c','d']

sortedPassword="abcd" == password -> "YES"

Edge case 3: All digits, not sorted.

n=3

password="321"

digits=['3','2','1']

letters=[]

sortedPassword="123" != "321" -> "NO"

Edge case 4: All letters, not sorted.

n=3

password="cba"

digits=[]

letters=['c','b','a']

sortedPassword="abc" != "cba" -> "NO"

Edge case 5: Digits and letters mixed, but not in the correct order.

n=4

password="a1b2"

digits=['1','2']

letters=['a','b']

sortedPassword="12ab" != "a1b2" -> "NO"

Edge case 6: Digits and letters with digits coming before letters, both sorted.

n=4

password="12ab"

digits=['1','2']

letters=['a','b']

sortedPassword="12ab" == "12ab" -> "YES"

Edge case 7: Single character.

n=1

password="a"

digits=[]

letters=['a']

sortedPassword="a" == "a" -> "YES"

n=1

password="1"

digits=['1']

letters=[]

sortedPassword="1" == "1" -> "YES"

Edge case 8: Digits and letters with digits not sorted.

n=3

password="21a"

digits=['2','1']

letters=['a']

sortedPassword="12a" != "21a" -> "NO"

Edge case 9: Digits and letters with letters not sorted.

n=3

password="a1b"

digits=['1']

letters=['a','b']

sortedPassword="1ab" != "a1b" -> "NO"

Edge case 10: Digits and letters with digits sorted, letters sorted, but digits come after letters.

n=3

password="a12"

digits=['1','2']

letters=['a']

sortedPassword="12a" != "a12" -> "NO"

Seems like in all these cases, the function behaves correctly.

Now, looking back at the function, there is a loop that seems a bit redundant:

for i in range(len(digits)):

if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:

return False

if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:

return False

But since digits are already sorted, the first condition should never be true.

The second condition checks if the last digit is greater than any letter.

This seems like a way to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

But, since in the sortedPassword, all digits come before letters, and if sortedPassword matches the original password, this condition is already satisfied.

So, this extra loop seems unnecessary.

But, since the main check is sortedPassword == password, and it seems to cover all cases, perhaps it's redundant.

However, in programming, it's good to have multiple checks if they make the code more robust.

But in this case, it's probably not needed.

But since the function works correctly, I can live with it.

Therefore, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{true}} \]
