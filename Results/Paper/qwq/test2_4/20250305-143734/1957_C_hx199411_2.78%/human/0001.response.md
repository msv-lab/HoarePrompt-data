Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where I'm placing white rooks and the computer is placing black rooks in a specific way. The rules are that no two rooks can attack each other, which means they can't share the same row or column. Also, the computer mirrors my moves by placing its rook at (c, r) when I place mine at (r, c), unless r equals c, in which case it skips its turn.

I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible after continuing the game until no more valid moves can be made, starting from k initial moves that are already valid.

First, I need to understand the state of the board after k moves and the computer's responses. Each time I place a white rook at (r, c), the computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r == c, in which case it skips. So, for each of my moves, either one rook is added (if r == c) or two rooks are added (if r != c).

I need to calculate how many remaining valid positions there are for me to place white rooks, and then determine how many ways I can place those rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the computer's mirroring moves.

Let me think about the impact of the initial k moves. Each move I make and the computer's response will block certain rows and columns from being used again for placing rooks, because rooks cannot attack each other.

If I place a rook at (r, c), then row r and column c are blocked for future white rooks, and similarly, the computer's rook at (c, r) blocks row c and column r for black rooks.

Wait, but since the computer is placing black rooks, and I'm placing white rooks, do their placements affect each other? I think they do because both types of rooks cannot share the same row or column. So, a white rook at (r, c) blocks row r and column c for both white and black rooks, and similarly, a black rook at (c, r) blocks row c and column r for both white and black rooks.

Wait, no. Actually, rooks of the same color cannot attack each other, but rooks of different colors can. So, white rooks cannot share the same row or column, and black rooks cannot share the same row or column, but a white rook and a black rook can be in the same row or column.

Wait, but the problem says "no two rooks attack each other", regardless of color. So, even rooks of different colors cannot be in the same row or column. Wait, but then it contradicts the mirroring move, because if I place a white rook at (r, c), and the computer places a black rook at (c, r), those two rooks are in the same row c and same column r, so they are attacking each other.

Wait, no, they are not in the same row or column. Wait, let's see: a rook at (r, c) is in row r and column c, and a rook at (c, r) is in row c and column r. So, unless r == c, these two rooks are not in the same row or column. So, they don't attack each other.

So, only when r == c, the computer cannot mirror my move, because placing at (c, r) would be the same position as (r, c), which is already occupied by my rook. In that case, the computer skips its turn.

So, in summary, for each of my moves:

- If r != c, I place a white rook at (r, c), and the computer places a black rook at (c, r). These two rooks do not attack each other.

- If r == c, I place a white rook at (r, c), and the computer skips its turn.

Now, I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible when I continue making moves until no more valid moves are left.

A valid move for me is to place a white rook at a position that is not attacked by any existing rook, meaning the row and column are not already occupied by any rook.

Similarly, the computer will mirror my move if possible, unless r == c.

I need to consider the state of the board after k initial moves and their corresponding computer moves, and then determine how many ways the game can proceed to its completion.

I think the key is to determine the number of remaining valid positions where I can place white rooks, and then consider the constraints imposed by the computer's mirroring moves.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's consider the board as having some rows and columns already blocked by the initial k moves and the computer's responses.

Each time I place a white rook at (r, c), I block row r and column c for future white rooks. The computer places a black rook at (c, r), which blocks row c and column r for future black rooks.

But since rooks of different colors cannot be in the same row or column, I need to ensure that no row or column is used by both a white and a black rook.

Wait, no, the problem says that no two rooks, regardless of color, can attack each other. So, no two rooks can share the same row or column, regardless of color.

Wait, but earlier I thought that rooks of different colors can be in the same row or column, but according to the problem, they cannot.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color."

So, regardless of color, no two rooks can be in the same row or column.

Therefore, when I place a white rook at (r, c), and the computer places a black rook at (c, r), these two rooks are not in the same row or column (unless r == c), so they do not attack each other.

Hence, in the general case, my white rook and the computer's black rook do not attack each other, except when r == c, in which case they would be at the same position, which is why the computer skips its turn.

So, in the game, after k moves by me and the computer's responses, some rows and columns are blocked.

I need to find out how many ways I can continue placing white rooks, with the computer mirroring my moves, until no more moves are possible.

I think the approach should be to calculate the number of remaining positions where I can place white rooks, considering the blocks from the initial k moves and their mirrors, and then determine how many ways I can place rooks such that no two rooks share the same row or column.

This sounds like a problem related to derangements or permutations with certain restrictions.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have an n x n chessboard, and some positions are already occupied by rooks, both white and black, in such a way that no two rooks attack each other.

I need to find out how many ways to place additional rooks (only white, with the computer mirroring my moves) such that no two rooks attack each other.

But it's a bit tricky because of the mirroring.

Let me consider the impact of my moves and the computer's moves on the board.

Each time I place a white rook at (r, c), the computer places a black rook at (c, r), unless r == c, in which case it skips.

So, for each of my moves, if r != c, two rooks are placed: one at (r, c) and one at (c, r). If r == c, only one rook is placed at (r, c).

These placements block rows and columns for future placements.

Specifically, placing a rook at (r, c) blocks row r and column c for future rooks.

Similarly, placing a rook at (c, r) blocks row c and column r.

So, after placing both rooks, rows r and c, and columns c and r are all blocked.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

When I place a white rook at (r, c), I block row r and column c for future rooks.

When the computer places a black rook at (c, r), it blocks row c and column r for future rooks.

So, in total, after both moves, rows r and c, and columns r and c are all blocked.

Wait, no. More precisely:

- Placing a white rook at (r, c) blocks row r and column c.

- Placing a black rook at (c, r) blocks row c and column r.

So, row r and row c are blocked by the black rook, and column c and column r are blocked by the white rook.

Wait, no, more accurately:

- A rook placed at (r, c) blocks row r and column c for future rooks, regardless of color.

- Similarly, a rook placed at (c, r) blocks row c and column r.

Therefore, after both moves, row r and row c are blocked (since the black rook at (c, r) blocks row c, and the white rook at (r, c) blocks row r), and similarly, column c and column r are blocked.

So, in effect, both rows r and c, and columns r and c are blocked.

Hence, for each pair of distinct r and c, two rooks are placed, blocking rows r and c, and columns r and c.

On the other hand, if r == c, only one rook is placed at (r, c), blocking row r and column c.

Wait, but since r == c, it's blocking row r and column c, which are the same since r == c.

So, in this case, only one row and one column are blocked.

Therefore, for each of my k moves:

- If r != c, two rooks are placed, blocking rows r and c, and columns r and c.

- If r == c, one rook is placed, blocking row r and column c (which is the same as row r).

So, in terms of blocked rows and columns:

- For each pair where r != c, rows r and c, and columns r and c are blocked.

- For each pair where r == c, only row r and column c (which is the same as row r) are blocked.

Wait, but in the case where r == c, only one row and one column are blocked, but since row and column are the same (because r == c), it's essentially blocking one unique row/column.

Wait, no, row r and column c are different only if r != c, but if r == c, they are the same.

So, in summary:

- For each move where r != c, two rooks are placed, blocking rows r and c, and columns r and c.

- For each move where r == c, one rook is placed, blocking row r (and column r, since r == c).

Now, I need to calculate the number of remaining positions where I can place white rooks, considering these blocked rows and columns, and then determine how many ways I can place these rooks, with the computer mirroring my moves.

I think it would be helpful to calculate the number of remaining rows and columns that are still available for placement.

Let me define:

- Let S be the set of rows and columns that are blocked.

For each of my k moves:

- If r != c, add rows r and c to S, and columns r and c to S.

- If r == c, add row r to S and column c to S (which is the same as row r since r == c).

Wait, but rows and columns are distinct, but in the context of blocking, a blocked row means no rook can be placed in that row, similarly for columns.

So, I need to keep track of the blocked rows and blocked columns separately.

Let me define:

- blocked_rows = set()

- blocked_cols = set()

For each of my k moves:

- If r != c:

- Add r to blocked_rows

- Add c to blocked_rows

- Add r to blocked_cols

- Add c to blocked_cols

- Else (r == c):

- Add r to blocked_rows

- Add c to blocked_cols

Wait, but since r == c, adding r to blocked_rows and c to blocked_cols is effectively adding the same row/column once.

Wait, but in the problem, rows are indexed from 1 to n, and columns from 1 to n, so row r and column r are distinct entities, even if r == c.

But in terms of blocking, if a row is blocked, no rook can be placed in that row, and similarly for columns.

So, in terms of available positions, the number of remaining rows and columns that are not blocked will determine the number of positions where I can place rooks.

Wait, more precisely, the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks share the same row or column is related to derangements or permutations.

But in this problem, since the computer mirrors my moves, there's a symmetry involved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have m remaining rows and m remaining columns that are not blocked.

Then, the number of ways to place rooks in this m x m subgrid, with the mirroring constraint, needs to be calculated.

Wait, but the mirroring is only for my moves and the computer's moves.

I need to consider that for each of my moves, the computer mirrors it, unless r == c.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of pairs of moves: my move and the computer's mirror move.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

In the first sample input:

4 1

1 2

After my move at (1,2), the computer places a rook at (2,1).

So, rows 1 and 2, and columns 1 and 2 are blocked.

Therefore, the remaining board is of size (n - 2) x (n - 2), which is 2x2.

Now, I need to place white rooks on this 2x2 grid, with the computer mirroring my moves.

Possible configurations:

1. Place a white rook at (3,4), computer places at (4,3).

2. Place a white rook at (4,3), computer places at (3,4). This is the same as the first configuration, just the order is different, but since it's the same positions, it's considered the same configuration.

3. Place a white rook at (3,3), but since r == c, the computer skips. Then, I can place another white rook at (4,4), with the computer skipping again.

But in this case, (3,3) and (4,4) are both placed by me, without the computer placing any mirrors.

Wait, but according to the problem, the computer mirrors my moves, unless r == c.

So, when I place at (3,3), the computer skips. Then, I place at (4,4), the computer skips again.

So, in this configuration, there are two white rooks at (3,3) and (4,4), and no black rooks from the computer.

In the first configuration, I place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3), and that's it.

So, total configurations are:

- Configuration 1: white at (3,4), black at (4,3)

- Configuration 2: white at (4,3), black at (3,4) (same as 1)

- Configuration 3: white at (3,3), white at (4,4)

So, effectively, there are 3 distinct configurations.

Hence, the output is 3.

From this, it seems that the number of configurations depends on the number of remaining positions after accounting for the blocked rows and columns.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose after k moves and the computer's responses, there are m remaining rows and m remaining columns that are not blocked.

Then, the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to place rooks in this m x m subgrid, considering the mirroring.

But I need a better way to calculate this.

I recall that the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a chessboard is related to permutations.

In particular, placing k non-attacking rooks on an n x n chessboard is equal to choosing k rows and k columns and arranging them in a permutation.

But in this problem, there's the added complexity of the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing rows and columns.

Given that the computer mirrors my moves, there is a symmetry between rows and columns.

Maybe I can pair rows and columns and consider them together.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of remaining rows and columns that are not blocked, and then calculate the number of perfect matchings or something similar.

Wait, but it's not necessarily about perfect matchings, because I can place any number of rooks, as long as no two share the same row or column.

I need to find the number of ways to place any number of non-attacking rooks in the remaining grid.

But considering that for each of my moves, the computer mirrors it, unless r == c.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the number of remaining rows and columns that are not blocked.

Let's define:

- Let num_blocked be the total number of unique rows and columns that are blocked.

For each of my k moves:

- If r != c, then rows r and c are blocked, and columns r and c are blocked.

- If r == c, then row r and column c (which is the same as row r) are blocked.

So, for r != c, I block rows r and c, and columns r and c, which are four entities, but since row r and column r are distinct, it's actually four distinct blocks.

Wait, no, rows and columns are distinct, even if they have the same index.

Wait, in the context of blocking, if a row is blocked, no rook can be placed in that row, regardless of the column.

Similarly, if a column is blocked, no rook can be placed in that column, regardless of the row.

So, in terms of degrees of freedom, the number of remaining rows and columns that are not blocked will determine the size of the subgrid where I can place rooks.

Let me define:

- blocked_rows = set of rows that are blocked

- blocked_cols = set of columns that are blocked

For each of my k moves:

- If r != c:

- Add r to blocked_rows

- Add c to blocked_rows

- Add r to blocked_cols

- Add c to blocked_cols

- Else (r == c):

- Add r to blocked_rows

- Add c to blocked_cols

Wait, but in the case where r == c, adding r to blocked_rows and c to blocked_cols is adding the same row/column once, since r == c.

Wait, but rows and columns are distinct, even if they have the same index.

So, in terms of counting, the number of blocked rows and blocked columns need to be tracked separately.

Then, the number of remaining rows is n - len(blocked_rows), and the number of remaining columns is n - len(blocked_cols).

But since rows and columns are independent in terms of blocking, the number of remaining positions where I can place a rook is (n - len(blocked_rows)) * (n - len(blocked_cols)).

But in reality, it's more nuanced because a position can only be placed if neither its row nor its column is blocked.

So, the number of remaining positions is (n - len(blocked_rows)) * (n - len(blocked_cols)).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Actually, the number of positions where I can place a rook is the number of positions where neither the row nor the column is blocked.

So, it's (n - len(blocked_rows)) * (n - len(blocked_cols)).

Wait, but that's not accurate because some positions may have their row or column blocked.

Actually, the correct number of positions where I can place a rook is the number of positions where the row is not blocked and the column is not blocked.

So, it's (n - len(blocked_rows)) * (n - len(blocked_cols)).

Wait, but in reality, since a position's row and column are independent in terms of blocking, yes, that's correct.

So, the number of remaining positions is (n - len(blocked_rows)) * (n - len(blocked_cols)).

But in the sample input, with n=4, k=1, and move (1,2), blocked_rows = {1,2}, blocked_cols = {1,2}, so remaining positions are (4 - 2) * (4 - 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 positions: (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).

And in the explanation, there are 3 configurations:

1. Place at (3,4) and (4,3)

2. Place at (4,3) and (3,4), which is the same as 1

3. Place at (3,3) and (4,4)

So, total configurations are 3.

But according to some formula, I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me see.

After the initial moves, the remaining grid is of size m x m, where m = n - len(blocked_rows) = n - len(blocked_cols).

Wait, in the sample, len(blocked_rows) = 2, len(blocked_cols) = 2, n=4, so m=2.

And the number of configurations is 3.

I recall that for an m x m grid, the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks is related to the number of permutations of m elements.

Specifically, the number of ways to place k non-attacking rooks on an m x m grid is equal to the number of ways to choose k rows and k columns and arrange them in a permutation, which is P(m, k) = m! / (m - k)!.

But in this problem, I need to place any number of non-attacking rooks, with the mirroring constraint.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of ways to choose a subset of positions where no two positions share the same row or column.

But considering the mirroring, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can be applied here.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model this as choosing pairs of positions that don't attack each other.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a pattern.

In the sample input, m=2, and the number of configurations is 3.

Wait, what are the possible configurations for m=2?

- Place no rooks: 1 way

- Place one rook: 2 ways (position (1,1) and (2,2), since (1,2) and (2,1) would mirror each other)

- Place two rooks: 1 way (place one at (1,1) and (2,2))

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when I place a rook at (3,4), the computer places at (4,3), so they are placed together.

Hence, the configurations are:

- Place no rooks: 1 way

- Place one pair: (3,4) and (4,3): 1 way

- Place two white rooks: (3,3) and (4,4): 1 way

Total: 3 ways.

So, it's 1 (no rooks) + 1 (one pair) + 1 (two white rooks): 3 ways.

Similarly, for m=1, there would be 2 ways: place no rooks or place one white rook.

For m=0, there is only 1 way: place no rooks.

Wait, but according to the sample input, when m=2, there are 3 configurations.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(m choose 1) + 1.

Wait, no, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's m! + 1.

For m=2: 2! + 1 = 3, which matches the sample.

For m=1: 1! + 1 = 2, which seems correct.

For m=0: 0! + 1 = 2, but according to the sample, when m=0, there should be 1 configuration (placing no rooks), but 0! +1 =2.

Wait, perhaps it's m! +1 for m >=1, and 1 for m=0.

But in the sample, m=2: 3 configurations, which is 2! +1=3.

m=1: 2 configurations, which is 1! +1=2.

m=0: 1 configuration, which is different.

So, perhaps the formula is m! +1 for m >=1, and 1 for m=0.

But in the sample, m=2: 3 configurations, which matches 2! +1=3.

m=1: 2 configurations, which matches 1! +1=2.

m=0: 1 configuration, which is consistent.

Hence, perhaps the number of configurations is m! +1 for m >=1, and 1 for m=0.

But wait, for m=3, it would be 3! +1=7, but let's check.

For m=3:

Possible configurations:

- Place no rooks: 1 way

- Place one pair: (1,2) and (2,1), (1,3) and (3,1), (2,3) and (3,2): 3 ways

- Place three white rooks: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3): 1 way

Total: 1 + 3 + 1 =5, but according to m! +1=6, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, for m=3, according to m! +1=6, but in reality, there are:

- No rooks: 1

- One pair: 3 ways

- Three white rooks: 1 way

Total: 5 ways, which doesn't match m! +1=6.

So, perhaps that's not the correct formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of (m choose k) * k! for k=0 to m.

Wait, (m choose 0) * 0! =1

(m choose 1) *1! =m

(m choose 2) *2! = m*(m-1)

(m choose 3)*3! = m*(m-1)*(m-2)

and so on.

Wait, but for m=2: 1 + 2 + 2=5, which doesn't match the sample.

Wait, no, for m=2: 1 (no rooks) + 2 (one pair) + 1 (two white rooks)=4, but in the sample, it's 3.

Wait, but in the sample, m=2, configurations: 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that placing one pair is one configuration, regardless of which pair is chosen.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, placing (3,4) and (4,3) is one configuration, and placing (3,3) and (4,4) is another configuration.

Wait, but according to the sample, there are 3 configurations:

1. Place (3,4) and (4,3)

2. Place (4,3) and (3,4), which is the same as 1

3. Place (3,3) and (4,4)

So, total 3 configurations.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of subsets of the remaining grid where no two positions share the same row or column, considering the mirroring.

But it's still confusing.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that for m=2, configurations=3.

For m=1, configurations=2.

For m=0, configurations=1.

Looking for a pattern:

m | configurations

0 | 1

1 | 2

2 | 3

3 | 4

...

It seems that configurations = m +1.

But in the m=3 case, according to this, it would be 4, but earlier I thought it was 5.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps configurations = 2^m.

For m=0, 1 (but 2^0=1)

m=1, 2 (matches 2^1=2)

m=2, 4 (but sample has 3)

So, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps configurations = m! +1.

For m=0, 1 +1=2, but should be 1.

Wait, perhaps configurations = m! +1 for m >=1, and 1 for m=0.

But in the sample, m=2: 3, which is 2! +1=3.

m=1:2, which is 1! +1=2.

m=0:1.

Seems consistent.

But earlier, for m=3, I thought it was 5, but according to this, it's 3! +1=7, which doesn't match my earlier count.

Wait, perhaps my earlier count was wrong.

For m=3:

- No rooks:1

- One pair:3 (since there are 3 possible pairs: (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,3)-(3,2))

- Two pairs: but in m=3, you can't place two pairs without having overlapping rows or columns.

Wait, no, in m=3, if I place one pair, say (1,2)-(2,1), then I can't place another pair because the remaining positions would be (3,3), so I can place a single white rook at (3,3).

Wait, but according to the mirroring, if I place at (3,3), the computer skips.

So, configurations for m=3:

- No rooks:1

- One pair:3

- One pair plus one white rook:3 (each pair leaves one white rook at (3,3))

- Three white rooks:1

Total:1+3+3+1=8, which is 3! +1=7? Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m! +1 for m >=1, and 1 for m=0.

But in m=3, according to this, it's 7, but according to my count, it's 8.

Hmm.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that for m=0, configurations=1.

m=1:2.

m=2:3.

m=3:4.

Wait, in the m=3 case, perhaps I'm overcounting.

If m=3:

- No rooks:1

- One pair:3

- Three white rooks:1

Total:5, but according to m! +1=6, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m +1.

For m=0:1

m=1:2

m=2:3

m=3:4

But in reality, for m=2, it's 3, and for m=3, it's 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^m -1 +1=2^m.

But for m=0, it's 1.

m=1:2

m=2:4

But sample has m=2:3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m +1.

For m=0:0 +1=1

m=1:1 +1=2

m=2:2 +1=3

m=3:3 +1=4

But earlier, for m=3, I thought it was 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps my earlier count for m=3 was wrong.

Let me recount for m=3.

Possible configurations:

- No rooks:1

- Place one pair:3 ways (each pair is (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,3)-(3,2)):3

- Place three white rooks:1 way ((1,1),(2,2),(3,3)):1

Total:1+3+1=5, but according to m +1=4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is C(m,0) + C(m,1) + ... + C(m,floor(m/2)).

For m=2: C(2,0) + C(2,1)=1+2=3, which matches.

For m=3: C(3,0) + C(3,1)=1+3=4, but earlier count was 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum from k=0 to m/2 of C(m, k).

But for m=3, it's C(3,0) + C(3,1)=1+3=4, but actual configurations are 5.

Still not matching.

This is getting too confusing.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found a pattern in the sample and tried to generalize, but it's not working.

Let me consider the problem differently.

Each remaining position can either be part of a pair (me and computer) or have a single white rook placed by me, with the computer skipping.

Wait, but in the mirroring, if I place at (r,c), the computer places at (c,r), unless r==c.

So, for positions where r != c, they come in pairs.

Positions where r == c can have only a white rook placed by me, with the computer skipping.

So, perhaps I can group the remaining positions into pairs where r != c, and single positions where r == c.

Then, for each pair, I can choose to place both rooks or not.

And for each single position, I can choose to place a white rook or not.

But I need to ensure that no two rooks share the same row or column.

Wait, but in the paired positions, placing one pair blocks the rows and columns of that pair.

Similarly, placing a single white rook blocks its row and column.

So, perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of subsets of the pairs multiplied by the number of subsets of the single positions, where in each subset, no two positions share the same row or column.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me think in terms of graph theory.

Consider the remaining grid as a bipartite graph, where one set of vertices represents the remaining rows, and the other set represents the remaining columns.

Edges represent possible positions to place rooks.

Then, placing rooks corresponds to selecting a matching in this bipartite graph.

But considering the mirroring, it's not straightforward.

This is getting too complicated for the time I have.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4.

So, I need an O(n log n) or better solution.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to compute something based on the number of remaining positions.

Let me analyze the provided code.

The code reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and k.

Then, it reads k lines, each containing c and r.

It calculates num, which seems to be the total number of blocked rows and columns.

Then, m = n - num.

If m == 0, print 0.

If m ==1, print 1.

Else, compute dp[m], where dp[i] seems to be built recursively.

Looking at dp[1]=1, dp[2]=3, and dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1)*dp[i-2]*2 % (10^9 +7).

In the sample input, for m=2, dp[2]=3, which matches the sample output.

For m=1, it prints 1, which seems correct.

For m=0, it prints 0, but in the problem statement, it should be 1 (no rooks), but the code prints 0.

Wait, perhaps there's an off-by-one error.

In the sample input, for m=2, it's 3.

For m=1, it's 2, but according to the code, it prints 1.

Wait, perhaps m is calculated incorrectly.

Wait, in the sample input, n=4, k=1, move (1,2).

Then, blocked_rows={1,2}, blocked_cols={1,2}, so m=4 - num.

How is num calculated?

num starts at 0.

For each of k moves:

If c == r, num +=1

Else, num +=2

So, for k=1, move (1,2), c=1, r=2, c != r, so num +=2, num=2.

Then, m=4-2=2.

Then, dp[2]=3, which matches the sample output.

For m=1, suppose k= something that leads to m=1.

Then, the code prints 1, but according to the sample, for m=1, it should be 2.

Wait, but in the code, if m==1, it prints 1, not 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, in the code, it has:

if m ==0:

print(0)

elif m ==1:

print(1)

else:

compute dp[m]

But according to the sample, for m=0, it should be 1 (only one configuration: no rooks), but the code prints 0.

Wait, perhaps it's an error in the code.

But in the sample input, for m=2, it's correct.

For m=1, it should be 2, but the code prints 1.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

But the sample output is 3 for m=2, which matches dp[2]=3.

Wait, perhaps the base cases are off by one.

Wait, perhaps m should be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps m should be m = n - num//2.

Wait, no, in the sample, num=2, n=4, m=2.

But for m=1, suppose n=3, k=1, move (1,1), then num=1 (since r==c), m=3-1=2, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to recalculate num correctly.

Wait, in the code, for each move:

if c ==r:

num +=1

else:

num +=2

Then, m =n - num

But in reality, for r !=c, num +=2, meaning two positions are blocked.

For r ==c, num +=1, meaning one position is blocked.

But in terms of blocking rows and columns, it's not directly corresponding to num +=1 or +=2.

Wait, perhaps num represents the total number of blocked rows and columns.

Wait, but in the sample, for k=1, move (1,2), num=2, m=4-2=2.

But in reality, blocked_rows={1,2}, blocked_cols={1,2}, so m=4-2=2 for rows and 4-2=2 for columns.

Wait, but rows and columns are independent.

Wait, perhaps num represents the total number of unique rows and columns blocked.

Wait, but in the code, num is incremented by 1 for r==c and by 2 for r!=c.

But in reality, for r!=c, four entities are blocked: row r, row c, col r, col c.

But in the code, it's num +=2.

Wait, perhaps num is intended to represent the number of unique rows and columns blocked.

Wait, perhaps num is the total number of rows and columns blocked.

Wait, but in the sample, for k=1, move (1,2), num=2, which might correspond to two unique rows and two unique columns blocked.

Wait, but in reality, blocked_rows={1,2}, blocked_cols={1,2}, so total unique rows and columns blocked is 4, but num=2.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding.

Wait, perhaps num is supposed to represent the number of unique rows and columns blocked, but in the code, it's num +=1 for r==c and num +=2 for r!=c.

Wait, perhaps for r !=c, num +=2 represents two unique rows and two unique columns blocked.

Wait, but in reality, for r !=c, rows r and c are blocked, and columns r and c are blocked, but rows and columns are distinct.

Wait, perhaps num represents the number of unique indices that are blocked in either rows or columns.

Wait, perhaps num is the total number of unique row and column indices that are blocked.

For example, for k=1, move (1,2), blocked_rows={1,2}, blocked_cols={1,2}, so unique indices blocked are {1,2}, so num=4 (since row 1, row 2, col 1, col 2), but in the code, num +=2 for r !=c.

Wait, perhaps num is intended to represent the number of unique row and column indices blocked.

Wait, perhaps num is the number of unique row indices plus the number of unique column indices blocked.

So, for r !=c, num +=2 (adding row r and row c), and for r ==c, num +=1 (adding row r and column r, but since they are the same index, it's counted once).

Wait, but rows and columns are distinct, even if they have the same index number.

Wait, perhaps num is the total number of unique row and column indices blocked.

Wait, perhaps it's better to track blocked_rows and blocked_cols separately.

Let me try to compute m correctly.

Let blocked_rows be the set of rows blocked.

blocked_cols be the set of columns blocked.

For each of my k moves:

if r !=c:

blocked_rows.add(r)

blocked_rows.add(c)

blocked_cols.add(r)

blocked_cols.add(c)

else:

blocked_rows.add(r)

blocked_cols.add(c)

Then, m = n - len(blocked_rows) - len(blocked_cols) + len(blocked_rows intersect blocked_cols)

Wait, no, because rows and columns are distinct.

Actually, the number of remaining rows is n - len(blocked_rows), and the number of remaining columns is n - len(blocked_cols).

Then, the number of remaining positions is (n - len(blocked_rows)) * (n - len(blocked_cols)).

But in the code, m =n - num, where num is incremented by 2 for r !=c and by 1 for r ==c.

Wait, perhaps num is len(blocked_rows) + len(blocked_cols).

For r !=c, num +=2 (adding row r, row c, col r, col c, but since rows and columns are distinct, it's +4.

Wait, no, perhaps num is the number of unique indices blocked in either rows or columns.

Wait, perhaps num is len(blocked_rows union blocked_cols).

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

len(blocked_rows union blocked_cols) = len(blocked_rows) + len(blocked_cols) - len(blocked_rows intersect blocked_cols)

But in the code, num is incremented by
