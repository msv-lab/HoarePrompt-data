Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, and we get a point if the card we play has a number that's already on the table.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if both me and Nene play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics clearly. There are 2n turns, with me and Nene alternating, starting with me. Each turn, a player picks one of their cards and plays it on the table. If the number on that card is already on the table, they get a point.

Important points:

- The game is played with complete information; both players can see all the cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, in that order.

- I need to play optimally to maximize my score, knowing that Nene is also playing optimally.

Given that, I need to find out the best possible score I can achieve.

Let me think about the example provided:

Input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

Output:

1

2

1

0

0

So, for the first test case with n=4 and my cards being 1,1,2,3, the output is 1.

From the explanation, it seems that in this scenario, I can get 1 point, and Nene gets 3.

I need to confirm if the program given will correctly output 1 for this case.

Looking at the program:

def func():

    import sys

    input = sys.stdin.readline

    for _ in range(int(input())):

        n = int(input())

        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)

        for x in a:

            cnt[x] += 1

        ans = 0

        for x in cnt:

            ans += max(0, x - 1)

        print(ans)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and then the list of cards I have. It counts the frequency of each number in my hand and then calculates the sum of (frequency - 1) for each number, but not less than 0.

Wait, why is it doing that?

Let me think about what (frequency - 1) represents.

If I have two cards of the same number, then when I play the first one, it doesn't give me a point because that number isn't on the table yet. But when I play the second one, it does give me a point because the first one is already on the table.

So, for each number that appears twice in my hand, I can get one point from it.

Similarly, if a number appears only once in my hand, I can't get any point from it because I don't have a second card to play for that number.

Wait, but that seems too simplistic. What about Nene's plays? How does her optimal play affect my score?

The problem says that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, in that order.

So, I need to consider how Nene's choices influence my ability to get points.

Let me consider the first test case again:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

From the explanation, the game proceeds as follows:

1. I play one of the 1's.

2. Nene plays one of the 4's.

3. I play the other 1 and get 1 point.

4. Nene plays the other 4 and gets 1 point.

5. I play 2.

6. Nene plays 2 and gets 1 point.

7. I play 3.

8. Nene plays 3 and gets 1 point.

So, I end up with 1 point, and Nene with 3.

But according to the program, it's counting the number of pairs I have in my hand. In this case, I have one pair of 1's, so it should output 1, which matches the example.

Wait, but what if I have more pairs?

Let me look at the second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

Nene's cards would be the remaining cards: assuming the deck has two of each number from 1 to 8.

So, Nene has: 3,6,4,2,7,7,5,5 (assuming that's what's left).

Wait, but in the input, it's guaranteed that each number appears at most twice in my hand, so Nene will have the other copies.

Wait, no. The deck has exactly two of each number from 1 to n.

In the input, it's guaranteed that each number appears at most twice in my hand, meaning that some numbers may appear only once in my hand, the others appear twice.

Wait, no, it says "each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1,a2,â€¦,an at most 2 times."

Wait, n is the number of cards each gets, so a1 to an are my cards, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice.

Wait, but n is the number of unique integers, I think.

Wait, no, n is the number of cards each gets, and there are 2n cards in total, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.

So, in my hand, I have n cards, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, because some integers may appear only once, others may appear twice.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3, so two 1's, one 2, one 3. Nene has the other 1,2,3, and 4,4.

Wait, but in this case, Nene has two 4's, which didn't appear in my hand.

So, in general, for each number from 1 to n, I may have zero, one, or two cards of that number.

But in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck.

And in my hand, each integer appears at most twice.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3, so number 4 doesn't appear in my hand, meaning Nene has both 4's.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, so I have:

- 7: one

- 4: one

- 1: one

- 2: one

- 8: two

- 5: two

So, Nene has the other cards: for 7,4,1,2, one each; for 8 and 5, none, since I have both.

Wait, no, wait, I have two 8's and two 5's, so Nene has none of those.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "each integer from 1 to n appears exactly on 2 cards", meaning that for each number from 1 to n, there are exactly two cards with that number in the deck.

When the deck is divided, I get n cards, and Nene gets the remaining n cards.

So, for each number from 1 to n, I may have zero, one, or two cards of that number in my hand, but in total, there are exactly two in the entire deck.

Given that, the program is counting, for each number in my hand, if I have two of them, I can get one point from it, because I can play the second one after the first one is on the table.

But, I need to consider Nene's optimal play.

Wait, in the first test case, I have two 1's, so I can get one point from them.

But, in the explanation, Nene plays in a way that minimizes my score.

Wait, but in the program, it's just counting the number of pairs I have in my hand.

Is that sufficient?

Wait, in the first test case, I have one pair (two 1's), so the program outputs 1, which matches the example.

In the second test case, I have two pairs (two 8's and two 5's), so the program would output 2, which matches the second output in the example.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6, so I have:

- 7: one

- 1: one

- 4: two

- 5: one

- 3: one

- 2: one

- 6: one

So, only one pair (two 4's), so the program outputs 1, which matches the third output in the example.

In the fourth test case, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3, so no pairs, output 0.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards are 1, so no pair, output 0.

So, in all the examples, the program seems to be correct.

But is this logic generally correct?

Let me think about it.

The key is to maximize my points, knowing that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, Nene will try to prevent me from getting points.

But in this setup, the only way Nene can prevent me from getting points is by playing cards that would block my ability to pair them.

Wait, but in the game, the way points are awarded is only when a player plays a card that has already been played by either player.

So, Nene can control which cards are on the table at what time.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have two cards of the same number, say x.

If I play the first x early in the game, and Nene plays another card y before I play the second x, then when I play the second x, it will get a point, because x is already on the table.

But Nene can try to play in a way that maximizes the number of times she plays a card that's already on the table, and minimizes the number of times I can do so.

Wait, but in reality, since Nene knows my hand, she can see which numbers I have duplicates of, and she can try to play those numbers at times that minimize my ability to get points.

Wait, but in the program, it's just counting the number of pairs I have, assuming that for each pair, I can get one point.

Is that always true, regardless of Nene's play?

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think of a scenario where having a pair doesn't necessarily lead to getting a point.

Suppose n=2, my hand is 1,1, and Nene's hand is 2,2.

If I play 1, then Nene plays 2, then I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 2 and gets a point.

So, I get one point.

But if Nene plays 2, then I play 1, then Nene plays 2, then I play 1 and get a point.

Still, I get one point.

So, in this case, having a pair allows me to get one point, regardless of the order.

Another scenario: n=3, my hand is 1,1,2, Nene's hand is 2,3,3.

If I play 1, Nene plays 2, I play 1 and get a point, Nene plays 3, I play 2 and get a point, Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

Wait, in this case, I get two points: one from each 1 and one from 2.

Wait, but according to the program, I have one pair (two 1's), so it would output 1, but in this scenario, I got two points.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, in this scenario, I have two 1's and one 2.

Nene has one 2 and two 3's.

So, according to the program, I have one pair (two 1's), so it should output 1.

But in the scenario I just described, I got two points: one from playing the second 1 and one from playing the second 2.

Wait, but in that scenario, I played the second 2 and got a point because the first 2 was already played by Nene.

But did I have a pair of 2's in my hand? No, I only had one 2.

So, according to the program, I should only get one point from the pair of 1's.

But in that scenario, I got two points: one from the second 1 and one from the second 2.

Wait, but the program only counts pairs in my hand, not considering pairs that might be formed with Nene's plays.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood.

Wait, in the program, it's counting the number of pairs I have in my hand, and assuming that for each pair, I can get one point.

But in the scenario I just described, I have only one pair (two 1's), and according to the program, I should get one point.

But in the scenario, I got two points: one from the second 1 and one from the second 2.

Wait, but the second 2 is not a pair in my hand; I only have one 2.

So, how did I get a point from playing the second 2?

Because Nene had played the first 2 before I played the second 2.

So, even though I only have one 2, if Nene has the other 2 and plays it before I play my 2, then when I play my 2, it's already on the table, so I get a point.

So, in this case, I can get a point from a number that appears only once in my hand, if Nene has the other card and plays it before I play mine.

But according to the program, it only counts pairs in my hand, so it would only count the pair of 1's and output 1, but in reality, I got two points.

So, in this scenario, the program would be incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this scenario, Nene would want to minimize my score.

So, she would play her 2 before I play my second 2, to make sure I get a point from it.

Wait, but in the scenario I described, she played 2 before I played my 2, and I got a point.

But Nene is trying to maximize her score, which would involve playing cards that are already on the table.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to understand Nene's optimal strategy.

Nene wants to maximize her own points and, secondarily, minimize my points.

So, she will prioritize playing cards that are already on the table to get points, but among those, she will choose the ones that minimize my potential points.

Wait, but if she plays a card that I have another copy of, that would allow me to play my copy later and get a point.

So, perhaps she would avoid playing cards that I have duplicates of, to prevent me from getting points.

Wait, but she wants to maximize her own points, so she needs to play cards that are already on the table.

It's a bit tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose that for each number, I look at how many cards of that number I have and how many Nene has.

For each number, there are two cards in total.

If I have both cards, then I can guarantee that I get one point from that number, because I can play the first one and then the second one, getting a point on the second one.

If I have one card and Nene has the other, then whether I can get a point from that number depends on the ordering of plays.

Specifically, if Nene plays her card before I play my card, then when I play my card, I get a point.

If I play my card before Nene plays her card, then when Nene plays her card, she gets a point.

But Nene wants to maximize her own points, so she would prefer to play her card after I play mine, to get a point herself.

But she also wants to minimize my points, so if she has to choose between playing a card that allows me to get a point or not, she would choose not to.

Wait, but if she plays her card before I play mine, then I get a point when I play mine.

If she plays her card after I play mine, then she gets a point when she plays hers.

So, to minimize my points, she would prefer to play her card before I play mine, so that I get a point.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, no, if she plays her card before I play mine, then when I play mine, I get a point.

But she wants to minimize my points, so she would prefer that I don't get that point.

So, perhaps she would choose to play her card after I play mine, so that I don't get a point.

But then she gets a point herself.

Wait, it's complicated.

Let me think about it step by step.

For numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other:

- If Nene plays her card before I play mine, then when I play mine, I get a point.

- If Nene plays her card after I play mine, then when she plays hers, she gets a point.

Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, for these numbers, she would prefer to play her card after I play mine, so that she gets a point instead of me.

Therefore, for numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other, I cannot count on getting a point from that number, because Nene will play her card after mine, giving her a point instead.

For numbers where I have two cards:

- I can play the first one, and then the second one to get a point.

Nene cannot interfere with this, because even if she plays other cards in between, I can still get the point from playing the second one.

Therefore, for each pair that I have, I can guarantee one point.

For numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other, I cannot guarantee a point from that number, because Nene can choose to play her card after mine, preventing me from getting a point.

Therefore, the maximum number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs that I have in my hand.

That seems to align with the program's logic.

Wait, but earlier I thought of a scenario where I got a point from a number I have only one of, but according to this, that shouldn't happen.

Let me revisit that scenario.

Scenario:

n=3

My hand: 1,1,2

Nene's hand: 2,3,3

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 2.

3. I play 1 and get a point.

4. Nene plays 3.

5. I play 2 and get a point.

6. Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

In this sequence, I got two points: one from the second 1 and one from the second 2.

But according to the previous reasoning, for the number 2, I have only one card, so I shouldn't count on getting a point from it, because Nene could have played her 2 before I played mine.

In this sequence, Nene played 2 before I played my 2, so when I played my 2, I got a point.

But Nene could have played her 3 instead.

Wait, but Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this situation, Nene would prefer to play her 2 before I play mine, so that I get a point, but she also wants to maximize her own points.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the entire sequence.

Let me consider all possible sequences.

Option 1:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 2.

3. I play 1 and get a point.

4. Nene plays 3.

5. I play 2 and get a point.

6. Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

In this case, I get two points.

Option 2:

1. I play 1.

2. Nene plays 3.

3. I play 1 and get a point.

4. Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

5. I play 2.

6. Nene plays 2 and gets a point.

In this case, I get one point.

Option 3:

1. I play 2.

2. Nene plays 1.

3. I play 1 and get a point.

4. Nene plays 3.

5. I play 2 and get a point.

6. Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

In this case, I get one point.

Wait, in option 3, I played 2 first, then Nene plays 1, then I play 1 and get a point, then Nene plays 3, I play 2 and get a point, Nene plays 3 and gets a point.

So, I get one point from the second 1 and one point from the second 2.

Wait, but according to Nene's optimal play, she could have played her 2 instead of 1 in step 2.

Wait, Nene will choose the move that maximizes her score and minimizes mine.

So, in step 2, Nene has choices: play 2 or play 3.

If she plays 2, then when I play my 2 later, I get a point.

If she plays 3, then when I play my 2, I don't get a point, but she might get a point later.

Nene needs to balance between maximizing her own points and minimizing mine.

In this scenario, perhaps Nene would choose to play 3 in step 2, to maximize her own points.

Then, in step 5, when I play 2, it's not already on the table, so I don't get a point.

In step 6, Nene plays 2 and gets a point.

So, in this case, I only get one point from the second 1.

Therefore, in this scenario, if Nene plays optimally, she would choose to play 3 in step 2, to maximize her own points, even though it allows me to play my 2 without getting a point.

Wait, but in this case, by playing 3 in step 2, Nene ensures that I don't get a point from playing my 2 in step 5.

Alternatively, if she plays 2 in step 2, then when I play my 2 in step 5, I get a point.

So, by playing 3 in step 2, she prevents me from getting that point.

Therefore, Nene would choose to play 3 in step 2, to minimize my points.

Hence, in this scenario, I only get one point, which matches the program's output.

Wait, but in the earlier sequence, I thought I could get two points, but with Nene playing optimally, she can reduce my points to one.

Therefore, the program's logic seems correct: it counts the number of pairs I have in my hand, which corresponds to the points I can guarantee, assuming Nene plays optimally to minimize my points.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points you can achieve in a card game against Nene, given optimal play from both sides.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - You and Nene each have `n` cards with integers from 1 to `n`, where each integer appears exactly twice across the entire deck.
   - Players take turns placing one card at a time on the table. A player scores a point if the card they play is already present on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   
2. **Insight**:
   - For integers where you have two cards, you can guarantee one point by playing the second card after the first is on the table.
   - For integers where you have only one card, Nene can prevent you from scoring by strategically placing her card for that integer at the right time.
   
3. **Solution**:
   - Count the number of integers for which you have two cards in your hand. Each such integer contributes one point to your score.

## Solution Code

```python
import sys

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
        for x in a:
            cnt[x] += 1
        ans = 0
        for x in cnt:
            ans += max(0, x - 1)
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `n` and the list of integers in your hand.
  
- **Counting Pairs**:
  - Use a list `cnt` to count occurrences of each integer in your hand.
  - For each integer that appears twice in your hand, you can score one point.
  
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, output the number of such pairs, which represents the maximum points you can guarantee.

This approach ensures that you calculate the maximum achievable points under optimal play conditions, focusing on the pairs you can control.
