Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about a game on a tree structure with n nodes, and there are t rounds, but in this easy version, t is always 1. The tree has exactly two leaves, which makes it sort of like an array because in an array, the first and last elements are the leaves.

The game starts with a stone on one node, which is activated, and then players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor, activating it in the process. Ron starts first, then Hermione, and they alternate until someone can't make a move. The player who can't move loses.

I need to figure out, for a given starting node, who wins if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the structure of the tree. Since it's a tree with exactly two leaves, it's essentially a straight line, like a path graph. So, the nodes are connected in a linear fashion, forming a path from one leaf to the other.

Given that, I can represent the tree as a list or deque where the order of nodes reflects their connectivity.

Now, the game is about moving the stone along this path, activating nodes as we go. It's similar to a game of nim on a path, where players take turns to move to an adjacent unactivated node.

I need to determine, for a given starting position, whether the first player, Ron, can force a win, or if Hermione can prevent him from winning.

Let me think about game theory here. In impartial games like this, the concept of nimbers or the mex function might be applicable.

But perhaps there's a simpler way since the tree is just a path.

Let's consider the distance from the starting node to each leaf. The game can be thought of as moving the stone towards one of the two leaves, and the player who ends up moving the stone to the last unactivated node wins.

Wait, no. The player who cannot make a move loses, so the player who moves the stone to the last unactivated node wins, because the opponent can't move anymore.

But in this setup, since it's a path, once you start from a node, you can choose to move towards one leaf or the other, but you have to follow the path.

Actually, in a path graph, the game is similar to moving a token on a line, and the game ends when you can't move the token anymore.

I recall that in such games, the outcome often depends on the parity of the number of moves available.

Let me try to model this.

Suppose the tree is a straight path with nodes labeled from 1 to n, where 1 and n are the leaves.

If the starting node is, say, node k, then the number of moves Ron can make initially is the number of inactive neighbors, which is either 1 or 2, depending on whether k is a leaf or not.

But wait, at the start, all nodes are inactive, but once a node is activated, its neighbors become available for moving to.

Actually, in this game, moving the stone to an inactive neighbor activates that neighbor, so the game progresses by activating one new node per move.

The game ends when the current player cannot move the stone to any inactive neighbor.

I need to find out, for a given starting node, whether Ron can force a win or not, assuming both play optimally.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of moves possible from the starting node.

Let me consider some small examples.

Example 1:

Input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

Output:

Ron

So, the tree has 3 nodes: 1 - 3 - 2

Starting node is 3.

Ron moves first. From 3, he can move to either 1 or 2.

If he moves to 1, then Hermione can move to 3 (but 3 is already activated), but wait, moving to an activated node is not allowed. So, from 1, the only move is to 3, but 3 is already activated, so Hermione can't move and loses. But according to the output, Ron wins, which suggests that in this case, Ron can force a win.

Wait, but in this scenario, if Ron moves to 1, Hermione can't move anywhere, so Ron wins.

Alternatively, if Ron moves to 2, Hermione can move to 3, and then Ron can't move anymore, so Hermione wins.

But the output is "Ron", which suggests that Ron can choose the move that leads to his victory.

So, Ron chooses to move to 1, forcing Hermione into a losing position.

Example 2:

Input:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

Output:

Hermione

Tree: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5

Starting node is 5.

Ron moves first. From 5, he can only move to 4.

Then Hermione moves to 3.

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 1.

Now, Ron can't move anymore, so Hermione wins.

But according to the output, Hermione wins.

So, in this case, no matter what Ron does, Hermione can force a win.

From these examples, it seems that the winner depends on the number of moves possible.

In the first example, there are 2 possible moves from the starting node (to 1 or 2), and Ron wins.

In the second example, there is only 1 possible move from the starting node (to 4), and Hermione wins.

It seems like if the number of moves is odd, Hermione wins, and if it's even, Ron wins.

Wait, in the first example, number of moves is 2, which is even, and Ron wins.

In the second example, number of moves is 4, which is even, but Hermione wins.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the first example, the game ends after 2 moves: Ron moves to 1, Hermione can't move.

In the second example, the game ends after 4 moves: Ron to 4, Hermione to 3, Ron to 2, Hermione to 1, and Ron can't move.

So, when the total number of moves is even, Ron wins if he can force it, but in the second example, Hermione wins even though the total moves are even.

This suggests that my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I should consider the distance from the starting node to the two leaves.

In the first example, starting at node 3, distances to leaves are 1 to node 1 and 1 to node 2.

In the second example, starting at node 5, distance to the only leaf is 4 steps to node 1.

Wait, but in the first example, the tree is more like a line with nodes 1, 3, 2, where 1 and 2 are leaves.

Wait, no, in the first example, nodes are 1, 2, 3, with connections 2-3 and 3-1, so it's a line: 2 - 3 - 1.

Wait, but in the input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

So, nodes are connected as 2-3 and 3-1, so indeed, it's a path: 2 - 3 - 1.

So, starting at 3, Ron can choose to move to 1 or to 2.

If he moves to 1, Hermione can't move anywhere because 3 is already activated, so Hermione loses.

If he moves to 2, Hermione moves to 3, Ron can't move anymore, so Ron loses.

So, Ron has a choice to make a move that leads to his victory or defeat.

Hence, if Ron chooses wisely, he can win.

In the second example:

5 nodes: 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5

Starting at 5, Ron can only move to 4.

Then Hermione moves to 3.

Ron moves to 2.

Hermione moves to 1.

Ron can't move, so Hermione wins.

So, in this case, no matter what Ron does, Hermione can force a win.

So, perhaps the key is to look at the number of moves available from the starting node, or the distances to the leaves.

Wait, maybe it's about the parity of the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

In the first example, distances to leaves are both 1, which is odd.

Ron wins.

In the second example, distance to the leaf is 4, which is even, and Hermione wins.

Wait, but in the first example, distances are 1 and 1, both odd, Ron wins.

In the second example, distance is 4, even, Hermione wins.

So, perhaps if the minimum distance to a leaf is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

Wait, in the first example, distance is odd, Ron wins.

In the second, even, Hermione wins.

Let me check another example.

Suppose n=4, t=1

Connections:

1 - 2

2 - 3

3 - 4

Starting node: 2

Distances to leaves: 1 to node 1, 2 to node 4.

Minimum distance is 1, which is odd.

So, Ron should win.

Let's simulate:

Ron moves to 1, Hermione can't move, Ron wins.

Alternatively, Ron moves to 3, Hermione moves to 4, Ron can't move, Hermione wins.

So, Ron can choose to move to 1 and win, or move to 3 and lose.

So, Ron can force a win.

Another example:

n=4, t=1

Connections:

1 - 2

2 - 3

3 - 4

Starting node: 3

Distances to leaves: 1 to node 4, 2 to node 1.

Minimum distance is 1, which is odd.

So, Ron should win.

Simulation:

Ron moves to 4, Hermione can't move, Ron wins.

Alternatively, Ron moves to 2, Hermione moves to 1, Ron can't move, Hermione wins.

So, Ron can choose to move to 4 and win.

This seems consistent with the earlier observation.

Wait, but in the second example, n=5, starting at 5, distance to leaf is 4, even, Hermione wins.

So, perhaps the rule is: if the minimum distance to a leaf is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

But in the first example, n=3, starting at 3, distance to leaves is 1, odd, Ron wins.

In the second example, n=5, starting at 5, distance to leaf is 4, even, Hermione wins.

Another example: n=4, starting at 2, distances to leaves are 1 and 2, minimum is 1, odd, Ron wins.

Another example: n=4, starting at 3, distances to leaves are 1 and 2, minimum is 1, odd, Ron wins.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but in the second example, n=5, starting at 5, distance to leaf is 4, even, Hermione wins.

So, generalizing, if the minimum distance from the starting node to any leaf is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

This seems to hold for the given examples.

So, in the code, I need to compute the distance from the starting node to each leaf, take the minimum of those distances, and check if it's odd or even.

If min distance is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

Wait, but in the first example, n=3, starting at 3, distance to leaves is 1, odd, Ron wins.

In the second example, n=5, starting at 5, distance to leaf is 4, even, Hermione wins.

In the additional example I thought of, n=4, starting at 2, distances to leaves are 1 and 2, minimum is 1, odd, Ron wins.

Another example: n=4, starting at 3, distances to leaves are 1 and 2, minimum is 1, odd, Ron wins.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the first example, starting at 3, Ron can choose to move to 2 instead of 1, leading to his loss.

But since he can choose to move to 1 and win, he has a winning strategy.

So, the rule seems to hold.

Now, how to implement this efficiently, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5.

I need an efficient way to find the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

First, I need to identify the leaves of the tree.

Given that the tree has exactly two leaves, I can find them by looking for nodes with degree 1.

Then, for each starting node, compute the distance to each leaf and take the minimum.

But since t=1, I only need to do this once for the given starting node.

To compute the distances efficiently, I can perform a BFS from each leaf and find the distances to all other nodes, but that would be time-consuming for large n.

Alternatively, since the tree is a path, I can represent it as a list or deque and find the positions of the leaves.

Wait, since it's a path, I can linearly order the nodes from one leaf to the other.

Then, for a given starting node, its position in this path determines its distances to the two leaves.

So, if I can find the positions of all nodes in the path, I can easily compute the distances.

For example, in the first sample input:

n=3, edges: 2-3 and 3-1.

So, the path is 2 - 3 - 1.

Starting at 3, distances to leaves are 1 (to 1) and 1 (to 2).

In the second sample input:

n=5, edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5.

Path is 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5.

Starting at 5, distance to leaf is 4 (to node 1).

So, if I can linearly order the nodes, I can find the position of the starting node and compute the distances to both ends.

This seems efficient.

Now, how to linearly order the nodes.

I can find one leaf, then perform a BFS to get the path to the other leaf.

This way, I can get the linear order of nodes from one leaf to the other.

Once I have this order, I can assign indices to each node based on their position in the path.

Then, for a given starting node, its distance to each leaf is its index from that leaf.

So, if the path is [1,2,3,4,5], and starting at 5, distance to leaf 1 is 4, to leaf 5 is 0.

But since leaves are the endpoints, and the tree has exactly two leaves, this should work.

Now, in the code provided, it seems to be trying to build this linear path.

Let's look at the code:

from functools import reduce

import math

from collections import deque

t = 1

for i in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())

tree = deque()

empty = True

for i in range(n - 1):

(u, v) = map(int, input().split())

if empty:

tree.append(u)

tree.append(v)

empty = False

elif v == tree[0]:

tree.appendleft(u)

elif v == tree[-1]:

tree.append(u)

elif u == tree[0]:

tree.appendleft(v)

elif u == tree[-1]:

tree.append(v)

start = int(input())

idx = tree.index(start)

moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]

if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves]):

print('Ron')

else:

print('Hermione')

So, it's using a deque to build the linear order of the tree.

It starts by adding the first two connected nodes, then iteratively adds the next connected nodes to either end of the deque.

This way, it constructs the path from one leaf to the other.

Then, it finds the index of the starting node in this deque.

Then, it calculates two moves: min(t, idx) and min(t, n - idx - 1), which seem to represent the distances to the two leaves.

Wait, but t is always 1 in this easy version, so min(t, idx) would be min(1, idx), which is 1 if idx >=1, else 0.

Similarly, min(t, n - idx -1).

But in the problem, t is the number of rounds, which is 1, but I think here, t is not relevant for calculating distances.

Maybe the variable name is misleading.

In the problem, t is the number of rounds, but in this code, it seems to be using t in a different way.

Wait, in the problem, t is the number of rounds, but in this easy version, t=1, and all rounds are played with the same tree.

But in the code, t is read from input, but since t=1, it only processes one starting node.

But in the moves calculation, it uses min(t, idx), which seems odd because t is 1.

Maybe it's a mistake, and it should just use idx and n - idx -1.

Let me check with the first sample input.

n=3, t=1

tree: deque([2,3,1])

start=3, idx=1

moves = [min(1,1), min(1,3-1-1)=min(1,1)]=[1,1]

Then, check if any of them is odd, which they are, so print 'Ron'

Which matches the first sample.

In the second sample:

n=5, t=1

tree: deque([1,2,3,4,5])

start=5, idx=4

moves = [min(1,4), min(1,5-4-1)=min(1,0)=0], so [1,0]

Then, check if any is odd: 1 is odd, so print 'Ron'

But in the sample output, it's 'Hermione'.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the second sample, starting at 5, distance to leaf 1 is 4, which is even, so Hermione wins.

But according to the code, it would print 'Ron' because min(1,4)=1 is odd.

But according to our earlier reasoning, it should be Hermione.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the number of moves is not directly the index, but the distance to the leaves.

In the first sample, starting at 3, distances to leaves are 1 and 1, both odd, so Ron wins.

In the second sample, starting at 5, distance to leaf 1 is 4, which is even, so Hermione wins.

So, the code should check if the minimum distance is odd or even.

But in the code, it's taking min(t, idx) and min(t, n - idx -1), which for t=1, is min(1, idx) and min(1, n - idx -1).

But in the second sample, min(1,4)=1 and min(1,0)=0, so moves=[1,0]

Then, check if any move is odd: 1 is odd, so print 'Ron'

But according to the problem, it should be 'Hermione'

So, the code is incorrect.

It seems that the code is incorrectly calculating the number of moves.

Instead, it should calculate the actual distances to the leaves.

In the second sample, starting at 5, distance to leaf 1 is 4, which is even, so Hermione wins.

But according to the code, it would see min(1,4)=1, which is odd, and print 'Ron', which is incorrect.

So, the code is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the variable t is being misused.

In the problem, t is the number of rounds, but in the code, it's being used in min(t, idx), which doesn't make sense in this context.

Maybe t should not be used here.

Perhaps it should just use idx and n - idx -1 as the distances to the two leaves.

Then, take the minimum of these two distances and check if it's odd or even.

If the minimum distance is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

In the first sample:

idx=1, distances=[1,1], min=1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second sample:

idx=4, distances=[4,0], min=0 (even), Hermione wins.

This matches the expected outputs.

So, the code should be modified to not use t in the min function.

Instead, moves should be [idx, n - idx -1]

Then, take the minimum of these two, and check if it's odd or even.

If min(moves) % 2 == 1, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the code, it's using min(t, idx) and min(t, n - idx -1), which is incorrect because t is always 1 in this version.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
