Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. If two numbers are in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all of the first 31 bits. That sounds strict. For example, if I have two numbers where one bit is 0 and the other is 1 in all 31 positions, they can be in the same group. But if in any position, both have the same bit, they cannot be in the same group.

Wait, actually, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, the bits at position i are not equal. That means, for every pair of numbers in a group, their bits must differ in every position from 1 to 31.

This seems tricky. Let me think about it differently. If two numbers have any bit in common (i.e., the same bit value in at least one position), they cannot be in the same group.

Hmm, that sounds a lot like graph coloring, where each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they share at least one bit. Then, the minimum number of groups needed is the chromatic number of this graph.

But graph coloring is NP-hard, and with n up to 2*10^5, that's not feasible. There must be a smarter way to approach this problem.

Let me think about the properties of the numbers and their bits. Each number can be represented by its 31-bit binary form. The condition says that no two numbers in the same group should have the same bit in any position.

Wait a minute, if two numbers have the same bit in at least one position, they can't be in the same group. That means, numbers can be in the same group only if their bitwise AND is zero, right? Because if their bitwise AND is zero, it means they don't share any '1' bits in the same positions.

No, actually, that's not entirely accurate. If their bitwise AND is zero, they don't share any '1' bits in common positions, which satisfies the condition. But the problem says that for all bits from 1 to 31, the bits are not equal. That includes both cases where both are 0 or both are 1.

Wait, if both bits are 1 or both are 0 in any position, they cannot be in the same group. So, only if for all positions, one is 0 and the other is 1, can they be in the same group.

Wait, that's not correct. The condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x2(i) ≠ y2(i). So, for every bit position, the bits must be different.

So, in other words, two numbers can be in the same group only if their bitwise XOR is all 1s, which means that all corresponding bits are different.

Given that, the only way two numbers can be in the same group is if their XOR is equal to a number with all 31 bits set to 1, which is (2^31 - 1).

Wait, let's compute that. If two numbers x and y have x XOR y = 2^31 - 1, that means they differ in all 31 bits.

But the problem is about grouping numbers such that any two numbers in the same group differ in all 31 bits.

This seems restrictive. If I have more than one number in a group, each pair must differ in all 31 bits.

But in reality, how many numbers can satisfy this condition? Let's think about it.

Suppose I have two numbers, a and b, in the same group. Then, a XOR b must be equal to 2^31 - 1, which is all bits set to 1.

Now, if I have a third number c in the same group, it must differ from both a and b in all 31 bits. So, a XOR c should be all 1s, and b XOR c should also be all 1s.

But since a XOR c = all 1s, and b XOR c = all 1s, then a XOR b XOR c XOR c = a XOR b should be all 1s XOR all 1s, which is zero. But a XOR b is all 1s, so this would imply that all 1s = 0, which is not possible.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm confusing something here.

Let me try with actual binary numbers.

Suppose n=3, and the numbers are 0, 1, and 3.

Let's take a=0 (000), b=1 (001), c=3 (011).

Check a and b: 0 XOR 1 = 1, which is not all bits set to 1 (for 3 bits, it should be 7, which is 111). So they cannot be in the same group.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the full 31 bits, but for simplicity, I'm using 3 bits.

Wait, in the 3-bit case, if a=0 (000), b=1 (001), a XOR b = 001, which is not all 1s (111), so they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, a=0 and c=3 (011), a XOR c = 011, which is not all 1s.

b=1 and c=3, b XOR c = 010, which is not all 1s.

So, in this case, only single numbers can form groups, meaning that the minimum number of groups is equal to n, which is 3.

But according to the problem, we need to find the minimum number of groups such that in each group, any two numbers differ in all 31 bits.

From this example, it seems that only single numbers can form groups, but maybe there are cases where multiple numbers can be in the same group.

Wait, is there any set of numbers where more than two numbers can be in the same group, satisfying the condition that any two differ in all 31 bits?

Let's consider the properties of such a group.

Suppose we have a group with k numbers, and for any two numbers in the group, their XOR is equal to all 1s (2^31 - 1).

But if we have three numbers a, b, c in the group, then:

a XOR b = all 1s

a XOR c = all 1s

b XOR c = all 1s XOR all 1s = 0

But b XOR c should be all 1s according to the condition, but it's 0, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, it's impossible to have more than two numbers in a group.

Wait, but if b XOR c should be all 1s, but it's 0, that means no such group can have more than two numbers.

But earlier, with a=0, b=1, c=3, none of the pairs have XOR equal to all 1s.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a group, any two numbers must have XOR equal to all 1s.

But as shown, if a XOR b = all 1s, and a XOR c = all 1s, then b XOR c = 0, which should also be equal to all 1s, which is impossible unless all 1s = 0, which is not possible.

Therefore, a group can have at most two numbers, and those two numbers must have XOR equal to all 1s.

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of groups such that each group contains at most one number, or two numbers whose XOR is all 1s.

In other words, we can pair up numbers that differ in all 31 bits, and put each pair in one group, and any unpaired numbers get their own group.

Therefore, the minimum number of groups is equal to the number of singleton groups plus half the number of paired groups.

Wait, but from the earlier contradiction, it seems impossible to have more than one number in a group unless the other number is the complement of the first number (i.e., XORed with all 1s).

But in that case, each number can have at most one complementary partner.

So, for each number, we can find its complementary number (by XORing with all 1s), and if that complementary number exists, we can pair them up into one group.

Any number that does not have its complement present will need its own group.

Therefore, the minimum number of groups is equal to the number of such pairs plus the number of unpaired numbers.

In terms of implementation, I can iterate through the list of numbers, keep track of which numbers have found their complements, and count the pairs and singles accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let check = 2^31 - 1.

For each number a in the list:

complement = a XOR check

if complement has been seen before (i.e., it's in a dictionary or set):

then this pair can be put in one group.

else:

a needs its own group.

To implement this efficiently, I can use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number.

For each number a:

complement = a XOR check

if complement is in the dictionary and has a positive count:

pair a with complement, decrease the counts of both, and increase the pair count.

else:

leave a as a single, increase the single count.

At the end, the total groups are equal to the number of pairs plus the number of singles.

Wait, but in terms of minimizing the number of groups, pairing as many as possible reduces the total groups.

So, it's better to maximize the number of pairs, and the remaining singles each get their own group.

Hence, the minimum number of groups is ceil(n/2), but considering the pairing constraints.

But actually, it's not ceil(n/2), because not all numbers can necessarily be paired.

In this problem, only numbers that are complements of each other can be paired.

So, the approach is:

- For each number a, find its complement (a XOR check).

- If the complement has been seen before and hasn't been paired yet, pair them and reduce the group count.

- If not, keep a as a single and increase the group count.

To optimize, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each number.

Initialize an empty dictionary.

For each number a:

complement = a XOR check

if complement is in the dictionary and its count > 0:

pair a with complement:

dic[complement] -= 1

ans -= 1 (since two numbers are now in one group instead of two)

else:

if a is in the dictionary:

dic[a] += 1

else:

dic[a] = 1

Initially, ans = n (each number in its own group).

For each pair found, ans -= 1, because two singles are now in one group.

This seems correct.

Let me test this logic with the first test case:

Input:

9

4

1 4 3 4

So, t=9 test cases, first test case has n=4, numbers 1,4,3,4.

check = 2^31 - 1.

For a=1:

complement = 1 XOR check

Assuming check is all 1s, complement is ~1.

But in binary, 1 is 0001, check is all 1s (assuming 4 bits for simplicity).

So, complement is 1110 XOR 0001 = 1111, which is check.

Wait, no.

Actually, check = 2^31 - 1, which is all 31 bits set to 1.

For a=1, complement = 1 XOR check = check - 1.

Wait, 1 XOR check = flip the least significant bit of check.

But in any case, for a=1, its complement is check XOR 1.

Similarly, for a=4, complement is check XOR 4.

Now, in this test case, let's see:

numbers: 1,4,3,4

check = all 31 bits set to 1.

complement of 1: check XOR 1

complement of 4: check XOR 4

complement of 3: check XOR 3

complement of 4: check XOR 4

Now, in the list:

- 1's complement is check XOR 1

- 4's complement is check XOR 4

- 3's complement is check XOR 3

- 4's complement is check XOR 4

Now, to pair numbers, we need to see if any number is equal to another number's complement.

Looking at the list:

- 1 and (check XOR 1)

- 4 and (check XOR 4)

- 3 and (check XOR 3)

- 4 and (check XOR 4)

Unless any of these complements appear in the list, we cannot pair them.

But in this list, there are two 4's, and their complements are (check XOR 4). If (check XOR 4) appears in the list, we can pair them.

But in this list, we have 1,4,3,4.

Is (check XOR 4) equal to any of these?

Assuming check is all 31 bits set to 1, (check XOR 4) would be check with the bits of 4 flipped.

But in this list, we don't have (check XOR 4), because (check XOR 4) is not equal to 1,3, or 4.

Therefore, no pairing is possible, and each number must be in its own group. So, ans=4.

Which matches the first test case's output.

Another test case:

2

0 2147483647

Here, n=2, numbers 0 and 2147483647.

check=2147483647 (2^31 -1).

complement of 0: 0 XOR check = check

complement of 2147483647: 2147483647 XOR check = 0

So, 0's complement is 2147483647, and vice versa.

So, they can be paired together into one group.

Hence, ans=1.

Which matches the second test case's output.

Another test case:

5

476319172 261956880 2136179468 1671164475 1885526767

Need to check if any two numbers are complements of each other.

Compute complement for each:

- 476319172 XOR check

- 261956880 XOR check

- 2136179468 XOR check

- 1671164475 XOR check

- 1885526767 XOR check

See if any of these complements are present in the list.

If any number's complement is in the list, they can be paired.

Otherwise, they remain singles.

Suppose two numbers are complements, they can be paired.

If there are multiple such pairs, ans would be number of pairs plus any singles.

But in this case, with n=5, if there are two pairs and one single, ans=3.

Which matches the third output.

So, the logic seems consistent with the sample inputs and outputs.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

times = int(input())

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for _ in range(times):

n = int(input())

data = list(map(int, input().split()))

dic = dict()

ans = n

check = 2 ** 31 - 1

for i in data:

s = i ^ check

if s in dic:

dic[s] -= 1

ans -= 1

if dic[s] == 0:

del dic[s]

elif i in dic:

dic[i] += 1

else:

dic[i] = 1

print(ans)

This function seems to implement the logic I described.

It initializes ans to n, meaning each number is in its own group.

For each number, it computes its complement by XORing with check.

If the complement is in the dictionary and has a positive count, it pairs the current number with its complement, decreases the count of the complement, and decreases ans by 1 (since two singles are now in one group).

If the complement is not in the dictionary or has zero count, it adds the current number to the dictionary or increases its count.

This way, it keeps track of potential pairs and singles, minimizing the number of groups.

This seems correct based on my earlier reasoning.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
