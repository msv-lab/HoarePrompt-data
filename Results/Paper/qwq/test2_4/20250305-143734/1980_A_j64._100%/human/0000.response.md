Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad wants to hold m rounds of something, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. That means, for each round, he needs one problem of each of these seven levels.

Now, he already has a bank of n problems, each with a difficulty from A to G. But it's possible that he doesn't have enough problems of certain difficulties to cover all m rounds. So, he might need to create some new problems to make up for the shortages.

My task is to figure out the minimum number of new problems Vlad needs to create so that he can hold all m rounds, each with one problem of each difficulty level.

Let's look at the example provided to understand better.

Example:

Input:

3

10 1

BGECDCBDED

10 2

BGECDCBDED

9 1

BBCDEFFGG

Output:

2

5

1

So, for the first test case: n=10, m=1, and a='BGECDCBDED'.

He needs one round with one problem of each difficulty: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Looking at the string 'BGECDCBDED', let's count how many of each difficulty he has:

B: 3

G: 1

E: 3

C: 2

D: 3

A: 0

F: 0

So, he's missing problems of difficulty A and F. Therefore, he needs to create 2 new problems.

That makes sense.

Second test case: n=10, m=2, a='BGECDCBDED'

He needs 2 rounds, each with one of A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

So, he needs 2 problems of each difficulty.

From the same counts as above:

B: 3 (enough for 2)

G: 1 (needs 1 more)

E: 3 (enough for 2)

C: 2 (enough for 2)

D: 3 (enough for 2)

A: 0 (needs 2)

F: 0 (needs 2)

So, he needs to create 1 more G, 2 A's, and 2 F's, totaling 5 new problems.

Third test case: n=9, m=1, a='BBCDEFFGG'

He needs one round with one of each difficulty.

Counts:

B: 2

C: 1

D: 1

E: 1

F: 2

G: 2

A: 0

He's missing A, so he needs to create 1 new problem.

Okay, so the general approach seems to be:

- For each test case, count the number of problems Vlad has for each difficulty.

- For each difficulty (A to G), calculate how many more problems he needs to reach at least m problems of that difficulty.

- Sum up all these shortfalls to get the total number of new problems he needs to create.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = input()

print(func_1(n, m, a))

def func_1(n, m, a):

count = [0] * 7

for char in a:

count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1

needed_problems = 0

for i in range(7):

if count[i] < m:

needed_problems += m - count[i]

return needed_problems

Let's break this down.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and m, and the string a.

It calls func_1 with n, m, and a, and prints the result.

In func_1:

- It initializes a list count with 7 zeros, representing the counts for A to G.

- It iterates through the string a, and for each character, it increments the corresponding index in count. It does this by calculating ord(char) - ord('A'), which gives the zero-based index for the letter (A=0, B=1, ..., G=6).

- Then, it initializes needed_problems to 0.

- It loops through the count list, and for each difficulty, if the count is less than m, it adds m - count[i] to needed_problems.

- Finally, it returns needed_problems.

This seems to match the approach I outlined earlier.

Let me verify with the first test case:

n=10, m=1, a='BGECDCBDED'

count:

B (1): 3

G (6): 1

E (4): 3

C (2): 2

D (3): 3

A (0): 0

F (5): 0

So, for each difficulty:

A: 0 < 1, need 1

B: 3 >= 1, no need

C: 2 >= 1, no need

D: 3 >= 1, no need

E: 3 >= 1, no need

F: 0 < 1, need 1

G: 1 >= 1, no need

Total needed: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the example.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, a='BGECDCBDED'

count:

B: 3

G: 1

E: 3

C: 2

D: 3

A: 0

F: 0

Needed:

A: 0 < 2, need 2

B: 3 >= 2, no need

C: 2 >= 2, no need

D: 3 >= 2, no need

E: 3 >= 2, no need

F: 0 < 2, need 2

G: 1 < 2, need 1

Total: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, which matches.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, a='BBCDEFFGG'

count:

B: 2

C: 1

D:1

E:1

F:2

G:2

A:0

Needed:

A: 0 < 1, need 1

B: 2 >= 1, no need

C: 1 >= 1, no need

D:1 >=1, no need

E:1 >=1, no need

F:2 >=1, no need

G:2 >=1, no need

Total: 1, which matches.

So, the program seems correct based on the examples.

Let me think about edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

t=1

n=7, m=1

A B C D E F G

count:

A:1

B:1

C:1

D:1

E:1

F:1

G:1

Needed: 0 for all, total 0.

Edge Case 2:

t=1

n=0, m=1

Empty string

count all 0

Needed: 7 problems.

Edge Case 3:

t=1

n=7, m=2

A B C D E F G

count:

A:1

B:1

C:1

D:1

E:1

F:1

G:1

Needed:

A:1 < 2, need 1

...

G:1 < 2, need 1

Total: 7 new problems.

Edge Case 4:

t=1

n=10, m=5

All A's

count:

A:10

Others:0

Needed:

A:10 >=5, no need

Others:0 <5, each need 5

Total: 6*5 = 30 new problems.

Wait, but n=10, m=5, a='AAAAAAAAAA'

count:

A:10

B:0

C:0

D:0

E:0

F:0

G:0

Needed:

A:10 >=5, no need

B:0 <5, need 5

C:0 <5, need 5

D:0 <5, need 5

E:0 <5, need 5

F:0 <5, need 5

G:0 <5, need 5

Total: 5*6 = 30.

Yes.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=35, m=5

All A's

count:

A:35

Others:0

Needed:

A:35 >=5, no need

Others:0 <5, need 5 each

Total: 6*5 = 30.

But n=35, m=5, but since A is more than needed, still need 30 new problems.

Wait, but actually, he only needs to make sure each difficulty has at least m problems. So, even if he has more than m in some difficulties, he still needs to have m in each.

So, in this case, he needs to create 5 problems for each of the other six difficulties, totaling 30.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=35, m=5

All A's except one B

count:

A:34

B:1

Others:0

Needed:

A:34 >=5, no need

B:1 <5, need 4

C:0 <5, need 5

D:0 <5, need 5

E:0 <5, need 5

F:0 <5, need 5

G:0 <5, need 5

Total: 4 + 5*5 = 4 + 25 = 29.

Wait, 5*5 is 25, plus 4 is 29.

But wait, others are C,G:0, so 6-1=5 difficulties need 5 each, plus B needs 4.

Total: 5*5 + 4 = 29.

Yes.

Seems the program handles this correctly.

Another aspect: The program assumes that the input string a contains only uppercase letters from A to G, as per the problem statement.

The problem says: "the string a of n characters from 'A' to 'G'"

So, no need to handle invalid characters.

Also, n can be from 1 to 50, m from 1 to 5.

So, no issues with the loops or counts exceeding limits.

Time constraints: Since n <= 50 and t <= 1000, total operations are negligible.

Space constraints: count is a list of 7 integers, no issue.

Therefore, the program seems correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{2}\]
