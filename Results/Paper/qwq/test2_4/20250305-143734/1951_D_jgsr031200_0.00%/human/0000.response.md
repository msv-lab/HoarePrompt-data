Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls with prices such that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. Both n and k can be as large as 10^18, which means I have to be careful with how I handle large numbers.

The output for each test case should be "YES" or "NO", followed by the number of stalls and the prices if it's "YES". The number of stalls should be at most 60, and each price should be between 1 and 10^18.

Let me think about how Alice buys the jewels. She goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her current coins. So, if a stall has price p, and she has c coins, she can buy floor(c/p) jewels, and then she's left with c - floor(c/p)*p coins to take to the next stall.

Bob needs to set up the stalls in such a way that the total number of jewels Alice buys is exactly k.

I need to find a way to choose up to 60 prices such that when Alice buys jewels in this greedy manner, she ends up with exactly k jewels.

Let me consider some examples to understand this better.

Example 1:

Input:

3

7 3

6 4

255 8

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

NO

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

In the first test case, with n=7 coins and k=3 jewels, the output is "YES" with 10 stalls priced from 2 to 11 coins. Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (7//2=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin), and since 1 coin is not enough to buy any jewels from the remaining stalls, she buys a total of 3 jewels.

In the third test case, with n=255 coins and k=8 jewels, the output is "YES" with 8 stalls priced as powers of 2 from 128 down to 1. Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

From these examples, it seems that choosing prices in a way that Alice spends as many coins as possible on fewer stalls to reach exactly k jewels is possible in some cases, while in others, it's not feasible.

Let me think about the general approach.

One way to approach this is to maximize the number of jewels Alice can buy with a given set of stalls. But in this problem, we need to make sure she buys exactly k jewels.

I need a way to control the total number of jewels she buys.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

If k=1, Alice should buy one jewel from one stall, and no more from the others.

If k=2, she could buy two jewels from one stall or one jewel from two stalls, etc.

But considering that she buys as many as possible from each stall in order, it's tricky to control exactly how many she buys unless I can set prices in a specific way.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed.

If I set one stall with price floor(n/k), then Alice would buy k jewels if n is exactly k times the price. But if n is not exactly divisible by the price, she might buy more or less.

Wait, no. If I set one stall with price floor(n/k), then Alice would buy floor(n / p) jewels, where p is floor(n/k). But if n is not exactly divisible by p, she might buy more or less than k.

Wait, let's calculate.

Suppose n=7, k=3.

floor(7/2)=3, which is exactly k.

But in the example, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, in this case, using just one stall with price 2 would also work, since she buys 3 jewels and has 1 coin left, which is not enough for any other stalls.

So why did they use 10 stalls? Maybe to show that it's possible with more stalls, but the minimal number is sufficient.

In the third example, they used 8 stalls with prices as powers of 2, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

So, in that case, using higher prices allowed controlling the number of jewels bought per stall.

Wait, with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, Alice buys one jewel from each stall:

- First stall: 255 // 128 = 1 jewel, spends 128, left with 127

- Second stall: 127 // 64 = 1 jewel, spends 64, left with 63

- Third stall: 63 // 32 = 1 jewel, spends 32, left with 31

- Fourth stall: 31 // 16 = 1 jewel, spends 16, left with 15

- Fifth stall: 15 // 8 = 1 jewel, spends 8, left with 7

- Sixth stall: 7 // 4 = 1 jewel, spends 4, left with 3

- Seventh stall: 3 // 2 = 1 jewel, spends 2, left with 1

- Eighth stall: 1 // 1 = 1 jewel, spends 1, left with 0

Total jewels: 8

So, in this way, by setting prices as powers of 2, Alice buys one jewel from each stall.

This seems like a general approach: to make Alice buy one jewel from each stall by setting prices that decrease in a way that she always has just enough coins left to buy one jewel from the next stall.

But in the first example, they used multiple stalls but achieved the same total jewels by having Alice buy all jewels from the first stall.

So, it seems there are multiple ways to achieve the same total jewels.

Now, I need to find a general method to determine whether it's possible to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

I need to think about the constraints and possibilities.

First, if k=1, it's easy: set one stall with price floor(n/1)=n, so Alice buys one jewel and has n - n = 0 coins left, which is enough since she doesn't need to buy from any other stalls.

Similarly, if k=n, set one stall with price 1, so Alice buys n jewels.

Wait, but in the problem, n and k can be up to 10^18, so I need an efficient way to handle large values.

But in the problem statement, it's mentioned that Alice does not need to spend all her coins, which is already considered in the greedy approach.

Now, I need to think about cases where it's impossible.

In the second test case, with n=6 and k=4, the output is "NO". So, it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Let me try to see why.

If I set one stall with price 1, Alice buys 6 jewels, which is more than 4.

If I set two stalls: first stall with price 2, Alice buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins. So, total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, first stall with price 1.5, but prices must be integers, so not possible.

Wait, prices must be integers, so I can't set a price of 1.5.

So, with two stalls, first with price 2 and second with price 1:

- First stall: 6//2 = 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Second stall: 0 coins, can't buy anything.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Another option: first stall with price 3, second with price 1.

- First stall: 6//3 = 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Second stall: 0 coins, can't buy anything.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Another option: first stall with price 1, second with price 100.

- First stall: 6//1 = 6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Second stall: 0 coins, can't buy anything.

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

So, in all cases, it seems impossible to get exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer for that test case.

Now, I need a general method to determine if it's possible for any given n and k.

I need to find a way to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that the total jewels Alice buys is exactly k.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal number of jewels: if all stalls have price greater than n, Alice buys 0 jewels.

Maximal number of jewels: if all stalls have price 1, Alice buys n jewels.

So, the possible number of jewels Alice can buy ranges from 0 to n.

But in our problem, k can be from 1 to 10^18, and n can be from 1 to 10^18.

So, in theory, if n >= k, it should be possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

But the second test case shows that it's not always possible, even if n >= k.

Wait, in the second test case, n=6 and k=4, and it's "NO". So, even though n >= k, it's not always possible.

So, there must be some constraints based on the way Alice buys the jewels.

I need to find a condition under which it's possible.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k > n, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

- If k == n, set up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys n jewels.

- If k == 1, set up one stall with price n, so Alice buys one jewel.

- For other cases, I need to find a combination of stalls that make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But as seen in the second test case, it's not always possible.

So, I need to find a general condition.

Let me think about the minimal number of stalls needed to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) from the second stall, and so on.

The total number of jewels is the sum over all stalls of floor((remaining coins)/pi).

This is a bit complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I can think recursively.

Let me consider that after the first stall, Alice has some remaining coins, and then the problem reduces to making her buy a certain number of jewels with the remaining coins and remaining stalls.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n/p1), floor((remaining coins after first stall)/p2), and so on, equals k.

This seems too vague to work with directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to maximize or minimize the number of jewels she buys.

But the problem is to reach exactly k, which is specific.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

I need to find a way to partition the k jewels into s parts, where each part is the number of jewels bought from each stall.

But the partition is constrained by the prices chosen and the remaining coins after each stall.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I set up s stalls with decreasing prices, like in the third example, where prices are powers of 2.

In that case, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, which sums up to s jewels.

So, if s = k, and n is at least the sum of the prices, Alice can buy one jewel from each stall.

But in the first example, they used 10 stalls to make Alice buy 3 jewels, but in that case, she bought all 3 from the first stall and didn't have enough for the others.

Wait, but in the third example, with 8 stalls, she bought one from each.

So, perhaps if I set up k stalls with prices that are decreasing and such that the sum of the prices is less than or equal to n, and the prices are such that Alice can buy one jewel from each stall, then she will buy exactly k jewels.

Wait, but in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought 3 from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, in that case, it's possible with more than k stalls, but in the third example, it's possible with exactly k stalls.

So, maybe a general approach is to set up k stalls with prices such that Alice buys one jewel from each stall, and the sum of the prices is less than or equal to n.

But in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, sum of prices from 2 to 11 is way more than 7, but Alice only buys from the first stall.

Wait, no, in that case, she buys from the first stall and doesn't have enough for the others.

Wait, no, with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and n=7, she buys floor(7/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy from any of the other stalls (since all other prices are greater than 1), so she buys a total of 3 jewels.

So, in this case, it's possible with multiple stalls, but in the third example, it's possible with exactly k stalls.

So, perhaps a general approach is to set up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 <= n, p2 <= remaining coins after first stall, and so on, such that the total jewels bought are exactly k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the constraints.

I need to ensure that the sum of the jewels bought from each stall equals k.

Given that Alice buys floor(n/p1) from the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) from the second stall, and so on, I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of these floor functions equals k.

This is tricky because floor functions are involved, and I have to deal with large numbers.

Maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

What's the minimal number of stalls needed?

Well, in the best case, one stall can make Alice buy exactly k jewels if n is exactly k*price.

But in general, it's not always possible.

Alternatively, if I set up k stalls with price floor(n/k), then Alice might buy more or less than k jewels, depending on the division.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels by adjusting the prices.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

- If n == k, set up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys n = k jewels.

- If n > k, I need to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Now, in the case where n > k, I need to set up stalls in such a way that the total jewels bought are exactly k.

One way to do this is to set up one stall with a price such that Alice buys as many jewels as possible without exceeding k, and then adjust with subsequent stalls.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of floor(n/p1), floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2), ..., floor((remaining coins after s-1 stalls)/ps) equals k.

This is complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I can consider the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

What's the minimal number of stalls needed?

Well, in the best case, one stall can make Alice buy exactly k jewels if n is exactly k*price.

But in general, it's not always possible.

Alternatively, if I set up k stalls with price floor(n/k), then Alice might buy more or less than k jewels.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a way to decompose k into a sum of floor divisions.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Then, the total jewels bought is sum from i=1 to s of floor(ni / pi), where ni is the remaining coins after the previous stalls.

This is recursive and depends on the previous stalls.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to set up the stalls such that the total jewels bought is exactly k, by choosing prices that allow precise control over the number of jewels bought at each stall.

Let me consider setting up stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the third example.

Suppose I set up k stalls with prices p1 > p2 > ... > pk, where p1 <= n, p2 <= remaining coins after first stall, and so on.

In the third example, they used prices that are powers of 2, decreasing from 128 down to 1, and Alice bought one jewel from each stall.

This suggests that by setting prices in a geometric progression with ratio 2, Alice buys one jewel from each stall.

Similarly, in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought all 3 jewels from the first stall and didn't have enough for the others.

So, in that case, it's possible with multiple stalls, but Alice only buys from the first stall.

So, perhaps a general approach is to set up k stalls with prices that are decreasing in a way that Alice buys one jewel from each stall, and the sum of the prices is less than or equal to n.

But in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, sum of prices from 2 to 11 is much larger than 7, but Alice only buys from the first stall because after buying 3 jewels from the first stall, she's left with 1 coin, which is not enough for any other stall.

So, in that case, it's possible.

Wait, but in the second example, with n=6 and k=4, it's impossible.

Let me see why.

If I set up 4 stalls with prices p1, p2, p3, p4, such that Alice buys one jewel from each.

Suppose p1=2, p2=2, p3=2, p4=2.

Then, Alice buys floor(6/2)=3 jewels from the first stall, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins, so can't buy from the other stalls. Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1.

Then, Alice buys floor(6/1)=6 jewels from the first stall, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins. Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Alternatively, p1=1.5, but prices must be integers.

Alternatively, p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1.

But p1 must be integer.

So, with p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1:

- Stall 1: floor(6/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins. Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, p1=3, p2=1, p3=1, p4=1:

- Stall 1: floor(6/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins. Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Alternatively, p1=1, p2=2, p3=2, p4=2:

- Stall 1: floor(6/1)=6 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins. Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

So, in all cases, it's not possible to get exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Hence, "NO" is the correct answer for that test case.

Now, I need a general method to determine if it's possible for any n and k.

Let me think about the relationship between n and k.

Suppose I have k stalls, each with price pi, and Alice buys one jewel from each stall.

Then, the total cost would be sum of pi for i=1 to k.

But Alice might buy more than one jewel from some stalls, depending on the prices and the remaining coins.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls needed to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Suppose I set up one stall with price floor(n/k).

Then, Alice buys floor(n / floor(n/k)) jewels.

But floor(n / floor(n/k)) could be equal to k, more than k, or less than k, depending on the values.

Wait, let's see.

Let q = floor(n/k).

Then, floor(n / q) could be k or more, depending on the division.

But if n is not a multiple of k, it might not be possible to get exactly k jewels.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls required is s, where s is the minimal integer such that sum of floor(n / p_i) for i=1 to s is equal to k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum of floor(n / p1), floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2), ..., floor((remaining coins after s-1 stalls)/ps) equals k.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to set up the stalls such that the total jewels bought is exactly k, by choosing prices that allow precise control over the number of jewels bought at each stall.

Let me consider setting up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, like in the third example.

In that case, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, provided that she has enough coins for each stall.

So, if I set up k stalls with prices that are decreasing powers of 2, starting from some value, Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, totaling k jewels.

But in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11, and Alice bought 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, in that case, it's possible with multiple stalls, but Alice only buys from the first stall.

So, perhaps a general approach is to set up one stall with a price such that Alice buys as many jewels as possible without exceeding k, and then adjust with subsequent stalls for the remaining jewels.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If n < k, output "NO" because it's impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than the number of coins she has.

- If n == k, set up one stall with price 1, so Alice buys n = k jewels.

- If n > k, try to set up stalls in a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

But I need a systematic way to determine if it's possible and how to set up the stalls.

Let me consider the case where k = 1.

In this case, set up one stall with price n, so Alice buys one jewel and spends n coins.

This works.

Now, for k > 1, I need to find a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

One idea is to set up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 > p2 > ... > pk, and choose them such that Alice buys one jewel from each stall.

But I need to ensure that after buying from each stall, she has enough coins left to buy from the next stall, but not too many to buy more than one jewel from any stall.

This seems tricky, but perhaps possible.

Let me try with n=255 and k=8, as in the third example.

They set up 8 stalls with prices 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, spending 128, then 64, then 32, and so on, until she has 0 coins left.

Total jewels: 8.

This works.

Similarly, for n=7 and k=3, if I set up 3 stalls with prices 3, 2, 1:

- Stall 1: floor(7/3)=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 coin < 2, can't buy anything.

- Stall 3: 1 coin < 1, can't buy anything.

Total jewels: 2, which is less than 3.

Not sufficient.

Alternatively, set up 3 stalls with prices 2, 2, 2:

- Stall 1: floor(7/2)=3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Stall 2: 1 coin < 2, can't buy anything.

- Stall 3: 1 coin < 2, can't buy anything.

Total jewels: 3.

This works.

Wait, but in this case, I have multiple stalls with the same price, which is allowed.

So, with s=3 stalls, each with price 2, Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

This achieves exactly k=3 jewels.

So, in this case, it's possible with s=3 stalls.

But in the first example, they used s=10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

Hence, for n=7 and k=3, it's possible.

Similarly, for n=6 and k=4, it's impossible, as shown earlier.

So, I need a way to determine if it's possible for any n and k.

Let me consider the following condition:

If n >= k and n - k < k, then it's possible.

Wait, let's see.

In the first example, n=7, k=3: 7 >= 3 and 7 - 3 = 4 < 3? No, 4 > 3.

Wait, that doesn't hold.

In the second example, n=6, k=4: 6 >= 4 and 6 - 4 = 2 < 4.

But in this case, it's "NO", so the condition doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's the opposite.

If n - k < k, then it's possible.

In the first example, n - k = 4 < 3? No, 4 > 3, so condition fails.

Wait, no.

Wait, n - k < k would mean n < 2k.

But in the first example, n=7, k=3: 7 < 6? No.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if n >= k and n - k < floor(n/k), then it's possible.

Wait, floor(n/k) is floor(7/3)=2.

So, n - k = 4 < 2? No, 4 > 2.

Hence, condition fails.

But in the first example, it's possible.

So, this condition doesn't hold.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up one stall with price floor(n/k).

Then, Alice buys floor(n / floor(n/k)) jewels.

If floor(n/k) = p, then floor(n / p) could be k or more, depending on the division.

But in the first example, floor(7/3)=2, and floor(7/2)=3 jewels, which is more than k=3.

Wait, no: floor(7/2)=3, which is equal to k=3.

Wait, in this case, it's possible to set up one stall with price 2, and Alice buys 3 jewels.

But in the first example, they used 10 stalls, but it's also possible with one stall.

So, perhaps in cases where floor(n / floor(n/k)) >= k, it's possible.

But in the second example, floor(6/4)=1, and floor(6/1)=6 jewels, which is more than k=4.

So, in that case, it's not possible to get exactly k=4.

Wait, but in the first example, floor(7/3)=2, floor(7/2)=3, which is equal to k=3.

So, perhaps if floor(n / floor(n/k)) >= k, it's possible.

But in the second example, floor(6/4)=1, floor(6/1)=6, which is more than k=4.

So, in that case, it's not possible.

Hence, perhaps the condition is:

If floor(n / floor(n/k)) >= k, then it's possible.

Else, it's not possible.

But in the first example, floor(7/2)=3 >= 3, so possible.

In the second example, floor(6/1)=6 >=4, but in reality, it's "NO".

So, this condition is not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

Let me consider that if floor(n / floor(n/k)) >= k, then it's possible to set up one stall with price floor(n/k) and make Alice buy floor(n / floor(n/k)) jewels.

But if floor(n / floor(n/k)) > k, then I need to find a way to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, possibly by setting up multiple stalls.

In the first example, floor(7/2)=3 >=3, and indeed it's possible.

In the second example, floor(6/1)=6 >=4, but it's impossible to get exactly 4 jewels.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if floor(n / floor(n/k)) >= k, it's possible.

But in the second example, it's not possible.

So, my condition is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal number of jewels Alice can buy with s stalls.

If I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps, then Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then from the second, and so on.

To make her buy exactly k jewels, I need to choose prices such that the sum of floor(n / p1), floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2), ..., floor((remaining coins after s-1 stalls)/ps) equals k.

This is still too vague.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 > p2 > ... > ps, and p1 <= n, p2 <= remaining coins after first stall, and so on, then Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, totaling s jewels.

But in reality, it's more complicated because the number of jewels bought from each stall depends on the prices and the remaining coins.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 > p2 > ... > ps, and p1 <= n, p2 <= n - floor(n/p1)*p1, and so on, then Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, totaling s jewels.

But in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, setting up 3 stalls with prices 2,2,2 makes Alice buy 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others, achieving exactly k=3 jewels.

Similarly, setting up 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11 also makes her buy 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, in that case, it's possible.

In the second example, with n=6 and k=4, no matter how I set up the stalls, I can't make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels.

So, perhaps the condition is that if floor(n / ceil(n/k)) >= k, then it's possible.

Wait, ceil(n/k) is the minimal price per jewel to make Alice buy at most k jewels.

But I need exactly k jewels.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that it's possible if and only if there exists a way to partition k jewels into s parts, where s <= 60, and each part corresponds to the number of jewels bought from each stall.

But again, this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in the third example, with n=255 and k=8, they set up 8 stalls with prices as powers of 2, decreasing from 128 to 1.

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

Similarly, in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, setting up 3 stalls with prices 2,2,2 makes Alice buy 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, perhaps a general approach is to set up k stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 >= p2 >= ... >= pk, and choose p1 such that floor(n / p1) <= k, and adjust the remaining stalls accordingly.

But this still seems too vague.

Let me consider that for n and k, if n >= k and n - k < p1, where p1 is the price of the first stall, then Alice can buy exactly k jewels.

Wait, not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 >= p2 >= ... >= ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) from the second stall, and so on.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that the sum of these floor functions equals k.

This seems too difficult to handle directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to maximize or minimize the number of jewels bought, but in this problem, I need exactly k.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal number of stalls required to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 = ceil(n / k), p2 = ceil((n - floor(n/p1)*p1) / (k - floor(n/p1))), and so on recursively.

But this seems too complicated.

Let me consider that it's possible if and only if there exists a sequence of s <= 60 prices such that the sum of floor(n / p1), floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2), ..., equals k.

This is still too vague.

Let me consider that for n >= k, it's possible if and only if n - k < p1, where p1 is the price of the first stall.

Wait, not sure.

Let me consider that if n - k < p1, then Alice can't buy more than k jewels from the first stall, and with subsequent stalls, she can buy additional jewels if needed.

But in reality, it's not that straightforward.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps, where p1 > p2 > ... > ps, and p1 <= floor(n / k), then Alice can buy at least k jewels.

But I need exactly k jewels.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that it's possible if and only if n >= k and n - k < floor(n / ceil(k - 1)), or something like that.

Wait, I'm getting lost.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in programming problems, sometimes it's useful to think in terms of binary representations or greedy algorithms.

In the third example, they used prices that are powers of 2, which is a binary approach.

Maybe I can think in terms of binary representation of n or k.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, starting from the highest possible power that is <= n, then Alice will buy one jewel from each stall, similar to the binary representation of n.

In the third example, with n=255 and k=8, 255 in binary is 11111111, which has 8 ones, so setting up 8 stalls with prices corresponding to the powers of 2 present in n allows Alice to buy one jewel from each stall.

Similarly, for n=7 (binary 111) and k=3, setting up 3 stalls with prices 4,2,1 would allow Alice to buy one jewel from each stall, but in the first example, they used different prices.

So, perhaps a general approach is to set up k stalls with prices corresponding to the highest k powers of 2 that are <= n.

But in the first example, with n=7 and k=3, setting up prices 4,2,1 would work, but in the given solution, they used 10 stalls with prices from 2 to 11.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

Hence, perhaps a general method is to set up k stalls with prices that are decreasing, starting from floor(n/k) or something similar, and adjust to make Alice buy exactly one jewel from each stall.

But I need to confirm if this always works.

Wait, in the second example, with n=6 and k=4, setting up 4 stalls with prices floor(6/4)=1, so prices 1,1,1,1.

Then, Alice buys floor(6/1)=6 jewels from the first stall, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins, so total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Hence, it's not possible in this case.

So, perhaps the condition is that if floor(n / floor(n/k)) <= k, then it's possible.

In the first example, floor(7/2)=3 <=3, so possible.

In the second example, floor(6/1)=6 >4, so not possible.

Wait, no: floor(6/1)=6 >=4, but in reality, it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps if floor(n / floor(n/k)) <= k, then it's possible.

In the first example, floor(7/2)=3 <=3, so possible.

In the second example, floor(6/1)=6 >4, so not possible.

In the third example, floor(255/8)=31, floor(255/31)=8 <=8, so possible.

Wait, but floor(255/31)=8, which is equal to k=8, so it's possible.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that if floor(n / floor(n/k)) <= k, then it's possible.

But in the first example, floor(7/2)=3 <=3, which holds.

In the second example, floor(6/1)=6 >4, which doesn't hold.

In the third example, floor(255/31)=8 <=8, which holds.

So, perhaps this is a general condition.

Let me test it with some other values.

Suppose n=10, k=5.

floor(10/5)=2, floor(10/2)=5 <=5, so possible.

Indeed, setting up 5 stalls with prices 2,2,2,2,2 would make Alice buy 5 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others, achieving exactly k=5 jewels.

Another example: n=10, k=3.

floor(10/3)=3, floor(10/3)=3 <=3, so possible.

Set up 3 stalls with prices 3,3,3.

Alice buys floor(10/3)=3 jewels from the first stall, spends 9 coins, left with 1 coin, which is not enough for the second stall. Total jewels:3.

Hence, possible.

Another example: n=10, k=4.

floor(10/4)=2, floor(10/2)=5 >=4, but according to the condition, floor(10/2)=5 <=4? No, 5 >4, so not possible.

Indeed, it's not possible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=10.

For example:

- Set up 4 stalls with prices 2,2,2,2.

Alice buys floor(10/2)=5 jewels from the first stall, spends 10 coins, left with 0 coins. Total jewels:5, which is more than 4.

- Set up 4 stalls with prices 3,3,3,3.

Alice buys floor(10/3)=3 jewels from the first stall, spends 9 coins, left with 1 coin.

Second stall: 1 coin <3, can't buy.

Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

- Set up 4 stalls with prices 2,3,4,5.

Alice buys floor(10/2)=5 jewels from the first stall, spends 10 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels:5, which is more than 4.

- Set up 4 stalls with prices 3,4,5,6.

Alice buys floor(10/3)=3 jewels from the first stall, spends 9 coins, left with 1 coin.

Second stall: 1 coin <4, can't buy.

Total jewels:3, which is less than 4.

Hence, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with n=10.

So, according to the condition, if floor(n / floor(n/k)) <= k, then it's possible.

In this case, floor(10/ floor(10/4)) = floor(10/2)=5 <=4? No, 5 >4, so not possible.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

Let me formalize this.

Define p = floor(n/k
