Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

There are n people in a queue, and Kirill arrives late and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He doesn't want to wait too long, so he wants to be among the first m people in the queue after some series of swaps. Each swap has a cost associated with it, and I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to achieve his goal.

Let me understand the swap mechanism. If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j where j < i and swap places with the person at position j. The cost for this swap is a_j coins to the person at position j, and for each k between j and i (exclusive), he has to pay b_k coins to the person at position k.

So, essentially, to move from position i to position j, he pays a_j plus the sum of b_k for all k from j+1 to i-1.

My goal is to get Kirill from position n+1 to some position between 1 and m, with the minimum total cost.

First, I need to model this problem in a way that I can apply some algorithm to find the minimum cost.

Let me think of this as a graph where each position in the queue is a node, and there are directed edges from position i to position j (where j < i) with a cost based on a_j and the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But that seems inefficient, especially since n can be up to 200,000, and t can be up to 10,000. I need a more efficient approach.

Maybe I can think in terms of prefix sums or dynamic programming.

Let me consider the positions from 1 to n+1, with Kirill starting at position n+1.

I need to get him to position m or earlier.

I need to find the minimum cost path from position n+1 to any position from 1 to m.

Given the constraints, a standard DP approach might be too slow if not optimized.

Let me consider dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach position i.

But n is too large for a straightforward DP.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from the end to the start, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Let me consider reversing the queue, so that Kirill starts at position 1, and he wants to move to position m or beyond.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as Kirill moving leftwards in the queue, swapping with people ahead of him (who are to his left).

But I need to model the costs correctly.

Let me consider that Kirill is at position i, and he can swap with anyone at position j < i.

The cost for swapping with j is a_j plus the sum of b_k for j < k < i.

So, if I consider moving Kirill from position n+1 to some position between 1 and m, I need to accumulate these costs appropriately.

This seems complex. Maybe I can find a way to calculate the minimum cost without simulating each possible swap.

Let me consider that Kirill can make multiple swaps, and I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and swaps are edges with associated costs.

But with n up to 200,000, building a graph with edges for each possible swap isn't feasible.

I need a better way.

Perhaps I can use prefix sums to compute the sum of b_k quickly.

Let me define prefix_b[i] as the sum of b_k from 1 to i.

Then, the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

But I need to be careful with the indices.

Wait, perhaps I should define prefix_b[i] as the sum of b_k from 1 to i-1, so that prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j] gives the sum from j to i-1.

Let me try that.

Define prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 0

prefix_b[2] = b[1]

prefix_b[3] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i-1

Then, the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1]

Wait, no.

Wait, if prefix_b[i] is sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i-1, then:

sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]

Because prefix_b[i] = sum from 1 to i-1

prefix_b[j] = sum from 1 to j-1

So, prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j] = sum from j to i-1

Wait, but j starts from 1, and i > j.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the cost to swap from position i to position j is a_j + (prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j])

Therefore, total cost is a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]

Which is equivalent to (a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i]

Interesting.

So, the cost to move from i to j is (a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i]

This seems useful.

Now, if I think in terms of dynamic programming, where dp[i] is the minimum cost to reach position i, then:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + cost from j to i)

Which is dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + (a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i])

Rearranging, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i]

Notice that prefix_b[i] is independent of j, so I can write:

dp[i] = min_over_j (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i]

Let me define temp = min_over_j (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j])

Then dp[i] = temp + prefix_b[i]

So, temp is a value that I can compute as I iterate over i.

This seems promising.

I can keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) up to i-1, and then dp[i] = temp + prefix_b[i]

This reduces the time complexity significantly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize prefix_b[0] = 0

Compute prefix_b[i] for i from 1 to n+1:

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i-1] for i >= 1

Initialize dp[0] = 0 (since position 0 is before the queue, but I need to adjust indices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider positions from 1 to n+1.

Set dp[1] = 0, since Kirill starts at position n+1, but I need to think carefully.

Wait, actually, Kirill starts at position n+1, and he wants to reach position m.

Wait, perhaps I should consider positions from 1 to n+1, with Kirill starting at n+1.

I need dp[n+1] to be 0, and then compute dp[i] for i from n down to 1, and finally take the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

Let me try that.

Set dp[n+1] = 0

Compute dp[i] for i from n down to 1.

But according to the earlier formula:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[i]

Wait, but in the earlier formula, j < i, but now if I'm going from n down to 1, I need to adjust the indices accordingly.

I think I need to rethink the DP approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a sliding window or some greedy approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Kirill moves from position n+1 to position i, and then from position i to some position j < i, and so on, until he reaches a position <= m.

I need to choose a sequence of positions to swap to, minimizing the total cost.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I can consider that Kirill can jump directly from n+1 to any position <=m, with a certain cost that includes the sum of b_k along the way.

But I need to model the intermediate swaps correctly.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Kirill can choose to pay a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n for each swap to position j.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Kirill starts at position 5 (n+1=5)

He wants to be at position 1 or 2.

He can swap to any position j < 5, paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to 4.

For example, swapping to position 4: cost = a[4] + sum(b[5 to 4]) = 9 + sum(b[5 to 4]) = 9 + 0 (since k from 5 to 4 is empty) = 9

Wait, indices are from 1 to n.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

Let me consider positions from 1 to n+1, with Kirill starting at n+1.

He can swap with anyone at position j from 1 to n, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

Wait, no, the problem says when swapping from i to j, he pays a_j plus sum of b_k for j < k < i.

In this case, i is n+1, and j is from 1 to n.

So, sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

So, the cost to swap directly to position j is a_j + sum(b[k] for k from j+1 to n).

Then, from position j, he can swap to any position k < j, paying a_k + sum(b[l] for l from k+1 to j).

But this seems too time-consuming to compute directly.

Maybe I can precompute the sum of b_k from j+1 to n for each j.

Let me define suffix_b[j] = sum of b_k from j+1 to n.

Then, the cost to swap from n+1 to j is a_j + suffix_b[j]

Similarly, the cost to swap from j to k is a_k + suffix_b[k]

And so on, until he reaches a position <=m.

So, the total cost would be the sum of a_j + suffix_b[j] for each swap, but considering that suffix_b[j] includes the sum from j+1 to n, and subsequent swaps would adjust this.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps I can consider that the total cost to reach position j directly from n+1 is a_j + suffix_b[j], and then from j, I can consider swapping to k < j with a cost of a_k + suffix_b[k], but I need to find a way to accumulate these costs optimally.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as Kirill choosing a path of swaps, and I need to find the path with the minimum total cost.

But with n up to 200,000, I need a linear or linearithmic time solution.

Maybe I can consider that the optimal strategy is to choose a single swap to some position j <=m, with cost a_j + suffix_b[j].

But that might not be optimal, because he can swap multiple times.

Wait, but perhaps it is optimal to swap directly to the final position, without intermediate swaps.

I need to verify this.

Consider that if Kirill swaps directly to position j, the cost is a_j + suffix_b[j].

If he swaps to an intermediate position k, then from k to j, the total cost would be a_k + suffix_b[k] + a_j + suffix_b[j] minus the overlapping sum.

This seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the cost to go from n+1 to j via k is a_k + suffix_b[k] (to go from n+1 to k) plus a_j + suffix_b[j] minus the sum from j+1 to k, but it's getting complicated.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach position j is the minimum over all paths of the sum of a_j + suffix_b[j] for each swap.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph with positions as nodes and swaps as edges, and then find the shortest path from n+1 to any position <=m.

But with n up to 200,000, building such a graph isn't feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the properties of the cost.

The cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum(b_k for j < k < i)

So, if I fix the final position j, the total cost would be the sum of a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to n)

Plus, if I swap through intermediate positions, additional costs would be added.

But perhaps it's optimal to swap directly to the final position without intermediate swaps.

If that's the case, then the minimal cost would be the minimum over j from 1 to m of a_j + suffix_b[j]

Where suffix_b[j] = sum of b_k from j+1 to n

But I need to verify if this is indeed the case.

Let me consider a small example.

Suppose n=3, m=2

a = [1, 2, 3]

b = [1, 1, 1]

suffix_b = [3, 2, 1, 0]

So, cost to swap directly to position 1: a1 + suffix_b[1] = 1 + 3 = 4

To position 2: a2 + suffix_b[2] = 2 + 2 = 4

So, minimal cost is 4.

But perhaps there's a better way via intermediate swaps.

For example, swap to position 3: a3 + suffix_b[3] = 3 + 1 = 4, then swap to position 1: a1 + suffix_b[1] = 1 + 0 = 1

Total cost: 4 +1 =5, which is worse than swapping directly to position 1 or 2.

Similarly, swapping to position 3 then to position 2: a2 + suffix_b[2] = 2 +0 =2

Total cost: 3 + 2 =5, again worse.

So, in this case, swapping directly to position 1 or 2 is better.

Let me try another example.

n=3, m=1

a = [5,1,1]

b = [1,1,1]

suffix_b = [3,2,1,0]

Swapping directly to position 1: a1 + suffix_b[1] =5 +3=8

Alternatively, swap to position 2: a2 + suffix_b[2] =1 +2=3, then swap to position 1: a1 + suffix_b[1] =5 +0=5

Total cost:3 +5=8, same as swapping directly.

So, no improvement.

Another example:

n=3, m=1

a = [5,1,1]

b = [10,10,10]

suffix_b = [30,20,10,0]

Swapping directly to position 1:5 +30=35

Swapping to position 2:1 +20=21, then to position 1:5 +0=5

Total:21 +5=26 < 35

So, in this case, swapping through position 2 is better.

Wait, but m=1, and position 2 is >m, so Kirill cannot stop at position 2; he needs to reach position 1.

So, in this case, swapping directly to position 1 is 35, swapping through position 2 is 21 +5=26, which is better.

So, in this case, swapping through an intermediate position gives a better result than swapping directly to position 1.

So, my initial assumption that swapping directly to the final position is optimal is incorrect.

Therefore, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple swaps, and I need to find the sequence of swaps that minimizes the total cost.

This seems similar to finding the shortest path in a graph where nodes are positions, and edges represent possible swaps with their associated costs.

But again, with n up to 200,000, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can choose to swap to any position j < i, paying a_j + sum(b_k for j < k < i).

If I consider positions in decreasing order, from n+1 down to 1, perhaps I can maintain some kind of minimum cost to reach each position.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among them.

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible j > i, and dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + sum(b_k for i < k < j)

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

When Kirill is at position j and swaps to position i where i < j, he pays a_i + sum(b_k for i < k < j)

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + sum(b_k for i < k < j)

But sum(b_k for i < k < j) can be expressed using prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 1 to i-1

Then, sum from i < k < j is prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]

I can rearrange this as dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Let me define temp = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j])

Then, dp[i] = temp + a_i - prefix_b[i]

So, if I can compute temp efficiently, I can compute dp[i]

But temp depends on dp[j] for j > i, so I need to compute dp from higher i to lower i.

This seems promising.

I can iterate i from n down to 1, computing dp[i] based on temp, which is the minimum of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) for j > i.

So, as I iterate from higher to lower, I can maintain a variable that keeps track of the minimum (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) for j starting from i+1 to n.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0 (since Kirill starts at position n+1)

Compute prefix_b[i] for i from 1 to n+1:

prefix_b[1] = 0

prefix_b[2] = b[1]

prefix_b[3] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i-2] for i >=2

Wait, indices are getting confusing.

Let me define prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = b[1]

prefix_b[2] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i-1

So, prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i-1]

Now, for dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

I can compute this by keeping a running minimum of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) for j from i+1 to n.

Let me initialize a variable, say, min_so_far, which is initially set to dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n+1] = 0 + 0 = 0

Then, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = min_so_far + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp[i] + prefix_b[i])

Wait, let's verify this.

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

We set min_so_far to be the min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j])

Then dp[i] = min_so_far + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, to update min_so_far for positions k < i, we need the min over j > k of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]), which includes dp[i] + prefix_b[i]

So, we update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp[i] + prefix_b[i])

This seems correct.

Let me test this logic with the earlier example where n=3, m=1, a=[5,1,1], b=[10,10,10]

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 0

prefix_b[2] = b[1] = 10

prefix_b[3] = b[1] + b[2] = 20

prefix_b[4] = b[1] + b[2] + b[3] = 30

Initialize dp[4] = 0

min_so_far = dp[4] + prefix_b[4] = 0 + 0 = 0

For i=3:

dp[3] = min_so_far + a[3] - prefix_b[3] = 0 +1 -20 = -19

Then, update min_so_far = min(0, dp[3] + prefix_b[3]) = min(0, -19 +20) = min(0,1) =0

For i=2:

dp[2] = min_so_far + a[2] - prefix_b[2] =0 +1 -10 = -9

Then, update min_so_far = min(0, -9 +10)= min(0,1)=0

For i=1:

dp[1] = min_so_far + a[1] - prefix_b[1] =0 +5 -0=5

Then, update min_so_far = min(0,5 +0)=0

The minimal cost is dp[1] =5

But earlier, I calculated that swapping through position 2 gives a total cost of 21 +5=26, which is worse than swapping directly to position 1 (cost 35), but in this calculation, dp[1]=5, which seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, in this approach, dp[i] represents the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

So, dp[1]=5 should be the minimum cost to reach position 1.

But in my earlier manual calculation, swapping directly to position 1 costs 5+30=35, and swapping to position 2 then to position 1 costs 1+20 +5+0=26, which is less than 35, but dp[1]=5.

There seems to be a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I need to verify the formula again.

Let me check the dp transition:

dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, min_so_far = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j])

So, dp[i] = min_so_far + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp[i] + prefix_b[i])

Wait, in the example:

Initialize dp[4]=0, min_so_far=0

i=3:

dp[3] =0 +1 -20= -19

Then, min_so_far = min(0, -19 +20)= min(0,1)=0

i=2:

dp[2]=0 +1 -10= -9

min_so_far = min(0, -9 +10)= min(0,1)=0

i=1:

dp[1]=0 +5 -0=5

min_so_far = min(0,5 +0)=0

So, dp[1]=5

But according to manual calculation, swapping directly to position 1 costs 5+30=35, swapping to position 2 then to position 1 costs 1+20 +5+0=26, which is less than 35, but dp[1]=5, which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to add something.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] should be dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + (prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i])

Wait, in the earlier step, I had sum from k=i+1 to j-1 is prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]

So, cost to swap from j to i is a_i + sum from k=i+1 to j-1 = a_i + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]

So, dp[i] = min over j >i of dp[j] + a_i + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]

Which is dp[i] = min over j >i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, dp[i] = min_so_far + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Where min_so_far is the minimum of dp[j] + prefix_b[j] for j >i

Then, min_so_far is updated to min(min_so_far, dp[i] + prefix_b[i])

In the earlier example:

dp[3] =0 +1 -20= -19

Then min_so_far = min(0, -19 +20)= min(0,1)=0

dp[2]=0 +1 -10= -9

min_so_far = min(0, -9 +10)= min(0,1)=0

dp[1]=0 +5 -0=5

min_so_far = min(0,5 +0)=0

So dp[1]=5, but according to manual calculation, the minimal cost should be 26.

Wait, perhaps I need to add the sum of b_k from i to j in the cost.

Wait, no, the cost is a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 when swapping from i to j.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the definition.

Let me double-check the problem statement.

"he can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k ."

So, cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum of b_k from j < k < i

In terms of prefix sums, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1]

Wait, earlier I defined prefix_b[i] = sum from 1 to i-1

So, sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1]

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1])

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1])

This seems different from my earlier formula.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the dp formula.

Let me try to redefine dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1])

This seems more accurate.

Now, I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me see.

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) + prefix_b[i]

So, similar to before, I can keep a running minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) for j < i

Then, dp[i] = min_so_far + prefix_b[i]

And after computing dp[i], I can update the min_so_far for j < i.

Wait, but min_so_far is for j < i, so I can maintain min_so_far as I iterate from left to right.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate from i=1 to n.

Let me try.

Compute prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i-1

Initialize dp[1] = a_1 + prefix_b[1] - prefix_b[1] = a_1

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me try to iterate from i=1 to n.

Initialize min_so_far = dp[1] + a_1 - prefix_b[2]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps in any order, and I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position <=m.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i-1)

Then, I can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from n+1 to any position <=m.

But again, with n up to 200,000, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the cost to go directly from n+1 to j is a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to n)

Then, the cost to go from n+1 to j to k, where k < j, is a_j + sum(b from j+1 to n) + a_k + sum(b from k+1 to j)

But sum(b from k+1 to j) = sum(b from 1 to j-1) - sum(b from 1 to k)

Which is prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[k]

So, total cost is a_j + (prefix_b[n+1] - prefix_b[j]) + a_k + (prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[k])

Simplify: a_j + prefix_b[n+1] - prefix_b[j] + a_k + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[k] = a_j + prefix_b[n+1] + a_k - prefix_b[k]

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to think recursively.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + sum(b_k from i < k < j)

Which is dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + (prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i])

So, dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, I can iterate from i=n down to 1, maintaining a variable that keeps track of the minimum value of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) for j > i.

This seems efficient.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, compute prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to k=i-1

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0

Initialize min_so_far = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n+1] = 0 + 0 = 0

Then, for i from n down to 1:

dp[i] = min_so_far + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Then, min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp[i] + prefix_b[i])

Then, after computing dp[i] for all i from 1 to n, take the minimum dp[i] for i from 1 to m.

Let me test this with the earlier example:

n=3, m=1

a=[5,1,1]

b=[10,10,10]

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[1] = 0

prefix_b[2] = b[1] =10

prefix_b[3] = b[1] + b[2] =20

prefix_b[4] = b[1] + b[2] + b[3] =30

Initialize dp[4]=0

min_so_far = dp[4] + prefix_b[4] =0 +0=0

i=3:

dp[3] =0 +1 -20= -19

min_so_far = min(0, -19 +20)= min(0,1)=0

i=2:

dp[2]=0 +1 -10= -9

min_so_far = min(0, -9 +10)= min(0,1)=0

i=1:

dp[1]=0 +5 -0=5

min_so_far = min(0,5 +0)=0

So, dp[1]=5

But according to manual calculation, swapping through position 2 gives a total cost of 1+20 +5+0=26, which is higher than dp[1]=5.

Wait, perhaps I need to add prefix_b[i] differently.

Wait, maybe dp[i] should be dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + (prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i])

Wait, in this case, dp[i] = min over j > i of dp[j] + a_i + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[i]

Which is dp[i] = min over j > i of (dp[j] + prefix_b[j]) + a_i - prefix_b[i]

So, dp[i] = min_so_far + a_i - prefix_b[i]

Where min_so_far is the minimum of dp[j] + prefix_b[j] for j > i

Then, after computing dp[i], update min_so_far = min(min_so_far, dp[i] + prefix_b[i])

In this example:

dp[3] =0 +1 -20= -19

Then, dp[3] + prefix_b[3]= -19 +20=1

So, min_so_far = min(0,1)=0

dp[2]=0 +1 -10= -9

Then, dp[2] + prefix_b[2]= -9 +10=1

min_so_far = min(0,1)=0

dp[1]=0 +5 -0=5

Then, dp[1] + prefix_b[1]=5 +0=5

min_so_far = min(0,5)=0

So, dp[1]=5

But according to manual calculation, swapping directly to position 1 costs 5+30=35, swapping to position 2 then to position 1 costs 1+20 +5+0=26, which is less than 35, but dp[1]=5 is less than both.

This suggests that dp[1]=5 is the minimal cost to reach position 1.

But how is that possible? In reality, swapping directly to position 1 costs 5+30=35, and swapping through position 2 costs 26, but dp[1]=5 is less than both.

There must be a mistake in the dp formula.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] should include the sum of b_k from i+1 to n.

Wait, perhaps dp[i] represents the minimal cost to reach position i from n+1, including the cost to move from n+1 to i.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the dp formula.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the cost to move from n+1 to i is a_i + sum(b_k from i+1 to n)

Then, from i, I can move to any j < i, paying a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i)

So, total cost is a_i + sum(b_k from i+1 to n) + a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i) + ...

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that the total cost is the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for all positions that are "skipped" during the swaps.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look at the first test case:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

Compute prefix_b:

prefix_b[1] =0

prefix_b[2]=4

prefix_b[3]=4+3=7

prefix_b[4]=4+3+8=15

prefix_b[5]=4+3+8+5=20

Initialize dp[5]=0

min_so_far=0

i=4:

dp[4]=0 +9 -15= -6

min_so_far = min(0, -6 +15)= min(0,9)=0

i=3:

dp[3]=0 +6 -7= -1

min_so_far = min(0, -1 +7)= min(0,6)=0

i=2:

dp[2]=0 +3 -4= -1

min_so_far = min(0, -1 +4)= min(0,3)=0

i=1:

dp[1]=0 +7 -0=7

min_so_far = min(0,7 +0)=0

So, dp[1]=7 and dp[2]=-1

But according to the sample output, it should be 14 for this test case.

Clearly, something is wrong with this dp approach.

Perhaps I need to reconsider the dp definition.

Let me try to think of dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from n+1.

Then, dp[i] = a_i + sum(b_k from i+1 to n) + minimal cost to reach some position j < i.

Wait, but this is recursive.

Maybe I can define dp[i] = a_i + sum(b_k from i+1 to n) + min(dp[j] for j < i)

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the positions in a certain way and use a sliding window minimum.

Let me consider sorting the positions based on some criteria.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a segment tree or priority queue to maintain the minimum value efficiently.

But I need to think of a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Let me consider that dp[i] = a_i + sum(b_k from i+1 to n) + min(dp[j] for j < i)

I can compute sum(b_k from i+1 to n) as suffix_b[i+1]

So, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_b[i+1] + min(dp[j] for j < i)

If I can compute min(dp[j] for j < i) efficiently, then I can compute dp[i]

I can keep a variable to track the minimum dp[j] for j from 1 to i-1.

Then, iterate i from 1 to n:

min_left = current minimum dp[j] for j < i

dp[i] = a_i + suffix_b[i+1] + min_left

Then, update the minimum if dp[i] is smaller.

This would be O(n), which is acceptable.

Let me try this with the first test case.

n=4, m=2

a=[7,3,6,9]

b=[4,3,8,5]

Compute suffix_b[i]:

suffix_b[5]=0

suffix_b[4]=b[4]=5

suffix_b[3]=b[3]+suffix_b[4]=8+5=13

suffix_b[2]=b[2]+suffix_b[3]=3+13=16

suffix_b[1]=b[1]+suffix_b[2]=4+16=20

Then:

dp[1] = a[1] + suffix_b[2] + min_left (initially 0) =7 +16 +0=23

Then, min_left = min(0,23)=0

dp[2] = a[2] + suffix_b[3] + min_left =3 +13 +0=16

Then, min_left = min(0,16)=0

dp[3] = a[3] + suffix_b[4] + min_left =6 +5 +0=11

Then, min_left = min(0,11)=0

dp[4] = a[4] + suffix_b[5] + min_left =9 +0 +0=9

Then, min_left = min(0,9)=0

Then, the minimal dp[i] for i from 1 to m=2 is min(dp[1], dp[2})=min(23,16)=16

But according to the sample output, it should be 14.

So, this approach is giving me 16, but the correct answer is 14.

There must be a mistake in this dp definition.

Let me think about what's wrong.

Perhaps I'm not accounting for the fact that Kirill can perform multiple swaps.

In this approach, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_b[i+1] + min_left, which seems like it's only considering direct swaps to position i from n+1, plus the minimal cost to reach j < i.

But perhaps it's not capturing the sequence of swaps correctly.

Let me consider that when Kirill swaps from n+1 to i, he pays a_i + suffix_b[i+1], and then from i, he can swap to j < i, paying a_j + suffix_b[j+1], and so on.

So, the total cost would be the sum of a_i + suffix_b[i+1] for each swap.

But in the dp definition above, dp[i] includes a_i + suffix_b[i+1] plus the minimal cost to reach some j < i.

This might be double-counting or missing some costs.

This seems incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform any number of swaps, and I need to find the minimal total cost to reach a position <=m.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from i to j for j < i with cost a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i).

Then, I can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the minimal cost from n+1 to any position <=m.

But with n up to 200,000, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach position i is the minimal cost among all sequences of swaps that lead to position i.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to consider that the cost to reach position i is a_i + sum of b_k from i+1 to n, plus the minimal cost to reach some position j < i.

So, dp[i] = a_i + suffix_b[i+1] + min(dp[j] for j < i)

This is similar to what I did earlier, but in the earlier approach, it gave me dp[1]=23, dp[2]=16, dp[3]=11, dp[4]=9, and minimal among dp[1] and dp[2] is 16, but the correct answer is 14.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the dp formula.

Let me consider that when Kirill swaps from n+1 to i, he pays a_i + suffix_b[i+1], and then he can perform further swaps to positions j < i, paying a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i).

Wait, sum from j+1 to i is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the sum ranges.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that Kirill needs to pay a_i to swap to position i, and then pay sum of b_k for positions between i and his current position.

I need to find a way to model this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the total cost is the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for all positions that are "skipped" over during the swaps.

In other words, when swapping from i to j, I pay a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

So, the total cost would be the sum of a_j for each swap, plus the sum of b_k for all positions k that are greater than the destination j of each swap.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at n+1 and wants to reach some position <=m.

He can perform swaps to positions j < i, paying a_j plus sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

He can perform this operation any number
