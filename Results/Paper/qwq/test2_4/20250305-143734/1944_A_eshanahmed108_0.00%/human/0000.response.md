Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? The number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2, which makes sense for a complete graph.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges, and he wants to do this in a way that minimizes the number of islands Everule can reach from island 1.

My task is to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, given that Dominater destroys up to k bridges optimally.

First, I need to understand what "optimally" means in this context. Since Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, he should try to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying bridges.

In graph terms, I have a complete graph, and I need to remove up to k edges to minimize the size of the connected component containing node 1.

I recall that in a complete graph, any two nodes are connected directly or through a series of connections. To isolate a node, I need to disconnect it completely from the graph by removing all its edges.

But in this problem, Everule starts from island 1, so Dominater might try to cut off other islands from island 1.

Wait, but Dominater can destroy at most k bridges, not necessarily all of them.

Let me think about small cases to get a better understanding.

Take n=2, k=0.

If k=0, no bridges are destroyed, so Everule can reach island 2 from island 1. So, the number of islands Everule can visit is 2.

n=2, k=1.

There's only one bridge between island 1 and 2. If Dominater destroys that bridge, Everule can only stay on island 1. So, the number is 1.

n=3, k=1.

Islands 1, 2, 3, and bridges between all of them.

If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between 1 and 2, then Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3. So, Everule can still reach all islands.

Alternatively, if Dominater destroys a different bridge, say between 2 and 3, Everule can still reach both 2 and 3 from 1.

It seems that in n=3, destroying one bridge doesn't isolate any island from island 1.

n=4, k=1.

Similarly, in n=4, destroying one bridge might not isolate any island from island 1, as there are multiple paths.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4 and k=1, the output is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Another sample input is n=5 and k=10.

Given that n=5, the total number of bridges is 10. So, k=10 means Dominater can destroy all bridges. Therefore, Everule can only stay on island 1, so the number is 1.

Another sample input is n=5 and k=3.

Total bridges are 10, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges.

I need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit.

Looking at the sample output, it's 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands even after destroying 3 bridges.

Wait, is that always the case?

Let me think about n=4 and k=4.

Total bridges: 6.

Destroying 4 bridges.

If Dominater destroys 4 bridges, can he isolate island 1 from the others?

Wait, in n=4, total bridges are 6.

If Dominater destroys 4 bridges, 2 bridges remain.

Is it possible to have island 1 connected to only one other island with 2 bridges?

For example, destroy bridges: 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and one more bridge.

Wait, if Dominater destroys 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, then island 1 is only connected to itself.

But in the sample input, for n=4 and k=4, the output is 1, meaning Everule can only visit island 1.

Wait, but in the earlier case with n=4 and k=1, Everule can still visit all islands.

So, it seems that the number of bridges Dominater can destroy affects whether he can isolate island 1 or not.

I need to find a general approach.

Let me think about how many bridges need to be destroyed to isolate island 1 completely.

To isolate island 1 completely, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1.

Since island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands, there are n-1 bridges connected to island 1.

So, if Dominater destroys all n-1 bridges connected to island 1, Everule can only stay on island 1.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 completely.

Otherwise, if k < n-1, Dominater can destroy up to k bridges connected to island 1, but Everule can still reach at least n - k - 1 islands, including island 1.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, for n=5 and k=3, the output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

But according to my previous thought, if k < n-1, Everule can reach n - k - 1 islands.

Wait, n=5, k=3, n-1=4, since k < n-1, Everule can reach n - k -1 =5 -3 -1=1 island, but the sample output is 5.

So, my previous thought is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

In a complete graph, the graph is highly connected. Even if some bridges are destroyed, there are multiple paths between islands.

I need to consider the connectivity of the graph after removing up to k bridges.

Specifically, I need to find the minimum number of islands that are still connected to island 1 after Dominater destroys up to k bridges.

I recall that in graph theory, the connectivity of a complete graph K_n is n-1, meaning that you need to remove at least n-1 edges to disconnect the graph.

So, if k < n-1, the graph remains connected, meaning Everule can reach all islands.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 by destroying all n-1 bridges connected to it, and possibly more.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5 and k=3, since k=3 < n-1=4, the graph remains connected, so Everule can reach all islands, which matches the sample output of 5.

Similarly, for n=5 and k=10, which is k >= n-1=4, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1, which matches the sample output of 1.

Another sample input is n=4 and k=1, where k=1 < n-1=3, so Everule can reach all islands, output is 4.

And for n=4 and k=4, k=4 >= n-1=3, so Everule can only visit island 1, output is 1.

Wait, n=4, n-1=3, but in the sample input, for k=4, which is greater than n-1=3, the output is 1, which makes sense.

So, the general rule seems to be:

- If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit island 1.

- If k < n-1, the graph remains connected, and Everule can visit all islands.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5 and k=3, k < n-1=4, output is 5.

For n=5 and k=10, k >= n-1=4, output is 1.

This seems to hold.

Another sample input is n=2, k=0: output 2 (k < n-1=1)

n=2, k=1: output 1 (k >= n-1=1)

So, the rule seems consistent.

Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is:

- If k >= n-1, then 1 (only island 1)

- Else, n (all islands)

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5 and k=3, k < n-1=4, output is 5.

For n=5 and k=10, k >= n-1=4, output is 1.

This matches.

Another sample input is n=4 and k=1: k < n-1=3, output 4.

n=4 and k=4: k >= n-1=3, output 1.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Hence, the program should check if k >= n-1, then print 1, else print n.

Looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)

Wait, this seems to be checking if n - k <=1, then print 1, else print n.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be if k >= n-1, then print 1, else print n.

Let's see, n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1.

Yes, because n - k <=1 => -k <=1 -n => k >= n -1.

So, the given program is doing the same thing.

Therefore, it seems correct.

Let me verify with some examples.

Sample input 1:

6

2 0

2 1

4 1

5 10

5 3

4 4

According to the program:

First test case: n=2, k=0

k < n-1=1, so print n=2.

Second test case: n=2, k=1

k >= n-1=1, so print 1.

Third test case: n=4, k=1

k < n-1=3, so print n=4.

Fourth test case: n=5, k=10

k >= n-1=4, so print 1.

Fifth test case: n=5, k=3

k < n-1=4, so print n=5.

Sixth test case: n=4, k=4

k >= n-1=3, so print 1.

Which matches the sample outputs.

Another test case: n=1, k=0

n=1, k=0

k >= n-1=0, so print 1.

Which makes sense, as there are no other islands to connect to.

Another test case: n=3, k=2

k >= n-1=2, so print 1.

Meaning, Dominater can destroy 2 bridges, which is enough to isolate island 1.

Wait, in n=3, total bridges are 3.

If Dominater destroys 2 bridges connected to island 1, then island 1 is only connected to one other island.

But in a complete graph, island 1 is connected to islands 2 and 3.

If Dominater destroys both 1-2 and 1-3, then island 1 is isolated.

Wait, but islands 2 and 3 are still connected to each other.

So, Everule can't reach them from island 1.

Hence, only island 1 is reachable.

So, the program correctly prints 1.

Another test case: n=3, k=1

k < n-1=2, so print n=3.

Meaning, Dominater can destroy one bridge, but Everule can still reach all islands through the remaining bridges.

For example, if Dominater destroys 1-2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3.

Hence, all islands are still reachable.

So, the program is correct in this case.

I think the program is correctly implementing the logic I derived.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
