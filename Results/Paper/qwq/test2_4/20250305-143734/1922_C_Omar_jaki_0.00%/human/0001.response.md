Alright, I have this problem to solve. There are n cities located on a number line, each with a unique coordinate. I need to handle multiple queries, each asking for the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another using specific movement rules.

First, I need to understand the movement options:

1. I can travel directly from city x to any other city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates, i.e., |a_x - a_y| coins.

2. I can travel from city x to its closest city, paying just 1 coin.

The problem states that for each city, the closest city is unique, so there's no ambiguity in determining which city is the closest to any given city.

My goal is to minimize the number of coins spent to go from city x to city y using these two types of moves.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Option 1: Direct Travel

- Simply pay |a_x - a_y| coins to go directly from x to y.

Option 2: Using Closest City Moves

- I can move to the closest city of x for 1 coin, and then continue from there.

- This seems like it could be cheaper if the closest city is closer than y, but I need to consider the sequence of moves.

- Perhaps there's a way to chain these closest city moves to get to y with fewer coins.

I need to find the optimal combination of these moves to minimize the cost.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Example:

Cities: [0, 8, 12, 15, 20]

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (8)

- City 2 (8): closest is city 3 (12)

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15)

- City 4 (15): closest is city 3 (12)

- City 5 (20): closest is city 4 (15)

Query: From city 1 to city 4

Option 1: Direct travel from 1 to 4: |0 - 15| = 15 coins

Option 2: Use closest city moves:

- From city 1, go to city 2 for 1 coin.

- From city 2, go to city 3 for 1 coin.

- From city 3, go to city 4 for 1 coin.

Total: 3 coins

This is better than the direct travel.

Another query: From city 1 to city 5

Option 1: Direct travel: |0 - 20| = 20 coins

Option 2: Use closest city moves:

- From city 1 to city 2: 1 coin

- From city 2 to city 3: 1 coin

- From city 3 to city 4: 1 coin

- From city 4 to city 5: pay |15 - 20| = 5 coins

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins

Alternatively:

- From city 1 to city 2: 1 coin

- From city 2 directly to city 5: |8 - 20| = 12 coins

Total: 1 + 12 = 13 coins

So, the first approach is better.

Another option:

- From city 1 to city 2: 1 coin

- From city 2 to city 3: 1 coin

- From city 3 to city 5: |12 - 20| = 8 coins

Total: 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 coins

So, the first approach is still better.

Wait, in the initial explanation, the output for city 1 to city 5 is 8 coins, which matches my calculation.

Now, let's think about how to generalize this.

I need a way to compute the minimal cost for any pair of cities.

One way is to model this as a graph where each city is a node, and there are edges:

- An edge between each city and its closest city with weight 1.

- Additionally, there are edges between every pair of cities with weight equal to the absolute difference in their coordinates.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path between two nodes in this graph.

However, with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building such a graph explicitly is impossible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimal cost without explicitly building the graph.

Let me think about the properties of the movement options.

Option 1 allows me to jump directly to any city with a cost equal to the distance.

Option 2 allows me to move to the closest city for 1 coin.

Given that moving to the closest city costs only 1 coin, it's often beneficial to use this option if the closest city is closer to the target than the direct jump.

In the example above, moving step by step through the closest cities from city 1 to city 4 costs 3 coins, which is less than the direct 15 coins.

Similarly, from city 1 to city 5, using the closest city moves step by step costs 8 coins, which is less than the direct 20 coins.

But is there a better way to compute this without simulating each move?

Let me consider the sequence of moves using the closest city.

Since the cities are on a number line and their coordinates are sorted, the closest city for each city is either the previous or the next city.

Wait, no. In the example, city 4's closest city is city 3, which is previous, and city 3's closest city is city 4, which is next.

Wait, actually, in the example:

- City 1's closest is city 2 (next)

- City 2's closest is city 3 (next)

- City 3's closest is city 4 (next)

- City 4's closest is city 3 (previous)

- City 5's closest is city 4 (previous)

So, it's not always moving to the next or previous city; it depends on which one is closer.

Wait, but in this particular example, it seems that moving to the next city is the closest for cities 1, 2, and 3, while for cities 4 and 5, moving to the previous city is closer.

But in general, it's not necessarily always moving to the next or previous city; it depends on the distances.

Wait, but given that the cities are sorted on the number line, the closest city to any city should be either the previous or the next city, whichever is closer.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and also has edges to all other cities with weights equal to their distances.

But again, building such a graph explicitly is not feasible for large n.

I need a way to compute the minimal cost without constructing the graph.

Let me consider the properties of the movement options.

If I choose to move directly from x to y, the cost is |a_x - a_y|.

If I choose to move to the closest city of x, which costs 1 coin, and then continue from there, the total cost would be 1 plus the minimal cost from the closest city to y.

I need to choose the minimum between these two options.

This sounds like a recursive approach, but with n and m up to 10^5, recursion won't be efficient enough.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the fact that moving to the closest city costs only 1 coin, which is much cheaper than moving directly to a faraway city.

So, it might be beneficial to move through a sequence of closest cities to get closer to the target city, and then make a direct jump when it's optimal.

But how do I determine when to make the direct jump?

Let me think about the sequence of moves.

Suppose I'm at city x, and I want to go to city y.

Option 1: Go directly to y, paying |a_x - a_y|.

Option 2: Go to the closest city of x, paying 1 coin, and then from there to y, paying the minimal cost from the closest city to y.

I need to choose the minimum of these two options.

But to compute the minimal cost from the closest city to y, I need to know the minimal cost from that city to y, which might require the same decision process.

This seems recursive, but with large n and m, recursion depth could be too big.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the fact that moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin), so I might want to use it multiple times to get closer to y before making a direct jump.

Perhaps I can think of it as moving along a path where each step is moving to the closest city, and then at some point, making a direct jump to y.

I need to find the point where making the direct jump minimizes the total cost.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote c(x) as the closest city to x.

Then, one possible path is x -> c(x) -> c(c(x)) -> ... -> c^k(x) -> y, where I choose to make the direct jump from c^k(x) to y.

The cost would be k (for moving to the closest city k times) plus |a_{c^k(x)} - a_y|.

I need to choose k such that this total cost is minimized.

But iterating over all possible k is not efficient, especially since k could be up to n.

I need a smarter way to choose k.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly is like moving towards y in steps of varying sizes, depending on the distances between cities.

Wait, but since the cities are on a number line and sorted, maybe I can model this as a form of greedy movement.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a tree and find some tree-distances.

Wait, another idea: since each city has a unique closest city, this forms a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1.

Additionally, there are direct edges between any two cities with weight equal to their distance.

This graph is a combination of a tree (formed by the closest city edges) and additional direct edges.

Wait, is the closest city graph a tree?

In the example:

Cities: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 3 -> ...

Wait, city 4's closest city is city 3, and city 3's closest city is city 4.

So, there is a cycle between city 3 and city 4.

Therefore, it's not a tree.

So, my graph has cycles, which complicates things.

I need to find the shortest path in this graph.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute the shortest paths.

One approach is to precompute some distances and then answer queries based on that.

But I need to think of a way to precompute the necessary information efficiently.

Let me consider that in the graph, there are two types of edges:

1. Edges from each city to its closest city with weight 1.

2. Edges between any two cities with weight equal to their distance.

Given that, the shortest path from x to y could either be:

- A direct edge from x to y with cost |a_x - a_y|.

- A path that goes through some sequence of closest city moves and then a direct jump to y.

I need to find the minimal cost among all such possible paths.

Is there a way to compute this without considering all possible sequences?

Let me consider that moving through the closest city edges is cheap (1 coin per move), so it's beneficial to move as much as possible through these edges to minimize the cost.

But since the closest city edges can form cycles, I need to be careful not to get stuck in an infinite loop.

Wait, but in reality, since the graph is undirected, and distances are based on actual distances, perhaps there's a way to model this more effectively.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is equal to the distance between x and y in the graph where edges are either weight 1 (closest city moves) or weight equal to the distance (direct moves).

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

An idea: Use the fact that moving through closest city edges is cheap and try to find a way to bound the number of such moves.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that moving through closest city edges allows me to cover distance in steps, and I can think of it in terms of covering distance incrementally.

But I need a better structure.

Let me consider precomputing for each city x, the minimal cost to reach any other city y.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need something more efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where cities are nodes, and there are edges between each city and its closest city with weight 1, and also edges between any two cities with weight equal to their distance.

Then, the minimal cost from x to y is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But building such a graph explicitly is not feasible due to the large n.

I need a way to compute the shortest path without building the graph.

Let me consider that in this graph, there are two types of edges:

1. Weight 1 edges to the closest city.

2. Weight equal to distance edges between any two cities.

This seems similar to a graph with two types of edges: cheap edges and expensive edges.

In such cases, sometimes a technique like Dijkstra's algorithm can be modified to handle it, but with n up to 10^5, standard Dijkstra's would be too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving through the closest city edges allows me to traverse the graph at a low cost, and then make a single big jump to the destination.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible k of (k + |a_{c^k(x)} - a_y|), where c^k(x) is the k-th closest city from x.

But computing this for each query would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the sequence of closest cities can form cycles or chains.

In the example, cities 3 and 4 point to each other, forming a cycle.

Other cities have a chain leading to this cycle.

Perhaps I can find the minimal cost by considering the path through these chains and cycles.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where moving through closest city edges is like moving along a tree, and then take into account the direct edges.

But earlier, I saw that it's not a tree due to cycles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the minimal cost by considering that moving through closest city edges allows me to cover distance in steps of 1 coin per step, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to find the optimal point where to make the direct jump.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I move k steps through closest city edges, each step costing 1 coin, and then make a direct jump to y, costing the remaining distance.

But the problem is that moving through closest city edges doesn't necessarily cover equal distances each step; the distance covered each step can vary.

Wait, in the number line, moving to the closest city might bring me closer to y, but the distance covered each step varies based on the positions of the cities.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible sequences of moves, which is essentially the shortest path in the graph.

But with large n and m, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix city y and try to compute the minimal cost to reach y from any city x.

Given that, for each x, the minimal cost to reach y is the minimum of:

- |a_x - a_y| (direct jump)

- 1 + minimal cost from c(x) to y (moving to closest city and then to y)

I can write this as:

cost(x, y) = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + cost(c(x), y))

This is a recursive definition.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need a way to compute this efficiently for all queries.

I need to find a way to compute cost(x, y) without recursing for each query.

Perhaps I can precompute some information.

Let me consider that for each city x, the sequence of moving through closest cities can be thought of as a path or a cycle.

I can compute for each city x, the city that it reaches after moving k times through closest cities.

But with k up to n, which is up to 1e5, this is not practical.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving through closest cities is like moving towards a "center" or a "sink" in the graph.

But with cycles present, there might not be a single center.

Wait, in the example, cities 3 and 4 form a cycle.

So, if I start from city 1, I can move to city 2, then to city 3, then to city 4, and then back to city 3, and so on.

But in practice, I would want to stop moving through closest cities when the direct jump to y becomes cheaper.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of closest city moves before making a direct jump.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s define d(x) as the minimal cost to reach y from x.

Then,

d(x) = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + d(c(x)))

Where c(x) is the closest city to x.

This is a recursive definition.

To compute this efficiently, I can think of it as dynamic programming.

If I can compute d(c(x)) first, then compute d(x), it might be efficient.

But with potential cycles in the closest city graph, this becomes complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can detect the cycles and handle them separately.

Let me consider that the graph formed by the closest city edges is a collection of trees and cycles.

In other words, it's a forest with possible cycles.

I can perform a topological sort on the DAG formed by the closest city edges, handling cycles appropriately.

But this seems complicated.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that for cities not in a cycle, I can compute d(x) recursively starting from the leaves.

But with cycles present, I need to handle them carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over the cities in reverse topological order, computing d(x) based on d(c(x)).

But since the graph can have cycles, I need to handle them by finding the minimal cost within the cycle.

This is getting complicated.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving through closest cities is effectively moving closer to y in steps of 1 coin each, and then making a direct jump.

But the issue is that moving through closest cities doesn't necessarily bring me monotonically closer to y in terms of distance.

In the example, moving from city 1 to city 2 to city 3 to city 4 gets me closer to y=4 step by step.

But in other cases, it might not be monotonic.

Wait, in the example, moving from city 5 to city 4 is moving closer to y=4.

But if y were city 1, moving from city 5 to city 4 would still be moving closer to y=1.

Wait, no, city 4 is closer to y=1 than city 5 is.

Wait, city 4 is at 15, city 5 at 20, and city 1 at 0.

So, city 4 is closer to city 1 than city 5 is.

So, moving from city 5 to city 4 is moving closer to city 1.

So, in this case, it is monotonic.

Wait, but in general, is moving to the closest city always moving closer to y?

Not necessarily, because the closest city is determined based on its own closest city, not based on y.

Wait, no, the closest city is the city closest to x, regardless of y.

So, it's possible that moving to the closest city might not be moving closer to y.

For example, if x is city 3, its closest city is city 4, which is farther from y=2.

Wait, in the example, city 3's closest city is city 4, and city 4 is farther from city 2 than city 3 is.

So, moving to the closest city might not always be moving closer to y.

This complicates things.

I need a way to handle such cases.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal over all possible sequences of moves.

But with large n and m, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the actual distance between x and y minus the maximum reduction I can get by using the closest city moves.

But I need to define what this reduction is.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of closest city moves I need to make to get from x to y.

But with cycles present, this might not be straightforward.

Another idea: model the movement through closest cities as a way to traverse the graph with cheap edges, and then make a direct jump.

So, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimal over all cities z of (distance from x to z using closest city moves + direct jump from z to y).

But distance from x to z using closest city moves is equal to the number of moves, which is the length of the path from x to z in the closest city graph.

But computing this for all z is not efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal such that z is on the path from x to y in some sense.

But I need a better way.

Let me consider that the closest city graph forms some connected components, possibly with cycles.

Within each connected component, the minimal cost can be computed based on the structure of the component.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is equal to the minimal over all possible sequences of moves using the closest city moves and direct jumps.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

An idea: Use the fact that moving through closest city edges is cheap and try to find a way to cover as much distance as possible with these cheap moves.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal number of closest city moves needed to get within a certain distance of y, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to define what that certain distance is.

This seems vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the distance between x and y minus the maximal reduction I can get by using the closest city moves.

But I need to define what this reduction is.

Wait, perhaps the reduction is equal to the number of closest city moves I can make in the direction towards y.

But determining the direction towards y requires knowing whether y is to the left or right of x.

Given that the cities are on a number line and sorted in increasing order, I can determine the direction.

Wait, in the number line, if y has a higher coordinate than x, then moving right (to higher indices) is moving towards y, else left.

But, the closest city to x might be to the left or right, depending on which one is closer.

So, it's not always moving to higher indices.

Wait, in the example:

Cities: 0,8,12,15,20

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (8)

- City 2 (8): closest is city 3 (12)

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15)

- City 4 (15): closest is city 3 (12)

- City 5 (20): closest is city 4 (15)

So, for city 3, moving to city 4 moves closer to y=5, and moving to city 4 from city 3 also moves closer.

Wait, but in city 4, moving to city 3 moves away from y=5.

So, it's not always clear.

I need a better way to handle this.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal over all paths of the sum of the costs of the moves.

But with large n and m, this is not practical.

Let me consider that the problem can be solved using the concept of "minimum spanning trees" or "shortest path trees", but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y, and store it in a table.

But with n and m up to 1e5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the distance between x and y minus the maximal number of closest city moves I can make in the direction towards y.

But I need to define what "towards y" means in this context.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal number of closest city moves needed to reach y, and then the cost is that number plus the remaining distance.

But in reality, it's not that straightforward because moving through closest cities might not lead directly to y.

Wait, in the example, from city 1 to city 4, I can move city 1 -> city 2 -> city 3 -> city 4, which is 3 moves of 1 coin each, plus the remaining distance if any.

But in this case, the remaining distance is zero because I reach y directly.

But in other cases, there might be a remaining distance.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal number of closest city moves needed to reach a city z such that z is "sufficiently close" to y, and then make a direct jump from z to y.

But I need to define "sufficiently close".

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the distance between x and y minus the number of closest city moves I can make in the direction towards y.

But again, defining the direction and determining how many moves I can make in that direction is not straightforward.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal over all possible k of (k + |a_{c^k(x)} - a_y|), where c^k(x) is the city reached by moving k times through closest cities.

I need to minimize k + |a_{c^k(x)} - a_y|.

I need to choose k such that this sum is minimized.

But computing this for each query is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

An idea: For each city x, find the city z on the path of closest cities that minimizes |a_z - a_y|, and then set k to be the number of steps from x to z.

But finding z for each x is not efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the city z that is the closest to y among all cities reachable from x through closest city moves.

Then, the minimal cost is the number of steps from x to z plus |a_z - a_y|.

But computing this for all x is time-consuming.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving through closest cities is like moving along a path where each step reduces the distance to y by a certain amount.

If that's the case, I can compute for each city x, the distance to y and the reduction per step, and find the minimal cost accordingly.

But the reduction per step varies based on the positions of the cities.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal over all paths of the sum of the costs of the moves.

But again, with large n and m, this is not practical.

I need to find a mathematical formula or an efficient algorithm to compute this.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the actual distance between x and y minus the maximal reduction I can get by using the closest city moves.

If I can compute the maximal reduction, then I can compute the minimal cost.

But I need to define and compute the maximal reduction efficiently.

Wait, perhaps the maximal reduction is equal to the minimal number of steps needed to move from x to the closest city to y.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that the problem can be solved using the concept of "potential functions" or "dynamic programming with memoization".

But with n and m up to 1e5, standard memoization would be too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal cost to reach y by moving through closest cities until I can make a direct jump to y with minimal total cost.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving through closest cities until I reach a city z from which the direct jump to y is optimal.

But I need to find a way to compute z efficiently.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the distance between x and y minus the maximal number of steps I can make towards y using the closest city moves.

But I need to define what "towards y" means in this context.

Wait, in the number line, if y is to the right of x, moving right is moving towards y, and vice versa.

But the closest city to x might be to the left or right, depending on which one is closer.

So, it's not always moving in the direction towards y.

In the example:

- From city 1 (0), closest is city 2 (8), which is towards y=4 (15).

- From city 2 (8), closest is city 3 (12), which is towards y=4.

- From city 3 (12), closest is city 4 (15), which is y.

So, in this case, moving through closest cities is moving towards y.

But in other cases, it might not be the case.

Wait, in the query from city 1 to city 5:

- City 1 -> city 2: 1 coin, distance to y=5 (20): |8 - 20| = 12

- City 2 -> city 3: 1 coin, distance to y=5: |12 - 20| = 8

- City 3 -> city 4: 1 coin, distance to y=5: |15 - 20| = 5

- City 4 -> city 5: direct jump of 5 coins, total cost: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins

Alternatively:

- City 1 -> city 2: 1 coin, then directly to y=5: 1 + |8 - 20| = 13 coins

- City 1 -> city 3: not directly connected, so need to go through city 2: 2 coins, then to y=5: 2 + |12 - 20| = 10 coins

- City 1 -> city 4: 3 coins, then to y=5: 3 + |15 - 20| = 8 coins

So, the minimal cost is 8 coins.

This matches the earlier calculation.

But I need a general way to compute this without simulating each possible path.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal over all possible k of (k + |a_{c^k(x)} - a_y|), where c^k(x) is the city reached by moving k times through closest cities.

I need to minimize k + |a_{c^k(x)} - a_y|.

I need to choose k such that this sum is minimized.

But with k up to n, which is up to 1e5, iterating over all k is too slow.

I need a smarter way to choose k.

Let me consider that moving through closest cities is like moving in steps of varying sizes towards y, and I need to find the step that minimizes the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a form of binary lifting, where I precompute the k-th closest city for each city x and then use that to jump in larger steps towards y.

But with cycles present, this might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can group the cities into clusters where moving within the cluster is cheap, and then make jumps between clusters.

But I need to define what these clusters are.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the actual distance between x and y minus the maximal number of steps I can make towards y using the closest city moves.

But I need to define what "towards y" means in this context.

Wait, in the number line, if y is to the right of x, moving right is moving towards y, and vice versa.

Given that, for each city x, I can determine whether moving to its closest city moves it towards y or away from y.

If moving to its closest city moves it towards y, then it's beneficial to make that move.

Otherwise, it's better to make a direct jump.

Wait, in the example:

From city 1 to city 5:

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (8), which is closer to city 5 (20) than city 1 is. So, move to city 2 for 1 coin.

- City 2 (8): closest is city 3 (12), which is closer to city 5 than city 2 is. So, move to city 3 for 1 coin.

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15), which is closer to city 5 than city 3 is. So, move to city 4 for 1 coin.

- City 4 (15): closest is city 3 (12), which is farther from city 5 than city 4 is. So, make a direct jump from city 4 to city 5 for 5 coins.

Total cost: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins.

This seems to work.

Similarly, from city 3 to city 2:

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15), which is farther from city 2 (8) than city 3 is. So, make a direct jump from city 3 to city 2 for |12 - 8| = 4 coins.

So, minimal cost is 4 coins.

This seems correct.

So, the general strategy is:

- While moving to the closest city moves you closer to y, do so for 1 coin.

- When moving to the closest city would not move you closer to y, make a direct jump to y.

This seems like a greedy approach.

Let me formalize this.

Define the distance to y for city x as d_x = |a_x - a_y|.

At each step, if d_{c(x)} < d_x, then move to c(x) for 1 coin.

Else, make a direct jump to y with cost d_x.

This seems correct.

In the first example, from city 1 to city 4:

- d1 = |0 - 15| = 15

- d2 = |8 - 15| = 7 < 15, so move to city 2 for 1 coin.

- d3 = |12 - 15| = 3 < 7, so move to city 3 for 1 coin.

- d4 = |15 - 15| = 0 < 3, so move to city 4 for 1 coin.

- Now, d4 = 0, so stop. Total cost: 3 coins.

In the second example, from city 1 to city 5:

- d1 = |0 - 20| = 20

- d2 = |8 - 20| = 12 < 20, so move to city 2 for 1 coin.

- d3 = |12 - 20| = 8 < 12, so move to city 3 for 1 coin.

- d4 = |15 - 20| = 5 < 8, so move to city 4 for 1 coin.

- d5 = |20 - 20| = 0 < 5, so move to city 5 for 1 coin.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, the total cost was 8 coins, but according to this, it would be 4 coins.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the initial example, from city 4 to city 5, it's a direct jump of 5 coins, not 1 coin.

Wait, in the problem, moving to the closest city costs 1 coin, but making a direct jump costs the distance.

So, in the sequence:

- City 1 -> city 2: 1 coin

- City 2 -> city 3: 1 coin

- City 3 -> city 4: 1 coin

- City 4 -> city 5: |15 - 20| = 5 coins

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins

So, in my greedy approach, I need to consider that moving to the closest city only costs 1 coin, but I need to check if that move reduces the distance to y.

If moving to the closest city reduces the distance to y, then it's beneficial to make that move.

Otherwise, make a direct jump from the current city to y.

Wait, but in the above sequence, moving from city 4 to city 5 reduces the distance from 5 to 0, so it's still beneficial to move to city 5 for 1 coin and then make a direct jump of 0 coins, but that doesn't match the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps my greedy approach needs adjustment.

Let me think again.

In the greedy approach, at each step, if moving to the closest city reduces the distance to y, then move there for 1 coin.

Otherwise, make a direct jump from the current city to y.

In the sequence:

- City 1: d1=15, d2=7 < 15, move to city 2 for 1 coin.

- City 2: d2=7, d3=3 < 7, move to city 3 for 1 coin.

- City 3: d3=3, d4=0 < 3, move to city 4 for 1 coin.

- City 4: d4=0, make a direct jump to city 5 with cost |15-20|=5 coins.

Total cost: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins.

This matches the earlier calculation.

So, the greedy approach seems correct.

But implementing this for each query would be too slow for n and m up to 1e5.

I need a way to compute this efficiently for all queries.

Let me consider precomputing some information.

Let me consider that for each city x, I can compute the minimal cost to reach y by applying the greedy approach.

But with n and m up to 1e5, this would still be too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the sequence of moves through closest cities forms a path or a cycle.

If I can identify these paths or cycles, I can precompute the minimal cost to reach y from any
