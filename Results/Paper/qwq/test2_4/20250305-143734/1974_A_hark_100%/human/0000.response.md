Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1, meaning they take up one cell, and others are 2x2, meaning they take up four cells in a square.

The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and the icons can't overlap.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. We have t test cases, and for each test case, we're given the numbers x and y, which are the counts of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

I need to figure out how to calculate the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons without overlapping.

Let me think about the screen grid. Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making it a 5x3 grid, which is 15 cells per screen.

Now, 1x1 icons take one cell each, and 2x2 icons take a 2x2 square, which is 4 cells.

I need to place as many icons as possible on each screen to minimize the number of screens used.

I should consider how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen and how the remaining space can be used for 1x1 icons.

Let me try to visualize the grid:

A 5x3 grid:

Row 1: Cell (1,1) (1,2) (1,3)

Row 2: Cell (2,1) (2,2) (2,3)

Row 3: Cell (3,1) (3,2) (3,3)

Row 4: Cell (4,1) (4,2) (4,3)

Row 5: Cell (5,1) (5,2) (5,3)

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four consecutive cells in a square. For example, cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) would be one 2x2 icon.

Given the grid dimensions, how many 2x2 icons can fit into one screen?

Let's see:

In a 5x3 grid, we can fit two 2x2 icons:

One in cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

And another in cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)

Wait, but these overlap on cell (2,2). That's a problem.

Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

If I place one 2x2 icon in the top-left corner:

Cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

Then the next 2x2 icon could be placed in cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)

But that would overlap cell (2,2), which is already occupied. So that's not allowed.

Therefore, I need to place the 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to arrange them.

Let me try to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a 5x3 grid without overlapping.

One possible arrangement:

- First 2x2 icon in cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Second 2x2 icon in cells (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)

But as I saw earlier, this would overlap cell (2,2). So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe place one 2x2 icon in the top-left and another in the bottom-right.

For example:

- First 2x2 icon in cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Second 2x2 icon in cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)

- Third 2x2 icon in cells (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3)

But again, the second and third icons would overlap on cells (3,2), (4,2), etc.

This seems tricky. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps only two 2x2 icons can fit into a 5x3 grid without overlapping.

Let me try to sketch it out.

Screen grid:

Row 1: 1,1 | 1,2 | 1,3

Row 2: 2,1 | 2,2 | 2,3

Row 3: 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3

Row 4: 4,1 | 4,2 | 4,3

Row 5: 5,1 | 5,2 | 5,3

If I place one 2x2 icon in cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

Then another 2x2 icon in cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)

This seems possible without overlapping.

Now, is there room for a third 2x2 icon? Let's see.

A third 2x2 icon would need four cells. If I try to place it in cells (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3), but those cells are already partially occupied by the second icon.

Specifically, cells (4,2) and (4,3) are already used by the second icon.

Therefore, only two 2x2 icons can fit into one screen without overlapping.

So, per screen, we can have up to two 2x2 icons, using up 8 cells (since 2 icons x 4 cells = 8 cells).

The remaining cells in the screen would be 15 - 8 = 7 cells, which can be used for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the example above, the second icon uses cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3), which overlap with the first icon if not careful.

Wait, in my earlier sketch, the first icon is in (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), and the second is in (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3). These don't overlap, as cell (2,2) from the first icon and cell (3,2) from the second are adjacent but not overlapping.

So yes, two 2x2 icons can fit into a 5x3 grid without overlapping, using up 8 cells.

The remaining cells are:

(1,3), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), and (4,3) if not already used.

Wait, actually, in the second icon, cells (4,2) and (4,3) are used, and cells (3,2) and (3,3) are used.

So the remaining cells are:

Row 1: cell (1,3)

Row 3: cell (3,1)

Row 4: cell (4,1)

Row 5: cells (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)

That's 6 cells, not 7.

Wait, let's count:

First icon: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

Second icon: cells (3,2), (3,3), (4,2), (4,3)

Total cells used: 8

Total cells in grid: 15

Remaining cells: 15 - 8 = 7

But according to my list above, I only have 6 cells listed. Maybe I missed one.

Looking again:

Row 1: cell (1,3)

Row 2: cells (2,3) - was not used by any icon

Row 3: cell (3,1)

Row 4: cell (4,1)

Row 5: cells (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)

Wait, row 2, cell (2,3) was not used.

So, remaining cells are:

(1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3)

That's 7 cells, as expected.

So, per screen, with two 2x2 icons, we have 7 cells left for 1x1 icons.

Now, the problem is to minimize the number of screens needed to fit all the icons.

So, for a given x (number of 1x1 icons) and y (number of 2x2 icons), we need to calculate the minimum number of screens required.

I need to find an efficient way to place the icons to minimize the number of screens.

One approach could be:

1. Calculate how many 2x2 icons can be placed on each screen, which is up to two per screen.

2. Calculate the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2)

3. Then, calculate the remaining cells available on these screens for 1x1 icons: number of screens * 7

4. If the number of 1x1 icons is less than or equal to the remaining cells, then the number of screens needed is just ceil(y / 2)

5. If not, then we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons: ceil((x - remaining cells) / 15)

6. The total number of screens would be ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - remaining cells) / 15)

But I need to make sure this logic is correct.

Let me think about an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

1 1

Output:

1

So, x = 1, y = 1

According to my logic:

Number of screens for y: ceil(1 / 2) = 1

Remaining cells for 1x1 icons: 1 screen * 7 cells = 7 cells

x = 1 <= 7, so total screens = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

Input:

7 2

Output:

1

So, x = 7, y = 2

Number of screens for y: ceil(2 / 2) = 1

Remaining cells: 1 * 7 = 7

x = 7 <= 7, so total screens = 1

Again matches the sample output.

Another one:

Input:

12 4

Output:

2

Calculations:

Number of screens for y: ceil(4 / 2) = 2

Remaining cells: 2 * 7 = 14

x = 12 <= 14, so total screens = 2

Matches the sample output.

Another test case:

Input:

0 3

Output:

2

Calculations:

Number of screens for y: ceil(3 / 2) = 2

Remaining cells: 2 * 7 = 14

x = 0 <= 14, so total screens = 2

Matches the sample output.

Seems correct so far.

Wait, but let's try another test case:

Input:

1 0

Output:

1

According to my logic:

Number of screens for y: ceil(0 / 2) = 0

Remaining cells: 0 * 7 = 0

x = 1 > 0, so need ceil(1 / 15) = 1 screen

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Matches the sample output.

Another test case:

Input:

8 1

Output:

1

Calculations:

Number of screens for y: ceil(1 / 2) = 1

Remaining cells: 1 * 7 = 7

x = 8 > 7, so need ceil((8 - 7) / 15) = ceil(1 / 15) = 1 additional screen

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, that's a discrepancy.

Wait, in the sample input, for 8 1, the output is 1.

But according to my calculation, it should be 2.

Wait, maybe my logic is flawed.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to optimize better.

Perhaps on the same screen where I place two 2x2 icons and have 7 cells left for 1x1 icons, but in some arrangements, I can place more 1x1 icons.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that with two 2x2 icons, I have 7 cells left.

But in the sample input, with x=8 and y=1, the output is 1, meaning that it's possible to fit them into one screen.

Wait, with y=1, which is one 2x2 icon, using 4 cells.

Total cells used by y: 4

Remaining cells: 15 - 4 = 11

So, x=8 <=11, so it should fit into one screen.

Wait, but earlier I was considering that with y=1, I need ceil(1/2)=1 screen, and remaining cells=7, but actually, with y=1, I can have more cells left for x.

So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

I need to adjust my logic.

Let me think differently.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, as per my earlier calculation.

But in reality, with only one 2x2 icon on a screen, I can have more space for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps I need to consider different combinations.

Let me try to generalize.

Let me consider that each screen can hold:

- Up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, totaling 8 icons if all are 1x1, since 2*4 +7*1=15 cells.

But in terms of icons, it's more accurate to think in terms of cells.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, for y 2x2 icons, they take up 4*y cells.

The remaining cells are 15 - 4*y.

If y <= floor(15/4) = 3, since 4*3=12 <15, 4*4=16 >15, so maximum y=3 per screen.

But earlier, I thought only two 2x2 icons can fit without overlapping.

Wait, there's a conflict here.

According to the cell calculation, up to three 2x2 icons could fit into a screen, using 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

But in reality, due to the grid arrangement, only two 2x2 icons can fit without overlapping.

So, I need to stick with the grid arrangement constraints.

Therefore, maximum two 2x2 icons per screen.

Hence, per screen:

- Two 2x2 icons: 8 cells used

- Remaining 7 cells for 1x1 icons

Or,

- One 2x2 icon: 4 cells used

- Remaining 11 cells for 1x1 icons

Or,

- No 2x2 icons: all 15 cells for 1x1 icons

So, I need to decide, for a given x and y, how to distribute the icons to minimize the number of screens.

I need to maximize the use of screens by placing as many icons as possible on each screen.

One way is:

- First, place as many 2x2 icons as possible, up to two per screen

- Then, use the remaining cells on those screens for 1x1 icons

- If there are still 1x1 icons left, use additional screens for them

So, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2)

Then, the remaining cells on these screens are (ceil(y / 2)) * (15 - 4 * min(y, 2))

Wait, more carefully:

If y <=2, then one screen can hold y 2x2 icons and the remaining cells can hold x 1x1 icons, as long as x <= 15 - 4*y

If y >2, then ceil(y / 2) screens are needed for the 2x2 icons, and the remaining cells on these screens can hold some 1x1 icons.

Then, if x exceeds the remaining cells, additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me look at the formula used in the provided program.

In the code:

if x >0 and y>0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <=0 else math.ceil(x /15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x==0 and y>0:

print(math.ceil(y /2))

elif x>0 and y==0:

print(math.ceil(x /15))

else:

print(0)

Wait, there seems to be a mistake in the formula.

In the line:

x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

I think it should be:

x = x - y*4

Because y 2x2 icons take up 4*y cells, and each screen can hold 15 cells.

But the code seems to be trying to calculate the remaining x after accounting for the screens used by y.

I'm not sure about this part.

Let me try to understand the code's logic.

First, it calculates bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2), which is the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Then, it updates x to x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

I think there's a mistake here.

It should be x = x - (15 - 4*min(2, y))

Because, on each screen used for 2x2 icons, it can hold up to two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If y <=2, then one screen can hold y 2x2 icons and up to 15 -4*y 1x1 icons.

If y >2, then ceil(y /2) screens are used, each holding two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, the total number of screens is ceil(y /2), and the remaining x should be x - (ceil(y /2)*7)

If x > ceil(y /2)*7, then additional screens are needed: ceil((x - ceil(y /2)*7)/15)

Total screens = ceil(y /2) + ceil((x - ceil(y /2)*7)/15)

But in the code, it's doing x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4, which seems off.

Wait, perhaps the intention is to calculate the remaining x after placing y 2x2 icons and using screens accordingly.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of a different approach.

Let me consider the total cell requirement.

Total cells needed = 4*y + x

Total cells per screen = 15

So, the minimal number of screens needed would be ceil((4*y + x)/15)

But, considering that each screen can hold at most two 2x2 icons, I need to make sure that y 2x2 icons are distributed such that no screen has more than two 2x2 icons.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed just for y 2x2 icons: ceil(y /2)

- Then, calculate the remaining cells on these screens: number_of_screens *7

- If x <= remaining cells, then total screens = ceil(y /2)

- Else, total screens = ceil(y /2) + ceil((x - remaining_cells)/15)

This seems correct, based on my earlier thoughts.

But in the sample input, for x=8, y=1, according to this:

Number of screens for y: ceil(1 /2)=1

Remaining cells:1*7=7

x=8 >7, so additional screens: ceil((8-7)/15)=1

Total screens:1+1=2

But in the sample output, it's 1.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Looking back at the sample input:

Input:

8 1

Output:

1

But according to my calculation, it should be 2.

But in reality, it's possible to fit them into one screen.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the remaining cells.

Let me see:

With y=1, number of screens for y: ceil(1 /2)=1

Remaining cells:1*7=7

x=8 >7, so additional screens: ceil((8-7)/15)=1

Total screens:1+1=2

But sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe the arrangement allows for more 1x1 icons on the same screen.

Wait, perhaps with y=1, instead of having only 7 cells left for x, there are actually more cells available.

Wait, with y=1, using 4 cells, remaining cells are 15-4=11, not 7.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in the case of y=1, only one 2x2 icon is placed, using 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, x=8 <=11, so it fits into one screen.

Hence, the sample output is 1.

But according to my earlier logic, I had remaining cells=7, which was incorrect.

So, my initial approach was flawed.

I need to adjust my thinking.

Let me consider that:

- If y <=2, then one screen can hold y 2x2 icons and up to 15 -4*y 1x1 icons.

- If y >2, then ceil(y /2) screens are needed, each holding two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the case y=1, it should be one screen holding one 2x2 icon and up to 11 1x1 icons.

Similarly, for y=2, one screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

For y=3, need two screens: one screen with two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, and another screen with one 2x2 icon and up to 11 1x1 icons.

And so on.

So, generalizing:

- For y <=2, screens_needed_y =1

- Else, screens_needed_y = ceil(y /2)

Then, remaining cells on these screens:

- For y <=2: 15 -4*y

- For y >2: screens_needed_y *7

Then, if x <= remaining cells, total screens = screens_needed_y

Else, total screens = screens_needed_y + ceil((x - remaining_cells)/15)

Wait, but in the case y=3:

screens_needed_y = ceil(3 /2)=2

remaining cells =2*7=14

If x <=14, total screens=2

Else, total screens=2 + ceil((x-14)/15)

But in reality, with y=3, using two screens:

- First screen: two 2x2 icons (8 cells) +7 1x1 icons

- Second screen: one 2x2 icon (4 cells) +11 1x1 icons

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed:7 +11=18

Hence, for y=3, screens_needed_y=2, remaining cells=18

Wait, but earlier I thought remaining cells=14, but actually it's 18.

So, perhaps my calculation of remaining cells is incorrect.

Wait, in the case y=3:

- First screen: two 2x2 icons (8 cells), remaining 7 cells for 1x1 icons

- Second screen: one 2x2 icon (4 cells), remaining 11 cells for 1x1 icons

Total remaining cells for 1x1 icons:7 +11=18

Similarly, for y=4:

- Two screens, each with two 2x2 icons (8 cells), remaining 7 cells per screen

Total remaining cells:14

For y=5:

- Three screens: two screens with two 2x2 icons (8 cells) +7 1x1 icons each, and one screen with one 2x2 icon (4 cells) +11 1x1 icons

Total remaining cells:7 +7 +11=25

This seems inconsistent with my earlier assumption.

So, perhaps a better way is:

- For every two 2x2 icons, we use one screen and have seven remaining cells for 1x1 icons

- For every single 2x2 icon, we use one screen and have eleven remaining cells for 1x1 icons

So, for y 2x2 icons:

- Number of screens for y: ceil(y /2)

- Remaining cells: ceil(y /2) *7 + (y %2) *11

Wait, let's test this.

For y=1:

ceil(1 /2)=1

remaining cells:1*7 + (1%2)*11=7 +1*11=18

Wait, but earlier for y=3, screens_needed_y=2, remaining cells=7 (from two screens with two 2x2 icons) +11 (from one screen with one 2x2 icon)=18, which matches.

For y=2:

ceil(2 /2)=1

remaining cells:1*7 + (0)*11=7

Which matches the earlier case.

For y=3:

ceil(3 /2)=2

remaining cells:2*7 + (1)*11=14 +11=25

Wait, but earlier I thought for y=3, total remaining cells are 7 +11=18

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps for every pair of 2x2 icons, we use one screen with two 2x2 icons and seven remaining cells.

Then, for any odd 2x2 icon, we use one screen with one 2x2 icon and eleven remaining cells.

So, for y=1:0 pairs +1 odd, screens=1, remaining cells=11

y=2:1 pair +0 odd, screens=1, remaining cells=7

y=3:1 pair +1 odd, screens=2, remaining cells=7 +11=18

y=4:2 pairs +0 odd, screens=2, remaining cells=14

y=5:2 pairs +1 odd, screens=3, remaining cells=14 +11=25

This seems consistent now.

Hence, general formula:

- pairs = floor(y /2)

- odds = y %2

- screens_needed_y = pairs + odds

- remaining_cells = pairs *7 + odds *11

Then, if x <= remaining_cells, total screens = screens_needed_y

Else, total screens = screens_needed_y + ceil((x - remaining_cells)/15)

This seems correct.

Now, let's verify with the sample inputs.

First test case:

x=1, y=1

pairs=0, odds=1

screens_needed_y=1

remaining_cells=0*7 +1*11=11

x=1 <=11, so total screens=1

Matches sample output.

Second test case:

x=7, y=2

pairs=1, odds=0

screens_needed_y=1

remaining_cells=1*7 +0*11=7

x=7 <=7, total screens=1

Matches sample output.

Third test case:

x=12, y=4

pairs=2, odds=0

screens_needed_y=2

remaining_cells=2*7 +0*11=14

x=12 <=14, total screens=2

Matches sample output.

Fourth test case:

x=0, y=3

pairs=1, odds=1

screens_needed_y=2

remaining_cells=1*7 +1*11=18

x=0 <=18, total screens=2

Matches sample output.

Fifth test case:

x=1, y=0

pairs=0, odds=0

screens_needed_y=0

remaining_cells=0*7 +0*11=0

x=1 >0, so total screens=0 + ceil(1/15)=1

Matches sample output.

Sixth test case:

x=8, y=1

pairs=0, odds=1

screens_needed_y=1

remaining_cells=0*7 +1*11=11

x=8 <=11, total screens=1

Matches sample output.

Seventh test case:

x=0, y=0

pairs=0, odds=0

screens_needed_y=0

remaining_cells=0

x=0 <=0, total screens=0

Matches sample output.

Eighth test case:

x=2, y=0

pairs=0, odds=0

screens_needed_y=0

remaining_cells=0

x=2 >0, total screens=0 + ceil(2/15)=1

Matches sample output.

Ninth test case:

x=15, y=0

pairs=0, odds=0

screens_needed_y=0

remaining_cells=0

x=15 >0, total screens=0 + ceil(15/15)=1

Matches sample output.

Tenth test case:

x=8, y=2

pairs=1, odds=0

screens_needed_y=1

remaining_cells=1*7 +0*11=7

x=8 >7, total screens=1 + ceil((8-7)/15)=1 +1=2

Matches sample output.

Eleventh test case:

x=0, y=9

pairs=4, odds=1

screens_needed_y=5

remaining_cells=4*7 +1*11=28 +11=39

x=0 <=39, total screens=5

Matches sample output.

So, this logic seems consistent with all the sample inputs.

Now, looking back at the provided code, it seems to have a different approach.

In the code:

if x >0 and y>0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y /2)

x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <=0 else math.ceil(x /15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x==0 and y>0:

print(math.ceil(y /2))

elif x>0 and y==0:

print(math.ceil(x /15))

else:

print(0)

I need to understand what this code is doing.

First, it calculates bxsfory = ceil(y /2), which is the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Then, it updates x to x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

This seems odd.

It's subtracting bxsfory *15, which is the total cells available in those screens, and adding y*4, which is the cells used by y 2x2 icons.

I think it's trying to calculate the remaining x after accounting for the screens used by y.

But I'm not sure.

Perhaps it's trying to compute the net x after considering the cells used by y on the screens.

But it's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe it's incorrect.

Let me test it with the sample input x=8, y=1.

bxsfory = ceil(1 /2)=1

x =8 -1*15 +1*4=8-15+4=-3

Then, bxsfory1 =0 since x=-3 <=0

Total screens=0 +1=1

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, even though the calculation of x=-3 seems wrong, the final output is correct.

Let me try another test case.

Test case x=12, y=4

bxsfory=ceil(4 /2)=2

x=12 -2*15 +4*4=12-30+16=-30+16=-14

bxsfory1=0 since x=-14 <=0

Total screens=2 +0=2

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=3

bxsfory=ceil(3 /2)=2

x=0 -2*15 +3*4=0-30+12=-18

bxsfory1=0

Total screens=2 +0=2

Matches sample output.

Another test case: x=1, y=0

bxsfory=ceil(0 /2)=0

x=1 -0*15 +0*4=1

bxsfory1=ceil(1 /15)=1

Total screens=0 +1=1

Matches sample output.

Seems like even with negative x, the final output is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

screens = ceil(y /2) + ceil( (x - (15 * ceil(y /2) - 4 * y)) /15 )

Let me see:

In the code, x is updated to x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

Which is x -15*ceil(y /2) +4*y

Then, bxsfory1 = ceil( max(0, x -15*ceil(y /2) +4*y) /15 )

But in the code, it's x = x - bxsfory *15 + y*4

Then, bxsfory1 =0 if x <=0 else ceil(x /15)

So, total screens = bxsfory1 + bxsfory

Which is equivalent to ceil(y /2) + ceil( max(0, x -15*ceil(y /2) +4*y)/15 )

I need to understand why this works.

Wait, perhaps it's accounting for the cells used by y and the total cells per screen.

Let me rearrange the formula.

x -15*ceil(y /2) +4*y = x +4*y -15*ceil(y /2)

Then, bxsfory1 = ceil( max(0, x +4*y -15*ceil(y /2)) /15 )

Then, total screens = ceil(y /2) + ceil( max(0, x +4*y -15*ceil(y /2)) /15 )

I need to see if this is equivalent to my earlier formula.

In my earlier formula:

pairs = floor(y /2)

odds = y %2

screens_needed_y = pairs + odds

remaining_cells = pairs *7 + odds *11

if x <= remaining_cells:

total_screens = screens_needed_y

else:

total_screens = screens_needed_y + ceil((x - remaining_cells)/15)

Now, screens_needed_y = ceil(y /2)

remaining_cells = floor(y /2) *7 + (y %2) *11

So, in the code's formula:

total_screens = ceil(y /2) + ceil( max(0, x +4*y -15*ceil(y /2)) /15 )

I need to verify if this is equivalent to my formula.

Let me test with y=1:

ceil(1 /2)=1

remaining_cells=0*7 +1*11=11

If x <=11, total_screens=1

Else, total_screens=1 + ceil((x -11)/15)

Now, in the code:

x +4*y -15*ceil(y /2) = x +4*1 -15*1 =x +4 -15 =x -11

So, bxsfory1 = ceil(max(0, x -11)/15)

Then, total_screens=1 + ceil(max(0, x -11)/15)

Which matches my formula.

Similarly, for y=2:

ceil(2 /2)=1

remaining_cells=1*7 +0*11=7

If x <=7, total_screens=1

Else, total_screens=1 + ceil((x -7)/15)

In the code:

x +4*2 -15*1 =x +8 -15 =x -7

bxsfory1=ceil(max(0, x -7)/15)

total_screens=1 + ceil(max(0, x -7)/15)

Again, matches my formula.

For y=3:

ceil(3 /2)=2

remaining_cells=1*7 +1*11=18

If x <=18, total_screens=2

Else, total_screens=2 + ceil((x -18)/15)

In the code:

x +4*3 -15*2 =x +12 -30 =x -18

bxsfory1=ceil(max(0, x -18)/15)

total_screens=2 + ceil(max(0, x -18)/15)

Again, matches my formula.

So, the code's formula is equivalent to my formula.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of screens required to fit a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 application icons on a desktop grid, where each screen is a 5x3 grid.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Grid and Icons:**
   - Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows and 3 columns).
   - 1x1 icons occupy one cell each.
   - 2x2 icons occupy four cells each in a square.

2. **Constraints:**
   - Each cell can be occupied by only one icon.
   - 2x2 icons cannot overlap.

3. **Optimal Placement Strategy:**
   - Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons (using 8 cells) and seven 1x1 icons (using 7 cells).
   - Alternatively, it can hold one 2x2 icon (4 cells) and eleven 1x1 icons (11 cells).
   - Or, no 2x2 icons and fifteen 1x1 icons.

4. **Calculations:**
   - Calculate the number of screens needed to accommodate the 2x2 icons (`ceil(y / 2)`).
   - Calculate the remaining cells available on these screens for 1x1 icons.
   - Determine if additional screens are needed for any leftover 1x1 icons.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory
