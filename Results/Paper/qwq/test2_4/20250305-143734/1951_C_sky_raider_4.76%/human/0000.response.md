Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the list a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets at the minimum total cost.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6, 4, 2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4, 2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

In the second test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

Buy 2 on each day:

- Day 1: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16; prices become [8, 6, 4]

- Day 2: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16; prices become [8, 6]

- Day 3: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16; prices become [8]

- Day 4: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16

Total cost = 64

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to delay buying tickets as much as possible, because the prices decrease over time, but buying tickets increases future prices. So, there's a trade-off between buying now at a lower price but increasing future prices, or waiting for even lower prices but risking that you can't buy enough later due to constraints.

I need to find a way to minimize the total cost. Let's think about this step by step.

First, I need to model the problem mathematically. Let's define:

- Let b_i be the number of tickets bought on day i.

- Constraints:

- b_i <= m for all i

- Sum of b_i from i=1 to n >= k

- The price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of b_j for j < i.

Wait, no. The problem says that if you buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the prices per ticket increase by x.

So, the price per ticket on day j is a_j + sum of b_i for i < j.

Wait, more precisely, it's a_j plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days.

Let me confirm this with the first example:

Day 1: buy 0, so no increase for days 2-4. Prices remain [6,4,2]

Day 2: buy 0, no increase for days 3-4. Prices remain [4,2]

Day 3: buy 1, so prices for day 4 increase by 1. So, day 4 price becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

Day 4: buy 2 at price 3 each, total 6.

Total cost: 0 + 0 + 1*4 + 2*3 = 4 + 6 = 10.

Yes, that matches.

So, in general, the price on day j is a_j plus the sum of b_i for i from 1 to j-1.

Our goal is to choose b_i for each i such that sum(b_i) = k and minimize the total cost, which is sum(b_i * (a_j + sum_{l=1}^{i-1} b_l)).

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me try to simplify the cost expression.

Let’s denote s_i = sum_{l=1}^{i} b_l

Then, the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}

The cost on day i is b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

But s_{i} = s_{i-1} + b_i

So, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i

So, cost = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_i - b_i) = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2)

This seems messy. Maybe there's another way.

Let me try to think differently. Since buying tickets on earlier days increases the prices on later days, it might be beneficial to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, but considering the impact on future prices.

Wait, but in the first example, buying on later days with lower a_i is better, but in the second example, you have to buy on all days to get enough tickets.

This is tricky.

Perhaps I should consider the days in order, and decide how many tickets to buy each day, considering the impact on future days.

But with n up to 3e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) per test case or better.

Let me think about sorting the days by a_i.

If I sort the days in increasing order of a_i, then I can consider buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.

But I have to be careful because buying on earlier days in this sorted list will increase the prices on later days.

Wait, but the days are ordered in time; I can't change that.

So, sorting the days might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the days in reverse order, starting from the last day.

On the last day, the price is a_n plus the sum of b_i for i from 1 to n-1.

But on the last day, there's no future days to worry about.

Wait, perhaps I can think of dynamic programming.

Let’s consider dp[i][k]: the minimum cost to buy k tickets using the first i days.

But with n up to 3e5, this is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula or a greedy strategy.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, b_i, subject to b_i <= m and sum(b_i) = k.

The total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Let’s denote s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_i - b_i) = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2)

This still seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost in terms of s_i.

Let’s see:

sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i

So, sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * (s_i - b_i)) = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2)

This seems messy. Maybe there's another way.

Let me consider the impact of buying one ticket on a particular day.

If I buy one ticket on day i, its cost is a_i plus the sum of all b_j for j < i.

So, each ticket bought on day i costs a_i plus the total tickets bought on previous days.

Therefore, the total cost for b_i tickets on day i is b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

This seems similar to what I had before.

Let me try to express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Let s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) where s_0 = 0.

So, total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1})

I need to minimize this sum subject to s_n = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a tricky optimization problem.

Maybe I can think of it as assigning tickets to days, considering the cost of each ticket based on when it's bought.

Each ticket bought on day i costs a_i plus the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, the first ticket bought on day i costs a_i, the second costs a_i + 1, and so on.

Wait, no. The problem says that buying x tickets on day i increases the price by x for all subsequent days.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the total number of tickets bought before day i.

Let me try to model this differently.

Let’s define t_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, the price per ticket on day i is a_i + t_{i-1}

Because t_{i-1} is the total tickets bought before day i.

So, the cost on day i is b_i * (a_i + t_{i-1})

But t_{i} = t_{i-1} + b_i

So, total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + t_{i-1})

I need to minimize this sum subject to t_n = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a problem that can be approached by minimizing the sum of b_i * (a_i + t_{i-1})

Let me see if I can find a way to minimize this.

Perhaps I can think of assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Each ticket bought on day i costs a_i plus the number of tickets bought before day i.

Wait, more precisely, the cost of a ticket bought on day i is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on days before i.

So, if I buy a ticket on day i, its cost is a_i + t_{i-1}

So, for b_i tickets on day i, the cost is b_i * (a_i + t_{i-1})

I need to choose b_i for each i such that sum(b_i) = k and b_i <= m, to minimize sum(b_i * (a_i + t_{i-1}))

This seems tricky.

Let me try to think of a greedy approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

I want to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, but I have to consider the impact on future days.

Wait, but buying on a day with lower a_i increases the prices for future days, which might offset the savings.

In the first example, buying on day 3 and day 4 was better than buying on day 1 and day 2.

In the second example, buying on all days was necessary.

Maybe I should prioritize buying on the days with the lowest a_i, but only after considering the cumulative impact on future prices.

Alternatively, perhaps I should buy on the days where the price increase has the least impact.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the total cost.

Total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + t_{i-1})

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * t_{i-1})

I can think of it as sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * t_{i-1}

The first sum is straightforward, but the second sum involves the interaction between b_i and t_{i-1}.

This seems tough to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider the days in sorted order of a_i and decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the cumulative effect.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate the minimum cost using prefix sums or some similar approach.

Let me try to consider the cost if I buy all k tickets on a single day.

If I buy all k tickets on day i, the cost would be k * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

But since I'm buying all on day i, sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j = 0, so the cost is k * a_i.

But this ignores the constraints of m per day and the increasing prices.

Wait, no, because if I buy on day i, the prices increase for days after i, but since I'm buying all on day i, there are no future days to worry about.

So, in that case, the total cost would indeed be k * a_i, provided that k <= m.

But if k > m, I can't buy all on one day.

Wait, no, m is the maximum number of tickets per day, so if k > m, I need to buy on multiple days.

So, buying all on one day is only possible if k <= m.

Otherwise, I need to distribute the tickets over multiple days.

So, perhaps the minimum cost is the minimum over all possible ways to distribute k tickets over n days, respecting the m per day limit, of sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

This seems too general to compute directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the days on which I buy tickets, and the number of tickets per day.

I need to choose b_i for each day, with b_i <= m, and sum(b_i) = k.

The total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j = s_{i-1}

So, the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

I can write this as sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1})

Now, s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i

Wait, s_{i} = s_{i-1} + b_i, so s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i

But s_i is the cumulative sum up to day i.

This substitution might not help directly.

Let me consider that s_i is the total tickets bought up to day i.

So, s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

And s_{i-1} = sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j

So, the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1})

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1})

I need to minimize this sum subject to s_n = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using the concept of minimum cost over time, considering the cumulative effect of previous purchases.

Maybe I can model this as a priority queue or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the days based on a certain criterion and assign tickets accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of (a_i + s_{i-1}), and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest (a_i + s_{i-1}).

But s_{i-1} depends on previous assignments, so it's not straightforward.

This seems too recursive.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints on m per day and the increasing prices for future days.

But I need to be careful because buying on a day with a low a_i increases the prices for future days, which might make it more expensive to buy tickets later.

So, there's a trade-off.

This seems like a classic optimization problem, possibly solvable with a priority queue or some kind of greedy algorithm.

Let me think about a greedy approach.

Idea 1: Always buy as many tickets as possible on the day with the lowest a_i, considering the cumulative increase from previous purchases.

But this is complicated because the a_i are for different days, and buying on one day affects future days.

Idea 2: Buy tickets on days in order, assigning as many tickets as possible to days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints.

But again, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider the impact of buying x tickets on day i.

The cost for those x tickets is x * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

And for each of those x tickets, the prices on all subsequent days increase by x.

Wait, no, the problem says that buying x tickets on day i increases the price per ticket by x for all subsequent days.

So, on day i, buying x tickets costs x * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

And for all j > i, a_j becomes a_j + x.

So, the prices for future days increase by x.

This means that buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days, which could make buying on later days more expensive.

Therefore, there is a trade-off between buying on a day with a low a_i and avoiding increasing the prices for future days.

This is tricky.

Let me think about the total cost.

Total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

I need to minimize this sum subject to sum(b_i) = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers or some similar optimization technique, but that might be too complex for an algorithmic problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a minimum cost assignment problem, but that seems too general.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

- Assign tickets to the days with the lowest a_i first, but considering the constraints on m per day and the cumulative increase.

Wait, but sorting the days doesn't directly account for the day ordering in the problem.

I need to find a way to assign tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost, considering the constraints.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the cumulative sum.

Let’s denote s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}

So, the cost on day i is b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

I need to minimize sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1}) given that s_n = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using dynamic programming, but with n up to 3e5, standard DP might be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * s_{i-1}

The first sum is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i

The second sum is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * s_{i-1}

I need to minimize this.

But s_{i-1} = sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j

So, sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j

This is equivalent to sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} b_i * b_j

So, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} b_i * b_j

This seems like a sum of individual costs plus a sum of pairwise products of b_i and b_j for j < i.

This is getting more complicated.

Maybe I can think of this as a quadratic form.

Let me consider the vector b = [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]

Then, the total cost is b^T * A * b, where A is a matrix that encodes the costs.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the total number of tickets bought up to each day, i.e., s_i.

Then, s_i >= s_{i-1}, and s_n = k.

The cost would be sum_{i=1 to n} (s_i - s_{i-1}) * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_i * a_i + s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1} * a_i - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems even more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

I need to minimize this sum subject to sum(b_i) = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a classic optimization problem, perhaps solvable using the method of Lagrange multipliers or some similar approach.

But given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient algorithmic solution.

Let me think about the impact of buying one more ticket on a day.

If I buy one more ticket on day i, its cost is a_i + s_{i-1}, and it increases the prices for all future days by 1.

So, the marginal cost of buying one more ticket on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}, plus the sum of 1 for each remaining ticket to be bought on future days.

Wait, that might be a way to think about it.

Let’s say I have to buy k tickets in total.

Each ticket has a base cost of a_i plus the number of tickets bought before day i, plus the number of tickets bought on future days.

Wait, no.

If I buy a ticket on day i, its cost is a_i plus the number of tickets bought before day i.

Additionally, buying this ticket increases the price for all future days by 1.

So, the total additional cost due to buying one ticket on day i is:

- Cost on day i: a_i + s_{i-1}

- Increased cost for all future tickets: sum_{j=i+1 to n} b_j * 1

But this seems too involved.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, b_i.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider the problem in terms of assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

I need to assign exactly k tickets to the n days, with no more than m tickets per day.

This seems similar to assigning workers to tasks with costs, but with dependencies.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent days, and edges represent the cost of assigning tickets to those days, considering the cumulative effect.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, respecting the constraints on m per day and the increasing prices for future days.

But I need to be careful because buying on a day with a low a_i increases the prices for future days, which might make it more expensive to buy tickets later.

So, there's a trade-off.

Maybe I can use a priority queue to always choose the day with the current lowest price plus the cumulative increase.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize a priority queue with the days, sorted by a_i plus the current sum of b_j for j < i.

Start with s_0 = 0.

For each day i, insert (a_i, i) into the priority queue.

Then, for k times:

- Extract the day with the smallest a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j

- Assign one ticket to that day, increment b_i, and update the prices for future days.

But this would be O(k log n), which is too slow for k up to 1e9 and n up to 3e5.

I need a faster approach.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, b_i.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Let’s denote s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_i - b_i

So, the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * (s_i - b_i)) = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * s_i - b_i^2)

This seems no better.

Wait, perhaps I can think of s_i as a variable and find a way to minimize this expression.

But it's still not clear.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed in terms of s_i.

Let’s try to express the total cost in terms of s_i.

Given that s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} b_j

Then, b_i = s_i - s_{i-1}

So, the cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_i - s_{i-1}) * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (s_i * a_i + s_i * s_{i-1} - s_{i-1} * a_i - s_{i-1}^2)

This seems even more complicated.

Maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

So, the cost of a ticket on day i is a_i plus the total tickets assigned to days 1 to i-1.

Therefore, if I assign t_i tickets to day i, their individual costs are:

- First ticket: a_i + s_{i-1}

- Second ticket: a_i + s_{i-1} + 1

- Third ticket: a_i + s_{i-1} + 2

- ...

- t_i-th ticket: a_i + s_{i-1} + t_i - 1

So, the total cost for day i is sum_{j=0 to t_i-1} (a_i + s_{i-1} + j) = t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1} + t_i * (t_i - 1) / 2

Therefore, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (t_i * a_i + t_i * s_{i-1} + t_i * (t_i - 1) / 2)

But s_{i-1} = sum_{j=1 to i-1} t_j

This seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the total cost as the sum over all tickets of their individual costs.

Each ticket has a cost equal to the day's a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before its day.

So, if a ticket is assigned to day i, its cost is a_i plus the total number of tickets assigned to days 1 to i-1.

Therefore, the total cost is sum over all tickets of (a_i + number of tickets before day i)

This can be expressed as sum over all tickets of a_i plus sum over all tickets of (number of tickets before its day)

Which is sum over all tickets of a_i plus the sum over all pairs of tickets where one ticket is before another.

So, total cost = sum over all tickets of a_i + number of pairs of tickets where one is before the other.

This seems interesting.

Let’s denote s = sum over all tickets of a_i + sum over all pairs of tickets where one is before another.

I need to minimize s.

Wait, more precisely:

Total cost = sum over all tickets of a_i + sum over all pairs of tickets where one is before another.

The sum over all tickets of a_i depends on which day each ticket is assigned to.

The sum over all pairs of tickets where one is before another is equal to the number of such pairs, which is the total number of pairs where one ticket is assigned to a day before another.

This seems related to the ordering of the tickets.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the problem differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

I need to minimize this sum subject to sum_{i=1 to n} b_i = k and b_i <= m for all i.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using calculus or optimization techniques, but I need an algorithmic solution.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

- Assign tickets to the days with the lowest a_i first, respecting the m per day limit.

- However, take into account that assigning tickets to earlier days increases the prices for future days.

This seems like a modified greedy approach.

But I need to find a way to balance between assigning tickets to days with low a_i and not increasing the prices too much for future days.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the incremental cost of assigning a ticket to day i is a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i, plus the number of future tickets times the increase in price due to this assignment.

Wait, this seems too involved.

Let me consider the following formula:

Total cost = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Which can be rewritten as sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i + b_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Let’s denote s = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i = k

Then, sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_i b_j = sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} b_i b_j

This is half of (sum_{i=1 to n} b_i)^2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2

Because (sum b_i)^2 = sum b_i^2 + 2 * sum_{i < j} b_i b_j

Therefore, sum_{i < j} b_i b_j = (s^2 - sum b_i^2) / 2

So, total cost = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i) + (s^2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2) / 2

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2) / 2

So, to minimize the total cost, I need to minimize sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2) / 2

This seems a bit simpler.

So, the total cost is c = sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2) / 2

I need to choose b_i such that sum_{i=1 to n} b_i = k and b_i <= m for all i, to minimize c.

This seems like a quadratic function in terms of b_i.

I need to minimize sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2

Let me rearrange this:

c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2)/2 - (sum b_i^2)/2

So, c = (k^2)/2 + sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

So, minimizing c is equivalent to minimizing (k^2)/2 + sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

But (k^2)/2 is constant, so I need to minimize sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

Wait, no.

Wait, c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2

Which is c = sum b_i * a_i + (k^2)/2 - (sum b_i^2)/2

So, c = (k^2)/2 + sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

Since (k^2)/2 is constant, minimizing c is equivalent to minimizing sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

Wait, but in the expression c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2, and I need to minimize c.

Given that sum b_i = k, and b_i <= m.

This seems like a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.

Perhaps I can approach this by considering the days in a certain order.

Let me think about sorting the days based on a_i - b_i.

Wait, perhaps sorting the days based on a_i - some function of b_i.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each day i, the term is b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2

So, for each day, the expression to minimize is b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2

This is a quadratic in b_i: - (b_i^2)/2 + a_i * b_i

This is a downward-opening parabola, and the maximum occurs at b_i = a_i.

But I need to minimize the sum over all days of this expression.

Wait, but I need to minimize c = (k^2)/2 + sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

Wait, but (k^2)/2 is a constant, so minimizing c is equivalent to minimizing sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

But in the expression c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2, and sum b_i = k.

So, perhaps I can think of it as minimizing sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2

Given that sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

This seems like a quadratic programming problem.

But perhaps there is a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that the expression c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2 can be rewritten in terms of a_i and b_i.

Let me think about assigning b_i to minimize this expression.

Given that sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

Perhaps I can assign b_i proportionally to a_i, but considering the quadratic term.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix the values of b_i, then the total cost is c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2

I need to minimize c.

Given that sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

This seems like a constrained optimization problem.

Perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers.

Define the Lagrangian:

L = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2 + lambda * (sum b_i - k)

Take derivatives with respect to b_i and set to zero.

dL/db_i = a_i - b_i + lambda = 0

So, a_i - b_i + lambda = 0 => b_i = a_i + lambda

But also, sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

This seems promising.

From b_i = a_i + lambda, and sum b_i = k, we have sum (a_i + lambda) = k => sum a_i + n * lambda = k => lambda = (k - sum a_i)/n

But this assumes that b_i <= m for all i, which may not hold.

So, perhaps I can set b_i = min(m, a_i + lambda)

But this needs to satisfy sum b_i = k.

This seems like a method to find b_i, but it's not clear how to implement it efficiently.

Moreover, I need to handle the constraints b_i <= m.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider a different approach.

Let’s consider that the total cost c can be expressed as sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2

I can rearrange this as c = sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2) + (k^2)/2

So, minimizing c is equivalent to minimizing sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2)

Given that sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

This seems like a standard quadratic optimization problem.

Perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i - b_i, and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i - b_i.

But I need to consider the quadratic term.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the values of b_i, then the expression sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2) can be thought of as a sum over days of individual contributions.

Each day contributes b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2.

I need to maximize the negative of this sum, which is equivalent to minimizing the sum.

So, I need to choose b_i to minimize sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2), subject to sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

This seems like a standard quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.

Perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the optimal b_i.

Set up the Lagrangian:

L = sum (b_i * a_i - (b_i^2)/2) + lambda * (sum b_i - k)

Take derivatives with respect to b_i and set to zero:

dL/db_i = a_i - b_i + lambda = 0 => b_i = a_i + lambda

But I also have the constraint b_i <= m.

So, the optimal b_i should be b_i = min(m, a_i + lambda)

But I need to find lambda such that sum b_i = k.

This seems like a standard method for solving such problems.

So, I can sort the days based on a_i, and assign b_i = min(m, a_i + lambda)

Then, choose lambda such that sum b_i = k.

This seems feasible.

Let me try to implement this idea.

First, sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, set lambda such that the sum of min(m, a_i + lambda) over all i equals k.

This seems like a way to find lambda.

But finding lambda such that sum min(m, a_i + lambda) = k might require a binary search on lambda.

Given that a_i can be up to 1e9 and lambda can be negative, this might be tricky.

Moreover, with n up to 3e5, I need an efficient way to compute the sum of min(m, a_i + lambda) over all i.

This seems feasible with sorting and prefix sums.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Sort the days based on a_i in increasing order.

2. Perform a binary search on lambda to find the value where sum of min(m, a_i + lambda) over all i equals k.

3. Once lambda is found, set b_i = min(m, a_i + lambda)

4. Then, compute the total cost c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2

But I need to ensure that sum b_i = k, which should hold by the choice of lambda.

This seems like a viable approach.

However, implementing a binary search on lambda with floating-point numbers could be error-prone, especially considering the large constraints on a_i and k.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that the expression c = sum (b_i * a_i) + (k^2 - sum b_i^2)/2 can be rewritten in terms of s_i.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that the total cost c can be expressed as:

c = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * s_{i-1}

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * (sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j)

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} b_i * b_j

This seems similar to what I had before.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this as sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + (sum_{i=1 to n} b_i)^2 / 2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2 / 2

Wait, is that correct?

Let’s see:

sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * s_{i-1} = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} b_j = sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} b_i * b_j

And sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} b_i * b_j = (sum_{i=1 to n} b_i)^2 / 2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2 / 2

Yes, that's correct.

So, c = sum_{i=1 to n} b_i * a_i + (k^2)/2 - sum_{i=1 to n} b_i^2 / 2

Therefore, c = sum (b_i * a_i - b_i^2 / 2) + (k^2)/2

So, minimizing c is equivalent to minimizing sum (b_i * a_i - b_i^2 / 2)

Given that sum b_i = k and b_i <= m.

This seems like a standard quadratic optimization problem.

Perhaps I can consider the days in increasing order of a_i - b_i / 2.

Wait, because the derivative of b_i * a_i - b_i^2 / 2 with respect to b_i is a_i - b_i.

So, setting a_i - b_i = 0 would give b_i = a_i, but I have constraints on b_i <= m and sum b_i = k.

This seems similar to the earlier approach.

Perhaps I can use a greedy approach where I assign b_i to the days with the highest a_i - b_i.

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each day, the expression b_i * a_i - b_i^2 / 2 is maximized when b_i = a_i, but I need to minimize the sum, so I need to minimize this expression.

Wait, no, I need to minimize sum (b_i * a_i - b_i^2 / 2)

So, I need to minimize this sum.

Given that, perhaps
