Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with a friendship value f_i. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she randomly chooses a pair of children equiprobably and independently. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0 that never changes. I need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen, considering the time they are chosen.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n children, and some of them are friends with a given friendship value. The teacher chooses k pairs randomly for excursions, and if a chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all future excursions. I need to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of choice for each of the k excursions.

Let me try to rephrase that to make sure I understand. For each excursion, a pair is chosen randomly. If they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all future excursions. Non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0 that doesn't change. I need the expected sum of the friendship values of all chosen pairs at the time they are chosen.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this. Since the choices are independent, maybe I can find the expected value for each excursion and then sum them up.

Let's consider one excursion. The teacher chooses a pair of children randomly. There are C(n,2) possible pairs, where C(n,2) is n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.

For each pair that is friends, their friendship value is f_i, and if chosen, it increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. But for the sum of friendship values at the time of choice, I need to consider the value at the time of choosing each pair.

Wait, but the problem says "the friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions." So, if a friend pair is chosen in excursion t, their friendship value increases by 1 for excursions t+1 onwards.

But for the sum of friendship values at the time of choice, I need the value at the time of choice, not future excursions.

Wait, no. The problem says: "the friendship value of a pair who are friends increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions." But "the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen)."

So, for each excursion, when a pair is chosen, their friendship value at that moment is considered, and if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

So, for each excursion, the friendship value of the chosen pair at the time of choice is what contributes to the sum.

I need to find the expected sum of these k values.

Let me think about how the friendship values change over time.

Let's consider that for each friend pair, each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

But for the sum, I need the value at the time of choice.

So, for a friend pair, if they are chosen for the first time, their friendship value at that time is f_i, and then it increases by 1 for each subsequent time they are chosen.

Wait, no. The problem says that if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, the first time they are chosen, their friendship value is f_i, and if they are chosen again later, their friendship value would be f_i +1, and so on.

But for the sum, I need the sum of the friendship values at the time of choice for each of the k excursions.

So, if a friend pair is chosen multiple times, each time their friendship value at the time of choice is f_i + number of times they have been chosen before.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

Initially, each friend pair has a friendship value f_i.

Each time a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, the first time they are chosen, their friendship value is f_i, and after that, it's f_i +1 for the next excursions, and so on.

But for the sum, I need the sum of the friendship values at the time of choice for each of the k excursions.

So, if a friend pair is chosen multiple times, each time their friendship value at the time of choice is f_i plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

So, for a friend pair, if they are chosen t times, at the first choice, their friendship value is f_i, at the second choice, it's f_i +1, at the third choice, f_i +2, and so on.

So, for a friend pair chosen t times, the sum of their friendship values at the times of choice is f_i + (f_i +1) + (f_i +2) + ... + (f_i + t-1) = t*f_i + (t*(t-1))/2.

But in this problem, since the choices are independent, the same pair can be chosen multiple times, and the order matters because each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases.

Wait, but the choices are independent, meaning that each time a pair is chosen, it's chosen randomly from all possible pairs, with replacement.

So, it's possible for the same pair to be chosen multiple times, and each time their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

But for the sum, I need the sum of the friendship values at the time of choice for each of the k excursions.

So, for each excursion, the friendship value of the chosen pair at that moment is added to the sum.

Given that the choices are independent, meaning that each choice is made randomly from all possible pairs, and the friendship values update based on how many times they have been chosen before.

This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute the expected sum without tracking the sequence of choices.

Let me consider the linearity of expectation. Maybe I can compute the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum and then sum over all friend pairs.

So, for each friend pair, let's compute the expected number of times they are chosen in k excursions, and each time, their friendship value at the time of choice.

Wait, but their friendship value increases each time they are chosen, so it's not straightforward.

Let me define some notation.

Let’s denote X_t as the friendship value of the pair chosen at excursion t, for t=1 to k.

The total sum S = X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_k.

I need E[S] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_k].

Since each X_t is the friendship value of the pair chosen at excursion t.

Now, for each excursion t, the pair is chosen randomly from all possible pairs.

Let’s consider E[X_t].

E[X_t] = sum over all possible pairs P of Pr(P is chosen at t) * friendship value of P at time t.

Given that the choices are independent, the probability that P is chosen at t is 1/C(n,2), where C(n,2) is n choose 2.

But the friendship value of P at time t depends on how many times P has been chosen before in previous excursions.

Wait, but since the choices are independent, the choice at t doesn't depend on previous choices, so perhaps the expectation for each E[X_t] is the same.

Wait, but the friendship value at time t depends on how many times P has been chosen before, which does depend on previous choices.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each friend pair P, their contribution to the total sum S is the sum over all excursions where P is chosen, of their friendship value at that time.

So, S = sum over all excursions t=1 to k of X_t, where X_t is the friendship value of the pair chosen at t.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of indicator variables.

Wait, maybe I can model this as follows:

For each friend pair P, let’s define N_P as the number of times P is chosen in the k excursions.

Then, the sum S = sum over all friend pairs P of sum over t=1 to N_P of (f_P + (t-1)).

Wait, because each time P is chosen, their friendship value at that time is f_P plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

So, if N_P = t, then the sum for P is f_P + (f_P +1) + (f_P +2) + ... + (f_P + t-1) = t*f_P + t*(t-1)/2.

So, S = sum over P of (N_P * f_P + N_P*(N_P -1)/2).

Now, I need E[S] = sum over P of E[N_P * f_P + N_P*(N_P -1)/2].

Since f_P is a constant for each P, this becomes sum over P of (f_P * E[N_P] + E[N_P*(N_P -1)]/2).

Now, N_P follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p=1/C(n,2), since each excursion chooses a pair independently with probability 1/C(n,2).

So, E[N_P] = k / C(n,2).

Also, for a binomial random variable N, E[N*(N-1)] = k*(k-1)/C(n,2)^2.

Therefore, E[S] = sum over P of (f_P * (k / C(n,2)) + (k*(k-1)/C(n,2)^2)/2).

But wait, this seems off because N_P is the same for all friend pairs, but actually, each pair has their own N_P, and they are independent since the choices are independent.

Wait, no, the N_P's are not independent because the same pair can be chosen multiple times.

Actually, since the choices are independent, the number of times each pair is chosen follows a binomial distribution, and the N_P's are independent for different P's.

So, sum over P of E[N_P * f_P] = sum over P of f_P * E[N_P] = sum over P of f_P * (k / C(n,2)).

Similarly, sum over P of E[N_P*(N_P -1)/2] = sum over P of E[N_P*(N_P -1)] / 2 = sum over P of (k*(k-1)/C(n,2)^2) / 2.

But there are m friend pairs, so sum over P of E[N_P*(N_P -1)] / 2 = m * (k*(k-1)/C(n,2)^2) / 2.

Therefore, E[S] = sum over P of f_P * (k / C(n,2)) + m * (k*(k-1)/C(n,2)^2) / 2.

Simplifying, E[S] = (sum over P of f_P) * (k / C(n,2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * C(n,2)^2).

Let me denote sum over P of f_P as sum_f.

So, E[S] = sum_f * (k / C(n,2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * C(n,2)^2).

Now, I need to compute this expression and then find p and q such that E[S] = p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 +7).

Let me see if I can simplify this expression further.

First, C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2.

So, E[S] = sum_f * (k / (n*(n-1)/2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2).

Simplifying the first term: sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)).

Second term: m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2) = m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2) = m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n^2*(n-1)^2)/4) = m * k*(k-1) / ( (n^2*(n-1)^2)/4 ) = 4 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

So, E[S] = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + 4 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

I need to express this as a single fraction p/q.

Let me find a common denominator for the two terms.

The first term has denominator n*(n-1), and the second term has denominator n^2*(n-1)^2.

So, the common denominator is n^2*(n-1)^2.

So, E[S] = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 4 * m * k*(k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Wait, no. Wait a minute.

Wait, the first term is sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)), so to have denominator n^2*(n-1)^2, multiply numerator and denominator by n*(n-1):

sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) = sum_f * (2k * n*(n-1)) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Similarly, the second term is 4 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

So, E[S] = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 4 * m * k*(k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Now, I need to simplify this expression.

Let me factor out 2k from the numerator:

2k * [sum_f * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * (k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 4 * m * k*(k-1) = 2k * [sum_f * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * (k-1)].

Yes, that's correct.

So, E[S] = 2k * [sum_f * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * (k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

This seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the expected increase in friendship values over time.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each friend pair contributes to the sum based on how many times they are chosen, and each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future choices.

But I think I made progress with the earlier approach using linearity of expectation.

So, to summarize, I have:

E[S] = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2).

Simplifying further:

sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2) = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n^2*(n-1)^2)/4) = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + m * k*(k-1) / ( (n^2*(n-1)^2)/2 ) = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + 2 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

So, E[S] = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + 2 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Now, I need to compute this expression and then find p and q such that E[S] = p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 +7).

Given the constraints on the input sizes, I need an efficient way to compute this for multiple test cases.

Let me see if I can precompute some values or find patterns across test cases.

But first, I need to make sure that my formula is correct.

Let me verify it with the sample input.

Sample Input:

4

100 0 24

2 1 10

1 2 1

3 1 2

2 1 1

5 2 4

1 2 25

3 2 24

Sample Output:

0

55

777777784

40000020

Let's check the first test case:

n=100, m=0, k=24

sum_f = 0

C(n,2) = 100*99/2 = 4950

E[S] = 0*(2*24)/4950 + 0*24*(24-1)/(2*4950^2) = 0, which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=2, m=1, k=10

sum_f =1

C(2,2)=1

E[S] =1*(2*10)/1 + 1*10*9/(2*1^2) =20 + 45 =65

Wait, but the sample output is 55. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, C(2,2)=1

E[S]=sum_f*(2k)/C(n,2) + m*k*(k-1)/(2*C(n,2)^2)

=1*(2*10)/1 +1*10*9/(2*1^2)=20 +45=65

But the sample output is 55. So maybe my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted something.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, m=1, k=10

There is only one possible pair, which is the friend pair with f=1.

Each time this pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

So, the sequence of friendship values chosen would be:

First choice: 1

Second choice: 2

Third choice: 3

...

Tenth choice:10

So, sum S=1+2+3+...+10=55, which matches the sample output.

But according to my formula, E[S]=sum_f*(2k)/C(n,2)+m*k*(k-1)/(2*C(n,2)^2)=1*(20)/1 +1*10*9/(2*1)=20+45=65

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, my formula is incorrect.

I must have made a mistake in deriving it.

Let me think again.

Perhaps the issue is in how I calculated the second term.

Let me recall that for each friend pair P, the sum of their contributions is sum over t=1 to N_P of (f_P + t -1), where N_P is the number of times P is chosen.

So, S = sum over P of [sum over t=1 to N_P of (f_P + t -1)].

Expanding, S = sum over P of (N_P * f_P + N_P*(N_P)/2 - N_P/2).

Wait, no.

Wait, sum over t=1 to N_P of (f_P + t -1) = N_P * f_P + sum over t=1 to N_P of (t-1) = N_P * f_P + sum over t=0 to N_P-1 of t = N_P * f_P + (N_P-1)*N_P/2.

So, S = sum over P of (N_P * f_P + (N_P)*(N_P -1)/2).

Therefore, E[S] = sum over P of E[N_P * f_P + N_P*(N_P -1)/2)].

Since f_P is constant, E[N_P * f_P] = f_P * E[N_P].

And E[N_P*(N_P -1)] can be computed using the variance of N_P.

Since N_P follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p=1/C(n,2), E[N_P] = k/C(n,2), and Var(N_P) = k*(1/C(n,2))*(1 - 1/C(n,2)).

But E[N_P*(N_P -1)] = E[N_P^2 - N_P] = E[N_P^2] - E[N_P] = Var(N_P) + (E[N_P])^2 - E[N_P] = k*(1/C(n,2))*(1 - 1/C(n,2)) + (k/C(n,2))^2 - k/C(n,2).

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, for a binomial random variable N_P ~ Binomial(k, p), E[N_P*(N_P -1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2.

Yes, that's a standard result.

So, E[N_P*(N_P -1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2, where p=1/C(n,2).

Therefore, E[S] = sum over P of (f_P * E[N_P] + E[N_P*(N_P -1)] / 2) = sum over P of (f_P * (k/C(n,2)) + (k*(k-1)/(C(n,2)^2))/2).

Now, sum over P of f_P * (k/C(n,2)) = sum_f * (k/C(n,2)).

And sum over P of (k*(k-1)/(2*C(n,2)^2)) = m * (k*(k-1)/(2*C(n,2)^2)), since there are m friend pairs.

Therefore, E[S] = sum_f * (k/C(n,2)) + m * k*(k-1)/(2*C(n,2)^2).

Now, in the second test case, n=2, m=1, k=10, sum_f=1, C(n,2)=1.

So, E[S] =1*(10/1) +1*10*9/(2*1^2)=10 +45=55, which matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I had C(n,2)=1, and it worked out to 55.

Earlier I thought C(n,2)=1, but in my previous calculation, I mistakenly used C(n,2)=1, but then in E[S], I had sum_f*(2k)/C(n,2), which is different from sum_f*(k/C(n,2)).

Wait a second, in my earlier formula, I had sum_f*(2k)/C(n,2), but now I have sum_f*(k/C(n,2)).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me correct that.

In the earlier steps, I had:

S = sum over P of (N_P * f_P + N_P*(N_P -1)/2).

Then E[S] = sum over P of (f_P * E[N_P] + E[N_P*(N_P -1)]/2).

Given that E[N_P] = k/C(n,2) and E[N_P*(N_P -1)] = k*(k-1)/(C(n,2)^2).

Therefore, E[S] = sum over P of (f_P * (k/C(n,2)) + (k*(k-1)/(C(n,2)^2))/2).

Now, sum over P of f_P is sum_f, and sum over P of 1 is m.

So, E[S] = sum_f * (k/C(n,2)) + m * (k*(k-1)/(2*C(n,2)^2)).

Now, in the second test case, n=2, m=1, k=10, sum_f=1, C(n,2)=1.

So, E[S] =1*(10/1) +1*(10*9)/(2*1^2)=10 +45=55, which matches the sample output.

Earlier, I had sum_f*(2k)/C(n,2), which was incorrect. It should be sum_f*(k/C(n,2)).

I must have mistakenly multiplied by 2 earlier.

So, the correct formula is E[S] = sum_f * (k / C(n,2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * C(n,2)^2).

Now, C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2.

So, E[S] = sum_f * (k / (n*(n-1)/2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2).

Simplifying:

First term: sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)).

Second term: m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2) = m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n^2*(n-1)^2)/4) = m * k*(k-1) / ( (n^2*(n-1)^2)/2 ) = 2 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Therefore, E[S] = sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + 2 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Now, to combine these into a single fraction:

E[S] = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Wait, no. To combine, need a common denominator.

First term: sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) = sum_f * (2k) / (n*(n-1)).

Second term: 2 * m * k*(k-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Common denominator is n^2*(n-1)^2.

So, first term: sum_f * (2k) * (n*(n-1)) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Wait, no, to get the common denominator, multiply the first term by (n*(n-1))/(n*(n-1)):

sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) = sum_f * (2k * n*(n-1)) / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Second term is already over n^2*(n-1)^2.

Therefore, E[S] = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2).

Now, I need to simplify this expression to compute p and q such that E[S] = p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 +7).

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, and t up to 5e4, I need an efficient way to compute this for all test cases.

Let me see if I can precompute some values or find patterns.

But first, I need to make sure that my formula is correct.

Given that in the second test case, n=2, m=1, k=10, sum_f=1, and E[S]=55, let's plug in the values:

E[S] = [1 * 2*10 *2*1 + 2*1*10*9]/(2^2 *1^2)= (40 + 180)/(4)=220/4=55, which matches the sample.

Good, so the formula seems correct.

Now, I need to compute p and q such that E[S] = p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 +7).

Given that n, m, k can be large, I need to handle large numbers and modular arithmetic carefully.

Also, since sum_f can be up to m*1e9, which is up to 1e5*1e9=1e14, I need to handle large integers.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's fine.

I need to compute p and q as defined, reduce them to coprime, and then compute p * q^{-1} mod (10^9 +7).

But since directly computing p and q might lead to very large numbers, I need a smarter way to compute p/q mod (10^9 +7).

I recall that to compute (p/q) mod M, where M is a prime, I can compute (p * q^{M-2}) mod M, using Fermat's Little Theorem.

But in this case, M=10^9+7, which is a prime.

So, I can compute p mod M and q mod M, then compute p * q^{M-2} mod M.

But I need to ensure that p and q are integers and that q is invertible mod M, which it is since M is prime and q is not a multiple of M.

Given that, I can proceed with this approach.

Now, in the formula, p = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)], and q = n^2*(n-1)^2.

I need to compute p mod M and q mod M, then compute p * q^{M-2} mod M.

But to ensure that p and q are coprime, I need to divide both p and q by their greatest common divisor (gcd).

But since I'm working modulo M, and M is prime, I can compute p * q^{M-2} mod M directly.

So, in code, I can compute p and q as per the formula, compute gcd(p, q), divide p and q by gcd, then compute p * q^{M-2} mod M.

But to optimize, since M is prime, I can directly compute p * q^{M-2} mod M.

Let me see an example to verify.

Take the second test case: n=2, m=1, k=10, sum_f=1.

p = 1*2*10*2*1 + 2*1*10*9 = 40 + 180 =220

q = 2^2 *1^2=4

E[S]=220/4=55, which matches the sample.

Now, compute p * q^{M-2} mod M.

Compute q^{M-2} mod M, where q=4, M=10^9+7.

q^{M-2} mod M = 4^{1000000005} mod (10^9+7).

Then, p * q^{M-2} mod M =220 * 4^{1000000005} mod (10^9+7).

But in practice, I can compute q_inv = pow(q, M-2, M)=pow(4, 1000000005, 1000000007).

Then, (p * q_inv) mod M=(220 * q_inv) mod M.

But in this case, since q=4 and M=10^9+7, q and M are coprime, so q_inv exists.

Compute q_inv = pow(4, 1000000005, 1000000007).

Then, (220 * q_inv) mod M should be 55, as E[S]=55.

But let's verify:

In Python, pow(4, 1000000005, 1000000007)= (4^1000000005) mod 1000000007.

Compute 4^{1000000005} mod 1000000007.

Since 4 and 1000000007 are coprime, by Fermat's Little Theorem, 4^{1000000006} ≡1 mod 1000000007.

Therefore, 4^{1000000005} ≡4^{-1} mod 1000000007.

So, q_inv=4^{1000000005} mod 1000000007}=4^{-1} mod 1000000007.

Therefore, p * q_inv mod M =220 * 4^{-1} mod M.

But 4^{-1} mod M is the modular inverse of 4, which is (M +1)/4= (1000000007 +1)/4=1000000008/4=250000002.

So, p * q_inv mod M=220 *250000002 mod 1000000007=55000000440 mod 1000000007.

Compute 55000000440 mod 1000000007.

55000000440 /1000000007=55 times, remainder 55000000440 -55*1000000007=55000000440 -55000000385=55.

So, 55, which matches the sample output.

Therefore, computing p * q^{M-2} mod M gives the correct result.

Hence, in code, I can compute p and q as per the formula, then compute p * pow(q, M-2, M) mod M.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it matches this approach.

Given code:

import math

def func():

t = int(input())

M = 10 ** 9 + 7

for i in range(t):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

sum_f = 0

for j in range(m):

(a, b, f) = map(int, input().split())

sum_f += f

cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2

p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

q = 2 * cn2 ** 2

gcd = math.gcd(p, q)

p = p // gcd

q = q // gcd

print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))

So, in this code:

p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

q = 2 * cn2 ** 2

Then, gcd is computed and p and q are divided by gcd.

Finally, p * q^{M-1} mod M is computed.

Wait, in the code, it's pow(q, -1, M), which is equivalent to q^{M-2} mod M since M is prime.

So, it's computing p * q^{-1} mod M, which matches my earlier approach.

Now, let's verify if p and q in the code match the p and q I derived.

In my derivation:

p = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

q = n^2 * (n-1)^2

In the code:

p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

q = 2 * cn2 ** 2

But cn2 = n*(n-1)/2

So, p = 2 * k * (n*(n-1)/2) * sum_f + m * k * (k-1) = k * n*(n-1) * sum_f + m * k * (k-1)

Wait, but in my earlier derivation, p = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

So, there's a discrepancy here.

In my derivation, p = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

In the code, p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) = 2 * k * (n*(n-1)/2) * sum_f + m * k * (k-1) = k * n*(n-1) * sum_f + m * k * (k-1)

So, p in the code is k * n*(n-1) * sum_f + m * k * (k-1)

Whereas in my derivation, p = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

So, the code has p = k * n*(n-1) * sum_f + m * k * (k-1)

But according to my derivation, it should be sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in deriving p.

Let me double-check.

Earlier, I had:

E[S] = sum_f * (k / C(n,2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * C(n,2)^2)

With C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2

So, E[S] = sum_f * (k / (n*(n-1)/2)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2)

= sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + m * k*(k-1) / (2 * (n^2*(n-1)^2)/4)

= sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + m * k*(k-1) / ( (n^2*(n-1)^2)/2 )

= sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)/(n^2*(n-1)^2)

Now, to combine these into a single fraction:

Common denominator is n^2*(n-1)^2.

So, E[S] = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) = sum_f * 2k * (n^2*(n-1)^2)/(n*(n-1) * n^2*(n-1)^2) = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1)/ (n^2*(n-1)^2)

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, to combine sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) and 2 * m * k*(k-1)/(n^2*(n-1)^2), common denominator is n^2*(n-1)^2.

So, sum_f * (2k)/(n*(n-1)) = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

And 2 * m * k*(k-1)/(n^2*(n-1)^2) remains the same.

Therefore, E[S] = [sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)] / (n^2*(n-1)^2)

So, p = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

q = n^2*(n-1)^2

But in the code, p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

With cn2 = n*(n-1)/2

So, p = 2 * k * (n*(n-1)/2) * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) = k * n*(n-1) * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)

Wait, that's different from my p.

Similarly, q = 2 * cn2 **2 = 2 * (n*(n-1)/2)^2 = 2 * (n^2*(n-1)^2)/4) = (n^2*(n-1)^2)/2

So, in the code, q = (n^2*(n-1)^2)/2

But according to my derivation, q = n^2*(n-1)^2

So, there's a discrepancy in both p and q.

Wait, perhaps they factored out a 2 or something.

Let me see.

Suppose I factor out a 2 from my p and q.

So, p = sum_f * 2k * n*(n-1) + 2 * m * k*(k-1)

q = n^2*(n-1)^2

If I factor out 2, p' = sum_f * k * n*(n-1) + m * k*(k-1)

q' = n^2*(n-1)^2 / 2

Which matches the code's p and q.

So, perhaps they simplified by factoring out a 2.

Then, E[S] = p / q = p' / q'

But when reducing p' and q' by their gcd, it should be equivalent.

Then, in the code, they compute p' and q', find gcd(p', q'), divide both by gcd, and then compute p' * q'^{-1} mod M.

This should give the correct result.

Let me verify with the second test case.

n=2, m=1, k=10, sum_f=1

cn2 =2*1/2=1

p =2*10*1*1 +1*10*9=20+90=110

q=2*1^2=2

Then, gcd(110,2)=2

p=110/2=55

q=2/2=1

Then, 55 * 1^{-1} mod (10^9+7)=55*1=55, which matches the sample.

In my earlier manual calculation, I had p=220 and q=4, which reduces to 55/1, giving the same result.

So, the code seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the expected value of the sum of friendship values for pairs of children chosen randomly over a series of excursions, considering that the friendship values of pairs who are friends increase over time.
