Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the original array a must be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called the "penalty." The penalty p(b) for a subsequence b is the number of times an element is less than the next one in the subsequence. Finally, I need to sum up the penalties of s and t and find the minimum possible value of this sum.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have array a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], possible subsequences could be [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], or even empty sequences.

The penalty p(b) is defined as the number of times an element is less than the next one in the subsequence. So, for example, in the subsequence [1, 3, 2], p(b) would be 1 because 3 < 2 is false, but 1 < 3 is true, so p(b) = 1.

My goal is to split the array into two subsequences s and t such that the sum of their penalties is minimized.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

First test case:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

One possible split is s = [2, 4, 5], t = [1, 3]

p(s) = 2 (since 2 < 4 and 4 < 5)

p(t) = 1 (since 1 < 3)

Total penalty = 3

But is this the minimal sum? Maybe there's a better split.

Another split: s = [1, 2, 3, 4], t = [5]

p(s) = 3 (1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4)

p(t) = 0 (only one element)

Total penalty = 3

Same as before.

Another split: s = [1, 3, 5], t = [2, 4]

p(s) = 2 (1 < 3, 3 < 5)

p(t) = 1 (2 < 4)

Total penalty = 3

Again, same sum.

What if s = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], t = []

p(s) = 4 (1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4, 4 < 5)

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 4, which is worse.

Wait, maybe there's a better split.

Let's try s = [1, 3, 4], t = [2, 5]

p(s) = 2 (1 < 3, 3 < 4)

p(t) = 1 (2 < 5)

Total penalty = 3

Still the same.

Is there a way to get a lower sum?

What if s = [1, 2, 4], t = [3, 5]

p(s) = 2 (1 < 2, 2 < 4)

p(t) = 1 (3 < 5)

Total penalty = 3

Same again.

Hmm, seems like 3 is the minimal sum for this case.

But according to the problem, in the first test case, the output is 3, which matches my findings.

Second test case:

n = 8

a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

One possible split: s = [8, 3, 1], t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]

p(s) = 0 (8 > 3 > 1, so no p(s))

p(t) = 1 (2 < 1 is false, 1 < 7 is true, 7 > 4 > 3, so only one increase)

Total penalty = 1

Is there a better split?

Another split: s = [8, 2, 1], t = [3, 1, 7, 4, 3]

p(s) = 0 (8 > 2 > 1)

p(t) = 1 (3 > 1 is false, 1 < 7 is true, 7 > 4 > 3)

Total penalty = 1

Same as before.

Another split: s = [8, 2, 3, 1], t = [1, 7, 4, 3]

p(s) = 0 (8 > 2 < 3 > 1, no increases)

p(t) = 1 (1 < 7 > 4 > 3, only one increase)

Total penalty = 1

Still the same.

Seems like 1 is the minimal sum for this case.

Third test case:

n = 5

a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Possible split: s = [], t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

p(s) = 0

p(t) = 0 (since all elements are equal, no increases)

Total penalty = 0

Another split: s = [3, 3], t = [3, 3, 3]

p(s) = 0

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 0

Same result.

Seems like 0 is the minimal sum for this case.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal sum is related to how we can arrange the elements in two sequences such that the number of increases in each sequence is minimized.

I need to find a way to split the array into two subsequences where the total number of times an element is less than the next one is minimized.

Wait, but actually, p(b) counts the number of times an element is less than the next one, and we need to minimize the sum of p(s) and p(t).

So, to minimize p(s) + p(t), we need to maximize the number of times where an element is greater than or equal to the next one across both s and t.

In other words, we want as many decreases or equalities as possible in the two sequences combined.

This sounds similar to finding two decreasing subsequences that cover the entire array.

Wait, in a decreasing subsequence, p(b) would be 0 because no element is less than the next one.

But the problem allows for any subsequences, not necessarily decreasing.

Wait, but if we can partition the array into two decreasing subsequences, then p(s) + p(t) would be 0, which is the minimal possible sum.

But is that always possible?

Well, in the first test case, a = [1,2,3,4,5], it's impossible to split into two decreasing subsequences with p(s) + p(t) = 0 because the array is increasing.

In that case, the minimal sum is 3, as per the example.

So, perhaps the minimal sum is related to the number of increasing runs in the array.

Wait, in the first test case, the array is strictly increasing, so any split will have some increases.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the length of the longest decreasing subsequence or something similar.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the array a = [a1, a2, ..., an].

I need to split it into two subsequences s and t.

I need to minimize p(s) + p(t), where p(b) is the number of times an element in b is less than the next one.

Wait, another way to think about p(b): it's the number of increases in b.

So, p(b) counts the number of times b_i < b_{i+1} in b.

So, p(b) is the number of increases in b.

Our goal is to minimize the total number of increases in s and t.

Since every pair of adjacent elements in a must be handled in either s or t, we need to decide how to assign these elements to s and t to minimize the total increases.

Wait, but since s and t are subsequences, the order is preserved, but they can have elements interspersed.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I should consider the problem in terms of the number of increases in a, and how to distribute them between s and t.

Let me consider that in the original array, there are certain increases, i.e., positions where a_i < a_{i+1}.

For each such position, I need to decide whether to put a_i and a_{i+1} in s or t, in a way that minimizes the total number of increases in s and t.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me try to model this.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current position in the array, and j indicates which sequence the previous element was assigned to (say j=0 if the previous element was assigned to s, j=1 if to t, or j=2 if no previous element).

Wait, that might be too slow since n can be up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that I can maintain two decreasing subsequences, one for s and one for t.

At each step, I add the current element to the sequence where it fits best, i.e., to the sequence where it can be added without increasing the penalty, or with the minimal increase in penalty.

Wait, more precisely, I can try to add the current element to s or t, and choose the one that causes the minimal increase in p(s) + p(t).

Since p(s) and p(t) count the number of increases in s and t, adding an element to a sequence can either cause an increase if the new element is greater than the previous one in that sequence, or no increase otherwise.

So, for each element, I need to decide whether to add it to s or t, considering whether it increases the penalty in that sequence.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's keep track of the last elements of s and t.

Let's say ls is the last element of s, and lt is the last element of t.

Initially, s and t are empty, so ls and lt are undefined.

For each element a_i in the array:

- If a_i <= ls, assign a_i to s, and p(s) doesn't increase.

- Else, if a_i <= lt, assign a_i to t, and p(t) doesn't increase.

- Else, assign a_i to the sequence where it causes the minimal increase.

Wait, but if a_i > ls and a_i > lt, then assigning it to either s or t will cause p(s) or p(t) to increase by 1, since it's greater than the previous element in that sequence.

So, in this case, it's better to assign it to the sequence that had the smaller p before, but since both would increase by 1, it doesn't matter which one I choose.

Wait, but actually, I need to minimize the total p(s) + p(t).

So, if both sequences would have their p increased by 1, then it doesn't matter which one I choose.

But perhaps I can choose to assign it to the sequence that has the smaller current p, but that might not necessarily lead to the minimal sum.

Wait, no, because p(s) and p(t) are only increased by 1 if a_i > the last element in that sequence.

Wait, actually, p(s) counts the number of times an element in s is less than the next one in s.

So, if I add a_i to s and a_i > ls, then p(s) increases by 1.

Similarly for t.

So, in this case, if a_i > ls, adding it to s increases p(s) by 1, and if a_i > lt, adding it to t increases p(t) by 1.

If a_i <= ls, adding it to s doesn't increase p(s), and similarly for t.

So, to minimize p(s) + p(t), I should assign a_i to the sequence where it doesn't increase p, if possible.

If that's not possible, then I have to assign it to one of the sequences and accept an increase of 1 in p for that sequence.

This sounds similar to patience sorting or finding the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to partition the array.

In fact, there's a known result that the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to partition the array is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence in the array.

Wait, that might be useful here.

Let me recall that in the well-known problem of "minimal number of decreasing subsequences," the answer is equal to the size of the minimal partition, which is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But in this problem, I need to partition into two subsequences, and minimize the sum of the number of increases in each.

Wait, perhaps I can relate this to the number of increases in the array.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix one subsequence, say s, and try to minimize p(s) + p(t).

Since t is the remaining elements, p(t) is determined once s is chosen.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the total number of increases in the array is the number of times a_i < a_{i+1} for i from 1 to n-1.

If I split the array into two subsequences, each increase in the original array must be accounted for in either s or t.

Wait, not necessarily, because s and t are subsequences, and the order is preserved, but some increases might be "broken" by assigning elements to different sequences.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of times a_i < a_{i+1} in s or t.

But it's getting complicated.

Let me look back at the reference program to understand how it's solving this.

Looking at the reference program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = l[0]

b = 0

c = 0

y = 0

for y in range(1, n):

if l[y] > l[y - 1]:

b = l[y]

break

for x in range(y + 1, n):

if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:

if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:

a = l[x]

else:

b = l[x]

c += 1

elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:

if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:

a = l[x]

else:

b = l[x]

elif a >= l[x]:

a = l[x]

else:

b = l[x]

print(c)

It seems to maintain two variables, a and b, which likely represent the last elements of the two subsequences s and t.

It initializes a to l[0], and b to 0.

Then, it looks for the first element greater than the previous one to set b.

After that, it iterates through the array, and for each element, it decides whether to assign it to s or t based on some conditions involving a and b.

Specifically, it checks if l[x] > a and l[x] > b, and then assigns it to the sequence where l[x] - last_element is greater or equal.

If l[x] < a and l[x] < b, it assigns it to the sequence where last_element - l[x] is smaller or equal.

If l[x] <= a, assign to s, else assign to t.

And it counts c, which seems to be the number of times an element is assigned to a sequence with an increase in penalty.

Wait, I need to understand this logic better.

Let me walk through the first test case:

n = 5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize a = 1, b = 0

Find the first y where l[y] > l[y-1], which is y=1 (2 > 1), so b = 2

Now, for x from y+1=2 to 4:

x=2, l[x]=3 > a=1 and > b=2, so compare l[x]-a=3-1=2 and l[x]-b=3-2=1

Since 2 >= 1, set a=3, c +=1 (c=1)

x=3, l[x]=4 > a=3 and > b=2, compare l[x]-a=4-3=1 and l[x]-b=4-2=2

Since 1 < 2, set a=4, c +=1 (c=2)

x=4, l[x]=5 > a=4 and > b=2, compare l[x]-a=5-4=1 and l[x]-b=5-2=3

Since 1 < 3, set a=5, c +=1 (c=3)

Total c=3, which matches the example.

So, in this case, c counts the number of times we assign an element to a sequence with an increase in penalty.

Wait, but in this approach, a and b represent the last elements of s and t.

s ends with a, t ends with b.

When we assign an element to s or t, if it's greater than the last element of that sequence, p increases by 1.

So, c counts the number of times we have to assign an element to a sequence where it's greater than the last element of that sequence.

Hence, c is equal to p(s) + p(t).

This makes sense.

In the first test case, c=3, which matches the example.

In the second test case:

n=8

a=[8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize a=8, b=0

Find y where l[y]>l[y-1], which is y=2 (3>2), so b=3

Now, for x from y+1=3 to 7:

x=3, l[x]=1 < a=8 and < b=3, so choose sequence where last_element - l[x] is smaller.

a - l[x] = 8 - 1 =7

b - l[x] = 3 -1 =2

Since 2 <= 7, set b=1, c +=0

x=4, l[x]=1 == b=1, set b=1, no increase

x=5, l[x]=7 > a=8 and > b=1, compare l[x]-a=7-8=-1 and l[x]-b=7-1=6

Since -1 < 6, set a=7, c +=1 (c=1)

x=6, l[x]=4 < a=7 and < b=1, a - l[x]=7-4=3, b - l[x]=1-4=-3

Since -3 <= 3, set b=4, c +=0

x=7, l[x]=3 < a=7 and < b=4, a - l[x]=7-3=4, b - l[x]=4-3=1

Since 1 <= 4, set b=3, c +=0

Total c=1, which matches the example.

So, this logic seems to be working correctly for the given examples.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

Let's try to understand the logic step by step.

Initialize a to the first element, and b to 0.

Find the first element greater than the previous one to set b.

Then, for each subsequent element, decide whether to assign it to s or t based on certain conditions.

The conditions seem to be:

- If l[x] > a and l[x] > b, choose to assign it to the sequence where l[x] - last_element is greater or equal.

- If l[x] < a and l[x] < b, choose to assign it to the sequence where last_element - l[x] is smaller or equal.

- If l[x] <= a, assign to s.

- Else, assign to t.

And c counts the number of times we assign an element to a sequence where it's greater than the last element of that sequence.

This seems to be a greedy approach, where at each step, we make a locally optimal choice to minimize the increase in penalty.

Given that the algorithm works correctly for the provided examples, and considering the time constraints (n up to 2e5), this seems to be an efficient solution.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**
