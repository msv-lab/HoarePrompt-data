Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of numbers, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. A subsequence means that I can pick elements from the array in order, skipping some if I want, but without changing their relative order. For example, if my array is [1, 2, 3], possible subsequences include [1, 3], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1], [2], [3], and the empty sequence.

The penalty for a sequence b is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, for sequence [1, 2, 3], the penalties would be at positions where 1 < 2 and 2 < 3, so p(b) = 2. For [3, 1, 2], p(b) = 1 because only 1 < 2.

My goal is to split the array into two subsequences, s and t, such that the sum of their penalties, p(s) + p(t), is minimized.

First, I need to understand what p(b) represents. It counts the number of increasing pairs in the sequence. So, the total penalty is the total number of increasing pairs across both sequences.

I need to minimize this sum. That means I want to minimize the number of increasing pairs in both sequences combined.

Let me think about what would minimize the number of increasing pairs. One way to minimize increasing pairs is to have sequences that are as non-increasing as possible. In other words, sequences where each element is less than or equal to the previous one.

Wait, but that's not entirely accurate. Because even in a non-increasing sequence, you can have p(b) = 0 if no element is less than the next one. But in practice, in a non-increasing sequence, p(b) would be 0 because there are no increasing pairs.

So, ideally, I want both sequences, s and t, to be non-increasing. That way, p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0, which is the minimal possible penalty.

But is that always possible? Can I always split the array into two non-increasing subsequences?

Let's consider an example. Take the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. If I try to split this into two non-increasing subsequences, it's impossible because all elements are strictly increasing. So, I have to distribute them in such a way that each sequence is non-increasing.

Wait, but in this case, if I put all elements into one sequence, it would have p(b) = 4, since 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5. If I split them into two sequences, say s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4], then p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 < 5) and p(t) = 1 (2 < 4), so total penalty is 3. Is there a better way?

Another split could be s = [1, 2, 5] and t = [3, 4], then p(s) = 2 (1 < 2 < 5) and p(t) = 1 (3 < 4), total penalty is 3 again.

Alternatively, s = [1, 3] and t = [2, 4, 5], p(s) = 1 (1 < 3), p(t) = 2 (2 < 4 < 5), total penalty is 3.

Seems like no matter how I split, I get a penalty of 3. But according to the first example in the problem, the minimal penalty is 3, so that seems correct.

Another example: [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]. According to the problem, the minimal penalty is 1. Let's see how that works.

If I split s = [8, 3, 1] and t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3], then p(s) = 0 (since 8 > 3 > 1), and p(t) = 1 (1 < 7). Total penalty is 1, which matches the example.

Another example: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]. Here, all elements are equal. If I split them into two sequences, say s = [3, 3, 3] and t = [3, 3], then p(s) = 0 and p(t) = 0, total penalty is 0, which is the minimal possible.

So, the strategy seems to be: split the array into two sequences such that each sequence is non-increasing. Then, the total penalty would be 0.

But, in cases where it's impossible to have both sequences non-increasing, we need to minimize the number of increasing pairs across both sequences.

I need to find a way to split the array into two sequences where the total number of increasing pairs is minimized.

This sounds similar to partitioning the array into two sequences where each sequence has as few increasing pairs as possible.

I recall that in some scheduling problems, we need to partition tasks into multiple machines to minimize some criteria. Maybe there's a similar approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph problem, where elements are nodes, and edges represent the increasing relationship, and then find a way to color the nodes into two colors such that the number of edges within each color class is minimized.

Wait, in graph terms, if I consider each pair (i, j) where i < j and a_i < a_j, as an edge between i and j, then the problem is to partition the nodes into two sets s and t such that the number of edges within s and within t is minimized.

But minimizing the number of increasing pairs in s and t is equivalent to minimizing the number of edges within s and within t.

This is similar to the graph bipartition problem, where we want to partition the graph into two sets to minimize the number of edges within each set.

In graph theory, this is related to the minimum cut problem, where we want to partition the graph into two sets such that the number of edges between the sets is maximized, but that doesn't directly help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as finding a maximum matching or something similar.

But this seems a bit too complicated for the time constraints, given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, which suggests that an O(n) or O(n log n) solution is expected.

Let me think of a different approach.

Suppose I iterate through the array from left to right, and at each step, I decide which sequence, s or t, to place the current element into.

I want to ensure that in each sequence, the elements are non-increasing.

So, for each element, I have two choices: put it into s or into t, but it must be less than or equal to the previous element in that sequence.

If I can't place it into either sequence without breaking the non-increasing property, then I have to accept that there will be an increasing pair.

Wait, actually, if I can't place it into either sequence without breaking the non-increasing property, then I have to place it into one of the sequences, increasing the penalty.

But I need to minimize the total penalty, which is the number of times an element is less than the next one in either sequence.

This sounds similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to partition the array.

In that problem, the minimal number of increasing subsequences required is equal to the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence.

But in this case, I only have two sequences to split into, not an arbitrary number.

Wait, perhaps it's similar, but constrained to two sequences.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix one sequence, say s, and try to make it as "bad" as possible in terms of increasing pairs, and then put the rest into t.

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i][j], where i is the current index in the array, and j indicates which sequence the i-th element is assigned to (j=0 for s, j=1 for t), and dp[i][j] represents the minimal penalty up to the i-th element, given that the i-th element is assigned to sequence j.

Wait, but this might not work because the penalty depends on the relative order of elements within each sequence, not just the assignment of individual elements.

Alternatively, maybe I can keep track of the last element assigned to s and the last element assigned to t, and decide where to place the current element based on those.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's maintain two sequences, s and t, and their last elements.

Initially, s and t are empty.

For each element in the array, I have two choices: assign it to s or to t.

But, to minimize the penalty, I need to ensure that assigning it to s or t doesn't create an increasing pair.

Wait, more precisely, assigning it to s or t may create an increasing pair in that sequence, and I need to minimize the total number of such pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a new element is greater than the previous one in its sequence.

But it's a bit tricky.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I fix one sequence, say s, to be a non-increasing sequence, and try to make t contain all the remaining elements.

But t might have increasing pairs.

Wait, but t is also a subsequence and I can arrange it in any order, as long as it's a subsequence of the original array.

Wait, no, subsequences must maintain the order of elements as they appear in the array.

So, in t, I have to keep the relative order of elements as they appear in the array.

So, I can't reorder t; I have to take elements in their original order, possibly skipping some.

So, t is a subsequence of the original array, maintaining the order.

Similarly for s.

Hence, when I assign elements to s and t, I have to assign them in their original order.

So, s and t are two subsequences of the original array, and their order follows the original array's order.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as finding two sequences s and t such that each is non-increasing, and every element of the array is in exactly one of them.

But in some cases, like the first example [1,2,3,4,5], it's impossible to have both s and t non-increasing while covering all elements.

Hence, I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of increasing pairs that must be present across both sequences, given that every element is in exactly one of them.

This seems complex.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Try to maximize the total number of non-increasing pairs in both sequences.

- Since p(s) + p(t) counts the number of increasing pairs, minimizing p(s) + p(t) is equivalent to maximizing the number of non-increasing pairs in both sequences.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Another idea: Think about the minimal number of "violations" where a violation is an increasing pair.

I need to distribute the elements into two sequences such that the total number of increasing pairs is minimized.

This seems similar to partitioning the array into two sequences where each sequence is as non-increasing as possible.

Perhaps I can model this as finding two sequences s and t such that the number of increasing pairs in s plus the number of increasing pairs in t is minimized.

To minimize this, I should try to maximize the number of non-increasing pairs in both sequences.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem differently.

Suppose I fix one sequence, say s, and make it as non-increasing as possible, and then assign the remaining elements to t.

But t might have many increasing pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Let me consider iterating through the array and assigning each element to the sequence where it causes the least increase in penalty.

Wait, that might be a way.

Here's an idea:

- Maintain two sequences, s and t, initially empty.

- For each element in the array, assign it to the sequence (s or t) where placing it there would result in the minimal increase in penalty.

- To implement this, I need to keep track of the last element in each sequence.

- When assigning the current element to a sequence, if it is less than the last element in that sequence, it doesn't increase the penalty.

- If it is greater than the last element in that sequence, it increases the penalty by 1.

- So, for each element, I choose the sequence where assigning it there increases the penalty by 0 if possible, else by 1.

- To minimize the total penalty, I should prefer assigning the element to a sequence where it doesn't increase the penalty.

- If I can't assign it to any sequence without increasing the penalty, then I have to choose one sequence, and the penalty increases by 1.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Initialize two sequences, s and t, both empty.

Initialize two variables, last_s and last_t, to keep track of the last elements in s and t, respectively.

Set last_s and last_t to infinity initially.

Initialize penalty to 0.

For each element in the array:

- If the element is less than or equal to both last_s and last_t:

- Assign it to the sequence with the larger last element.

- Update the last element of that sequence.

- If the element is greater than one last element and less than or equal to the other:

- Assign it to the sequence where it is less than or equal to the last element.

- Update the last element of that sequence.

- If the element is greater than both last_s and last_t:

- Choose the sequence whose last element is smaller.

- Assign the element to that sequence.

- Update the last element of that sequence.

- Increase the penalty by 1.

This seems like a way to minimize the penalty.

Wait, but in the first step, if the element is less than or equal to both, I assign it to the sequence with the larger last element.

Is that correct?

Let me think about the first example: [1,2,3,4,5].

Initialize last_s = infinity, last_t = infinity, penalty = 0.

First element: 1.

- 1 < last_s and 1 < last_t.

- Assign it to the sequence with the larger last element, which is both are infinity.

- Let's say I assign it to s, update last_s = 1.

Second element: 2.

- 2 > last_s (2 > 1), and 2 < last_t (infinity).

- Assign it to t, since 2 < infinity.

- Update last_t = 2.

- penalty += 1 (since 2 > last_t).

Wait, but last_t was infinity, so 2 < infinity, so it shouldn't increase the penalty.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the logic.

Wait, if last_t is infinity, and I assign 2 to t, then since 2 < infinity, it doesn't increase the penalty.

Wait, but infinity is just a placeholder for "no elements yet."

So, when assigning to a sequence that is empty, assigning any element doesn't increase the penalty.

Hence, in this case, assigning 2 to t with last_t = infinity doesn't increase the penalty.

Wait, but according to the problem, p(b) counts the number of times b_i < b_{i+1}.

So, in t = [2], p(t) = 0.

Similarly, s = [1], p(s) = 0.

Third element: 3.

- 3 > last_s (3 > 1), 3 > last_t (3 > 2).

- Assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element.

- last_s = 1, last_t = 2.

- So, last_s < last_t.

- Assign 3 to s.

- Update last_s = 3.

- penalty += 1 (since 3 > last_s).

Now, s = [1,3], p(s) = 1 (1 < 3).

t = [2], p(t) = 0.

Fourth element: 4.

- 4 > last_s (4 > 3), 4 > last_t (4 > 2).

- Assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element.

- last_s = 3, last_t = 2.

- last_t < last_s.

- Assign 4 to t.

- Update last_t = 4.

- penalty += 1 (since 4 > last_t).

Now, s = [1,3], p(s) = 1.

t = [2,4], p(t) = 1.

Total penalty = 2.

But according to the first example, the minimal penalty is 3.

Wait, that's less than 3, but according to the example, it's 3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the assignment.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that when assigning to a sequence, if the element is greater than the last element in that sequence, it increases the penalty by 1.

In the above steps, when assigning 3 to s, since 3 > 1, penalty +=1.

Assigning 4 to t, since 4 > 2, penalty +=1.

Total penalty = 2, but the example says 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to count p(b) as the number of times b_i < b_{i+1}, which is equivalent to the number of increasing pairs in the sequence.

In s = [1,3], p(s) = 1 (1 < 3).

In t = [2,4], p(t) = 1 (2 < 4).

Total penalty = 2, but the example says 3.

So, perhaps my approach is undercounting.

Wait, maybe I need to count the number of increasing pairs properly.

In the first example, no matter how I split, I can't get a penalty less than 3.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me try another way.

Perhaps I should model this as counting the minimal number of increasing pairs across both sequences.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times I have to "break" the non-increasing property.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to partition the array.

Wait, but in this problem, we are allowed to split into any two subsequences, and we need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that p(s) + p(t) is equal to the total number of times an element is less than the next one in s plus the same in t.

This is equivalent to the total number of increasing pairs in s and t.

I need to minimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem where I keep track of the minimal penalty up to each position.

Let me define dp[i][j], where i is the current index, and j indicates which sequence the i-th element is assigned to (0 for s, 1 for t).

dp[i][j] would represent the minimal penalty for assigning the first i elements, with the i-th element assigned to sequence j.

Then, for each i from 1 to n, and for each j in {0,1}, I can consider the possible assignments of the previous element.

Wait, but this seems too time-consuming for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the total penalty is equal to the number of times an element is less than the next one in s plus the number of times an element is less than the next one in t.

This is equivalent to the number of increasing pairs in s plus the number of increasing pairs in t.

I need to minimize this sum.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the problem in terms of the number of inversions or some similar concept.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times I have to "switch" sequences to maintain non-increasing order.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of patience sorting or similar algorithms.

Wait, patience sorting is used to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But here, I need to split into two sequences to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to cover the array, but limited to two sequences.

But I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs, not the number of subsequences.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix one sequence, say s, to be a non-increasing sequence, and then assign the remaining elements to t.

Then, the penalty would be p(s) + p(t).

I need to choose s such that p(s) + p(t) is minimized.

But I don't know which elements to put in s and which in t.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in order to minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to maximize the number of non-increasing pairs in both sequences.

Wait, but maximizing non-increasing pairs is equivalent to minimizing increasing pairs.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of non-increasing pairs across both sequences.

But I'm not sure how to turn this into an algorithm.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Initialize two sequences, s and t, both empty.

Initialize two variables, last_s and last_t, to keep track of the last elements in s and t.

Set last_s and last_t to infinity initially.

For each element in the array:

- If the element is less than or equal to last_s, assign it to s and update last_s.

- Else if the element is less than or equal to last_t, assign it to t and update last_t.

- Else, assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element, and update that last element, and increase the penalty by 1.

Wait, this is similar to the earlier approach.

But in the first example, [1,2,3,4,5], this would assign:

1 to s, last_s =1.

2 to t, last_t=2.

3 > last_s (3>1), and 3 > last_t (3>2).

So, assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element, which is s (last_s=1 < last_t=2).

Assign 3 to s, update last_s=3, penalty +=1.

4 > last_s (4>3), and 4 > last_t (4>2).

Assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element, which is t (last_t=2 < last_s=3).

Assign 4 to t, update last_t=4, penalty +=1.

5 > last_s (5>3), and 5 > last_t (5>4).

Assign it to the sequence with the smaller last element, which is s (last_s=3 < last_t=4).

Assign 5 to s, update last_s=5, penalty +=1.

Total penalty =3, which matches the example.

So, perhaps this approach works.

Let me try it on another example.

Take [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3].

Initialize last_s = infinity, last_t = infinity, penalty =0.

1. 8:

- 8 < last_s and last_t.

- Assign to s, last_s=8.

2. 2:

- 2 < last_s (2<8), and 2 < last_t (infinity).

- Assign to t, last_t=2.

3. 3:

- 3 > last_s (3<8), and 3 > last_t (3>2).

- Assign to the sequence with smaller last element, which is t (2 < 8).

- Assign 3 to t, last_t=3.

- penalty +=1.

4. 1:

- 1 < last_s (1<8), and 1 < last_t (1<3).

- Assign to s, last_s=1.

5. 1:

- 1 <= last_s (1==1), and 1 < last_t (1<3).

- Assign to s, last_s=1.

6. 7:

- 7 > last_s (7>1), and 7 > last_t (7>3).

- Assign to the sequence with smaller last element, which is s (1 < 3).

- Assign 7 to s, last_s=7.

- penalty +=1.

7. 4:

- 4 > last_s (4<7), and 4 > last_t (4>3).

- Assign to t, last_t=4.

- penalty +=1.

8. 3:

- 3 < last_s (3<7), and 3 < last_t (3<4).

- Assign to s, last_s=3.

Total penalty =1 (from step 3 and step 7 and step 8, but wait:

- Step 3: assign 3 to t, last_t=3, penalty +=1.

- Step 7: assign 4 to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1.

- Step 8: assign 3 to s, last_s=3.

Wait, total penalty is 2, but the example says 1.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in step 7, assigning 4 to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1.

But according to the example, the minimal penalty is 1.

So, perhaps my approach is not always giving the minimal penalty.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the assignment rule.

Let me try a different assignment.

Assign 8 to s, last_s=8.

Assign 2 to t, last_t=2.

Assign 3 to t, last_t=3 (penalty +=1).

Assign 1 to s, last_s=1.

Assign 1 to s, last_s=1.

Assign 7 to s, last_s=7 (penalty +=1).

Assign 4 to t, last_t=4 (penalty +=1).

Assign 3 to s, last_s=3.

Total penalty =3, which is worse than the example's 1.

So, my earlier approach gives a better penalty of 1, which is correct.

Wait, but according to my adjusted approach, I can get penalty=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to be more careful in choosing which sequence to assign the element to when it's greater than both last_s and last_t.

Maybe I should choose the sequence where the last element is smaller, to minimize the potential for future increasing pairs.

Wait, in the first approach, I chose the sequence with the smaller last element, which in step 6 would be s (last_s=1 < last_t=3), assign 7 to s, last_s=7, penalty +=1.

Then, step 7: 4 > last_s (4<7), and 4 > last_t (4>3).

Assign to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1.

Total penalty=1 (from step 3 and step 7).

But according to the example, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in step 3, assigning 3 to t, last_t=3, penalty +=1.

In step 7, assigning 4 to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1.

Total penalty=2, but the example says 1.

So, perhaps there is a better way to assign the elements.

Let me try a different assignment.

Assign 8 to s, last_s=8.

Assign 2 to t, last_t=2.

Assign 3 to s, last_s=3 (since 3 < 8, no penalty).

Assign 1 to t, last_t=1.

Assign 1 to t, last_t=1.

Assign 7 to t, last_t=7 (penalty +=1).

Assign 4 to s, last_s=4.

Assign 3 to s, last_s=3.

Total penalty=1.

Yes, this gives total penalty=1, which matches the example.

So, in this case, assigning 3 to s instead of t in step 3 leads to a better penalty.

Hence, perhaps my earlier rule needs adjustment.

Instead of always assigning to the sequence with the smaller last element when both are smaller than the current element, maybe I should choose the sequence where the last element is larger.

Wait, in step 3, assigning 3 to s (last_s=8 > 3), no penalty.

Whereas assigning it to t (last_t=2 < 3), penalty +=1.

So, assigning to s doesn't increase the penalty, while assigning to t does.

Hence, perhaps I should prefer assigning to the sequence where the last element is larger than the current element, to avoid increasing the penalty.

Only when I have to assign to a sequence where the last element is smaller, I accept the penalty.

So, modified rule:

- If the current element is less than or equal to last_s, assign to s, update last_s.

- Else if the current element is less than or equal to last_t, assign to t, update last_t.

- Else, assign to the sequence where the last element is larger.

- If both sequences have last elements smaller than the current element, choose the sequence with the larger last element.

Wait, in step 3, 3 < last_s (8), so assign to s, last_s=3, no penalty.

But in my earlier attempt, I assigned 3 to t, last_t=3, penalty +=1.

Hence, assigning 3 to s is better.

So, perhaps the rule should be:

- If the current element is less than or equal to last_s, assign to s, update last_s.

- Else if the current element is less than or equal to last_t, assign to t, update last_t.

- Else, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, and update that sequence's last element, and increase the penalty by 1.

This seems to work better.

Let me try it on the first example:

[1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize last_s=infinity, last_t=infinity, penalty=0.

1: assign to s, last_s=1.

2: assign to t, last_t=2, penalty +=1.

3: 3 > last_s (1), 3 > last_t (2).

Assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is t (2 > 1).

Assign 3 to t, last_t=3, penalty +=1.

4: 4 > last_s (1), 4 > last_t (3).

Assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is t (3 > 1).

Assign 4 to t, last_t=4, penalty +=1.

5: 5 > last_s (1), 5 > last_t (4).

Assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is t (4 > 1).

Assign 5 to t, last_t=5, penalty +=1.

Total penalty=3, which matches the example.

Another example: [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize last_s=infinity, last_t=infinity, penalty=0.

1. 8: assign to s, last_s=8.

2. 2: assign to t, last_t=2.

3. 3: 3 < last_s (8), assign to s, last_s=3.

4. 1: assign to t, last_t=1.

5. 1: assign to t, last_t=1.

6. 7: 7 > last_s (3), 7 > last_t (1).

Assign to the sequence with the larger last element, which is s (3 > 1).

Assign 7 to s, last_s=7, penalty +=1.

7. 4: 4 < last_s (7), assign to s, last_s=4.

8. 3: assign to s, last_s=3.

Total penalty=1, which matches the example.

Seems like this approach works.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- Initialize two sequences s and t, with last_s and last_t set to infinity.

- Initialize penalty to 0.

- For each element in the array:

- If element <= last_s, assign to s, update last_s = element.

- Else if element <= last_t, assign to t, update last_t = element.

- Else, assign to the sequence with the larger last element, update that sequence's last element to the current element, and increase penalty by 1.

This should give the minimal penalty.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I don't need to store the entire sequences, just the last elements of s and t.

Hence, I can implement it with O(1) space aside from the input.

Let me try to write the code accordingly.

But looking at the given code, it seems to implement a similar idea.

Let's see:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

Wait, this seems different from what I described.

In my approach, I keep track of last_s and last_t, initially set to infinity, and assign each element to the sequence where it is <= the last element, or to the sequence with the larger last element if it's greater than both, increasing the penalty by 1.

In the given code, it initializes a =
