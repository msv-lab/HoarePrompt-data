Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can remove 'e' and 'd' to get "abc".

So, the task is to check if every possible combination of length n using the first k letters of the alphabet is a subsequence of s. If not, I need to output one such combination that isn't a subsequence of s.

Let's think about the constraints:

- t is up to 10^5, which is 100,000 test cases.

- n is from 1 to 26.

- k is from 1 to 26.

- m is from 1 to 1000, and s is of length m.

- The sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6, which is manageable.

Given that t can be up to 100,000, I need an efficient solution, probably O(m) per test case or better.

Let's consider the number of possible strings of length n using the first k letters. It's k^n, which can be up to 26^26, but since n is up to 26, and k is up to 26, this number is huge. So, it's impossible to generate and check all possible strings explicitly.

I need a smarter way to determine if all possible strings of length n are subsequences of s.

Let me think about what makes a string not a subsequence of s. If there's any sequence of characters from the first k letters that cannot be found in s in order, then it's not a subsequence.

I need to find if there exists at least one sequence of length n that isn't a subsequence of s.

To check this efficiently, I need to find a way to determine the maximum number of distinct subsequences of length n that s can have, and compare it to k^n.

But even better, I need a way to find a string that isn't a subsequence of s, if such a string exists.

Let me consider building a string that isn't a subsequence by choosing characters that aren't present in s, or in the positions they are in s.

Wait, but all characters are from the first k letters, and s consists only of the first k letters.

So, I need to find a sequence of n characters from the first k letters that doesn't appear in s in order.

I need an efficient way to find such a sequence.

One approach could be to model this using a graph where each node represents a state of the subsequence being built, and edges represent adding a character.

This sounds like a prefix automaton or something similar.

But maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the minimal requirements for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters.

If s contains all possible subsequences of length n, then for any sequence of n characters from the first k letters, there should be positions in s where these characters appear in order.

To check this, I need to ensure that for any sequence, there are indices in s where the characters appear in the required order.

This seems too slow for large n and k.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a string s, and I want to know if it contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters.

One way is to check if s has enough variety in its characters and their positions.

But I need a more concrete approach.

An idea: If s contains all possible subsequences of length n, then for each position in the subsequence, there must be enough choices in s.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each character appears in s.

But that might not be sufficient, because the order matters.

Another idea: Consider the longest increasing subsequence, but that doesn't directly apply here.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of distinct subsequences that s has.

Calculating the total number of distinct subsequences of s and comparing it to k^n could be an approach, but again, for large k and n, this isn't practical.

I need a better way.

Let me consider building a sequence that isn't a subsequence of s.

I can try to find a sequence where, for each character in the sequence, there isn't a path in s that allows that character to follow the previous ones in the required order.

This sounds similar to finding a path in a directed graph where edges represent possible transitions between characters in s.

Wait, perhaps I can model this with a graph.

Let me try to model s as a directed graph where each character is a node, and there's an edge from character A to character B if B appears after A in s.

Then, the existence of a path of length n in this graph would correspond to a subsequence of length n.

So, if I can find a path of length n for every possible sequence, then s contains all possible subsequences.

But checking this for all possible sequences is too slow.

Alternatively, if I can find at least one sequence for which there is no path of length n, then the answer is NO, and I can output that sequence.

But again, checking all possible sequences isn't feasible.

I need a smarter way to find such a sequence if it exists.

Let me consider the minimal number of characters needed in s to contain all possible subsequences of length n.

For example, if n=1, s needs to contain all k characters at least once.

If n=2, s needs to contain all possible pairs of the k characters in order.

Wait, but even for n=2 and k=2, s="ab" contains "ab" and "a" and "b", but not "ba". So, if k=2, n=2, and s="ab", the answer would be NO, and I should output "ba".

So, in this case, "ba" is not a subsequence of "ab".

Similarly, for n=2, k=2, s="abba", let's see:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (a at position 1 and a at position 3)

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 3 and 2

- "bb": positions 2 and 4

So, all are present.

But for s="abb", let's see:

- "aa": is not present, since there are two 'a's only at positions 1 and 3, but in "abb", there's only one 'a' at position 1.

Wait, s="abb" has 'a' at position 1, 'b' at position 2, 'b' at position 3.

So, "aa" would require two 'a's in order, but there's only one 'a'. So, "aa" is not a subsequence.

Hence, the answer should be NO, and I can output "aa".

But according to the sample input, for n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba", the answer is YES.

For n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb", the answer is NO, and "aa" is provided.

So, the program seems to be aligning with this.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

OUT = []

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

(b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)

if not b:

OUT.append('No')

i = 97

while i <= k + 97:

if chr(i) not in s1:

break

i += 1

be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))

OUT.append(s2 + be9i)

else:

OUT.append('Yes')

for i in OUT:

print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):

s1 = ''

s2 = ''

alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}

for i in s:

if i in alphabet:

if len(alphabet) != 1:

alphabet.remove(i)

else:

s2 += i

alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}

s1 += i

r = len(s1) // k

return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)

So, this program defines a function func_1 that processes the string s, keeping track of characters in the first k letters.

It maintains s1, which seems to be a modified version of s, and s2, which might be some suffix.

Then, it checks if len(s1) >= n * k, and if not, it constructs a string that isn't a subsequence by finding a character not in s1 and repeating it to make a string of length n.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, func_1 iterates through s, building s1 by appending characters that are in the first k letters.

It also manages an alphabet set, removing characters as they appear, unless only one character is left in the alphabet set.

I'm a bit confused about the logic inside the loop:

if len(alphabet) != 1:

alphabet.remove(i)

else:

s2 += i

alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}

So, if there are multiple characters left in alphabet, it removes the current character i from alphabet, meaning it's been seen.

But if only one character is left, it appends i to s2 and resets the alphabet set.

I need to understand why this is done.

Then, it calculates r = len(s1) // k, and returns (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2).

The main function then checks if b is True, meaning len(s1) >= n * k.

If not, it constructs a string that isn't a subsequence by finding a character not in s1 and repeating it n times.

If b is True, it outputs 'Yes'.

I need to verify if this correctly determines whether all possible strings of length n from the first k letters are subsequences of s.

Let me consider some examples.

Sample Input 1:

2 2 4

abba

Here, n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

func_1 processes s:

s1 starts empty.

alphabet = {'a', 'b'}

- i=0, s[0]='a', in alphabet, len(alphabet)!=1, so remove 'a', alphabet={'b'}, s1='a'

- i=1, s[1]='b', in alphabet, len(alphabet)!=1, remove 'b', alphabetç©º, s1='ab'

- i=2, s[2]='b', in alphabet, but alphabet is empty, so len(alphabet)==0 !=1, but alphabet is empty, so maybe error?

Wait, the condition is if len(alphabet) !=1:

if alphabet is empty, len(alphabet)==0 !=1, so try to remove i, but alphabet is empty, so maybe error.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the first iteration:

- s1=''

- alphabet={'a','b'}

- i=0, s[0]='a', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=2 !=1, so remove 'a', alphabet={'b'}, s1='a'

- i=1, s[1]='b', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=1 !=1 is False, so s2 += 'b', and reset alphabet={'a','b'}, s1='ab'

- i=2, s[2]='b', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=2 !=1, remove 'b', alphabet={'a'}, s1='abb'

- i=3, s[3]='a', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=1 !=1 is False, s2 += 'a', reset alphabet={'a','b'}, s1='abba'

Then, r = len(s1)//k = 4//2=2

So, return (4 >= 2*2, s1[4:], s2)

Which is (True, '', 'ba')

So, b=True, so output 'Yes'

Which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

2 2 3

abb

Processing:

s1=''

alphabet={'a','b'}

i=0, s[0]='a', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=2 !=1, remove 'a', alphabet={'b'}, s1='a'

i=1, s[1]='b', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=1 !=1 is False, s2 += 'b', reset alphabet={'a','b'}, s1='ab'

i=2, s[2]='b', in alphabet, len(alphabet)=2 !=1, remove 'b', alphabet={'a'}, s1='abb'

r = len(s1)//k = 3//2=1

Return (3 >= 2*2, s1[2:], s2) => (3 >=4 is False, s1[2:]='bb', s2='b')

So, b=False

Output 'No'

Then, find i from 97 to 97+k=99, i.e., 'a','b','c'

Check if 'a' not in s1='abb': 'a' is in s1

'b' is in s1

'c' is not in s1

So, be9i='c'*(2- len(s2)) = 'c'*(2-1)='c'

Output 's2 + be9i' = 'b' + 'c' = 'bc'

But according to the sample output, it should be 'aa'

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking back:

be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))

s2='b', n=2, so be9i='c'*(2-1)='c'

Then, s2 + be9i = 'b' + 'c' = 'bc'

But sample output is 'aa'

So, perhaps this program is incorrect for this case.

Wait, maybe I need to understand the logic better.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to find a missing subsequence.

Let me think differently.

An alternative approach could be to find the minimal number of times each character needs to appear in s to cover all possible subsequences.

For example, for n=2, k=2, s="abb":

- 'a' appears once, 'b' appears twice.

- Possible subsequences:

- 'aa': not possible, since 'a' only appears once.

- 'ab': positions 1 and 2

- 'ba': positions 1 and 2 (a at 1, b at 2)

- 'bb': positions 2 and 3

So, 'aa' is missing, hence output should be 'aa'

But according to the program, it outputs 'bc', which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Looking back at the code:

i = 97

while i <= k + 97:

if chr(i) not in s1:

break

i += 1

be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))

OUT.append(s2 + be9i)

In the second sample input, s1='abb', k=2, so i starts at 97 ('a'), 'a' in s1, i=98 ('b'), 'b' in s1, i=99 ('c'), 'c' not in s1, so be9i='c'*(2-1)='c', and s2='b', so 'b'+'c'='bc'

But according to the sample output, it should be 'aa'

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
