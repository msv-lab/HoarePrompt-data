Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, each occurring every a_i years. The signs must occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we wait for the second sign to occur after that, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on.

But there's a specific condition: for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur sequentially. That means that after the first sign occurs in a certain year, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on.

Let me try to rephrase it to make sure I understand. Suppose the first sign occurs in year x. Then we start looking for the second sign in year x+1, and it must occur in some year after x, say x + k, where k is a multiple of a_2.

Wait, no. More precisely, the second sign must occur in a year that is a multiple of a_2, but after the first sign has occurred.

So, for each sign after the first, we need to find the smallest year that is a multiple of a_i and greater than the year when the previous sign occurred.

Let me take the first example from the input:

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

So, n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

Let's find out in which year the 6th sign occurs.

Start with the first sign: it occurs in year 3 (since a_1=3).

Now, wait for the second sign after year 3. The second sign occurs every 2 years, so possible years are 2,4,6,8,...

But we start looking from year 4 onwards (since we have to wait strictly after year 3). So the second sign occurs in year 4.

Now, wait for the third sign after year 4. The third sign occurs every 4 years, so possible years are 4,8,12,...

But we have to wait after year 4, so the next occurrence is in year 8.

Wait for the fourth sign after year 8. The fourth sign occurs every 5 years, so possible years are 5,10,15,...

But we have to wait after year 8, so the next occurrence is in year 10.

Wait for the fifth sign after year 10. The fifth sign occurs every 9 years, so possible years are 9,18,27,...

But we have to wait after year 10, so the next occurrence is in year 18.

Finally, wait for the sixth sign after year 18. The sixth sign occurs every 18 years, so possible years are 18,36,54,...

Since we are waiting after year 18, the next occurrence is in year 36.

So, the sixth sign occurs in year 36, which matches the first output in the example.

Let's check the second test case:

5

1 2 3 4 5

So, n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

First sign: occurs in year 1.

Wait for the second sign after year 1, which occurs every 2 years, so possible years are 2,4,6,...

After year 1, the next is year 2.

Wait for the third sign after year 2, which occurs every 3 years, so possible years are 3,6,9,...

After year 2, the next is year 3.

Wait for the fourth sign after year 3, which occurs every 4 years, so possible years are 4,8,12,...

After year 3, the next is year 4.

Wait for the fifth sign after year 4, which occurs every 5 years, so possible years are 5,10,15,...

After year 4, the next is year 5.

So, the fifth sign occurs in year 5, matching the second output.

Third test case:

5

1 1 1 1 1

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

First sign: year 1.

Wait for the second sign after year 1, which occurs every 1 year, so next in year 2.

Wait for the third sign after year 2, which occurs every 1 year, so next in year 3.

Wait for the fourth sign after year 3, which occurs every 1 year, so next in year 4.

Wait for the fifth sign after year 4, which occurs every 1 year, so next in year 5.

Again, matches the output.

Fourth test case:

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

First sign: year 50.

Wait for the second sign after year 50, which occurs every 30 years, so possible years are 30,60,90,...

After year 50, the next is year 60.

Wait for the third sign after year 60, which occurs every 711 years, so possible years are 711,1422,...

After year 60, the next is year 711.

Wait for the fourth sign after year 711, which occurs every 200 years, so possible years are 200,400,600,800,1000,1200,...

But 200,400,600 are before 711, so the next is 800,1000,1200,...

Wait, no, 200*4=800, which is after 711.

So, year 800.

Wait for the fifth sign after year 800, which occurs every 503 years, so possible years are 503,1006,1509,...

After year 800, the next is year 1006.

Wait for the sixth sign after year 1006, which occurs every 1006 years, so possible years are 1006,2012,3018,...

After year 1006, the next is year 2012.

So, the sixth sign occurs in year 2012, matching the fourth output.

Alright, so the problem is clear. Now, I need to implement a function that, given n and the list a of periodicities, computes the year in which the nth sign occurs, following the sequential occurrence rules.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems like there's a mismatch. The problem is about signs of the apocalypse occurring sequentially, based on their periodicities, while the provided code is about some path with '@' and '*' characters, which doesn't seem related.

Wait a minute, perhaps there's a confusion here. The problem and the code don't match. The problem is about signs occurring sequentially based on their periods, but the code is about some path with specific characters.

I think there might be a mistake in the provided code. It doesn't relate to the problem described. Maybe it's a different problem.

Given that, I need to assess whether the provided program is correct for the given problem. Since the program doesn't relate to the problem at all, it must be incorrect.

But perhaps I should consider if there's a misinterpretation here. Maybe the program is for a different problem, and I need to evaluate its correctness for that different problem.

Wait, the task is clear: determine if the given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description. Assuming valid inputs as described in the problem description.

Given that the program doesn't relate to the problem at all, I would say it's incorrect for the problem provided.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
