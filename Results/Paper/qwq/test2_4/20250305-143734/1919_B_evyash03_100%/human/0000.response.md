Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each substring, I calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the substring's characters (where "+" is 1 and "-" is -1) multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to split the string into substrings in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

First, I need to understand what the penalty represents. For a substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive; if more "-", negative. Taking the absolute value and multiplying by the length means that the penalty increases with the magnitude of the sum and the length of the substring.

I need to find a way to split the string to minimize the sum of these penalties.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Example 2:

n = 5

s = "-----"

a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty = 5

Alternatively, if I split it into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ], the sum is -5, penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25

So, splitting into individual elements gives a lower penalty.

Another way: split into [ -1, -1 ], [ -1, -1 ], [ -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2, penalty = | -2 | * 2 = 4

Second substring: sum = -2, penalty = 4

Third substring: sum = -1, penalty = 1

Total penalty = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, which is higher than 5.

So, in this case, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty.

Example 3:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split into [1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1]

First substring: sum = 1 -1 +1 -1 = 0, penalty = |0| * 4 = 0

Second substring: sum = 1 -1 = 0, penalty = |0| * 2 = 0

Total penalty = 0 + 0 = 0

Alternatively, splitting into individual elements would give penalty |1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 + |-1|*1 + |1|*1 + |-1|*1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6, which is higher.

So, in this case, splitting into substrings that sum to zero minimizes the penalty.

Another split: [1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1]

Each substring has sum 0, penalty 0, total penalty 0.

Same as the previous split.

So, seems like splitting into substrings that sum to zero is optimal when possible.

Example 4:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Let's try to split this optimally.

Option 1: Split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2 + 7 = 5, penalty = |5| * 9 = 45

Second substring: sum = -1, penalty = 1 * 1 = 1

Total penalty = 45 + 1 = 46

Option 2: Split into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2, penalty = 2 * 2 = 4

Second substring: sum = 7 -1 = 6, penalty = 6 * 8 = 48

Total penalty = 4 + 48 = 52

Option 3: Split into [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First substring: sum = -1, penalty = 1 * 1 = 1

Second substring: sum = -1 + 7 = 6, penalty = 6 * 7 = 42

Third substring: sum = -1, penalty = 1 * 1 = 1

Total penalty = 1 + 42 + 1 = 44

Option 4: Split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2 + 2 = 0, penalty = 0 * 4 = 0

Second substring: sum = 3 -1 = 2, penalty = 2 * 4 = 8

Total penalty = 0 + 8 = 8

Option 5: Split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2 + 4 = 2, penalty = 2 * 6 = 12

Second substring: sum = 1 -1 = 0, penalty = 0 * 3 = 0

Total penalty = 12 + 0 = 12

So, the minimal penalty here seems to be 8.

But according to the sample output, it's 4. Hmm, maybe I missed a better split.

Let's try splitting into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2 + 5 = 3, penalty = 3 * 7 = 21

Second substring: sum = 1 -1 = 0, penalty = 0 * 2 = 0

Total penalty = 21 + 0 = 21

Not better.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

Like option 4, which gave 8.

Is there a better way?

Let's try [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring: sum = -2 + 3 = 1, penalty = 1 * 5 = 5

Second substring: sum = 2 -1 = 1, penalty = 1 * 3 = 3

Total penalty = 5 + 3 = 8

Same as before.

Is there a way to get penalty 4?

Maybe splitting into [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ], [ 1, 1 ]

First: sum = 0, penalty 0

Second: sum = 0, penalty 0

Third: sum = 0, penalty 0

Fourth: sum = 2, penalty = 2 * 2 = 4

Total penalty = 0 + 0 + 0 + 4 = 4

Yes, that works.

So, the minimal penalty is indeed 4.

This suggests that splitting substrings that sum to zero is beneficial, and only substrings with non-zero sums contribute to the penalty.

In this case, splitting into substrings that sum to zero wherever possible, and minimizing the penalty of non-zero sum substrings.

Another way to think about it is to maximize the number of substrings with sum zero.

In the last example, by splitting into substrings that sum to zero as much as possible, and only having one substring with sum 2, which has penalty 4.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

length = int(input())

expression = input().strip()

print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

count += 1

sub = length - count

return abs(sub - count)

So, this program counts the number of '+' characters in the string, subtracts it from the length to get the number of '-' characters, and then returns the absolute difference multiplied by something.

Wait, actually, in the function, it's returning abs(sub - count), which is abs((length - count) - count) = abs(length - 2*count).

But according to the problem, the penalty is the sum of penalties for each substring, where each penalty is abs(sum of substring) * length of substring.

The program seems to be ignoring the splitting altogether and just computing something based on the total counts of '+' and '-'.

This seems incorrect because the splitting can affect the total penalty.

In the first example, with n=1 and s="+", the program would do:

count = 1

sub = 1 - 1 = 0

abs(0 - 1) = 1, which matches the sample output.

In the second example, n=5, s="-----":

count = 0

sub = 5 - 0 = 5

abs(5 - 0) = 5, which matches the sample output.

In the third example, n=6, s="+-+-+-

count = 3

sub = 6 - 3 = 3

abs(3 - 3) = 0, which matches the sample output.

Fourth example, n=10, s="--+++++++-

count = 7 (since there are seven '+')

sub = 10 - 7 = 3

abs(3 - 7) = 4, which matches the sample output.

Fifth example in the notes: n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-"

But the sample input only has n=20, and the output is 4.

Let's see:

count = number of '+', which is 10

sub = 20 - 10 = 10

abs(10 - 10) = 0, but the sample output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the note, it's n=10, s="--+++++++-", output 4.

Wait, in the input, n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", output 4.

Wait, in the input provided, it's 5 test cases:

1. n=1, s="+", output 1

2. n=5, s="-----", output 5

3. n=6, s="+-+-+-", output 0

4. n=10, s="--+++++++-", output 4

5. n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", output 4

But according to the program, for n=20, count=10, sub=10, abs(10-10)=0, but output is 4.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back:

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

count += 1

sub = length - count

return abs(sub - count)

So, it's returning abs(sub - count), where sub = length - count.

So, abs(length - 2*count).

In the first example, abs(1 - 2*1) = abs(-1) = 1

Second example, abs(5 - 0) = 5

Third example, abs(6 - 6) = 0

Fourth example, abs(10 - 14) = abs(-4) = 4

Fifth example, abs(20 - 2*10) = 0, but output is 4.

Wait, in the fourth example, s="--++++++-", count=7, length=10, abs(10 - 14)=4, which matches output 4.

Wait, in the fifth example, n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", count=12 ('+' appears 12 times), sub=20-12=8, abs(8 - 12)=4, which matches output 4.

Wait, I think I miscounted the number of '+' in the fifth example.

Let's count: "+---++++-+++++---++-"

+ - - - + + + - + + + + + - - - + + -

Looks like 12 '+' and 8 '-'

So, abs(8 - 12) = 4, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

But earlier, I thought that the program was ignoring the splitting, but somehow it's giving the correct output.

How is that possible?

Let me think differently.

Suppose I split the string into substrings where each substring has an equal number of '+' and '-', making their sum zero, and only have substrings with a non-zero sum when necessary.

In other words, splitting the string into balanced parts where possible.

In that case, the total penalty would only come from the substrings that have an imbalance, and the penalty would be the absolute sum times the length.

But in the program, it's simply returning abs(length - 2*count), which seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical insight here.

Let me consider the entire array as one substring.

In that case, the penalty would be abs(sum(a)) * length.

Sum(a) = number of '+' - number of '-' = count - (length - count) = 2*count - length

So, sum(a) = 2*count - length

Penalty = abs(2*count - length) * length

Now, if I split the array into two parts, say prefix and suffix, the total penalty would be abs(sum(prefix)) * len(prefix) + abs(sum(suffix)) * len(suffix)

Similarly, for multiple splits.

I need to find the minimal total penalty over all possible splits.

Is there a way to compute this efficiently?

Maybe dynamic programming can be used here.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimal penalty for the first i characters.

Then, for each i from 1 to n, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of dp[j] + penalty for substring s[j+1:i]

But with n=5000, this would be O(n^2), which might be too slow.

Is there a better way?

Looking back at the program, it's simply returning abs(length - 2*count), which is the penalty if the entire string is taken as one substring.

But in the examples, this seems to match the minimal penalty.

Wait, in the third example, n=6, s="+-+-+-

count=3, abs(6 - 6)=0, which matches the minimal penalty.

In the first and second examples, it also matches.

In the fourth example, n=10, s="--++++++-", count=7, abs(10 - 14)=4, which matches.

In the fifth example, n=20, count=12, abs(20 - 24)=4, which matches.

So, it seems that taking the entire string as one substring and calculating the penalty that way gives the minimal penalty.

But is this always true?

Wait, in the third example, splitting into substrings that sum to zero gives a penalty of 0, which matches the program's output.

Is there a case where splitting the string into multiple substrings can give a lower penalty than treating it as a single substring?

Wait, in the third example, splitting into substrings that sum to zero gives penalty 0, which is the same as the program's output.

Is there a case where splitting helps reduce the penalty below what the program calculates?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Consider n=4, s="+-+-"

a = [1, -1, 1, -1]

If I take it as one substring: sum=0, penalty=0*4=0

If I split into [1, -1], [1, -1]: each has sum=0, penalty=0*2 + 0*2 = 0

Same penalty.

Another split: [1], [-1, 1], [-1]

First: sum=1, penalty=1*1=1

Second: sum=0, penalty=0*2=0

Third: sum=-1, penalty=1*1=1

Total penalty=1+0+1=2, which is higher than 0.

So, in this case, splitting doesn't help reduce the penalty below what the program calculates.

Another example: n=3, s="+-+"

a = [1, -1, 1]

As one substring: sum=1, penalty=1*3=3

Split into [1, -1], [1]: penalties 0*2 + 1*1=1

Split into [1], [-1], [1]: penalties 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1=3

So, splitting into two substrings gives a lower penalty of 1, while the program would return abs(3 - 2*2)=abs(3-4)=1, which matches.

Wait, in this case, count=2, length=3, abs(3 - 4)=1, which matches the minimal penalty when split optimally.

Wait, but according to the program, it's returning 1, which matches the minimal possible penalty.

So, even in this case, it works.

How is this possible?

Wait, perhaps in all cases, the minimal penalty is equal to abs(length - 2*count).

Let me see.

From earlier:

sum(a) = 2*count - length

penalty if entire string is one substring: abs(2*count - length) * length

But in some splits, we can get lower penalties.

But in the program, it's returning abs(length - 2*count), which is different from abs(2*count - length)*length.

Wait, no, abs(length - 2*count) is the same as abs(2*count - length).

So, the program is returning abs(2*count - length), but in the third example, it's returning 0, which is abs(6 - 6)=0, matching the minimal penalty.

In the n=3, s="+-+" example, count=2, length=3, abs(3 - 4)=1, which matches the minimal penalty.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is always abs(length - 2*count), but how?

Wait, perhaps there's a mathematical justification for this.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have a string of length n, with c '+' characters and n - c '-' characters.

Sum of the entire array is s = c - (n - c) = 2c - n

Penalty if entire string is one substring: |2c - n| * n

But if I split the string into substrings where each substring has sum zero, then the total penalty would be zero.

But only if it's possible to split the string into substrings with sum zero.

If it's not possible, then there will be some substrings with non-zero sums, contributing to the penalty.

But in the program, it's returning abs(2c - n), which seems to be the minimal possible penalty.

Wait, but in the third example, abs(6 - 6)=0, which is the minimal penalty.

In the n=3, s="+-+", abs(3 - 4)=1, which matches the minimal penalty.

In the n=4, s="+-+-", abs(4 - 4)=0, which matches.

Another example: n=4, s="++--"

c=2, n=4, abs(4 - 4)=0

Indeed, splitting into [1,1,-1,-1] or [1,-1],[1,-1] gives penalty 0.

Another example: n=4, s="+++-"

c=3, n=4, abs(4 - 6)=2

Indeed, sum is 3 -1 = 2, penalty is |2| * 4 = 8 if not split.

But if split into [1,1,1],[-1], penalties |3|*3 + |-1|*1 = 3*3 + 1*1 = 9 + 1 = 10

Or split into [1,1],[-1,1], penalties |2|*2 + |0|*2 = 4 + 0 = 4

Or split into [1,1,1],[-1], penalties 3*3 + 1*1 = 10

Or split into [1],[1,1],[-1], penalties 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6

The minimal is 4, but the program returns 2.

Wait, in this case, the program returns abs(4 - 6)=2, but the minimal penalty is 4.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in this case, n=4, c=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, but the minimal penalty is 4.

So, the program would return 2, but the minimal penalty is 4.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Wait, in the fifth example, n=20, c=12, abs(20 - 24)=4, which matches output 4.

But in this n=4, c=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, but minimal penalty is 4.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in n=4, c=3, sum=2, penalty if whole string is one substring: |2|*4=8

Split into [1,1,1],[-1]: |3|*3 + |-1|*1=9+1=10

Split into [1,1],[-1,1]: |2|*2 + |0|*2=4+0=4

Split into [1],[1,1],[-1]: |1|*1 + |2|*2 + |-1|*1=1+4+1=6

So, minimal penalty is 4, but the program returns 2.

So, in this case, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Perhaps the program is incorrect for this particular case.

But according to the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Is there a way to split the string to achieve a penalty lower than abs(length - 2*count)?

In the n=4, c=3 case, program returns 2, but minimal penalty is 4.

So, program is incorrect.

But in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the mathematical formula.

Let me consider the minimal penalty.

Suppose I split the string into k substrings.

Each substring has a sum s_i, and length l_i.

The penalty is sum over i of |s_i| * l_i.

I need to minimize this sum.

Is there a way to express this minimal value in terms of total sum and length?

Wait, perhaps using dynamic programming.

Define dp[j] as the minimal penalty for the first j characters.

Then, dp[j] = min over i from 0 to j-1 of dp[i] + |sum from i+1 to j| * (j - i)

With dp[0] = 0

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow for n=5000.

Is there a better way?

Looking back, perhaps the minimal penalty is abs(total sum) + 2 * sum of absolute sums of the imbalances.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps minimal penalty is abs(total sum) * length - something.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect, and the sample outputs are just coinciding in some cases.

But in the n=4, c=3 case, it returns 2, but minimal penalty is 4.

So, it's incorrect.

But in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, in the fifth example, n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", count=12, abs(20 - 24)=4, which matches output 4.

In n=4, c=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, but minimal penalty is 4.

So, the program is incorrect.

But why does it work in the sample inputs?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of '+' in the fifth example.

Let me count again: "+---++++-+++++---++-"

+ - - - + + + - + + + + + - - - + + -

Count of '+': 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

Yes, 12 '+' and 8 '-'

Program returns abs(20 - 24)=4, which matches output 4.

In n=10, s="--+++++++-", count=7, abs(10 - 14)=4, matches output 4.

In n=6, s="+-+-+-", count=3, abs(6 - 6)=0, matches output 0.

In n=5, s="-----", count=0, abs(5 - 0)=5, matches output 5.

In n=1, s="+", count=1, abs(1 - 2)=1, matches output 1.

So, in all sample inputs, it matches.

But in my earlier counterexample, n=4, s="+++-", count=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, but minimal penalty is 4.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect, but the sample inputs don't reveal it.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the minimal penalty.

Let me recalculate for n=4, s="+++-"

Option 1: entire string as one substring: sum=2, penalty=|2|*4=8

Option 2: split into [1,1,1],[-1]: penalties 3*3 + 1*1=10

Option 3: split into [1,1],[-1,1]: 2*2 + 0*2=4

Option 4: split into [1],[1,1],[-1]: 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1=1+4+1=6

So, minimal penalty is 4, but the program returns 2.

So, the program is incorrect.

Perhaps the sample inputs don't include a case where this discrepancy occurs.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the program is calculating something else.

Looking back at the program:

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

count += 1

sub = length - count

return abs(sub - count)

So, it's returning abs(length - 2*count)

But in the n=4, c=3 case, abs(4 - 6)=2, but minimal penalty is 4.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is actually 2 * abs(length - 2*count).

Wait, in n=4, c=3, 2 * abs(4 - 6)=4, which matches the minimal penalty.

In n=6, c=3, 2 * abs(6 - 6)=0, matches.

N=5, c=0, 2 * 5=10, but sample output is 5.

Wait, no, sample output is 5, program returns 5.

Wait, abs(5 - 0)=5, but 2 * 5=10, which doesn't match.

So, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's abs(length - 2*count).

In n=4, c=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, but minimal penalty is 4, which is 2 * 2.

In n=6, c=3, abs(6 - 6)=0, minimal penalty 0.

In n=5, c=0, abs(5 - 0)=5, minimal penalty 5.

In n=10, c=7, abs(10 - 14)=4, minimal penalty 4.

In n=20, c=12, abs(20 - 24)=4, minimal penalty 4.

So, in the cases where minimal penalty is even, it's twice the program's output, in n=4, c=3.

Wait, but in n=4, c=3, program returns 2, but minimal penalty is 4.

Similarly, in n=10, c=7, program returns 4, minimal penalty is 4.

In n=20, c=12, program returns 4, minimal penalty is 4.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is abs(length - 2*count) * (something).

But in n=4, c=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, minimal penalty is 4, which is 2 * 2.

In n=6, c=3, abs(6 - 6)=0, minimal penalty 0.

In n=5, c=0, abs(5 - 0)=5, minimal penalty 5.

In n=10, c=7, abs(10 - 14)=4, minimal penalty 4.

In n=20, c=12, abs(20 - 24)=4, minimal penalty 4.

So, in n=4, c=3, it's 2 * 2=4.

In n=5, c=0, it's 5 * 1=5.

Wait, no pattern here.

Wait, perhaps it's abs(length - 2*count) * min(count, length - count).

In n=4, c=3, abs(4 - 6)=2, min(3,1)=1, 2*1=2, but minimal penalty is 4.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's abs(length - 2*count) * something else.

This seems too convoluted.

Perhaps the program is incorrect, and the sample inputs don't expose it because in those cases, abs(length - 2*count) coincides with the minimal penalty.

But in n=4, c=3, it doesn't.

So, the program is incorrect.

But in the sample inputs, it seems correct.

Maybe the problem setter made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the minimal penalty.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I have a string, and I split it into substrings where each substring has sum zero.

Then, the total penalty is zero.

But if I can't split it entirely into such substrings, I have to have some substrings with non-zero sums, contributing to the penalty.

But in the n=4, c=3 case, I can't split it into substrings with sum zero, so I have to have at least one substring with sum non-zero.

What's the minimal penalty in such cases?

In n=4, c=3, the minimal penalty is 4, which is |2| * 2 = 4, achieved by splitting into [1,1],[-1,1]

Wait, sum of first substring is 2, length 2, penalty 2*2=4

Second substring has sum 0, penalty 0

Total penalty 4.

Is there a better way?

Split into [1,1,1],[-1]: penalties 3*3 + 1*1=10

Not better.

Split into [1],[1,1],[-1]: penalties 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1=1+4+1=6

Not better.

So, minimal penalty is indeed 4.

But the program returns abs(4 - 6)=2, which doesn't match.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
