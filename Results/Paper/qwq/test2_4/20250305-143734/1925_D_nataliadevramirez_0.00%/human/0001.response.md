Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with a friendship value f_i. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she chooses a pair of children randomly and equiprobably. If the pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0 that doesn't change.

I need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship values can increase over time based on the selections.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n children, and some of them are friends with a certain friendship value. The teacher chooses pairs randomly for k excursions, and if she chooses a pair that are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all future excursions.

I need to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values at the time each pair is chosen.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's consider the total number of possible pairs. Since the pairs are chosen without any restrictions, the total number of possible pairs is C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2.

Out of these, m pairs are friends with initial friendship values f_i.

For each excursion, a pair is chosen randomly and equiprobably from all possible pairs.

If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

I need to find the expected sum of the friendship values at the time each pair is chosen, over k excursions.

Hmm.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote the friendship values as a dictionary or list, where each friend pair has an initial value f_i, and non-friend pairs have 0.

But since the friendship values can increase over time, I need to keep track of how many times each friend pair has been chosen before.

Wait, but it's tricky because the increases are cumulative.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of expected values.

Let me consider each friend pair separately and see how their friendship value contributes to the total sum over k excursions.

For each friend pair (a, b) with initial value f, the friendship value at the time of choice increases by the number of times this pair has been chosen in previous excursions.

Wait, more precisely, each time this pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

So, if a pair is chosen t times across the k excursions, their friendship value will be f + t at the time of the last choice, but for each of the t times they were chosen, their friendship value at the time of choice would be f + (number of times chosen so far).

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let me consider a friend pair (a, b) with initial value f.

I need to find the expected sum over k excursions of the friendship value of the pair chosen at each excursion.

But since the pair can be chosen multiple times, and each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices, it's getting messy.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

For each friend pair, the total contribution to the sum is the sum over all excursions where they are chosen of their friendship value at that time.

But calculating this directly seems tough.

Maybe I can think about the expected value for each excursion and sum them up.

Let me consider the first excursion.

At the first excursion, the friendship value of any friend pair is just their initial value f, because no increases have occurred yet.

For the second excursion, if the same pair is chosen again, their friendship value would be f + 1.

If a different pair is chosen, their friendship value remains f.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to think about the expected increase in friendship values over time.

Wait, maybe I can model the expected friendship value for each friend pair over the k excursions.

Let me consider that each friend pair has a certain probability of being chosen in each excursion.

The probability of choosing any specific pair is 2 / (n choose 2), but since pairs are chosen with replacement, and the choices are independent.

Wait, actually, the problem says the pairs are chosen equiprobably and independently, which means with replacement.

So, each excursion, a pair is chosen uniformly at random from all possible pairs, independently of previous choices.

Given that, I can model the process as a sequence of k independent choices, each with a certain expected contribution to the total sum.

But the friendship values can increase over time based on previous choices, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected friendship value at the time of each choice.

Let me consider that for each excursion, the expected friendship value of the chosen pair is the sum over all possible pairs of the probability of choosing that pair multiplied by their friendship value at that time.

But since the friendship values can change based on previous choices, this seems intertwined.

Maybe I need to think about linearity of expectation here.

Linearity of expectation allows me to sum the expected values of individual random variables, even if they are dependent.

So, perhaps I can define for each excursion, a random variable X_i representing the friendship value at the time of the i-th excursion, and then the total expected sum is E[X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_k] = E[X_1] + E[X_2] + ... + E[X_k].

That seems promising.

Now, I need to find E[X_i] for each i, where X_i is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the i-th excursion.

Since the choices are independent and equiprobable, E[X_i] should be the same for all i.

Wait, but the friendship values can increase over time, so E[X_i] might depend on i.

Wait, but since the increases are based on previous choices, the expectation could change over time.

Wait, but actually, because the choices are independent and equiprobable, and the increases are based on previous choices, this seems like a Markov process, where the state is the current friendship values, and each choice transitions to a new state.

But this seems too complicated to handle directly, especially given the constraints on n and m.

Perhaps there's a smarter way to compute the expected sum.

Let me think about the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Consider a specific friend pair (a, b) with initial value f.

Let’s define indicator variables for whether this pair is chosen in each excursion.

Let I_j be an indicator variable that is 1 if pair (a, b) is chosen in the j-th excursion, and 0 otherwise.

The probability that I_j = 1 is p = 2 / (n choose 2), since pairs are chosen uniformly at random.

Wait, actually, for n children, the number of unique unordered pairs is C(n, 2) = n(n-1)/2.

But in Python, if we choose pairs (a, b) where a < b, then the total number is C(n, 2).

But in the problem, it seems that pairs are ordered, because friendships are between a and b where a != b, but likely unordered.

Wait, the problem says "a pair of children", which I assume is unordered, so total pairs are C(n, 2).

Therefore, the probability of choosing a specific pair is p = 1 / C(n, 2).

Wait, but in code, it might be easier to think in terms of ordered pairs, but that would be n*(n-1), with each unordered pair appearing twice.

But I think it's clearer to think in terms of unordered pairs, so total pairs are C(n, 2).

So, p = 1 / C(n, 2).

Now, for a specific friend pair (a, b), their contribution to the total sum is the sum over all excursions where they are chosen, of their friendship value at that time.

Their friendship value at the time of the j-th choice is f + number of times they have been chosen before in previous excursions.

Wait, more precisely, each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent choices.

So, if they are chosen t times in the k excursions, their friendship values at the times of choice would be f, f+1, f+2, ..., f+(t-1).

Wait, no.

Wait, when they are chosen for the first time, their friendship value is f, and then it increases by 1 for all subsequent choices, including future choices.

Wait, but the problem says "their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions".

So, when a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Wait, but it's a bit confusing.

Let me think carefully.

At the time of choice, the friendship value is f, and after the choice, it increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, in the excursion where they are chosen, their friendship value is f, and in all future excursions, their friendship value is f+1, regardless of whether they are chosen again.

Wait, no.

Wait, the problem says: "If a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions".

So, the increase is effective from the next excursion onwards.

Therefore, at the time of choice, their friendship value is still f, and in the next excursion, it becomes f+1.

If they are chosen again in a later excursion, their friendship value at the time of that choice is f + (number of times chosen before that excursion).

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the initial friendship values and the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen across the k excursions.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, their initial contribution is f times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus 1 times the expected number of times they are chosen after the first time, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the total expected sum as the sum over all excursions of the expected friendship value at the time of choice.

Given that excursions are independent, perhaps I can find a recursive formula for the expected friendship value at each excursion.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a Markov chain, where the state is the current friendship values, and the transitions are based on which pair is chosen.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this seems infeasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the friendship values can be modeled independently, since the increases are only based on whether the pair is chosen or not.

Wait, but the increases are cumulative, so they are not entirely independent.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen, and then compute their contribution based on that.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote for each friend pair (a, b) with initial value f, and let’s define p = 1 / C(n, 2), the probability of choosing this pair in any given excursion.

Now, the number of times this pair is chosen in k excursions follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p.

But their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen, affecting future choices.

Wait, but the problem says that when a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, if a friend pair is chosen in excursion t, then for all excursions t+1, t+2, ..., k, their friendship value is increased by 1.

But at the time of choice, their friendship value is f plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected friendship value at the time of each choice.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, their expected contribution to the total sum is the sum over all excursions of the probability that they are chosen in that excursion multiplied by their expected friendship value at that time.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected friendship value at the time of choice for each friend pair, and then sum these expectations over all k excursions.

Given that the choices are independent, perhaps I can find a formula for the expected friendship value at the time of choice for a friend pair.

Let me consider a specific friend pair (a, b) with initial value f.

I need to find the expected sum over all k excursions of their friendship value at the time of choice, considering that their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions each time they are chosen.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can model the expected friendship value at the time of choice for this pair.

Let me denote E_t as the expected friendship value of this pair at the time of the t-th excursion, given that they have been chosen a certain number of times before.

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that the friendship value of a friend pair at the time of choice is f plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

So, if they have been chosen t times before the current excursion, their friendship value at the time of choice is f + t.

But since the choices are independent, the number of times they have been chosen before the current excursion follows a binomial distribution.

Wait, but because the choices are with replacement and independent, the number of times they have been chosen before the t-th excursion is binomial(t-1, p).

But this seems too involved to handle directly.

Maybe I need to think about the total expected sum over all k excursions.

Let me consider that the total sum S is the sum over all k excursions of the friendship value of the pair chosen at that excursion.

I need to find E[S] = E[sum_{t=1 to k} X_t], where X_t is the friendship value at the time of the t-th excursion.

By linearity of expectation, E[S] = sum_{t=1 to k} E[X_t].

Now, I need to find E[X_t] for each t.

But since the excursions are independent and identically distributed (except for the increases), I need to see how the friendship values evolve over time.

Wait, but the friendship values can increase based on previous choices, so they are not identically distributed.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think about the process recursively.

Let me define E_t as the expected friendship value at time t.

Then, E_t = sum over all friend pairs of their probability of being chosen at time t multiplied by their expected friendship value at that time.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected increase in friendship values over time.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, choosing a friend pair not only affects the current excursion but also all future excursions.

This seems like a cumulative effect that might be modeled using expectation.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the total expected increase in friendship values over all excursions.

Let me consider that each time a friend pair is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, if a friend pair is chosen at excursion t, their friendship value increases by 1 for excursions t+1 to k.

Additionally, at excursion t, their friendship value is f plus the number of times they have been chosen before.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Maybe I can think about the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen, and then compute their contribution based on that.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, the expected number of times they are chosen in k excursions is k * p, where p = 1 / C(n, 2).

But since their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions each time they are chosen, I need to account for this increase.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected friendship value at the time of choice for each friend pair.

Let’s consider a friend pair (a, b) with initial value f.

Let’s define E as the expected friendship value at the time of choice for this pair.

Then, E = f + sum_{t=1 to k} P(pair chosen at excursion t) * (number of times chosen before t)

But this seems too involved.

Maybe I need to think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that the total sum S is the sum over all k excursions of the friendship value of the pair chosen at that excursion.

I need to find E[S].

Now, I can think about S as the sum over all friend pairs of their initial value f multiplied by the number of times they are chosen, plus the sum over all friend pairs of the number of times they are chosen before a given excursion.

Wait, perhaps I can express S in terms of the initial values and the increases.

Let me denote for each friend pair i, let N_i be the number of times they are chosen in the k excursions.

Then, the total sum S is sum over all excursions t=1 to k of X_t, where X_t is the friendship value of the pair chosen at excursion t.

For a friend pair i, each time they are chosen, their friendship value at that time is f_i + sum over all previous excursions s < t where pair i was chosen.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled using linearity of expectation, considering the contribution of each friend pair independently.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen, and then compute their contribution based on their initial value and the expected number of times they are chosen.

Let me consider that for each friend pair i with initial value f_i, their expected contribution to S is f_i * E[N_i] + 1 * E[N_i choose 2], where N_i is the number of times they are chosen.

But I'm not sure about this.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the expected number of times each friend pair is chosen and how their friendship value increases accordingly.

Let me consider that for each friend pair i, their friendship value at the time of the j-th choice is f_i + (j - 1).

So, if they are chosen t times, their total contribution is sum_{j=1 to t} (f_i + j - 1) = t * f_i + t*(t-1)/2.

Therefore, their expected contribution is E[t * f_i + t*(t-1)/2], where t is the number of times they are chosen in k excursions.

Since t follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p = 1 / C(n, 2), I can compute E[t] and E[t*(t-1)].

Yes, this seems promising.

Let me proceed with this.

So, for each friend pair i:

Expected contribution = E[t * f_i + t*(t-1)/2] = f_i * E[t] + E[t*(t-1)/2]

We know that t follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p = 1 / C(n, 2).

Therefore, E[t] = k * p = k / C(n, 2)

Similarly, E[t*(t-1)] = Var(t) + E[t]*(E[t] - 1) = k*p*(1 - p) + k*p*(k*p - 1)

Wait, actually, for binomial distribution, E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2

But let me double-check.

Actually, for binomial distribution, E[t*(t-1)] = E[t*(t-1)] = E[t^2 - t] = E[t^2] - E[t] = Var(t) + (E[t])^2 - E[t] = k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2 - k*p = k*(k-1)*p^2

So, E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2

Therefore, E[t*(t-1)/2] = (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2

So, the expected contribution for each friend pair i is:

f_i * (k * p) + (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2

Similarly, for non-friend pairs, their friendship value is always 0, so they don't contribute to the sum.

Therefore, the total expected sum S is sum over all friend pairs i of [f_i * (k * p) + (k*(k-1)*p^2)/2]

Wait, but this seems off because the increase should be specific to each friend pair based on how many times they are chosen.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the sum over all excursions of the friendship value at the time of choice.

Let me consider that for each friend pair i, their contribution to S is sum over all excursions t where they are chosen of their friendship value at that time.

As established earlier, if they are chosen t times, their total contribution is t * f_i + t*(t-1)/2

Therefore, E[contribution of pair i] = E[t * f_i + t*(t-1)/2] = f_i * E[t] + E[t*(t-1)/2]

Which is f_i * (k / C(n, 2)) + (k*(k-1)/(C(n, 2)^2))/2

But this seems too general.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the sum over all friend pairs.

Let me denote C as C(n, 2), the total number of unique unordered pairs.

Then, p = 1 / C

So, E[t] = k * p = k / C

E[t*(t-1)] = k*(k-1)*p^2 = k*(k-1)/(C^2)

Therefore, E[t*(t-1)/2] = (k*(k-1))/(2*C^2)

Therefore, for each friend pair i, their expected contribution is:

f_i * (k / C) + (k*(k-1))/(2*C^2)

But I have m friend pairs, so the total expected sum S is:

sum over i=1 to m of [f_i * (k / C) + (k*(k-1))/(2*C^2)]

Wait, but this seems incorrect because the second term doesn't depend on the friend pair.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, actually, the increase in friendship value is specific to each friend pair based on how many times they are chosen.

So, perhaps I need to consider for each friend pair separately.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the linearity of expectation for each friend pair's contribution.

Let me consider that for each friend pair i, their expected contribution to S is sum over all excursions t of P(pair i is chosen at t) * (f_i + number of times pair i has been chosen before t).

This seems more accurate.

Let me denote t_j as the number of times pair i has been chosen before excursion t.

Then, the friendship value at time t is f_i + t_j

So, E[contribution of pair i] = sum over t=1 to k of P(pair i is chosen at t) * (f_i + E[t_j])

But t_j is the number of times pair i has been chosen before t.

Wait, this seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that for each friend pair i, their expected contribution is f_i * E[number of times chosen] + 1 * E[sum of number of times chosen before each choice]

Which would be f_i * E[t] + E[sum_{s=1 to k} (t_s - I_{s is choosing pair i})], where t_s is the number of times pair i has been chosen before s.

This seems too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled using the linearity of expectation by considering the contribution of each possible pair at each excursion.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected friendship value at each excursion and then sum them up.

Let me think about E[X_t], the expected friendship value at excursion t.

E[X_t] = sum over all friend pairs i of P(pair i is chosen at t) * (f_i + number of times pair i has been chosen before t)

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the expected increase in friendship values over time.

Let me consider that for each friend pair i, each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, choosing a friend pair not only affects the current excursion but also all future excursions.

This seems similar to a geometric series in expectation.

Wait, perhaps I can model the expected friendship value at the time of choice for each friend pair as f_i plus the expected number of times they have been chosen before.

Let me denote for friend pair i, E[t_i], the expected number of times they have been chosen before excursion t.

Then, E[X_t | pair i is chosen] = f_i + E[t_i]

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think about the problem in terms of the order of choices.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the problem recursively.

Let me consider that for each excursion, the expected sum S_t at time t depends on whether a friend pair is chosen and which one.

This seems too involved for the time constraints.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to find a closed-form formula for the expected sum S.

Let me consider that S is the sum over k excursions of the friendship value at the time of choice.

I need to find E[S] = sum over t=1 to k of E[X_t]

Now, E[X_t] = sum over all friend pairs i of P(pair i is chosen at t) * (f_i + number of times pair i has been chosen before t)

But since the choices are independent, the probability of choosing pair i at t is p = 1 / C(n, 2), and the expected number of times pair i has been chosen before t is (t-1) * p

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if the choices are independent, then the expected number of times pair i has been chosen before t is (t-1) * p

Therefore, E[X_t] = sum over i=1 to m of [p * (f_i + (t-1)*p)]

Therefore, E[S] = sum over t=1 to k of E[X_t] = sum over t=1 to k of [sum over i=1 to m of (p * (f_i + (t-1)*p))]

Simplify:

E[S] = sum_{t=1 to k} [m * p * f_bar + (t-1) * m * p^2]

Where f_bar is the average f_i.

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep it in terms of sum of f_i.

Let me denote S_f = sum of f_i for all friend pairs.

Then,

E[S] = sum_{t=1 to k} [p * (S_f + (t-1) * m * p)]

Because sum over i of f_i is S_f, and sum over i of E[t_i] is m * p * (t-1), since each pair has the same probability p.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to compute E[S] directly.

E[S] = sum over t=1 to k of E[X_t] = sum over t=1 to k of [sum over i=1 to m of P(pair i is chosen at t) * (f_i + number of times pair i has been chosen before t)]

Given that the choices are independent, P(pair i is chosen at t) = p = 1 / C(n, 2)

And E[number of times pair i has been chosen before t] = (t-1) * p

Therefore, E[X_t] = sum_{i=1 to m} [p * (f_i + (t-1)*p)]

Therefore, E[S] = sum_{t=1 to k} [p * sum_{i=1 to m} f_i + p^2 * m * (t-1)]

Let me denote C = C(n, 2), so p = 1 / C

And S_f = sum_{i=1 to m} f_i

Therefore, E[S] = sum_{t=1 to k} [ (S_f / C) + (m / C^2) * (t-1) ]

Now, sum_{t=1 to k} (t-1) = sum_{t=0 to k-1} t = (k-1)*k/2

Therefore, E[S] = k * (S_f / C) + (m / C^2) * (k*(k-1)/2)

So, E[S] = (k * S_f)/C + (m * k*(k-1))/(2 * C^2)

Now, C = C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2

Therefore, E[S] = (2 k S_f)/(n(n-1)) + (2 m k (k-1))/(n^2 (n-1)^2)

Wait, this seems messy.

But perhaps this is the way to go.

Let me confirm with the sample input.

In the second test case:

n=2, m=1, k=10

friendship: 1 2 1

So, C = C(2,2) = 1

S_f = 1

E[S] = (10 * 1)/1 + (1 * 10*9)/(2*1^2) = 10 + 45 = 55, which matches the sample output.

Good.

In the third test case:

n=3, m=1, k=2

friendship: 2 1 1

C = C(3,2) = 3

S_f = 1

E[S] = (2 * 1)/3 + (1 * 2*1)/(2*9) = 2/3 + 1/9 = 6/9 + 1/9 = 7/9, which matches the sample output of 777777784, since 7*inverse(9) mod 1e9+7 is 7*inverse(9) mod 1e9+7.

Similarly, in the first test case:

n=100, m=0, k=24

S_f = 0

E[S] = 0 + 0 = 0, matches the sample output.

So, this formula seems correct.

Therefore, the expected sum E[S] = (2 k S_f)/(n(n-1)) + (2 m k(k-1))/(n^2 (n-1)^2)

Now, I need to compute this value and output it modulo 1e9+7, as p * q^{-1} mod 1e9+7, where p/q is the reduced fraction of E[S].

So, first, I need to compute E[S] as a fraction p/q, then compute p * q^{-1} mod 1e9+7.

Given that n can be up to 1e5, m up to 1e5, and k up to 2e5, I need to handle large numbers efficiently.

Let me define MOD = 1e9+7

I need to compute E[S] as a fraction and then find p * q^{-1} mod MOD.

First, compute S_f = sum of f_i for all m friend pairs.

Then, compute E[S] = (2 k S_f)/(n(n-1)) + (2 m k(k-1))/(n^2 (n-1)^2)

I need to compute this expression as a fraction.

Let me define numerator and denominator separately.

Let me denote denom = n*n*(n-1)*(n-1)

Then, the first term is (2 k S_f * n * (n-1)) / denom

And the second term is (2 m k (k-1)) / denom

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Wait, let's see:

(2 k S_f)/(n(n-1)) = (2 k S_f * n * (n-1)) / (n^2 (n-1)^2)

And (2 m k(k-1))/(n^2 (n-1)^2) remains the same.

Therefore, E[S] = [2 k S_f * n (n-1) + 2 m k (k-1)] / (n^2 (n-1)^2)

So, numerator = 2 k S_f * n (n-1) + 2 m k (k-1)

Denominator = n^2 (n-1)^2

Then, simplify this fraction and compute p * q^{-1} mod MOD.

Now, I need to compute this efficiently, considering that n, m, k can be large, and S_f can be up to 1e5 * 1e9 = 1e14.

I need to handle large numbers carefully to avoid overflow.

In Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's fine.

But I need to compute the modular inverse efficiently.

I can use the built-in pow function for computing inverses modulo MOD.

Given that MOD is prime, I can compute q^{-1} as pow(q, MOD-2, MOD)

But first, I need to compute numerator and denominator.

But since numerator and denominator might have common factors, I should compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) and reduce the fraction before computing the inverse.

Wait, but since n can be up to 1e5, and k up to 2e5, and m up to 1e5, S_f up to 1e14, I need to handle large integers.

In Python, integer operations are efficient enough, so that should be fine.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, m, k

b. Read m lines of a_i, b_i, f_i, sum f_i to get S_f

c. Compute numerator = 2 * k * S_f * n * (n-1) + 2 * m * k * (k-1)

d. Compute denominator = n^2 * (n-1)^2

e. Compute GCD of numerator and denominator

f. Divide numerator and denominator by GCD to get p and q

g. Compute p * pow(q, MOD-2, MOD) mod MOD

h. Print the result

But to optimize, I can compute numerator and denominator modulo MOD, and then compute the inverse.

Wait, but since numerator can be very large, I need to handle it carefully.

Alternatively, I can factor out the common terms.

Wait, perhaps I can compute numerator and denominator, then find their GCD, and reduce them before computing the inverse.

But in Python, handling large integers is manageable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

But perhaps I can look for common factors to simplify the computation.

Let me see:

numerator = 2 * k * S_f * n * (n-1) + 2 * m * k * (k-1)

denominator = n^2 * (n-1)^2

I can factor out 2 * k from numerator:

numerator = 2 * k * [S_f * n * (n-1) + m * (k-1)]

denominator = n^2 * (n-1)^2

Now, I can see if there are common factors.

For example, if n or (n-1) divides [S_f * n * (n-1) + m * (k-1)], but that seems unlikely in general.

Alternatively, I can compute the GCD of numerator and denominator after computing them.

In code, I can use math.gcd to find the GCD and then reduce numerator and denominator by GCD.

Then, compute p * pow(q, MOD-2, MOD) mod MOD.

This should work.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently for t test cases, with sum of n and m over all test cases up to 1e5, and sum of k up to 2e5.

In Python, reading input efficiently is important for large inputs.

I can read all input at once and process it, to speed things up.

But given that t can be up to 5e4, and sum of m up to 1e5, I need to make sure that the code runs efficiently.

I should avoid nested loops where possible.

In this case, since for each test case, I process m friend pairs, and t is up to 5e4, with sum of m up to 1e5, it should be manageable.

I need to make sure that I read the inputs efficiently.

In code, I can read all lines at once, split them into tokens, and process them accordingly.

This is a common technique for handling multiple test cases with large inputs in Python.

Therefore, I can implement a function that reads all input, processes it, and computes the required values for each test case.

I need to be careful with the computations to avoid integer overflows, but in Python, integers can handle arbitrary sizes, so that should be fine.

Also, I need to make sure that I compute the modular inverse only when q is not zero modulo MOD, but since q is n^2 * (n-1)^2, and n >=2, q will always be non-zero modulo MOD, since MOD is 1e9+7 and n is up to 1e5.

Therefore, q will never be zero modulo MOD.

Hence, I can safely compute pow(q, MOD-2, MOD).

Therefore, the approach is correct.

So, the given program is incorrect because it doesn't implement this logic.

Wait, but the given program is not provided in the problem statement.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description."

But no program is given for me to assess.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"First explain your reasoning step by step, then reply Correctness: **True** if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False** if the given program is incorrect."

But no program is provided.

Wait, perhaps the program is in the "Program" section.

Looking back, yes, there is a "Program" section.

Let me see.

Given program:

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_2()

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):

result = 0

for i in range(m):

(a, b, f) = friendships[i]

result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD

return result % MOD

def func_2():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]

result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)

print(result)

So, the given program defines func_1 and func_2.

func_2 reads t test cases, for each test case reads n, m, k, and m friendships, then calls func_1 to compute the result and prints it.

func_1 computes the sum of f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) for each friendship, modulo MOD, and returns the sum modulo MOD.

But according to my earlier reasoning, this is incorrect.

In my earlier reasoning, the correct formula for E[S] is:

E[S] = (2 * k * S_f * n * (n - 1) + 2 * m * k * (k - 1)) / (n ** 2 * (n - 1) ** 2)

Where S_f is the sum of f_i for all m friend pairs.

But in the given program, it's computing for each friendship:

f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD

And summing them up, then taking modulo MOD.

This seems incorrect based on my earlier reasoning.

Let me check with the sample input.

Sample Input 2:

2 1 10

1 2 1

According to the sample, the output should be 55.

According to the given program:

S_f = 1

result = 1 * (10 * 11 / 2) % MOD = 1 * 55 % MOD = 55

Which matches the sample output.

But according to my earlier formula:

C = C(2,2) = 1

E[S] = (10 * 1)/1 + (1 * 10*9)/(2*1^2) = 10 + 45 = 55

So, in this case, it matches.

Wait, but according to my formula, E[S] = (2 k S_f)/(n(n-1)) + (2 m k(k-1))/(n^2 (n-1)^2)

For n=2, m=1, k=10, S_f=1

E[S] = (2*10*1)/(2*1) + (2*1*10*9)/(4*1^2) = 20/2 + 180/4 = 10 + 45 = 55

But according to the program:

result = 1 * (10*11/2) = 55

Which matches.

Wait, but in my formula, it's (2 k S_f)/(n(n-1)) + (2 m k(k-1))/(n^2 (n-1)^2)

But in the program, it's f * (k*(k+1)//2)

Wait, for n=2, m=1, k=10, S_f=1

My formula gives E[S] = (2*10*1)/(2*1) + (2*1*10*9)/(4*1^2) = 10 + 45 = 55

Program computes 1 * (10*11/2) = 55

Which matches.

But is this a general case?

Let me check for another sample.

Sample Input 3:

3 1 2

2 1 1

According to my formula:

n=3, m=1, k=2, S_f=1

C = 3

E[S] = (2*2*1)/(3*2) + (2*1*2*1)/(9*4) = 4/6 + 4/36 = 2/3 + 1/9 = 7/9

Which matches the sample output of 777777784, since 7 * inverse(9) mod 1e9+7 is 7 * 111111114 mod 1e9+7 = 777777798, but perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, 9 * 111111114 = 999999996, which is 999999996 - 1*(10^9+7) = 999999996 - 1000000007 = -11, which is equivalent to -11 + 1000000007 = 1000000007 - 11 = 999999996, which
