Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a hidden array 'a' of size 'n', and each element is either 1 or -1. From this array, we calculate prefix sums and then sort those prefix sums in non-decreasing order. We're given this sorted prefix sum array 'p', and we need to figure out how many possible initial arrays 'a' could lead to this sorted prefix sum array 'p'. The answer should be modulo 998244353.

First, I need to understand what prefix sums are. Prefix sums are cumulative sums of the array elements up to each position. So, for an array 'a' of size 'n', the prefix sum array 'p' is defined as:

p_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i

For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1], then p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1]. Then, we sort this p array to get [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1].

Now, the problem gives us this sorted p array and asks how many possible 'a' arrays could result in this sorted p array.

I need to count the number of initial arrays 'a' that, when we compute their prefix sums and sort them, match the given sorted prefix sum array 'p'.

Constraints:

- Number of test cases t ≤ 1000

- For each test case, 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 5000

- p is sorted in non-decreasing order

- Each p_i satisfies |p_i| ≤ n

Given these constraints, I need an efficient solution, possibly O(n^2) per test case, but need to be careful with time limits.

Let me think about the properties of the prefix sum array 'p'.

First, p_1 = a_1, since it's the first element.

p_2 = a_1 + a_2

...

p_n = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n

After computing these prefix sums, we sort them to get the final p array.

Given that a_i is either 1 or -1, each p_i can range from -n to n.

The problem gives us the sorted p array and asks for the number of possible 'a' arrays that could lead to this sorted p array.

I need to find the number of permutations of 'a' such that when we compute the prefix sums and sort them, we get the given p array.

Wait, but it's not just about permutations of 'a', because the order of 'a' affects the prefix sums.

But after sorting the prefix sums, the order is lost.

So, it's a bit tricky.

Let me consider that the sorted prefix sums must match the given p array.

So, the set of prefix sums must be exactly the p array, regardless of order.

But since p is sorted, I need to consider all possible orderings of p that could be the prefix sums of some 'a'.

Wait, no. The prefix sums are computed in order, but then sorted to match the given p.

So, I need to find the number of 'a' sequences where, if I compute the prefix sums and sort them, they match the given sorted p array.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think about the properties of the prefix sum array before sorting.

Let me denote the original prefix sum array before sorting as q.

So, q is defined as:

q_i = a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_i

Then, p is just q sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, p is a sorted version of q.

I need to find the number of 'a' sequences such that when q is sorted, it matches p.

This is equivalent to saying that the multiset of values in q is equal to the multiset of values in p.

Because sorting makes the order irrelevant, and we just care about the counts of each value.

So, I need to find the number of 'a' sequences where the multiset of prefix sums matches the given p.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

I can think of dp[i][s], where i is the position in the array, and s is the current prefix sum.

But wait, s can range from -n to n, which is up to 10000 values, and n can be up to 5000, which might be too slow.

Also, I need to keep track of the counts of each prefix sum.

Wait, maybe I can shift the sums by adding n, so that they are non-negative.

Let offset = n

Then, s can range from 0 to 2n.

So, dp[i][j], where j is the current prefix sum plus offset.

But again, j can be up to 2n, which is 10000, and n is 5000, so dp[5000][10000] is too big.

I need a better way.

Looking at the problem again, perhaps I can consider that the sorted prefix sums must match p, so the counts of each value in p must match the counts in q.

So, I can count the frequency of each value in p.

Then, I need to ensure that in the sequence of prefix sums q, the frequency of each value matches the frequency in p.

But q is determined by the cumulative sums of a, which is a sequence where each step is +1 or -1.

So, it's like walking on a number line, starting at 0, and at each step moving up by 1 or down by 1.

I need to count the number of such walks of length n where the multiset of positions visited matches p.

This seems similar to counting the number of paths in a 1D random walk that pass through certain points a specific number of times.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can look at the differences between consecutive prefix sums in the sorted p array.

Wait, but p is sorted, so it's not the actual order of q.

I need to think differently.

Another idea: since p is sorted, the minimal prefix sum is p[0], and the maximal is p[n-1].

In the sequence q (before sorting), the minimal prefix sum must be at least p[0], and the maximal must be at most p[n-1].

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider that in the sequence q, the minimal value is p[0], and the maximal is p[n-1].

Also, the sum of q is the sum of p, since sorting doesn't change the sum.

Wait, sum of q is sum of p.

That might be useful.

Let me calculate sum_p = sum(p)

Also, sum_q = sum(q), and sum_q = sum(p), since sorting doesn't change the sum.

Now, sum_q = sum(a_i * i), but that might not be directly useful.

Wait, no.

Actually, sum_q = sum(p)

But sum_q = sum(a_1 + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_n)

Wait, no.

sum_q = sum_{i=1 to n} q_i = sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to i} a_j = sum_{j=1 to n} (n - j + 1) * a_j

Hmm, that seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think recursively.

Let me consider dp[i][s], where i is the step (1 to n), and s is the current prefix sum.

But as I thought earlier, s can be from -n to n, which is too wide for dp.

Wait, perhaps I can use a rolling array or find a way to optimize the space.

Alternatively, maybe inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial formula can be applied here.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n=1

p=[0]

Possible a arrays:

a=[1], q=[1], sorted q=[1]

a=[-1], q=[-1], sorted q=[-1]

Neither matches p=[0], so output is 0.

Second test case:

n=1

p=[1]

Only a=[1], q=[1], sorted q=[1] matches, so output is 1.

Third test case:

n=3

p=[-1,1,2]

Possible a sequences:

Let's see:

a=[1,1,2] sorted is [1,1,2] doesn't match.

Wait, p is sorted prefix sums of a.

Wait, a is [1,1,1], q=[1,2,3], sorted [1,2,3]

a=[1,1,-1], q=[1,2,1], sorted [1,1,2] matches p.

a=[1,-1,1], q=[1,0,1], sorted [-1,0,1] doesn't match.

Wait, p=[-1,1,2], so sorted q must be [-1,0,1], but p is [-1,1,2], which doesn't match any q.

Hence, output is 0.

Fourth test case:

n=5

p=[-1,0,0,1,1]

Possible a sequences:

a=[1,-1,1,-1,-1], q=[1,0,1,0,-1], sorted [-1,0,0,1,1] matches.

a=[1,-1,-1,1,1], q=[1,0,-1,0,1], sorted [-1,0,0,1,1] matches.

a=[-1,1,1,-1,1], q=[-1,0,1,0,1], sorted [-1,0,0,1,1] matches.

So, 3 possibilities.

Fifth test case:

n=5

p=[-4,-3,-3,-2,-1]

Only a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,1], q=[-1,-2,-3,-4,-3], sorted [-4,-3,-3,-2,-1] matches.

Hence, output is 1.

From these examples, it seems that the approach needs to account for all possible sequences 'a' and check if sorting their prefix sums matches 'p'.

But brute-forcing through all 2^n possibilities is too slow for n=5000.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the number of times each prefix sum value appears in q must match the frequency in p.

So, I can count the frequency of each value in p.

Then, I need to ensure that in the sequence q, each value appears exactly the number of times it appears in p.

Given that q is determined by the cumulative sums of a, which is a random walk with steps of +1 or -1.

I need to count the number of such random walks where the multiset of positions matches p.

This seems similar to counting the number of paths in a 1D random walk that pass through specific points a specific number of times.

This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and it might involve the reflection principle or other path-counting techniques.

But I need to find a way to implement this efficiently.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to implement a dynamic programming approach.

Let's analyze the given code to see if it correctly solves the problem.

The code defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 reads the input and processes each test case by calling func_1.

So, the main logic is in func_1.

Let's look at func_1:

def func_1(n, p):

dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)

offset = n

dp[offset] = 1

for i in range(1, n + 1):

new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)

for j in range(2 * n + 1):

if dp[j] > 0:

if j + 1 <= 2 * n:

new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

if j - 1 >= 0:

new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

dp = new_dp

final_sum = p[-1] + offset

return dp[final_sum]

This seems to be implementing a dynamic programming approach where dp[j] represents the number of ways to reach a prefix sum of j - offset after i steps.

offset is set to n to shift the sums to non-negative indices since prefix sums can be negative.

In each step, we can add either +1 or -1 to the current sum.

So, dp[j] is updated by adding dp[j-1] and dp[j+1] from the previous step.

Wait, actually, in the code:

for j in range(2 * n + 1):

if dp[j] > 0:

if j + 1 <= 2 * n:

new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

if j - 1 >= 0:

new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

This means that from sum j, we can move to j+1 (by adding +1) or to j-1 (by adding -1), provided they are within bounds.

Finally, it looks at the sum that matches p[-1] (the last element of p, which is the largest since p is sorted).

But wait, in the problem, p is the sorted prefix sums, so p[-1] is the maximum prefix sum.

The code seems to be counting the number of ways to have the final prefix sum (after n steps) equal to p[-1].

But the problem requires that the entire multiset of prefix sums matches p, not just the final sum.

This seems insufficient because it only considers the final sum, ignoring the distribution of intermediate sums.

Looking back at the sample input and output, let's see if this code produces the correct results.

First test case:

n=1

p=[0]

According to the code:

dp = [0,0,0] (since n=1, 2*n+1=3)

offset =1

dp[1]=1

for i=1:

new_dp = [0,0,0]

for j=0: dp[0]=0, skip

j=1: dp[1]=1

new_dp[2] +=1

new_dp[0] +=1

so new_dp=[1,0,1]

final_sum = p[-1] +1 =0+1=1

return dp[1]=0

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Second test case:

n=1

p=[1]

final_sum=1+1=2

dp=[1,0,1], so dp[2]=1

Which matches the sample output of 1.

Third test case:

n=3

p=[-1,1,2]

final_sum=2+3=5

dp after 3 steps:

Starting from dp=[1,0,0]

i=1: new_dp=[1,1,0]

i=2: new_dp=[1,0,1]

i=3: new_dp=[1,1,0]

So dp[5]=0 (since 5>3)

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Fourth test case:

n=5

p=[-1,0,0,1,1]

final_sum=1+5=6

dp after 5 steps:

Starting from dp=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

i=1: new_dp=[1,1,0,0,0,0,0]

i=2: new_dp=[1,0,1,1,0,0,0]

i=3: new_dp=[1,1,0,0,1,1,0]

i=4: new_dp=[1,0,1,0,0,0,1]

i=5: new_dp=[1,1,0,1,1,0,0]

dp[6]=0 (since 6>5)

But sample output is 3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated dp after 5 steps.

Let's compute dp step by step for n=5.

Initialize dp=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0] (offset=5, sums from -5 to 5, indices 0 to 10)

i=1:

new_dp[j]=dp[j-1]+dp[j+1]

So:

j=0: j-1=-1 (invalid), j+1=1 -> dp[1]=0 -> new_dp[1]=0

j=1: j-1=0 -> dp[0]=1, j+1=2 -> dp[2]=0 -> new_dp[1]=0+1=1, new_dp[2]=0

j=2: j-1=1 -> dp[1]=0, j+1=3 -> dp[3]=0 -> new_dp[2]=0+0=0, new_dp[3]=0

j=3: j-1=2 -> dp[2]=0, j+1=4 -> dp[4]=0 -> new_dp[3]=0+0=0, new_dp[4]=0

j=4: j-1=3 -> dp[3]=0, j+1=5 -> dp[5]=0 -> new_dp[4]=0+0=0, new_dp[5]=0

j=5: j-1=4 -> dp[4]=0, j+1=6 -> dp[6]=0 -> new_dp[5]=0+0=0, new_dp[6]=0

j=6: j-1=5 -> dp[5]=0, j+1=7 -> invalid -> new_dp[5]+=0, new_dp[6]=0

So new_dp=[0,1,0,0,0,0,0]

Wait, that doesn't match my earlier step.

I must have made a mistake in earlier step.

Wait, in code:

for j in range(2*n+1):

if dp[j] >0:

if j +1 <=2*n:

new_dp[j+1] += dp[j]

if j -1 >=0:

new_dp[j-1] += dp[j]

So for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1] +=1 (j+1=1), j-1=-1 invalid

for j=1: dp[1]=0, skip

So new_dp=[0,1,0,0,0,0,0]

Yes, that's correct.

i=2:

dp=[0,1,0,0,0,0,0]

for j=0: dp[0]=0, skip

j=1: dp[1]=1 >0 -> new_dp[2] +=1, new_dp[0] +=1

j=2: dp[2]=0, skip

...

So new_dp=[1,0,1,0,0,0,0]

i=3:

dp=[1,0,1,0,0,0,0]

for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1] +=1, new_dp[0] +=0 (j-1=-1 invalid)

j=1: dp[1]=0, skip

j=2: dp[2]=1 >0 -> new_dp[3] +=1, new_dp[1] +=1

j=3: dp[3]=0, skip

...

new_dp=[1,1,0,1,0,0,0]

i=4:

dp=[1,1,0,1,0,0,0]

for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1] +=1, new_dp[0] +=0

j=1: dp[1]=1 >0 -> new_dp[2] +=1, new_dp[0] +=1

j=2: dp[2]=0, skip

j=3: dp[3]=1 >0 -> new_dp[4] +=1, new_dp[2] +=1

j=4: dp[4]=0, skip

j=5: dp[5]=0, skip

j=6: dp[6]=0, skip

So new_dp=[1,1+1=2,0+1=1,1,0,0,0]

Wait, but according to earlier, it should be [1,0,1,0,0,0,0] at i=2, but I think I messed up the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I need to correct my calculations.

Let me recompute dp for n=5 properly.

Initialize dp=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] (offset=5, sums from -5 to 5, indices 0 to 10)

i=1:

for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1]=1, new_dp[0-1 invalid]

new_dp=[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

i=2:

for j=0: dp[0]=0, skip

j=1: dp[1]=1 >0 -> new_dp[2]=1, new_dp[0]=1

new_dp=[1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

i=3:

for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1]=1, new_dp[0-1 invalid]

j=1: dp[1]=0, skip

j=2: dp[2]=1 >0 -> new_dp[3]=1, new_dp[1]=1

new_dp=[0,1+0=1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

Wait, no, in the code, it's new_dp[j+1] and new_dp[j-1], not new_dp[j-1] and new_dp[j+1].

Wait, in the code:

for j in range(2*n+1):

if dp[j] >0:

if j +1 <=2*n:

new_dp[j+1] += dp[j]

if j -1 >=0:

new_dp[j-1] += dp[j]

So, for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1] +=1, new_dp[0-1 invalid]

for j=1: dp[1]=0, skip

for j=2: dp[2]=1 >0 -> new_dp[3] +=1, new_dp[1] +=1

So new_dp=[0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

i=4:

dp=[0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]

for j=0: dp[0]=0, skip

j=1: dp[1]=1 >0 -> new_dp[2]=1, new_dp[0]=1

j=2: dp[2]=0, skip

j=3: dp[3]=1 >0 -> new_dp[4]=1, new_dp[2]=1

j=4: dp[4]=0, skip

...

new_dp=[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

i=5:

dp=[1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]

for j=0: dp[0]=1 >0 -> new_dp[1]=1, new_dp[0-1 invalid]

j=1: dp[1]=0, skip

j=2: dp[2]=1 >0 -> new_dp[3]=1, new_dp[1]=1

j=3: dp[3]=0, skip

j=4: dp[4]=1 >0 -> new_dp[5]=1, new_dp[3]=1

j=5: dp[5]=0, skip

...

new_dp=[0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]

So dp after 5 steps is [0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]

final_sum = p[-1] + offset =1 +5=6

dp[6]=0

But according to the sample, it should be 3.

So, this suggests that the code is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample, for n=5 and p=[-1,0,0,1,1], the code would return dp[6], which is 0, but the sample output is 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect for this test case.

So, the code seems to be trying to count the number of ways the final prefix sum equals p[-1], but that's not sufficient for the problem, which requires matching the entire multiset of prefix sums.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But according to the first part, it matches some test cases, but fails on others.

Wait, in the first test case, it correctly outputs 0, and in the second test case, it correctly outputs 1, but in the fourth test case, it outputs 0 instead of 3.

Hence, it's not a correct solution.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
