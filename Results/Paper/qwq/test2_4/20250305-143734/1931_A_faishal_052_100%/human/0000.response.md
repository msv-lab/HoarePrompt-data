Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Nikita had a 3-letter word consisting of lowercase Latin letters. He encoded this word by summing up the positions of each letter in the alphabet. For example, "cat" is encoded as 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. But this encoding is ambiguous because different words can have the same sum, like "ava" also sums to 24.

My task is to determine the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could correspond to a given encoded sum.

First, I need to understand what "lexicographically smallest" means. It means that among all possible words that could sum to the given number, I need to find the one that would come first in a dictionary. For example, "aav" comes before "ava" because 'a' is smaller than 'v' in the alphabet.

So, for each test case, I'm given an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78), which is the sum of the positions of the three letters. I need to output the smallest possible 3-letter word that sums to n.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26. I need to find three such numbers that add up to n, and among all possible combinations, choose the one that is lexicographically smallest.

To get the smallest lexicographical order, I should minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

So, I should try to assign the smallest possible value to the first letter, then to the second, and finally whatever is left to the third letter.

Let's formalize this.

Let the three letters be a, b, c, where each is between 1 and 26.

I need a + b + c = n.

And I need to minimize the word in lex order, which means minimizing a first, then b, then c.

So, I should set a as small as possible, then b as small as possible, given a, and then c is determined.

Wait, c is determined by a and b, since c = n - a - b.

But I have to make sure that c is between 1 and 26.

So, I need to find the smallest possible a, then the smallest possible b given a, and then c is n - a - b, and it should be between 1 and 26.

This seems correct.

Let me try an example.

Take n = 24.

I need to find a, b, c such that a + b + c = 24, with a, b, c between 1 and 26, and the word is lex smallest.

So, start with a = 1 (smallest possible).

Then, b should be as small as possible, so b = 1.

Then, c = 24 - 1 - 1 = 22, which is 'v'.

So, the word is 'aav'.

Let me check if there's any other combination that is smaller.

If I try a = 1, b = 2, then c = 21, which is 'u', so 'auu'.

Is 'auu' smaller than 'aav'? 'aav' is smaller because 'v' comes before 'u' in the alphabet.

Wait, no. 'u' is before 'v'. So 'auu' would be smaller than 'aav'.

Wait, but according to the example in the problem, for n=24, the output is 'aav'.

Is there a mistake here?

Wait, let's see: a=1, b=1, c=22 → 'aav'

a=1, b=2, c=21 → 'auu'

Which one is smaller? 'a' is equal, 'a' vs 'u': 'a' is smaller than 'u', so 'aaa' would be smaller than 'auu', but 'aav' comes before 'auu' because 'a' is smaller than 'u' in the second position.

Wait, no. In 'aav', the second letter is 'a', and in 'auu', the second letter is 'u'. Since 'a' comes before 'u', 'aav' is smaller than 'auu'.

Wait, but in the example, 'aav' is given as the answer, so maybe 'aav' is indeed the smallest.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, 'auu' should be smaller than 'aav' because 'a' is smaller than 'v' in the third position, but actually, the second position is 'a' vs 'u', and 'a' is smaller.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let's compare 'aav' and 'auu':

- First letter: 'a' vs 'a' → equal

- Second letter: 'a' vs 'u' → 'a' is smaller

- Third letter: 'v' vs 'u' → 'u' is smaller

But since the second letter is 'a' in 'aav' and 'u' in 'auu', and 'a' is smaller than 'u', 'aav' is smaller than 'auu'.

Therefore, 'aav' is indeed smaller than 'auu'.

So, 'aav' is the smallest possible word for n=24.

Another example: n=3.

The smallest possible word should be 'aaa', since 1+1+1=3.

Another example: n=78.

That's the maximum sum, which is 26+26+26=78, corresponding to 'zzz'.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

The program is:

def func():

cases = int(input())

info = []

for i in range(cases):

arr = []

lex = int(input())

for j in range(2):

if lex < 28:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex - 1

elif lex < 52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

elif lex <= 78:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex - 26

arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

info.append(arr)

for i in range(cases):

temp = ''

for j in range(3):

temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)

print(temp)

Let's analyze this.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n (lex).

Then, it has a loop for j in range(2), meaning it processes the first two letters.

Inside this loop, it checks if lex < 28:

- If so, it sets the letter to 1 ( 'a' ) and subtracts 1 from lex.

- If lex is between 28 and 52, it sets the letter to 26 ( 'z' ) and subtracts 26 from lex.

- If lex is up to 78, it also sets the letter to 26 and subtracts 26.

After this loop, it sets the third letter to whatever is left (lex).

Then, it sorts the three letters in ascending order and constructs the word.

Wait a minute. This approach seems flawed.

The problem is that sorting the letters will not necessarily give the lex smallest word.

Wait, but in the example, for n=24, it should output 'aav'.

Let's see what this program would do for n=24.

First iteration (j=0):

lex = 24

Since 24 < 28, set arr[0] = 1, lex = 24 -1 = 23

Second iteration (j=1):

lex = 23

23 < 28, set arr[1] =1, lex =23-1=22

Then, arr.append(22), so arr = [1,1,22]

Sort arr: [1,1,22], which corresponds to 'aav'

Which matches the example.

Another example, n=3:

First iteration: lex=3 <28, arr=[1], lex=2

Second iteration: lex=2 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=1

Then arr.append(1), arr=[1,1,1], sorted is [1,1,1], which is 'aaa'

Correct.

Another example, n=78:

First iteration: lex=78 >52, arr=[26], lex=78-26=52

Second iteration: lex=52 >52, arr=[26,26], lex=52-26=26

Then arr.append(26), arr=[26,26,26], sorted is [26,26,26], which is 'zzz'

Correct.

Another example, n=25:

First iteration: lex=25 <28, arr=[1], lex=24

Second iteration: lex=24 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=23

Then arr.append(23), arr=[1,1,23], sorted [1,1,23], which is 'aac'

But wait, 1+1+23=25, which is correct.

But is 'aac' the smallest possible?

Let's see: 'aab' is 1+1+2=3, which is less than 25, so 'aac' is correct.

Wait, 'aab' sums to 4, not 25. Wait, 1+1+2=4, which is less than 25.

So, 'aac' is correct.

Wait, 1+1+23=25, yes.

But is there a smaller word than 'aac' that sums to 25?

Let's see: 'aab' sums to 4, which is less than 25.

'aaa' sums to 3.

'aad' sums to 1+1+4=6.

Wait, nothing smaller than 'aac' sums to 25.

So, 'aac' is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it outputs [1,1,23], which is 'aac'

But according to my initial logic, I thought I should minimize the first letter, then the second, then the third.

But in this approach, it seems to be working correctly for these examples.

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I thought that sorting the letters would not give the lex smallest word, but in these examples, it seems to work.

Let me think of a case where sorting might fail.

Suppose n=5.

According to the program:

First iteration: lex=5 <28, arr=[1], lex=4

Second iteration: lex=4 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=3

Then arr.append(3), arr=[1,1,3], sorted is [1,1,3], which is 'aab'

But is 'aab' the smallest for n=5?

Let's see: 'aab' is 1+1+2=4, which is less than 5.

Wait, no: 1+1+3=5, which is correct.

Is there a smaller word than 'aab' that sums to 5?

Well, 'aaa' sums to 3, which is less than 5.

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 6.

Wait, so 'aab' sums to 4, which is less than 5, so it's not correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it outputs 'aab' for n=5, but that sums to 4, not 5.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, n=5 cannot be achieved with 'aab' which sums to 4.

So, what should it be?

It should be 'aae', since 1+1+5=7, which is greater than 5.

Wait, but no, 'aad' is 1+1+4=6, still greater than 5.

Wait, so is there any 3-letter word that sums to 5?

Wait, 1+1+3=5, which is 'aac'

Wait, 'aac' sums to 1+1+3=5.

So, 'aac' is a possible word.

But according to the program, it would output 'aab', which sums to 4, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, let's recalculate.

Wait, 'aab' is 1+1+2=4

'aac' is 1+1+3=5

So, for n=5, the program would output 'aab', which sums to 4, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Let's see:

for j in range(2):

if lex < 28:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex -1

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

elif lex <=78:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

Then, arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

So, for n=5:

First iteration: lex=5 <28, arr=[1], lex=4

Second iteration: lex=4 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=3

Then, arr.append(3), arr=[1,1,3], sorted [1,1,3], which is 'aac'

Which sums to 5, correct.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I thought arr.append(lex), which is 3, but actually, in the program, it's arr.append(lex), which is 3.

So, 'aac' is correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, for n=5, it outputs 'aac', which is correct.

Another test: n=6

First iteration: lex=6 <28, arr=[1], lex=5

Second iteration: lex=5 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=4

arr.append(4), arr=[1,1,4], sorted [1,1,4], which is 'aad'

Which sums to 1+1+4=6, correct.

Is there a smaller word than 'aad' that sums to 6?

'aab' sums to 4, which is less than 6.

'aac' sums to 5.

'aad' sums to 6.

So, 'aad' is correct.

Another test: n=7

First iteration: lex=7 <28, arr=[1], lex=6

Second iteration: lex=6 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=5

arr.append(5), arr=[1,1,5], sorted [1,1,5], which is 'aae'

Which sums to 1+1+5=7, correct.

Is there a smaller word than 'aae' that sums to 7?

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 5.

'aad' sums to 6.

'aae' sums to 7.

So, 'aae' is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=7, it should output 'aae'

But is there a word like 'abD' that sums to 7 and is smaller than 'aae'?

Wait, 'abD' is 'abD', which is 1+2+4=7.

But in lex order, 'aab' is smaller than 'aae'.

Wait, 'aab' sums to 4, which is less than 7.

So, 'aab' is not a candidate.

'aaa' sums to 3.

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 5.

'aad' sums to 6.

'aae' sums to 7.

So, 'aae' is the smallest word that sums to 7.

Hence, the program seems correct for n=7.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=7, it would output 'aae', which is correct.

Another test: n=26

First iteration: lex=26 <28, arr=[1], lex=25

Second iteration: lex=25 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=24

arr.append(24), arr=[1,1,24], sorted [1,1,24], which is 'axx'

Wait, 24 corresponds to 'x'

But 'axx' sums to 1+24+24=49, which is greater than 26.

Wait, no, arr=[1,1,24], sum is 26, which is correct.

Is there a smaller word than 'axx' that sums to 26?

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 5.

...

'axx' seems correct.

Wait, but 'abz' is 1+2+26=29, which is greater than 26.

'axy' is 1+24+25=50, which is greater than 26.

So, 'axx' is correct.

Wait, but is 'abz' smaller than 'axx'?

'abz' would be 'abz', which is 1,2,26.

In lex order, 'a' 'b' 'z' vs 'a' 'x' 'x'.

Comparing 'a' vs 'a', equal.

Then 'b' vs 'x', 'b' is smaller than 'x', so 'abz' would be smaller than 'axx'.

But 'abz' sums to 1+2+26=29, which is greater than 26.

So, it's invalid.

Hence, 'axx' is the smallest valid word that sums to 26.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Wait, but according to the program, for n=26, it outputs 'axx'

Which is correct.

Another test: n=78

As before, it outputs 'zzz', which is correct.

n=3: 'aaa', correct.

n=24: 'aav', correct.

n=5: 'aac', correct.

n=6: 'aad', correct.

n=7: 'aae', correct.

n=26: 'axx', correct.

Seems consistent.

But let's see how the program works.

It seems to always set the first two letters to the smallest possible value (1,1), and then set the third letter to the remaining sum minus 2.

Then, it sorts them in ascending order.

Wait, but in the case of n=26, it sets a=1, b=1, c=24, and sorts them to [1,1,24], which is 'axx'

But is there a way to get a smaller word?

Wait, 'abx' would be 1,2,24, summing to 27, which is greater than 26.

So, 'axx' is indeed the smallest possible.

Another test: n=25

First iteration: lex=25 <28, arr=[1], lex=24

Second iteration: lex=24 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=23

arr.append(23), arr=[1,1,23], sorted [1,1,23], which is 'aac'

Which sums to 1+1+23=25, correct.

Is there a smaller word than 'aac' that sums to 25?

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 5.

...

No, 'aac' is correct.

Another test: n=27

First iteration: lex=27 <28, arr=[1], lex=26

Second iteration: lex=26 <28, arr=[1,1], lex=25

arr.append(25), arr=[1,1,25], sorted [1,1,25], which is 'aaz'

Which sums to 1+1+26=28, but wait, 25 corresponds to 'y'

Wait, no, 25 is 'y', so 'aay', which sums to 1+1+25=27, correct.

Is there a smaller word than 'aay' that sums to 27?

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 5.

...

'aay' is correct.

Hence, the program seems to be working correctly for these test cases.

But I need to understand why this approach works.

The approach is:

- Set the first two letters to the smallest possible value (1), and set the third letter to n - 2.

- Then sort the three letters in ascending order.

This seems to produce the lex smallest word.

But is this always the case?

Let me think about it.

By setting the first two letters to 1 and the third to n-2, and then sorting them, it ensures that the smallest possible letters are used first, and the larger letters are placed towards the end.

By sorting them in ascending order, it makes sure that the lex order is minimized.

Because in lex order, smaller letters come first.

So, by having the smallest letters as early as possible in the word, we achieve the smallest lex order.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

But let me think of a case where this might fail.

Suppose n=50.

First iteration: lex=50 >28, so arr=[26], lex=50-26=24

Second iteration: lex=24 <28, arr=[26,1], lex=24-1=23

arr.append(23), arr=[26,1,23], sorted [1,23,26], which is 'aco'

Which sums to 1+23+26=50.

Is there a smaller word than 'aco' that sums to 50?

'aab' sums to 4.

'aac' sums to 5.

...

'aco' seems correct.

But is 'abz' smaller?

'abz' is 1,2,26=29, which is less than 50, but not relevant.

'acz' is 1,3,26=30.

...

'aco' seems correct.

Another test: n=77

First iteration: lex=77 >52, arr=[26], lex=77-26=51

Second iteration: lex=51 >28, arr=[26,26], lex=51-26=25

arr.append(25), arr=[26,26,25], sorted [25,26,26], which is 'ayz'

Which sums to 25+26+26=77.

Is there a smaller word than 'ayz' that sums to 77?

'abz' is 1+2+26=29.

'acz' is 1+3+26=30.

...

'ayz' seems correct.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

But let's look back at the program's condition:

for j in range(2):

if lex < 28:

arr.append(1)

lex = lex -1

elif lex <52:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

elif lex <=78:

arr.append(26)

lex = lex -26

Then, arr.append(lex)

arr.sort()

I'm not entirely sure why it's checking lex <28, elif lex<52, etc.

In my earlier analysis, I just set the first two letters to 1 and the third to n-2, then sort them.

But in the program, it's conditionally appending 1 or 26 based on the value of lex.

But in practice, it seems to work correctly for various test cases.

Perhaps the conditions are there to handle different ranges of n.

For example, when lex <28, it sets a letter to 1.

When 28 <= lex <52, it sets a letter to 26.

And when lex >=52, it also sets a letter to 26.

But in my earlier analysis, I didn't need these conditions; simply setting the first two letters to 1 and the third to n-2, then sorting, seems to work.

Perhaps the conditions in the program are optimizations or handle edge cases that I haven't considered.

But since the program seems to work correctly for the test cases I tried, I'll assume that it's correct.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
