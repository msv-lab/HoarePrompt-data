Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Yarik is getting a birthday array from Mark, and Yarik loves bitwise operations, especially XOR and OR. Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that he can split the array into k segments where certain conditions are met, and the result of combining these segments' XOR values with OR operations is less than or equal to x. If it's not possible, he should output -1.

First, I need to understand the conditions for these segments:

1. The first segment must start at index 1.

2. The last segment must end at index n.

3. Each segment's start should be less than or equal to its end.

4. The segments should be consecutive, meaning the next segment starts right after the previous one ends.

5. The bitwise OR of the XORs of each segment should be less than or equal to x.

Okay, so it's about splitting the array into consecutive segments and ensuring that the OR of their XOR values meets the condition.

I need to maximize the number of such segments.

Let me think about how XOR and OR work here.

XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and XOR of a subarray can be computed efficiently using prefix XORs.

OR is also associative and commutative, but it's a bit different from XOR.

So, perhaps I can precompute prefix XORs and then try to find segments where the OR of their XOR values is <= x.

But maximizing k means I want as many segments as possible, while ensuring the OR condition holds.

I should consider that OR is a monotonic operation in a way that adding more bits can only keep the value the same or increase it.

Wait, actually, OR can only increase or stay the same when you add more terms because it's a bitwise OR.

So, if I have segments with their XOR values, and I OR them together, the result can only get larger or stay the same as I add more segments.

But in this problem, I need the OR to be <= x.

So, if I have too many segments, the OR might become larger than x, which is bad.

But I need to maximize k, so I need to find the largest k such that the OR of the XORs of k segments is <= x.

Wait, but the segments have to cover the entire array from 1 to n, and be non-overlapping, consecutive.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first example from the input:

3 1

1 2 3

So, n=3, x=1, array [1,2,3]

Possible segments:

- [1,1]: XOR is 1

- [2,2]: XOR is 2

- [3,3]: XOR is 3

- [1,2]: XOR is 1 XOR 2 = 3

- [2,3]: XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1

- [1,3]: XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

Now, we need to select k segments that are consecutive and cover the whole array, with the OR of their XORs <= x=1.

Looking at the explanation, k=2 with segments [1,1] and [2,3], whose XORs are 1 and 1, and 1 | 1 = 1 <=1.

Another way, if k=1, segment [1,3], XOR=0, 0 <=1.

But we need to maximize k, so k=2 is better than k=1.

So, in this case, k=2 is possible.

But is k=3 possible? Let's check:

Segments [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], XORs are 1,2,3, and 1 | 2 | 3 = 3 >1, which violates the condition.

So, k=2 is the maximum possible.

Got it.

Another example:

2 2

1 1

Possible segments:

- [1,1]: XOR=1

- [2,2]: XOR=1

- [1,2]: XOR=1 XOR 1 =0

So, k=2 with segments [1,1] and [2,2], OR=1 |1=1 <=2, which is acceptable.

So, k=2 is possible.

k=1 is also possible with [1,2], XOR=0, which is <=2.

But k=2 is larger.

So, output is 2.

Another example:

2 2

1 3

Possible segments:

- [1,1]: XOR=1

- [2,2]: XOR=3

- [1,2]: XOR=1 XOR 3 =2

So, k=2: 1 | 3 =3 >2, not acceptable.

k=1: [1,2], XOR=2 <=2, acceptable.

So, maximum k=1.

Got it.

Now, I need to find a general way to compute this for any given n, x, and array a.

Constraints are:

- t <=10^4 test cases

- sum of n across all test cases <=10^5

So, per test case, n can be up to 10^5, but since t is up to 10^4, and sum of n across all test cases is 10^5, it's manageable.

I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or O(n log n) at worst.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and OR here.

First, XOR is associative and commutative, so the XOR of a subarray can be computed using prefix XORs.

Let me define prefix_xor[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, XOR from l to r is prefix_xor[r] XOR prefix_xor[l-1]

Now, OR is a bitwise OR, which means for each bit position, if any of the operands has that bit set, the result has that bit set.

So, if I have k segments, their XORs are computed, and then ORed together.

I need the OR of these k XORs to be <= x.

I need to maximize k.

First, I need to understand how the OR operation affects the bits.

Let me consider the bits one by one.

Because OR is a bitwise operation, the bits are independent in a way.

Wait, but XOR affects the bits based on the number of 1s in each bit position.

So, for each bit position, the XOR of a subarray is 1 if there's an odd number of 1s, and 0 otherwise.

Then, ORing multiple such XORs will set a bit if any of the XORs has that bit set.

So, for the overall OR to be <= x, for each bit position, if x has that bit set to 0, then none of the XORs can have that bit set to 1.

That is, for bits where x has 0, all XORs must have 0 in that bit position.

For bits where x has 1, the XORs can have either 0 or 1 in that bit position.

So, to satisfy the condition, for each bit where x has 0, all k XORs must have 0 in that bit position.

For bits where x has 1, at least one of the k XORs can have 1 in that bit position.

Wait, no. OR is 1 if any of the operands has 1 in that bit.

So, for the OR of k XORs to have a 0 in a particular bit, all k XORs must have 0 in that bit.

If x has 0 in a bit, then the OR of the k XORs must have 0 in that bit, which means all k XORs must have 0 in that bit.

For bits where x has 1, the OR can have either 0 or 1, but to satisfy OR <=x, for each bit, if x has 0, OR must have 0; if x has 1, OR can have 0 or 1.

But to maximize k, I need to make sure that the OR of the k XORs is <=x.

So, for bits where x has 0, all k XORs must have 0 in that bit.

For bits where x has 1, at least one of the k XORs must have 1 in that bit, but to maximize k, I need to see how I can split the array to have as many segments as possible while respecting the OR constraint.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can iterate over the bits from the most significant to the least significant and make decisions based on whether the bit in x is set or not.

So, starting from the highest bit, if x has that bit set to 0, then all segments must have that bit as 0 in their XOR.

If x has that bit set to 1, then at least one segment must have that bit as 1 in its XOR.

I need to maximize k, so I want as many segments as possible.

So, for bits where x has 0, I need to ensure that in all segments, that bit is 0 in their XOR.

For bits where x has 1, I need at least one segment to have that bit as 1 in its XOR.

But I need to maximize k, so I need to see how I can split the array into as many segments as possible while respecting these constraints.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can process the bits in order and try to merge segments when necessary.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider dynamic programming.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the maximum k for the subarray from 1 to i.

Then, dp[i] = max over j from 1 to i of dp[j-1] + 1, where the OR of XORs from 1 to j-1 and j to i satisfies the condition.

But this seems too slow for n=1e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the OR operation is monotonic in a way.

If I have segments covering the whole array, and I merge some segments, the OR can only decrease or stay the same.

Wait, actually, if I merge segments, their XORs are XORed together, and then ORed.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I have segments [1,r1], [r1+1,r2], ..., [rk-1+1,n], and their XORs are XORed if I merge them.

But actually, if I merge two segments, their combined XOR is the XOR of their individual XORs.

Then, if I OR that with the next segment's XOR, it's equivalent to ORing all individual XORs.

Wait, no, OR is not associative with XOR.

Wait, no, OR is not directly related to XOR in that way.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the OR of k XORs is equivalent to the bitwise OR of each segment's XOR.

So, if I have k segments, each with their own XOR, and I OR those k XORs together, that's the value that needs to be <=x.

I need to maximize k, given that constraint.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can consider the bits independently.

For each bit position, consider whether it's allowed to be 1 in the OR.

If x has that bit set to 1, then at least one segment can have that bit set to 1.

If x has that bit set to 0, then no segment can have that bit set to 1.

So, perhaps I can process the bits from high to low, and try to satisfy the constraints for each bit.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

In the reference solution, there's a function func_5() that seems to handle the logic.

Let's see what it's doing.

It reads n and x, then reads the array a.

Then it initializes t as an empty list and ans as -1.

Then it loops over bits from 29 to 0 (assuming 30-bit integers).

For each bit i:

- u = (x >> i) & 1 : checks if bit i in x is set.

- v = sum of (val >> i & 1 for val in a) : counts the number of elements in a with bit i set.

Then, it has several cases based on u and v.

Case 1: u == 0 and v == 0:

- continue to the next bit.

Case 2: u == 0 and v != 0:

- if v % 2 == 1:

- return ans (which is -1)

- else:

- compute op and ai:

- op is the XOR of bits i of elements in a, accumulated.

- ai is the accumulated XOR of elements.

- whenever op == 0, append ai to t and reset ai.

- then set a = t and t = []

Case 3: u == 1 and v % 2 == 1:

- continue to the next bit.

Case 4: u == 1 and v % 2 == 0:

- if v != 0:

- compute op and count the number of times op == 0.

- ans = max(ans, cnt)

Case 5: after all bits, return max(ans, len(a))

This seems complicated, but let's try to understand it.

It's processing bits from high to low.

For bits where x has 0:

- if the sum of that bit in the array is odd (v % 2 ==1), it's impossible, so return -1.

- else, it splits the array into segments where the XOR of each segment for this bit is 0.

- It does this by accumulating XORs and splitting when op ==0.

- Then, it sets a to these new segments and continues.

For bits where x has 1:

- if the sum of that bit in the array is odd, it's fine, continue.

- if sum is even, but v !=0, it tries to find the maximum number of segments where the XOR for this bit is 0, which would allow the OR to still be <=x.

Finally, it returns the maximum of ans and len(a).

This seems to be a way to maximize k by considering bits from high to low and adjusting the segments accordingly.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's see with the first example:

n=3, x=1, a=[1,2,3]

Binary:

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

x=1: 001

Process bit 29 to 0.

x bit 0: 1

x bit 1: 0

x bit 2: 0

Wait, x=1 is 001 in binary.

sum of bit 0 in a: 1 + 0 + 1 = 2 (%2=0)

sum of bit 1 in a: 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 (%2=0)

sum of bit 2 in a: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 (%2=0)

So, starting from bit 29 to bit 0.

But in this case, x=1, so only bit 0 is set.

So, for bit 2 (i=2), x bit 2 is 0, v=0, so continue.

bit 1 (i=1), x bit 1 is 0, v=2 %2=0, so continue.

bit 0 (i=0), x bit 0 is 1, v=2 %2=0, so u=1, v%2=0, v!=0, so compute op and cnt.

op is XOR of bit 0:

1 -> 1

2 -> 0

3 -> 1

So, op sequence: 1,1^0=1,1^1=0

cnt is number of times op==0, which is 1.

So, ans = max(-1,1) =1

Then, after all bits, return max(1, len(a)=3)=3

But in the example, the answer is 2.

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the reference solution, for u==1 and v%2==0 and v!=0, it computes cnt and sets ans=max(ans,cnt)

But in this case, bit 0: u=1, v=2 %2=0, v!=0, so cnt=1 (since op==0 once)

Then, ans=1

But in the example, k=2 is possible.

So, perhaps this logic is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after processing all bits, the final answer is the maximum of ans and len(a), which is max(1,3)=3, but in the example, it's 2.

So, maybe this logic is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

Wait, in the reference solution, it seems that for u==0 and v%2==1, it returns -1, which makes sense because if x has a bit 0, but the total XOR for that bit is 1, which cannot be achieved with any number of segments.

In the first example, for bit 1 and bit 2, x has 0, and v is even, so it's fine.

For bit 0, x has 1, and v is even, so it computes cnt=1, ans=1

Then, it returns max(1,3)=3, but the correct answer is 2.

So, perhaps this logic is flawed.

Wait, maybe I need to understand the splitting process better.

In the reference solution, for u==0 and v%2==0, it splits the array into segments where each segment's XOR for that bit is 0.

It does this by accumulating XORs and splitting when op==0.

Then, it sets a to these new segments and continues to the next bit.

In the first example, for bit 1 and bit 2, x has 0, and v is even, so it splits the array accordingly.

Wait, for bit 1:

x bit 1 is 0, v=2 (%2=0), so it splits the array where op==0 for bit 1.

Computing op for bit 1:

1: 0

2: 0^1=1

3: 1^1=0

So, op==0 at positions 1 and 3.

So, it splits into segments [1,1] and [2,3], since op==0 at these points.

Then, a becomes [ai for op==0], which are the XORs of [1,1] and [2,3], which are 1 and 1.

Then, it continues to the next bit.

For bit 0:

x bit 0 is 1, v=2 (%2=0), u=1, v%2=0, v!=0, so compute cnt.

Compute op for bit 0:

1:1

2:1^0=1

3:1^1=0

So, op==0 at position 3, cnt=1

ans=max(-1,1)=1

Then, return max(1, len(a)=2)=2

Wait, in the first iteration, len(a)=2, so max(1,2)=2, which matches the example.

So, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Yes, after splitting into [1,1] and [2,3], a becomes [1,1], then for bit 0, cnt=1, ans=1, and len(a)=2, so max(1,2)=2.

Got it.

So, the logic seems correct in this case.

Another example:

2 2

1 1

x=2 (10 in binary)

Bits:

bit 1: x=1, v=0 (since both 1 and 1 have bit 1 as 0), so u=1, v%2=0, v=0, so continue.

bit 0: x=0, v=2 (%2=0), so u=0, v%2=0, so continue.

Then, ans=-1, len(a)=2, so max(-1,2)=2, which matches the example.

Another example:

2 2

1 3

x=2 (10 in binary)

Bits:

bit 1: x=1, v=2 (%2=0), u=1, v%2=0, v!=0, cnt=1 (op sequence:1:0,2:0^1=1,3:1^1=0), so cnt=1, ans=1

Then, len(a)=2, max(1,2)=2, but in the explanation, k=1 is the answer.

Wait, in the explanation, k=1 is the answer for this case, but according to this, it returns 2.

Hmm, there might be an issue here.

Wait, in the reference solution, it seems that when u==1 and v%2==0 and v!=0, it computes cnt and sets ans=max(ans,cnt), but it doesn't necessarily mean that k=cnt is possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand better.

In this case, for u==1 and v%2==0 and v!=0, it computes cnt, which is the number of times op==0.

But in the second example, op for bit 0:

1:1

2:1^1=0

So, cnt=1, ans=1

len(a)=2, so max(1,2)=2

But in reality, k=2 gives XORs 1 and 3, OR=3 >2, which is invalid.

So, the solution incorrectly returns 2, but in reality, k=2 is invalid.

Hence, the solution might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's more to it.

Looking back at the reference solution, in this case, it seems that after processing all bits, it returns max(ans, len(a)), but in this example, ans=1 and len(a)=2, and it chooses 2, but in reality, k=2 is invalid.

So, perhaps this is a flaw in the solution.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that len(a) is the number of segments after all bit processing, but in this case, it's not correctly reflecting the validity.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not entirely correct.

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the op for bit 0.

For a=[1,3], bit 0:

1:1

2:1^1=0

So, cnt=1, ans=1

Then, len(a)=2, but in reality, k=2 is invalid.

So, perhaps the solution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at another example.

Take the third example:

2 2

1 3

x=2 (10 in binary)

Processing bit 1:

x bit 1=1, v=1 (%2=1), continue.

bit 0:

x bit 0=0, v=2 (%2=0), so u=0, v%2=0, split where op==0.

op for bit 0:

1:1

2:1^1=0

So, split at position 2, a becomes [1, 0]

Then, for bit 1:

x bit 1=1, u=1, v=1 (%2=1), continue.

Then, ans=-1, len(a)=2, max(-1,2)=2

But in reality, k=2 is invalid.

Hence, the solution is incorrect in this case.

So, perhaps the solution is not entirely correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to see how the OR of XORs is computed.

In the reference solution, it seems to process bits and split the array based on certain conditions, but it doesn't explicitly compute the OR of XORs.

It seems to make some assumptions based on the parity of the sum of bits.

But in this example, it fails to correctly identify that k=2 is invalid.

Hence, I think the reference solution is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
