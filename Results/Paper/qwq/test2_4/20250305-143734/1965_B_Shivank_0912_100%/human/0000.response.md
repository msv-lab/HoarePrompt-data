Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists under the given constraints, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have the sequence [1, 2, 3], some subsequences would be [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], and [1,2,3].

Now, the problem is about subset sums. I need to ensure that the subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n except for k. That means the set of all possible subset sums of my sequence should be equal to the set {1, 2, ..., n} minus {k}.

I recall that if I have a set of numbers where each number is a power of 2, the subset sums can represent any number up to the sum of all these powers of 2. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number from 1 to 15 by choosing appropriate subsets.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k, while including all others up to n.

So, maybe I can start with a set of powers of 2 that can cover up to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

Wait, but if I take powers of 2 up to n, the subset sums can make any number up to n. How can I modify this to exclude only k?

One idea is to remove the element that corresponds to k in the subset sum. But that might not work because k could be a sum of multiple elements, not just a single one.

Another idea is to include elements that allow making all sums except k. Maybe I can include elements that cover all sums up to n, and then adjust the sequence to make sure that k cannot be formed.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have a set A that can make all sums from 1 to n except k. I need to find such a set A with at most 25 elements.

I also know that the maximum n is 10^6, and I need to handle up to 10^3 test cases with n summing up to at most 10^7, but for each test case, n can be up to 10^6, which is large, so I need an efficient solution.

Given that m can be at most 25, which is small, I need to find a small set that can cover all sums up to n except one specific sum k.

I recall that with a set of 25 elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, but since n can be up to 10^6, it's manageable.

But generating all subsets is not practical; I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the properties of subset sums. If I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums should cover {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

One approach could be to start with a set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

But how?

Maybe I can exclude k by removing or altering one of the elements in the set so that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can still be formed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include an element that blocks the sum k while not affecting other sums.

This seems tricky. Let's think about it differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums except k. I need to make sure that no subset of A sums to k, but for every other v from 1 to n (v != k), there exists a subset that sums to v.

One strategy could be to include elements that allow me to reach all sums except k.

Let me consider the binary representation of numbers. Since 2^25 is over 33 million, which is larger than n=10^6, using powers of 2 up to 2^20 (which is 1,048,576) would cover n up to 10^6.

So, if I take the first 20 powers of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288. The sum of these is 1,048,575, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

Now, with these 20 powers of 2, I can make any sum from 1 to 1,048,575 by choosing the appropriate subset. But I need to exclude only k.

So, if I remove one of these elements, say 2^i, then I cannot make sums that have that bit set without including 2^i.

But that would exclude multiple sums, not just k.

So, that's not a good approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can include an element that, when included, blocks the sum k, but doesn't affect other sums.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at small examples to get some intuition.

Take the first test case: n=2, k=2.

I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 2, but there is a subsequence that sums to 1.

So, [1] is a valid sequence because its subsets are [] (sum 0) and [1] (sum 1). No subset sums to 2.

Similarly, in the second test case: n=6, k=1.

I need subsets that can sum to 2,3,4,5,6, but not 1.

One possible sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], but that's more than 25 elements, but since m can be up to 25, it's acceptable, but in this case, it's only 5 elements.

But the sample output shows m=5, with elements [2,3,4,5,6], which satisfies the conditions.

In the third test case: n=8, k=8.

Need subsets summing to 1 through 7, but not 8.

One way is to use [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum to any number from 1 to 7, but not 8, since 7*1=7 <8.

But that's 7 elements, which is acceptable.

Fourth test case: n=9, k=3.

Need subsets summing to 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, but not 3.

One possible sequence is [7,1,4,1]. Let's check:

Subsets:

- []: 0

- [7]:7

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1]:1

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [7,1,4]:12

- [7,1,1]:8

- [1,4]:5

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,4,1]:13

So, sums: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13. Missing 3 and 9.

Wait, but according to the sample output, m=4, and elements [7,1,4,1]. According to the problem, it should cover all v from 1 to 9 except 3.

Wait, but in my list above, I don't see 9. Maybe I missed some subsets.

Wait, [7,1,1]:7+1+1=9. So, yes, 9 is there. So sums are 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13. Missing 3, which is good.

So, this sequence works.

Fifth test case: n=10, k=7.

Need subsets summing to 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10, but not 7.

Sample output: m=4, elements [1,2,8,3].

Subsets:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Missing 7.

Perfect, it works.

So, from these examples, I can see that it's possible to construct such sequences.

Now, I need a general approach to construct such a sequence for any n and k within the constraints.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, it seems that the sequences provided are carefully chosen to cover all sums except k.

In the first test case, m=1, [1], which covers sum=1, and doesn't cover sum=2.

Second test case, m=5, [2,3,4,5,6], which covers sums from 2 to 6 and 7 (2+5), 8 (2+6), 9 (3+6), etc., but doesn't cover sum=1.

Third test case, m=7, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which covers sums from 1 to 7, but since k=8, which is beyond n, but according to the problem, k can be up to n, so maybe there's a misinterpretation here.

Wait, in the third test case, n=8, k=8. So, I need sums from 1 to 7, and no sum should be 8.

The sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] can sum up to at most 7, which is fine, but actually, the sum can be up to 7, which is less than 8, so it's okay.

But in general, I need to make sure that no subset sums to k, while being able to sum to all other v from 1 to n.

Looking at the fourth test case, m=4, [7,1,4,1], which can sum to 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13, but not 3.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, m=4, [1,2,8,3], which can sum to 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, but not 7.

So, there must be a pattern here.

I need to find a sequence where the subset sums cover everything except k.

One idea is to include elements that allow me to reach all sums except k by carefully choosing elements that fill in the gaps appropriately.

But this seems vague. Let's think about it differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to ensure two things:

1. For every v from 1 to n, v != k, there exists a subset of A that sums to v.

2. There is no subset of A that sums to k.

Given that m <= 25, and elements can be up to 10^9, I have some flexibility.

I need an efficient way to construct such a set A.

Let me consider the properties of subset sums.

If I have a set of elements where each element is a power of 2, then the subset sums can represent any number up to the sum of all elements, similar to binary representation.

But in this case, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, maybe I can modify the set of powers of 2 to exclude k.

But how?

One approach is to remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, but that might not work because k could be a sum of multiple elements.

Wait, perhaps I can add an element that blocks the sum k while not affecting other sums.

Let me think about adding an element that is equal to k.

But if I add k, then the subset that includes only k sums to k, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid.

So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can add elements that make it impossible to reach k, but still allow all other sums.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the minimal number of elements needed to reach all sums from 1 to n except k.

In the first test case, m=1, [1], which covers sum=1, and doesn't cover sum=2.

In the second test case, m=5, [2,3,4,5,6], which covers sums from 2 to 6 and beyond, but doesn't cover sum=1.

In the third test case, m=7, [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which covers sums from 1 to 7, and k=8 is beyond n=8, but according to the problem, k can be up to n, so I need to handle cases where k is within 1 to n.

In the fourth test case, m=4, [7,1,4,1], which covers sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

In the fifth test case, m=4, [1,2,8,3], which covers sums from 1 to 14 except 7.

So, in these examples, m is small, and the sequences are carefully chosen.

I need a general method to construct such sequences.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find a minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- To do this, I can start with a set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude the sum k.

- One way to generate all sums from 1 to n is to use the minimal number of elements with values being powers of 2, up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n.

- However, this would allow generating all sums from 1 to the sum of these powers of 2, which is more than n.

- To exclude k, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

- Perhaps I can add an element that, when included, would make some sums unreachable, specifically k.

But this is still unclear.

Let me think about the properties of k.

Suppose I have the binary representation of k.

Let’s say k has certain bits set.

If I have elements that correspond to the powers of 2 for all bits except one specific bit, then certain sums might be unreachable.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach inspired by the sample inputs:

- Include elements that cover all sums except k by ensuring that k cannot be formed, while all other sums can be formed by appropriate combinations of the elements.

- To do this, I can include elements that allow me to reach all sums up to n, except block the sum k.

- One way to block k is to include elements in such a way that any subset summing to k is invalid, but still allow other sums.

But this is still not concrete.

Looking back at the fourth sample input: n=9, k=3, sequence [7,1,4,1]

Let's see how this works:

- Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [1,4]:5 (duplicate)

- [1,7]:8 (duplicate)

- [4,7]:11

- [1,1,4]:6

- [1,1,7]:9

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,7]:12 (duplicate)

- [1,1,4,7]:13

So, sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13. Missing 3 and 10.

But according to the problem, it's acceptable to have sums beyond n=9, and the important part is to cover all v from 1 to n except k=3.

In this case, sums 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9 are covered, and 3 is not covered.

Similarly, in the fifth sample input: n=10, k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3]

- Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

Sums: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Missing 7.

So, in both cases, the sequences are constructed in a way that avoids summing to k, while covering all other sums up to n.

Looking at these sequences, it seems that they are carefully chosen to cover the necessary sums and exclude k.

But how to generalize this?

Let me consider that m can be up to 25, which is a small number, and the elements can be up to 10^9, which is also manageable.

I need an efficient way to construct such a sequence for any n and k within the constraints.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- One way to do this is to include elements that cover all sums except k.

- To achieve this, I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, but adjust for k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that any number can be represented uniquely in binary, except for k.

But k is just one number, so maybe I can modify the set of powers of 2 by adjusting one of the elements to block k.

Let me think about the binary representation of k.

Suppose k has a specific binary representation, and I can choose elements that correspond to the bits in k in a particular way.

This seems promising, but I need to formalize it.

Let me consider that in the binary representation of k, there is a specific bit that I can manipulate to block the sum k.

Let’s denote the binary representation of k as a sequence of bits.

Let’s say k has bits set at positions i1, i2, ..., im.

If I exclude one of these bits, say the highest set bit, then I might prevent k from being formed.

But this might not be sufficient, as k could be formed by combining multiple smaller elements.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to all powers of 2 except the one that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

But this might not work, because k could still be formed by combining other elements.

Let me try an example.

Suppose n=9, k=3.

Binary representation of 3 is 11 in binary (2^1 + 2^0).

If I exclude 2^1 (which is 2), and include 2^0 (which is 1), then I can make sums 1 and 1+1=2, but not 3.

But I need to cover sums up to 9.

Wait, but in the sample input, they used [7,1,4,1], which can make sums up to 14.

So, perhaps excluding one specific power of 2 isn't the way to go.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I include elements that can generate all sums except k, by ensuring that k cannot be formed.

One way to do this is to include elements such that any subset sum that would equal k is blocked.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I include an element that is equal to k, then I can easily block k by excluding subsets that include this element.

But if I include k, then there is a subset that sums to k, which is just [k].

So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can include elements that are greater than k, and combine them in such a way that k cannot be formed.

But this is still not concrete.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are powers of 2, except for the one that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal set of elements to generate all sums except k.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote the highest set bit in k as 2^i.

Then, if I exclude 2^i from the set of powers of 2, I might prevent k from being formed, but this may not be sufficient because k could still be formed by combining other elements.

Wait, let's take an example.

Let’s take n=9, k=3.

Binary of 3 is 11 (2^1 + 2^0).

If I exclude 2^1 (which is 2), and include 2^0 (1), then I can make sums of 1 and multiples of 1, but not 2.

But 2 can be made by 1+1.

Wait, so excluding 2 doesn't help because 2 can still be made by 1+1.

So, that's not effective.

Wait, perhaps I need to exclude a different element or include additional elements to block k.

Another idea: include elements that allow making all sums except k by ensuring that k cannot be formed, perhaps by making sure that the combination of elements doesn't allow summing to k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that if I include elements that sum up to n, but adjust them so that k is not achievable.

But this is still not specific enough.

Let me consider that in the sample input, for n=9, k=3, they used [7,1,4,1].

Let's see how this blocks k=3.

Possible subsets:

- [1]:1

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [1,4]:5 (duplicate)

- [1,7]:8 (duplicate)

- [4,7]:11

- [1,1,4]:6

- [1,1,7]:9

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,7]:12 (duplicate)

- [1,1,4,7]:13

So, sums: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13. Missing 3 and 10.

But 10 is beyond n=9, so it's acceptable.

Similarly, in the fourth sample input, n=9, k=3, and m=4, [7,1,4,1], which blocks sum=3.

Similarly, in the fifth sample input, n=10, k=7, m=4, [1,2,8,3], which blocks sum=7.

So, perhaps there is a pattern in choosing elements that allow covering all sums except k.

Looking at these sequences, it seems that including elements that are larger than k helps in covering higher sums without necessarily including k.

But I need a general method.

Let me consider that I can include elements that are powers of 2, and adjust one element to block k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and replace one of them with k - 2^i, for some i.

This might help in blocking k.

Let me try this idea.

Suppose I have the set of powers of 2: 1,2,4,8,16,...

And I replace one of them with k - 2^i.

Then, perhaps the subset sums would cover all sums except k.

Let me try with n=9, k=3.

Powers of 2 up to n=9: 1,2,4,8.

Sum of these is 15, which covers sums from 0 to 15.

But I need to exclude sum=3.

So, perhaps I can replace one of these elements with 3 - 2^i for some i.

Wait, 3 - 1=2, 3 - 2=1, 3 - 4=-1 (invalid).

So, replacing 1 with 2, or 2 with 1.

If I replace 1 with 2, then the set becomes [2,2,4,8].

Subsets:

- [2]:2

- [2]:2

- [4]:4

- [8]:8

- [2,2]:4

- [2,4]:6

- [2,8]:10

- [2,4]:6 (duplicate)

- [2,8]:10 (duplicate)

- [4,8]:12

- [2,2,4]:8

- [2,2,8]:12

- [2,4,8]:14

- [2,2,4,8]:16

So, sums: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16. Missing 1,3,5,7,9.

But I need to cover sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if I replace 2 with 1, the set becomes [1,1,4,8].

Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [8]:8

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,8]:9

- [1,4]:5 (duplicate)

- [1,8]:9 (duplicate)

- [4,8]:12

- [1,1,4]:6

- [1,1,8]:10

- [1,4,8]:13

- [1,4,8]:13 (duplicate)

- [1,1,4,8]:14

Sums: 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14. Missing 3,7.

But in this case, sum=7 is missing, which is acceptable since k=3 is already excluded.

But according to the problem, for n=9, k=3, the sequence should cover sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

In this case, sum=7 is also missing, but the sample input provides a sequence that covers sums up to 13, but n=9 requires only up to 9.

So, perhaps it's acceptable to have sums beyond n, but the main requirement is to cover all v from 1 to n except k.

In this case, sums up to 9 are covered except 3, so it's acceptable.

But in the sample input, they used [7,1,4,1], which covers sums up to 13, but that's fine.

So, perhaps my approach of replacing one element with another value is a way to block k.

But I need to generalize this.

Let me consider that I can replace one of the powers of 2 with k - 2^i, for some i.

Then, the subset sums would include sums that can be formed by combining these elements.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose i such that k - 2^i is non-negative and doesn't allow forming k.

Let me try with n=9, k=3.

Powers of 2: 1,2,4,8.

Let’s choose i=1 (2^1=2).

Then, k - 2^1 = 3 - 2 =1.

So, replace 2 with 1.

Then, the set becomes [1,1,4,8], as above, which covers sums from 1 to 9 except 3 and 7.

But in the sample input, they used [7,1,4,1], which covers sums up to 13 except 3.

So, perhaps choosing a larger element helps in covering higher sums.

Wait, maybe instead of replacing an element, I can add an element that blocks k.

But this is getting too vague.

Let me consider that in the sequence [7,1,4,1], the element 7 is larger than n=9, but it helps in covering higher sums.

But the problem allows elements up to 10^9, so large elements are acceptable.

Similarly, in the fifth sample input, n=10, k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3], which includes 8, which is larger than k=7.

So, perhaps including elements larger than k helps in covering higher sums without necessarily allowing sum k.

But I need a systematic way to construct such sequences.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- To do this, include elements that cover all sums except k.

- One way is to include elements that correspond to powers of 2, but adjust one of them to block k.

- Specifically, find the highest set bit in k, and adjust the corresponding element.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal set of elements that can generate all sums except k by excluding the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

But in the earlier example, that didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include an element that is equal to k minus the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that in the sequence, including elements that sum up to all values except k can be achieved by carefully selecting elements that cover the necessary sums.

Given that m can be up to 25, which is small, and elements can be up to 10^9, I can afford to include some redundant elements if necessary.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, while all other sums from 1 to n except k are possible.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that if I can find a set of elements where the subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to the sum of the elements, excluding k.

But sum of elements can be up to 25*10^9, which is way beyond n=10^6, so that's not a problem.

But I need to make sure that k cannot be formed.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that allow me to reach all sums except k by ensuring that k is not reachable.

One way to ensure that k is not reachable is to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

But this is the condition I need to satisfy.

So, perhaps I need to choose elements such that their subset sums cover everything except k.

This seems circular.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to find such a set A with m <=25.

Given that m is small (25), and n can be up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to construct A.

Let me consider that with m elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^m, which is 33,554,432, which is more than enough to cover n=10^6.

But generating all subsets is not practical.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the elements can be chosen such that their subset sums cover all numbers except k.

One way to achieve this is to include elements that correspond to the binary representation, but adjust for k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the subset sums of a set of elements correspond to the possible combinations of including or excluding each element.

So, if I represent the elements in binary, their sums can be seen as the combinations of their binary representations.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that in order to exclude k, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This is equivalent to saying that the equation sum(s) =k has no solution for any subset s of A.

But I also need that for every v from 1 to n, v !=k, there exists a subset s of A such that sum(s)=v.

This seems like a complex constraint.

Let me consider that I can include elements that allow me to generate all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

One idea is to include elements that are just enough to cover the required sums, while excluding k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that I can include elements that are powers of 2, and adjust one element to block k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an additional element that blocks k.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2 up to the largest power less than or equal to n, and then adjust one element to block k.

For example, for n=9, k=3, include [1,2,4,8], but adjust one of them to block k=3.

In the earlier attempt, replacing 2 with 1 gave [1,1,4,8], which blocks k=3.

But in that case, sum=7 is also missing, which is acceptable since n=9 and k=3.

Similarly, in the sample input, [7,1,4,1] covers sums up to 13 except 3.

So, perhaps including a larger element helps in covering higher sums while blocking k.

But I need a general method.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an additional element that is equal to k plus some value to block k.

Wait, perhaps including k plus a power of 2.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=9, k=3, they used [7,1,4,1].

Note that 7=3+4, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps including k plus a power of 2 helps in blocking k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to find such a set A with m <=25.

Given that m is small, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select elements that cover as much as possible without covering k.

But this might be too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2 up to a certain point, and adjust one element to block k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and replace one of them with k - 2^i for some i.

Then, the subset sums would cover all sums except k.

Let me try this with n=9, k=3.

Powers of 2: 1,2,4,8.

Let’s choose i=1 (2^1=2).

Then, k - 2^1 =3-2=1.

So, replace 2 with 1.

Then, the set becomes [1,1,4,8].

As before, this covers sums 1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14, missing 3 and 7.

But for n=9, k=3, this is acceptable.

Similarly, in the sample input, [7,1,4,1] covers sums 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13, missing 3 and 10.

But in this case, sum=7 is included, which is different from my previous attempt.

Wait, in my previous attempt, sum=7 was missing, but in the sample input, sum=7 is included.

So, perhaps my earlier approach is not correct.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I can include elements that allow me to cover all sums except k by including elements that cover the necessary sums and excluding k.

But this seems too vague.

Looking back at the problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, and m can be at most 25.

Given that m is small, perhaps I can use a precomputed set of elements that can cover all sums up to a certain value, and adjust for k.

But precomputing seems impractical.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2 up to 2^24=16,777,216, which is way larger than n=10^6.

So, with m=25, I can cover sums up to 16,777,215, which is more than enough for n=10^6.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and adjust one element to block k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an additional element that blocks k.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2 up to 2^24, and then adjust one element to block k.

But this seems too broad.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and replace one of them with k + 2^i for some i.

Then, the subset sums would cover all sums except k.

Let me try this with n=9, k=3.

Powers of 2:1,2,4,8.

Let’s choose i=0 (2^0=1).

Then, k + 2^0=3+1=4.

So, replace 1 with 4.

Then, the set becomes [4,2,4,8].

But now, sums are 2,4,8,6,12,10,12,14, etc. Missing 1,3,5,7,9.

But I need to cover sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to include k + 2^i as an additional element, not replacing any.

Wait, let's try that.

Include powers of 2:1,2,4,8, and include k + 2^i for some i.

Let’s choose i=0: k + 2^0=3+1=4.

So, include [1,2,4,8,4].

But this is redundant, as 4 is already included.

Wait, perhaps choosing i such that k + 2^i is not already included.

But this seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an element that is equal to k plus a power of 2.

Then, the subset sums would include sums that are k plus some other sums, but I'm not sure if this helps in blocking k.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an element that is equal to k minus a power of 2.

But k minus a power of 2 might be negative, which is invalid.

Wait, in the earlier attempt, for n=9, k=3, replacing 2 with 1 gives [1,1,4,8], which blocks k=3.

So, perhaps replacing 2 with k - 2^i, but k -2=1, which is positive.

So, perhaps replacing 2^i with k - 2^j for some j.

But this needs more thought.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an element that is equal to k minus the sum of some subset of the powers of 2.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an element that is equal to k plus some power of 2.

Wait, perhaps including k plus the smallest power of 2 not included.

But this is still too vague.

I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and adjust one element to be equal to k plus a power of 2.

Then, the subset sums would include sums that are k plus some other sums, but I'm not sure how this helps in blocking k.

This seems too unclear.

Let me consider that I can include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include an element that is equal to k minus the highest power of 2 less than or equal to k.

Wait, for n=9, k=3, the highest power of 2 less than or equal to 3 is 2.

So, k -2=1.

Then, include [1,2,4,8], which is similar to replacing 2 with 1.

But earlier, this didn't work perfectly.

Wait, in the sample input, they used [7,1,4,1], which includes 7, which is k=3 plus 4.

Wait, 7=3+4, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, perhaps including k plus a power of 2 helps in blocking k.

But in this case, 7=3+4, and including 7 blocks sum=3.

Wait, how does including 7 block sum=3?

Let’s see:

Subsets:

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [4,7]:11

- [1,4,7]:12

So, no subset sums to 3.

But if I include 7, which is k=3 plus 4, it blocks sum=3.

Wait, perhaps including k plus a power of 2 helps in blocking k.

Let me try this idea.

Suppose I include elements that correspond to powers of 2, and include k plus a power of 2.

Then, the subset sums would include sums that are k plus some other sums, which might help in blocking k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that including k plus a power of 2 makes it impossible to form k, because to form k, I would need to include k plus a power of 2 and subtract that power of 2, but since elements are non-negative, this might not be possible.

Wait, but subsets can only include elements, not exclude them or subtract them.

So, including k plus a power of
