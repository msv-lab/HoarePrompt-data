Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, with the condition that k is less than or equal to n, and k is even. I need to construct a permutation of length n that is k-level. A k-level permutation is one where, among all the sums of continuous segments of length k, any two sums differ by no more than 1. That means the maximum difference between any two such sums should be at most 1.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without any repeats. For example, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], etc.

Now, the task is to create such a permutation where the sums of all consecutive sequences of length k differ by at most 1. That sounds tricky, but maybe there's a pattern or a specific way to arrange the numbers to achieve this.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

2 2

3 2

10 4

13 4

7 4

Output:

2 1

1 3 2

1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6

4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7

1 6 3 7 2 5 4

In the second test case, for n=3 and k=2:

Permutation: [1,3,2]

Sums of consecutive segments of length 2:

1+3=4

3+2=5

The difference between the sums is 5-4=1, which satisfies the condition.

In the third test case, n=10 and k=4:

Permutation: [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

Sums of consecutive segments of length 4:

1+8+4+10=23

8+4+10+2=24

4+10+2+7=23

10+2+7+5=24

2+7+5+9=23

7+5+9+3=24

5+9+3+6=23

The sums alternate between 23 and 24, so the difference is 1, which is acceptable.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the sums of every k consecutive numbers are as close as possible, differing by at most 1.

I need to find a general method to construct such a permutation for any given n and k, where k is even.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since k is even, that might be a key point. Maybe I can pair numbers in a certain way.

One idea is to arrange the numbers in a way that high and low numbers are alternated or grouped in a specific pattern to balance the sums.

Another thought: since the difference between any two sums should be at most 1, the sums should be as equal as possible. This sounds like a problem of distributing the numbers evenly.

Let me consider the total sum of all numbers from 1 to n, which is n*(n+1)/2. Each number is part of several sums, depending on its position.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of times each number is included in the sums.

In the sliding window of size k, each number is included in a certain number of sums based on its position.

For example, for n=5 and k=3:

- Position 1: included in sum 1 (positions 1,2,3)

- Position 2: included in sums 1 and 2 (positions 1,2,3 and 2,3,4)

- Position 3: included in sums 1, 2, and 3 (positions 1,2,3; 2,3,4; 3,4,5)

- Position 4: included in sums 2 and 3

- Position 5: included in sum 3

So, the numbers in positions with higher inclusion frequency should perhaps be balanced with higher and lower numbers.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler pattern.

Looking back at the examples, in the first test case, n=2 and k=2:

Permutation: [2,1]

Sum: 2+1=3

Since there's only one sum, it trivially satisfies the condition.

In the second test case, n=3 and k=2:

[1,3,2]

Sums: 1+3=4, 3+2=5

Difference is 1, which is acceptable.

In the third test case, n=10 and k=4:

[1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

Sums: 23 and 24 alternating.

Again, difference is 1.

Looking at this, it seems like pairing high and low numbers in a specific order achieves the balance needed.

Maybe I can interleave high and low numbers.

Let me try to formalize this.

Given that k is even, I can divide the permutation into blocks of size k/2, and in each block, place the highest available numbers and the lowest available numbers alternately.

Wait, perhaps I should use a technique similar to the median filter or some sorting and reversing.

Alternatively, maybe I can use arithmetic properties to distribute the numbers evenly.

Let me consider the average sum of a window of size k.

The total sum of all numbers is n*(n+1)/2.

The number of windows is n - k + 1.

So, the average sum per window would be [n*(n+1)/2] / [n - k + 1].

But I need the sums to be as close as possible to this average, differing by at most 1.

This sounds similar to distributing the numbers to balance the load.

Another idea: perhaps arrange the numbers in an increasing order and then adjust specific positions to minimize the differences.

But in the example, the permutation isn't strictly increasing or decreasing; it's a mix.

Wait, in the third test case, it's [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6].

It seems like high and low numbers are interleaved in a specific pattern.

Maybe I can arrange the numbers in a way that the sum of every k consecutive numbers is either S or S+1, for some S.

To achieve this, perhaps I can arrange the numbers so that the differences between consecutive sums are minimized.

Looking at the sums in the third test case:

Sums: 23,24,23,24,23,24,23

So, they alternate between 23 and 24.

This suggests that the difference between consecutive sums is 1, and overall, the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is 1.

How can I arrange the numbers to achieve this?

Let me consider the difference between consecutive sums.

For example, sum from position i to i+k-1 and sum from position i+1 to i+k.

The difference between these two sums is p_i - p_{i+k}, where p is the permutation.

So, p_i - p_{i+k} should be either 0 or 1 to ensure that the sums differ by at most 1.

Wait, actually, the difference could be more, but the cumulative effect should result in sums differing by at most 1.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me think about the total sum and how it's distributed among the windows.

Total sum S = n*(n+1)/2.

Number of windows W = n - k + 1.

Ideal sum per window would be floor(S/W) or ceil(S/W).

So, perhaps aim for sums in each window to be floor(S/W) or ceil(S/W), ensuring that the difference between the highest and lowest sums is at most 1.

But calculating S/W for each test case might not be efficient, especially since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4.

I need a more straightforward way to construct the permutation.

Maybe I can arrange the numbers in a specific order, like sorting them in a particular pattern.

Wait, here's an idea: arrange the numbers in increasing order, but alternate the placement in the permutation.

For example, place the smallest number first, then the largest, then the second smallest, then the second largest, and so on.

This way, high and low numbers are interleaved, which might balance the sums.

Let me try this for n=3, k=2:

Numbers: 1,2,3

Arrange: 1 (smallest), 3 (largest), 2 (next smallest)

So, [1,3,2], which matches the example.

For n=10, k=4:

Numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Arrange: 1,10,3,9,5,8,7,6,2,4

Wait, but in the example, it's [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6], which is different from my arrangement, but still achieves the goal.

So, my method might not be the same, but perhaps a similar idea.

Let me check the sums for my arrangement:

[1,10,3,9,5,8,7,6,2,4]

Sums of windows of size 4:

1+10+3+9=23

10+3+9+5=27

3+9+5+8=25

9+5+8+7=29

5+8+7+6=26

8+7+6+2=23

7+6+2+4=19

Differences are more than 1, so this arrangement doesn't work.

Hmm, my approach failed here. So, perhaps simply alternating high and low isn't sufficient.

I need a better strategy.

Let me look for a pattern in the example provided for n=10 and k=4: [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

Let's see the sums:

1+8+4+10=23

8+4+10+2=24

4+10+2+7=23

10+2+7+5=24

2+7+5+9=23

7+5+9+3=24

5+9+3+6=23

So, sums alternate between 23 and 24.

Is there a pattern in the arrangement?

Looking closely:

Position 1: 1 (low)

Position 2: 8 (high)

Position 3: 4 (medium)

Position 4: 10 (high)

Position 5: 2 (low)

Position 6: 7 (high)

Position 7: 5 (medium)

Position 8: 9 (high)

Position 9: 3 (low)

Position 10: 6 (medium)

It seems like low and high numbers are interleaved in a specific way to balance the sums.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of k/2 low and k/2 high numbers in each window.

Since k is even, k/2 is an integer.

So, in each window of size k, have k/2 smallest available numbers and k/2 largest available numbers.

Wait, but that might not work because the available numbers change as the window slides.

Alternatively, perhaps arrange the permutation so that in every window of size k, there are exactly k/2 smallest numbers and k/2 largest numbers.

But defining "smallest" and "largest" in this context is tricky.

Another idea: arrange the numbers in increasing order, but shift every k/2 numbers by a certain offset.

Wait, perhaps use a specific ordering based on indices.

Let me consider arranging the numbers in order, but with a specific step.

For example, start with the smallest number, then pick the number that is k/2 positions ahead, and so on.

Wait, perhaps arrange the numbers in order, but with a stride of k/2.

Wait, maybe arrange the numbers in order, but place them in positions that are k/2 apart.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving sums of consecutive elements, using differences or prefix sums can be helpful.

Let me define prefix sums.

Let s_i be the sum from p_i to p_{i+k-1}.

Then, s_{i+1} = s_i - p_i + p_{i+k}.

So, s_{i+1} - s_i = p_{i+k} - p_i.

We need that for all i, |s_{i+1} - s_i| <=1.

Wait, but the problem states that the difference between any two s_i and s_j should be at most 1, not just consecutive s_i and s_{i+1}.

But in the example, they seem to have made sure that consecutive s_i and s_{i+1} differ by at most 1, which indirectly ensures that any two s_i and s_j differ by at most 1.

Wait, no. The problem says that the maximum sum minus the minimum sum should be at most 1.

But ensuring that consecutive s_i and s_{i+1} differ by at most 1 would indeed ensure that the overall difference is at most 1, because the sums can only change by at most 1 at each step.

So, if I can arrange the permutation such that p_{i+k} - p_i is either 0 or 1 for all i, then s_{i+1} - s_i would be either 0 or 1, which would satisfy the condition.

But that seems too restrictive, because the numbers are distinct, so p_{i+k} - p_i can't be 0.

Wait, actually, p_{i+k} - p_i can be any value depending on how I arrange the permutation.

But if I arrange the permutation such that p_{i+k} - p_i is either 0 or 1, which is impossible since all p are distinct integers.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that p_{i+k} - p_i should be as small as possible.

But again, this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to focus on minimizing the variation in the sums.

Another idea: arrange the numbers in such a way that the sorted order of the sums is as compact as possible.

But that doesn't give me a clear construction method.

Let me try to think about smaller examples.

For n=4 and k=2:

Possible permutation: [1,3,2,4]

Sums: 1+3=4, 3+2=5, 2+4=6 → differences are 1 and 1, which is acceptable.

Another permutation: [1,4,2,3]

Sums: 1+4=5, 4+2=6, 2+3=5 → sums are 5,6,5 → difference is 1, which is acceptable.

Wait, in both cases, the sums alternate between two values differing by 1.

So, perhaps arranging the permutation in a way that the sums alternate between two values is the key.

How can I generalize this?

For k=4, n=6:

Let's try [1,5,2,6,3,4]

Sums:

1+5+2+6=14

5+2+6+3=16

2+6+3+4=15

Difference between maximum and minimum is 2, which is not acceptable.

Need to adjust.

Maybe [1,6,2,5,3,4]

Sums:

1+6+2+5=14

6+2+5+3=16

2+5+3+4=14

Difference is 2, still not good.

Wait, perhaps [1,5,2,6,3,4] isn't working.

Let me try [1,4,3,6,2,5]

Sums:

1+4+3+6=14

4+3+6+2=15

3+6+2+5=16

Difference is 2, again.

Hmm.

What's the issue here?

In all these arrangements, the difference between the highest and lowest sums is at least 2.

But according to the problem, there should be a permutation where this difference is at most 1.

Maybe I need to arrange the numbers so that the sums are as balanced as possible.

Another idea: arrange the numbers in a way that the sum of each window is as close as possible to the average sum.

The average sum would be total sum S divided by number of windows W.

But since we need the difference between any two sums to be at most 1, perhaps arrange the permutation so that the sums cycle through floor(S/W) and ceil(S/W).

Let me calculate S and W for n=10 and k=4.

S = 10*11/2 = 55

W = 10 - 4 + 1 = 7

Average sum per window: 55/7 ≈ 7.857 → floor is 7, ceil is 8.

So, aim for sums of 7 and 8 in each window.

But in the example, the sums are higher. Wait, in the example for n=10 and k=4, the sums are 23 and 24, which are higher than 7 and 8. So perhaps this approach isn't directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating S/W.

Wait, n=10, k=4:

Total sum S = 55

Number of windows W = 7

So, average sum per window is 55/7 ≈ 7.857

But in the example, sums are 23 and 24, which don't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, the sums in the example are correct based on the permutation provided.

So, maybe the average sum isn't directly relevant here.

Perhaps I need to focus on the differences between consecutive sums.

As s_{i+1} - s_i = p_{i+k} - p_i

And we need that for all i, |p_{i+k} - p_i| <=1

But since all p_i are distinct integers, |p_{i+k} - p_i| >=1, and often much larger.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's allowed for sums to differ by up to 1, but in practice, with distinct integers, the differences p_{i+k} - p_i can be large, but their impact on the sum difference is balanced by other terms.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider constructing the permutation in a specific order.

One idea is to arrange the numbers in increasing order, but in a pattern that balances the sums.

For example, arrange the permutation in increasing order, but reverse every k/2 elements.

Wait, for k=4, reverse every 2 elements.

For n=6, k=4:

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Reverse every 2 elements:

[2,1,4,3,6,5]

Sums:

2+1+4+3=10

1+4+3+6=14

4+3+6+5=18

Difference is 8, which is too much.

Not working.

Another idea: arrange the numbers in a snake-like pattern.

Start with the smallest, then the largest, then the next smallest, then the next largest, and so on.

For n=6, k=4:

[1,6,2,5,3,4]

Sums:

1+6+2+5=14

6+2+5+3=16

2+5+3+4=14

Difference is 2, still not good.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe adjust the snake pattern.

Start with the smallest, then the second largest, then the second smallest, then the largest, and so on.

For n=6, k=4:

[1,5,2,6,3,4]

Sums:

1+5+2+6=14

5+2+6+3=16

2+6+3+4=15

Difference is 2.

Still not meeting the requirement.

Wait, in the example for n=10 and k=4, the permutation is [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

Sums: 23,24,23,24,23,24,23

So, the differences are 1.

How is this achieved?

Looking at the positions:

Position 1:1

Position 2:8

Position 3:4

Position 4:10

Position 5:2

Position 6:7

Position 7:5

Position 8:9

Position 9:3

Position 10:6

It seems like high and low numbers are interleaved in a specific manner.

Maybe I can arrange the permutation by interleaving low and high numbers in a more controlled way.

Let me try dividing the numbers into two halves: low half and high half.

For n=10, low half:1,2,3,4,5; high half:6,7,8,9,10

Then, arrange them in an alternating pattern: low, high, low, high, etc.

But in the example, it's not strictly alternating.

Wait, in the example, it's [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

So, position 1:1 (low), position 2:8 (high), position 3:4 (low), position 4:10 (high), position 5:2 (low), position 6:7 (high), position 7:5 (medium), position 8:9 (high), position 9:3 (low), position 10:6 (high).

It's not a strict alternating pattern between low and high.

Maybe it's more about arranging numbers in a way that the sum of every k consecutive numbers is balanced.

Another idea: arrange the numbers in increasing order, but shift the order by k/2 steps.

Wait, for k=4, shift by 2 steps.

For n=10, original order:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

Shift by 2: positions 1,3,5,7,9,11 (but 11 is out of bounds), so take only up to position 9.

Wait, this seems unclear.

Perhaps I need to use a different approach.

Let me consider that since k is even, I can pair elements in a specific way to balance the sums.

For example, pair a high number with a low number in a way that their sum is approximately the same.

But for sums of k elements, this might be more complex.

Wait, perhaps arrange the numbers in a way that the sum of every k consecutive numbers is as close as possible to the average sum.

To achieve this, perhaps arrange the numbers in increasing order, but adjust the permutation to minimize the variation in the sums.

But this is still too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in some problems, arranging numbers in a specific order, such as increasing followed by decreasing, can help balance sums.

For example, create a permutation that is a sequence of increasing and decreasing blocks.

Wait, perhaps arrange the permutation in a zigzag pattern.

For example, start with the smallest number, then the largest, then the second smallest, then the second largest, and so on.

For n=6, k=4:

[1,6,2,5,3,4]

Sums:

1+6+2+5=14

6+2+5+3=16

2+5+3+4=14

Difference is 2, which is still more than 1.

Not sufficient.

Wait, maybe adjust the pattern.

Start with the smallest, then the second largest, then the second smallest, then the largest, and so on.

For n=6, k=4:

[1,5,2,6,3,4]

Sums:

1+5+2+6=14

5+2+6+3=16

2+6+3+4=15

Difference is 2.

Still not meeting the requirement.

Perhaps I need to arrange the numbers in a more specific pattern to achieve the required sum differences.

Let me consider the positions in the permutation modulo k.

Since k is even, maybe arrange the numbers based on their position modulo k/2 or something similar.

Wait, perhaps arrange the numbers in order, but with a specific stride.

For example, place numbers in positions that are multiples of k/2 apart.

Wait, perhaps arrange the permutation by placing numbers in positions i and i + k/2 for each i.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to look at the example again.

For n=10 and k=4:

Permutation: [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

Sums:

1+8+4+10=23

8+4+10+2=24

4+10+2+7=23

10+2+7+5=24

2+7+5+9=23

7+5+9+3=24

5+9+3+6=23

So, sums alternate between 23 and 24.

Looking at the positions:

Positions 1 to 4:1,8,4,10 → sum=23

Positions 2 to 5:8,4,10,2 → sum=24

Positions 3 to 6:4,10,2,7 → sum=23

And so on.

So, the difference between consecutive sums is 1, and overall, the difference between maximum and minimum sums is 1.

How did they achieve this?

It seems like the arrangement is such that the sum of every four consecutive numbers is either 23 or 24.

Looking at the numbers:

1,8,4,10: sum=23

8,4,10,2: sum=24

4,10,2,7: sum=23

10,2,7,5: sum=24

2,7,5,9: sum=23

7,5,9,3: sum=24

5,9,3,6: sum=23

So, the sums alternate between 23 and 24.

This suggests that the arrangement is such that every window of size 4 has a sum that is either 23 or 24, differing by 1.

But how to generalize this arrangement for any n and k?

I need a systematic way to construct such permutations.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the first k elements such that their sum is as desired, and then arrange the remaining elements to maintain the sum difference of at most 1.

But this seems too vague.

Another idea: use a sliding window and adjust the elements to keep the sum balanced.

But again, not specific enough.

Let me consider the difference between consecutive sums.

As s_{i+1} - s_i = p_{i+k} - p_i

And we need |s_{i+1} - s_i| <=1, which implies |p_{i+k} - p_i| <=1

But since all p_i are distinct integers, |p_{i+k} - p_i| >=1, and often much larger.

So, perhaps arrange the permutation such that p_{i+k} is as close as possible to p_i.

But arranging distinct integers with p_{i+k} - p_i <=1 would require p_{i+k} = p_i +1, since they are distinct.

But this seems too restrictive and may not be possible for all n and k.

Wait, perhaps arrange the permutation in such a way that p_{i+k} = p_i +1 for all i.

But this would require that p_i +1 = p_{i+k} for all i, which may not be possible due to the constraints of the permutation.

For example, in n=4, k=2:

[1,2,3,4]

Then, p_{i+1} = p_i +1 for i=1,2,3.

But in this case, s_i = p_i + p_{i+1} = 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7 → differences are 2, which is more than 1.

Not working.

Another idea: arrange the permutation in a way that p_{i+k} - p_i is minimized.

But again, not sure how to do that systematically.

Let me consider the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the first k elements with sum S, and then ensure that each subsequent window has sum S or S+1.

How can I achieve that?

For example, start with the smallest k numbers to get the minimal sum, and then adjust the subsequent elements to maintain the sum difference of at most 1.

But in the example, they didn't use the smallest k numbers.

Wait, for n=10 and k=4, the first window is [1,8,4,10], sum=23, which is not the minimal possible sum.

The minimal possible sum would be 1+2+3+4=10.

So, they chose a higher sum.

Maybe I need to aim for a higher sum to balance the variations.

But this is unclear.

Another idea: arrange the permutation in increasing order, but adjust every k/2 elements to balance the sums.

Wait, perhaps arrange the permutation in blocks of size k, and arrange numbers within each block to balance the sums.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the properties of the sums.

Each sum s_i is the sum of k consecutive elements.

The difference between s_i and s_{i+1} is p_{i+k} - p_i.

To keep the difference between any two s_i and s_j at most 1, perhaps arrange the permutation so that the differences p_{i+k} - p_i are minimized.

But again, with distinct integers, p_{i+k} - p_i >=1.

Wait, perhaps arrange the permutation so that p_{i+k} - p_i =1 for all i.

But this would require that p_{i+k} = p_i +1, which isn't possible for all i in a permutation.

For example, in n=4, k=2:

[1,2,3,4]

Then, p_{i+1} = p_i +1 for all i, but the sums would be 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7 → differences are 2.

Not working.

Another arrangement:

[1,3,2,4]

Sums:1+3=4, 3+2=5, 2+4=6 → differences are 1 and 1.

This works for k=2, but n must be at least k, so n=2 is the smallest.

Wait, in this case, for n=4 and k=2, [1,3,2,4] gives sums 4,5,6, which differ by 1 consecutively.

But for k=4, it's harder.

Wait, perhaps generalize this pattern for larger k.

But not sure how.

Let me consider another approach.

Since the problem states that such a permutation always exists given the constraints, perhaps there's a standard method or formula to construct it.

Maybe arranging the numbers in a specific order based on their indices.

Wait, perhaps arranging the numbers in order, but with a specific shift.

Wait, perhaps arranging the numbers in order, but starting from a specific position.

But this seems too vague.

Another idea: arrange the permutation in increasing order, but adjust every k positions.

Wait, perhaps arrange the permutation in increasing order, but reverse every k elements.

For n=6, k=4:

Original: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Reverse every 4 elements:

First 4: reverse to [4,3,2,1], then next 2: remain as is.

So, [4,3,2,1,5,6]

Sums:

4+3+2+1=10

3+2+1+5=11

2+1+5+6=14

Difference is 4, which is too much.

Not working.

Another idea: arrange the permutation in a way that the sum of every k consecutive elements is as close as possible.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following strategy:

1. Sort the numbers from 1 to n.

2. Arrange them in a specific pattern that balances the sums.

For example, arrange the smallest and largest numbers in a way that their contributions to the sums are balanced.

But I need a clearer plan.

Wait, perhaps arrange the numbers in increasing order, but adjust the permutation to minimize the variation in the sums.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider constructing the permutation in rounds, where in each round, I place certain numbers in specific positions to balance the sums.

But this is too vague.

Another idea: use a snake-like arrangement, where I alternate between increasing and decreasing sequences.

For example, for n=6, k=4:

[1,6,2,5,3,4]

Sums:

1+6+2+5=14

6+2+5+3=16

2+5+3+4=14

Difference is 2.

Still not meeting the requirement.

Wait, maybe adjust the snake pattern.

Start with the smallest, then the second largest, then the second smallest, then the largest, and so on.

For n=6, k=4:

[1,5,2,6,3,4]

Sums:

1+5+2+6=14

5+2+6+3=16

2+6+3+4=15

Difference is 2.

Still not good enough.

Perhaps I need to arrange the numbers in a more controlled manner.

Let me try to assign the numbers in order, but with a specific step.

For example, place the smallest number in position 1, then the next in position 1+k/2, and so on.

Wait, for k=4, k/2=2.

So, place the smallest number in position 1, then the next in position 3, and so on.

For n=6, k=4:

Position 1:1

Position 3:2

Position 5:3

Position 2:4

Position 4:5

Position 6:6

So, permutation: [1,4,2,5,3,6]

Sums:

1+4+2+5=12

4+2+5+3=14

2+5+3+6=16

Difference is 4.

Still not good.

Another arrangement: start with the smallest, then skip k/2 positions.

For n=6, k=4:

Position 1:1

Position 3:2

Position 5:3

Position 2:4

Position 4:5

Position 6:6

Same as above.

Same result.

Not working.

Wait, perhaps arrange the numbers in order, but with a different step.

Let me try step size of k/2.

For n=6, k=4, step=2.

Start with 1 in position 1, then 2 in position 3, 3 in position 5, 4 in position 1 (already filled), so maybe adjust.

This seems messy.

Perhaps I need to accept that my manual attempts are not sufficient and look for a different approach.

Let me consider that since k is even, perhaps arrange the permutation in a way that in every window of size k, the sum is balanced by having half of the highest available numbers and half of the lowest available numbers.

But this is too vague to implement.

Another idea: use a specific formula or calculation to determine the position of each number.

But without a clear formula, this is difficult.

Wait, perhaps look for a mathematical pattern in the example provided.

In the example for n=10 and k=4:

Permutation: [1,8,4,10,2,7,5,9,3,6]

Looking at the positions:

Position 1:1

Position 2:8

Position 3:4

Position 4:10

Position 5:2

Position 6:7

Position 7:5

Position 8:9

Position 9:3

Position 10:6

Is there a pattern here?

Looking at the positions modulo k.

Since k=4, positions modulo 4.

Position 1:1 → 1 mod 4=1

Position 2:8 → 2 mod 4=2

Position 3:4 → 3 mod 4=3

Position 4:10 → 4 mod 4=0

Position 5:2 → 5 mod 4=1

Position 6:7 → 6 mod 4=2

Position 7:5 → 7 mod 4=3

Position 8:9 → 8 mod 4=0

Position 9:3 → 9 mod 4=1

Position 10:6 → 10 mod 4=2

So, positions grouped by mod:

mod 0: positions 4,8

values:10,9

mod 1: positions 1,5,9

values:1,2,3

mod 2: positions 2,6,10

values:8,7,6

mod 3: positions 3,7

values:4,5

So, mod 0: highest numbers:10,9

mod 1: lowest numbers:1,2,3

mod 2: high numbers:8,7,6

mod 3: medium numbers:4,5

This seems like a pattern where numbers are assigned to positions based on their modulo class, with higher positions getting higher numbers.

Maybe I can generalize this.
