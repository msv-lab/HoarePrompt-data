Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he's selling n buns. The usual price for each bun is a coins, but he's running a promotion to attract customers. The promotion works like this: he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the minimum of n and b), and for the first k buns sold, each bun has a modified price: the i-th bun costs (b - i + 1) coins. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at the usual price a coins each. So, the total profit would be n * a.

If he chooses k > 0, say k buns, then:

- The first bun sells for b coins.

- The second bun sells for (b - 1) coins.

- The third bun sells for (b - 2) coins.

- And so on, until the k-th bun, which sells for (b - k + 1) coins.

- The remaining (n - k) buns sell at the usual price a coins each.

So, the total profit would be the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

I need to maximize this total profit by choosing the optimal k.

Let me think about how to calculate the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns.

The sum of the first k modified prices is:

b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1)

This is an arithmetic series where the first term is b and the last term is (b - k + 1), with a common difference of -1.

The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term).

So, sum = k/2 * (b + (b - k + 1)) = k/2 * (2b - k + 1)

Therefore, the total profit when choosing k is:

sum of modified prices + sum of usual prices for the remaining buns

Which is:

k/2 * (2b - k + 1) + a*(n - k)

I need to maximize this expression with respect to k, where k can be from 0 to min(n, b).

Wait, but b is not necessarily greater than or equal to k. Actually, k can be up to min(n, b), but b can be less than, equal to, or greater than a.

I need to consider different cases based on the values of a and b.

Case 1: b <= a

In this case, the modified price for the first k buns is less than or equal to the usual price a.

But wait, the modified price for the i-th bun is (b - i + 1), which could be less than a, equal to a, or greater than a, depending on the values.

Wait, no. Since b is the initial modified price, and it decreases by 1 for each subsequent bun, while a is the usual price.

If b <= a, then the modified price for the first bun is b, which is less than or equal to a, and it decreases from there. So, in this case, it's better to sell all buns at the usual price a, because a is greater than or equal to the modified prices.

Wait, but let's think about an example.

Suppose n=4, a=4, b=5.

From the example, it's optimal to choose k=1, getting 5 + 4*3 = 17.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if b > a, we might want to choose some k > 0.

Wait, in this case, b=5 > a=4, so it makes sense to choose k=1, getting the higher price for one bun.

In another example, n=5, a=5, b=9.

Choosing k=5, getting 9+8+7+6+5=35, which is better than 5*5=25.

Another example, n=10, a=10, b=5.

Choosing k=0, getting 10*10=100, which is better than choosing any k>0.

So, it seems that when b > a, there might be some optimal k to choose, and when b <= a, it's better to choose k=0.

So, I need to find the optimal k when b > a, and set k=0 when b <= a.

Now, how to find the optimal k when b > a.

I need to maximize the total profit function:

P(k) = k/2 * (2b - k + 1) + a*(n - k)

I can consider this as a function of k, and find the value of k that maximizes P(k).

This is a quadratic function in terms of k.

Let's write it in terms of k:

P(k) = k*(2b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

= (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k

= (2b*k)/2 + (-k^2)/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

= b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

= (-1/2)*k^2 + (b + 1/2 - a)*k + a*n

This is a quadratic equation in terms of k: P(k) = A*k^2 + B*k + C, where:

A = -1/2

B = b + 0.5 - a

C = a*n

Since A is negative, the parabola opens downwards, so the maximum occurs at the vertex k = -B/(2*A)

Plugging in the values:

k = -(b + 0.5 - a)/(2*(-1/2)) = (a - b - 0.5)/(-1) = b + 0.5 - a

So, k = ceil(b + 0.5 - a)

Wait, but k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b).

Also, since k is integer, I need to consider the integer values around this point.

But perhaps it's easier to iterate and find the best k, but since n and b can be up to 1e9, iterating is not feasible.

Alternatively, since it's a quadratic function, I can compute the optimal k using the formula above and then ensure it's within the allowed range.

Wait, but in the earlier example, n=4, a=4, b=5, the optimal k=1.

According to the formula, k = b + 0.5 - a = 5 + 0.5 - 4 = 1.5

Then, rounding to the nearest integer, k=2, but in the example, k=1 gives a better profit.

Wait, let's compute P(k) for k=0,1,2,3,4.

P(0) = 0 + 4*4 = 16

P(1) = 1*(2*5 -1 +1)/2 + 4*(4-1) = 1*10/2 + 4*3 = 5 + 12 = 17

P(2) = 2*(10 -2 +1)/2 + 4*2 = 2*9/2 + 8 = 9 + 8 = 17

P(3) = 3*(10 -3 +1)/2 + 4*1 = 3*8/2 + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16

P(4) = 4*(10 -4 +1)/2 + 4*0 = 4*7/2 + 0 = 14 + 0 = 14

So, indeed, the maximum is P(1)=P(2)=17.

But according to the formula, k=1.5, which rounds to k=2, which also gives 17.

But in this case, k=1 also gives 17.

So, perhaps choosing k= floor(b + 0.5 - a) or ceil(b + 0.5 - a) both give the same profit.

But to be safe, I should choose the integer k closest to the vertex.

Alternatively, since it's a quadratic function, and A is negative, the maximum is at k = floor((2*B)/(2*A)) = floor((2*(b + 0.5 - a))/(2*(-0.5))) = floor((2*b +1 -2*a)/(-1)) = ceil(2*a - 2*b -1)

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe a better approach is to find the point where the marginal profit changes.

That is, find the smallest k where the price of the (k+1)-th bun in the promotion is less than a.

Because beyond that point, it's better to sell at the usual price a.

So, the modified price for the k-th bun is (b - k +1).

We need to find the largest k where (b - k +1) >= a.

So, b - k +1 >= a => k <= b +1 - a

Therefore, the optimal k is floor(b +1 - a)

Wait, in the earlier example, b=5, a=4, so k <= 5 +1 -4 =2

So, k <=2, which matches the optimal k=1 or 2.

Similarly, in another example, n=5, a=5, b=9.

k <=9 +1 -5=5, so k<=5, which matches the optimal k=5.

In the third example, n=10, a=10, b=5.

k <=5 +1 -10=-4, so k<=0, which means k=0.

This makes sense.

So, the optimal k is floor(b +1 - a), but it should be at least 0 and at most min(n, b).

So, k = min(n, b, b +1 - a), but since k >=0, we can write k = min(n, b, max(0, b +1 - a))

Wait, but b +1 - a could be negative, so we need to take max(0, b +1 - a)

Then, k = min(n, b, max(0, b +1 - a))

But in the earlier example, b=5, a=4, so b +1 -a=2, so k=min(4,5,2)=2, which gives P(2)=17.

But choosing k=1 also gives P(1)=17.

So, in cases where (b - k +1) >= a for k up to some value, any k in that range gives the same profit.

Wait, why is that?

Let me look at the profit function again.

P(k) = k/2 * (2b - k +1) + a*(n -k)

Let me compute P(k+1) - P(k):

= [ (k+1)/2 * (2b - (k+1) +1) + a*(n - (k+1)) ] - [ k/2 * (2b - k +1) + a*(n -k) ]

= [ (k+1)/2 * (2b - k) + a*(n - k -1) ] - [ k/2 * (2b - k +1) + a*(n -k) ]

= (k+1)/2 * (2b - k) - k/2 * (2b - k +1) + a*(n - k -1) - a*(n -k)

= (k+1)*(2b - k)/2 - k*(2b - k +1)/2 + a*(-1)

= [ (k+1)*(2b - k) - k*(2b - k +1) ] / 2 - a

Expand the numerator:

(k+1)*(2b - k) = 2b(k+1) - k(k+1) = 2bk +2b - k^2 -k

k*(2b - k +1) = 2bk - k^2 +k

So, difference is:

2bk +2b -k^2 -k - 2bk +k^2 -k = 2b -2k

Therefore, P(k+1) - P(k) = (2b - 2k)/2 - a = (b - k) - a

So, P(k+1) - P(k) = b - k - a

This tells us that P(k+1) > P(k) when b - k - a >0, i.e., k < b - a

P(k+1) = P(k) when b - k - a =0, i.e., k = b - a

P(k+1) < P(k) when k > b - a

Therefore, the profit increases as long as k < b - a, stays the same at k = b - a, and decreases afterward.

So, the optimal k is k = b - a, but only if b - a <= min(n, b), and k >=0.

Wait, b - a could be negative, so we need to set k = max(0, b - a)

Also, k cannot exceed min(n, b), so k = min(min(n, b), max(0, b - a))

But in the earlier example, b=5, a=4, so b - a=1, and min(n,b)=4, so k=1, which gives P(1)=17, but earlier P(2)=17 as well.

Wait, according to this, P(k+1) - P(k) = b - k - a

So, when k < b - a, P increases

When k = b - a, P(k+1) - P(k) = b - (b - a) - a = a - a =0, so P is equal.

When k > b - a, P decreases.

Therefore, any k from 0 to (b - a) gives the same P, and beyond that, P decreases.

So, in the first example, b - a=1, so k=0 to 1 give the same P=17, and higher k give lower P.

In the second example, b=9, a=5, b - a=4, so k from 0 to 4 give the same P, and k=5 gives lower P.

Wait, but in the second example, choosing k=5 gives P=35, which is higher than k=4.

Wait, let's compute P for k=4 and k=5.

P(4) =4*(2*9 -4 +1)/2 +5*(5-4)=4*13/2 +5*1=26 +5=31

P(5)=5*(18 -5 +1)/2 +5*(0)=5*14/2 +0=35+0=35

Wait, so P(5)>P(4), which contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, according to the formula P(k+1)-P(k)=b - k -a=9 - k -5=4 -k

So, for k=0, P(1)-P(0)=4

k=1, P(2)-P(1)=3

k=2, P(3)-P(2)=2

k=3, P(3)-P(2)=1

k=4, P(5)-P(4)=0

k=5, P(6)-P(5)=-1

Wait, but in this case, P(5)-P(4)=9 -5 -5=-1, which is less than 0.

But according to the calculation, P(5)=35 and P(4)=31, so P(5)-P(4)=4, which contradicts the formula.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me recalculate P(k+1)-P(k).

P(k+1)-P(k)= [ (k+1)/2 * (2b - (k+1) +1) + a*(n - (k+1)) ] - [ k/2 * (2b - k +1) + a*(n -k) ]

= [ (k+1)/2 * (2b - k) + a*(n - k -1) ] - [ k/2 * (2b - k +1) + a*(n -k) ]

= (k+1)/2 * (2b -k) - k/2 * (2b -k +1) + a*(n - k -1) - a*(n -k)

= (k+1)(2b -k)/2 - k(2b -k +1)/2 - a

= [ (k+1)(2b -k) - k(2b -k +1) ] / 2 - a

Expand (k+1)(2b -k) = 2b(k+1) - k(k+1) = 2bk +2b -k^2 -k

k(2b -k +1) = 2bk -k^2 +k

Difference: 2bk +2b -k^2 -k -2bk +k^2 -k = 2b -2k

So, P(k+1)-P(k)= (2b -2k)/2 -a = b -k -a

So, in the second example, b=9, a=5, so P(k+1)-P(k)=9 -k -5=4 -k

So, for k=0: P(1)-P(0)=4 >0

k=1: P(2)-P(1)=3 >0

k=2: P(3)-P(2)=2 >0

k=3: P(4)-P(3)=1 >0

k=4: P(5)-P(4)=0

k=5: P(6)-P(5)=-1 <0

But in reality, P(5)=35, P(4)=31, so P(5)-P(4)=4, which contradicts the formula.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated P(4).

Let me compute P(4):

P(4)=4/2 * (2*9 -4 +1) +5*(5-4)=2*(18 -4 +1)=2*15=30 +5*1=30+5=35

Wait, earlier I thought P(4)=31, but actually it's 35.

Similarly, P(5)=5/2*(18 -5 +1)=2.5*14=35 +0=35

So, P(5)=P(4)=35

So, P(5)-P(4)=0, which matches the formula for k=4: b -k -a=9 -4 -5=0

So, it was my miscalculation earlier.

So, in this case, k can be up to 5, and P is 35.

Similarly, in the first example, k can be up to 2 (since b -a=1), and P is 17 for k=1 and k=2.

So, in general, the optimal k is min(n, b, b -a)

Wait, in the first example, b -a=1, n=4, b=5, so k=min(4,5,1)=1

But in the second example, b -a=4, n=5, b=9, so k=min(5,9,4)=4

But in that case, P(4)=35, and P(5)=35, so k=4 or k=5.

Wait, but according to the formula, k should be min(n, b, b -a), which is 4, but k=5 also gives the same P.

So, perhaps k can be up to min(n, b, b -a + something)

Wait, perhaps k can be up to min(n, b, b -a, b -a + something)

Wait, maybe k can be up to min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

Wait, in the second example, b +1 -a=9+1-5=5, min(n,b,5)=5, so k=5.

But b -a=4, which is less than 5.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is k = min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

In the first example, floor(b +1 -a)=floor(5+1-4)=floor(2)=2

So, k= min(4,5,2)=2, which matches P(1)=P(2)=17

In the second example, floor(b +1 -a)=floor(9+1-5)=5, so k= min(5,9,5)=5, which gives P=35

In the third example, floor(b +1 -a)=floor(5+1-10)=-4, so k=0

So, this seems to work.

Therefore, the optimal k is min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a)), and set k to be at least 0.

So, k = max(0, min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a)))

Then, the total profit is sum of the first k modified prices plus the remaining (n -k) usual prices.

Sum of first k modified prices is k*(2b -k +1)/2

Sum of remaining (n -k) usual prices is a*(n -k)

Total profit is k*(2b -k +1)/2 + a*(n -k)

This is what we need to compute.

Now, in terms of implementation, since n, a, b can be up to 1e9, we need to handle large numbers, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.

Also, we need to handle multiple test cases, up to 1e4, so the code should be efficient.

Given that, the function provided seems to implement this logic.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

k = min(n, b - a)

if b <= a:

print(a * n)

else:

print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)

Wait, there is a potential issue here.

In the code, k is set to min(n, b - a), but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

But in the code, it's min(n, b -a), which is different from min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

In the first example, b -a=1, min(n=4, b=5, floor(b +1 -a)=2) should be 1, but according to the code, k=min(4,1)=1, which matches P(1)=17

In the second example, b -a=4, min(n=5, b=9, floor(b +1 -a)=5)=4, which matches P(4)=35, but in reality, k=5 also gives P=35, so it's suboptimal to choose k=4.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, P(5)=35, which is the same as P(4).

So, choosing k=4 or k=5 gives the same profit.

So, choosing k=4 is still optimal.

In the third example, b -a=5-10=-5, so k=0, which is correct.

So, perhaps choosing k=min(n, b -a) works, because when b -a >=0, k=min(n, b -a), and when b -a <0, k=0.

But in the second example, b -a=4, but floor(b +1 -a)=5, and min(n,b,floor(b +1 -a))=min(5,9,5)=5, which is better or equal to min(n,b -a)=min(5,4)=4.

But in that case, P(k=4)=35 and P(k=5)=35, so it's fine.

So, perhaps choosing k=min(n, b -a) is sufficient, as long as b > a.

And when b <= a, choose k=0.

In the code, it's implementing this: if b <=a, choose k=0, else k=min(n, b -a)

But in the second example, b -a=4, n=5, so k=4, which gives P=35, which is the same as k=5.

So, it's acceptable.

But is there a case where choosing k=min(n, b -a) gives less profit than choosing k=min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))?

Let me think of an example.

Suppose n=6, a=3, b=7

Then, b -a=4, floor(b +1 -a)=7+1-3=5

So, k=min(n,b,floor(b +1 -a))=min(6,7,5)=5

But in the code, k=min(n,b -a)=min(6,4)=4

Now, let's compute P(4) and P(5)

P(4)=4/2*(2*7 -4 +1)+3*(6-4)=2*(14 -4 +1)+3*2=2*11 +6=22+6=28

P(5)=5/2*(14 -5 +1)+3*(1)=5/2*10 +3=25 +3=28

So, again, P(4)=P(5)=28

So, choosing k=4 or k=5 gives the same profit.

Hence, choosing k=min(n, b -a) is sufficient, as it gives the same profit as choosing k=min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

Therefore, the code is correct.

Another example: n=3, a=2, b=4

b -a=2, floor(b +1 -a)=4+1-2=3

k=min(3,4,3)=3

But in the code, k=min(n,b -a)=min(3,2)=2

Now, P(2)=2/2*(8 -2 +1)+2*(1)=1*(7)+2=7+2=9

P(3)=3/2*(8 -3 +1)+2*(0)=1.5*6 +0=9+0=9

So, again, same profit.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Edge cases:

1. n=1, a=1, b=1

k=min(1,0)=0, since b -a=0

P(0)=1*1=1

P(1)=1/2*(2*1 -1 +1)+1*(0)=1/2*2 +0=1

So, same profit.

2. n=1, a=2, b=1

k=0

P(0)=2*1=2

P(1)=1/2*(2 -1 +1)+2*(0)=1/2*2 +0=1 <2, so choosing k=0 is better.

3. n=1000000000, a=1000000000, b=1000000000

k=min(10^9,0)=0

P(0)=10^9 *10^9=10^18

P(1)=10^9/2*(2*10^9 -1 +1)+10^9*(999999999)=10^9/2*2*10^9 +10^9*999999999=10^18 +9.99999999*10^17 <10^18, so choosing k=0 is better.

4. n=1000000000, a=1, b=1000000000

k=min(10^9,999999999)=999999999

P(999999999)=999999999/2*(2*10^9 -999999999 +1)+1*(1)=499999999.5*1000000002 +1≈5*10^16 +1

P(1000000000)=1000000000/2*(2*10^9 -1000000000 +1)+0=500000000*1000000001=5*10^17

Which is higher, so choosing k=1000000000 is better.

But according to the code, k=min(n,b -a)=min(10^9,999999999)=999999999, giving P≈5*10^16, which is less than P with k=1000000000.

Wait, this seems problematic.

Wait, let's compute P(k) for k=999999999 and k=1000000000.

P(999999999)=999999999*(2*10^9 -999999999 +1)/2 +1*1=999999999*(2000000000 -999999999 +1)/2 +1=999999999*1000000002/2 +1=999999999*500000001 +1

= approximately 5*10^16 +1

P(1000000000)=1000000000*(2*10^9 -1000000000 +1)/2 +0=1000000000*(2000000000 -1000000000 +1)/2=1000000000*1000000001/2=1000000000*500000000.5=5*10^17 +5*10^9

Which is higher than P(999999999)

So, in this case, choosing k=1000000000 is better than k=999999999

But according to the code, k=min(n,b -a)=min(10^9,999999999)=999999999, which gives P≈5*10^16, but P with k=1000000000 is higher.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, k should be min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

Here, b +1 -a=1000000000 +1 -1=1000000000, so k=min(10^9,10^9,10^9)=10^9

But in the code, k=min(n,b -a)=min(10^9,999999999)=999999999

So, the code is choosing k=999999999, which gives lower profit than k=1000000000.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct k should be k = min(n, b, floor(b +1 -a))

In this case, floor(b +1 -a)=b +1 -a=10^9 +1 -1=10^9, so k=min(10^9,10^9,10^9)=10^9

Which gives the higher profit.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize Bob's profit from selling his buns with a promotional pricing strategy. The key is to choose the optimal number of buns, \( k \), to sell at a modified price sequence, ensuring maximum revenue.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Promotion:** For the first \( k \) buns, the price of the \( i \)-th bun is \( b - i + 1 \) coins. The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price of \( a \) coins each.
2. **Profit Calculation:** The profit function is:
   \[
   P(k) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) \right) + a(n - k)
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   P(k) = \frac{k}{2} (2b - k + 1) + a(n - k)
   \]
3. **Optimal \( k \) Selection:** To maximize profit, select \( k \) such that the additional revenue from selling more buns at the modified price outweighs the revenue from selling them at the usual price.
4. **Conditions to Consider:**
   - If \( b \leq a \), it's better to sell all buns at the usual price (\( k = 0 \)).
   - If \( b > a \), compute the optimal \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \).

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            k = min(n, b - a)
            profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1)) // 2 + a * (n - k)
            print(profit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Input Handling:** Read the number of test cases and, for each test case, read the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
2. **Profit Calculation Based on Conditions:**
   - If \( b \leq a \), set \( k = 0 \) and compute profit as \( a \times n \).
   - If \( b > a \), set \( k = \min(n, b - a) \) and compute the profit using the formula:
     \[
     P(k) = \frac{k (2b - k + 1)}{2} + a(n - k)
     \]
3. **Output the Profit:** For each test case, print the computed profit.

This approach ensures that Bob maximizes his profit by optimally choosing how many buns to sell at the modified promotional prices.
