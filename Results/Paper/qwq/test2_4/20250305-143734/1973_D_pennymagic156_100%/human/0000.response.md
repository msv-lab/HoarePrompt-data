Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this hidden array `a` of length `n`, with each element between 1 and `n` inclusive. The goal is to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, where each subarray's `f(l, r)` equals `m`. Here, `f(l, r)` is defined as `(r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r)`. If no such `m` exists, I should output `-1`.

First, I need to understand what `f(l, r)` represents. It's the product of the subarray's length and its maximum value. So, for a subarray from index `l` to `r`, `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r)`.

The problem allows me to ask up to 2n queries per test case. Each query is of the form `? l x`, where `l` is the starting index, and `x` is a value. The response is the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`, or `n+1` if no such `r` exists.

My task is to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`. For `k=1`, it's straightforward; `m` would just be `f(1, n)`.

But for `k > 1`, I need to split the array into `k` parts, each satisfying `f(l, r) = m`, and I want the largest possible `m`.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need a way to find possible values of `m`. Since `m` is the product of a subarray's length and its maximum value, and given that `1 <= a_i <= n`, the maximum possible `m` would be `n * n` (for a subarray of length `n` with all elements `n`), and the minimum would be `1*1 = 1`.

But I need to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

This sounds like an optimization problem, where I need to maximize `m` under certain constraints.

I need to consider how to split the array into `k` subarrays, each satisfying the condition `f(l, r) = m`.

One way to think about this is to iterate over possible values of `m`, from the largest possible down to the smallest, and check for each `m` whether it's possible to split the array into exactly `k` subarrays where each subarray has `f(l, r) = m`.

But since `m` can be up to `n*n`, which is up to `10^8` for `n=10^4`, and with `t` up to `10^3`, this brute-force approach isn't feasible due to time constraints.

Moreover, I have a limited number of queries per test case (up to 2n), so I need an efficient way to find the largest possible `m`.

Let me consider binary search on `m`. Since I need the largest `m`, I can perform a binary search over the possible values of `m`, from 1 to `n*n`, and for each mid value, check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

But I need to ensure that the number of queries doesn't exceed the limit.

Given that `n` can be up to `10^4` and `t` up to `10^3`, a binary search over `m` might be too slow because each binary search iteration would require checking if `m` is achievable, which might involve multiple queries.

I need a smarter way to find `m`.

Looking back at the problem, I realize that for a fixed `m`, I need to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has `f(l, r) = m`.

Given that `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r)`, and this product equals `m`, I can think of `m` as being equal to `length * max_value`.

So, for a given `m`, I can iterate through the array and try to find subarrays where `length * max_value = m`.

But since the array is hidden, I can't iterate through it directly. I need to use queries to gather information about possible `r` for given `l` and `x`.

Wait, in each query, when I ask `? l x`, I get the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`, or `n+1` if no such `r` exists.

So, for a given `l` and `x`, I get the smallest `r` where `(r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r) = x`.

This seems useful for checking if a particular `m` is achievable for a subarray starting at `l`.

But I need to split the array into `k` such subarrays.

This sounds complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the maximum possible `m`. To maximize `m`, I need to maximize the product `(r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r)` for each subarray, while ensuring all subarrays have the same `m`.

Wait, but I need to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with the same `m`.

I need to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can think about the constraints on `m`.

Given that `m = (r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r)`, for a fixed `m`, the subarray's length and maximum value must satisfy this equation.

Given that `max(a_l to a_r)` is at least 1 and at most `n`, and `r - l + 1` is at least 1 and at most `n`, `m` can range from 1 to `n*n`.

But I need to find the largest `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

I need to maximize `m`, so I should start from the largest possible `m` and check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with that `m`.

But checking for each `m` whether it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m` seems too slow if done naively, given the constraints.

I need a way to efficiently find the largest `m` that allows such a split.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Find the maximum possible `m` for the entire array, which would be `f(1, n)`. This is the product of the array's length and the maximum value in the array.

2. Then, try to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

But this doesn't directly help, because `m` needs to be the same for all subarrays, and I need to maximize `m`.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that larger `m` values correspond to subarrays with larger lengths and/or larger maximum values.

But I need to ensure that the entire array is split into exactly `k` subarrays, each satisfying `f(l, r) = m`.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix `m`, and then try to split the array into as many subarrays as possible, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

Then, I can binary search on `m` to find the largest `m` such that the number of subarrays equals `k`.

But I need to make sure that I don't exceed the query limit.

Given that I have up to 2n queries per test case, and t up to 10^3, I need an efficient way to check for each `m` whether it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with that `m`.

Let me consider how to check for a given `m` whether it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

To do this, I can try to find the smallest possible `r` for each `l`, such that `f(l, r) = m`, using the query operation.

Then, I can attempt to split the array by greedily choosing the smallest possible `r` for each `l`, and see if I can do this `k` times to cover the entire array.

But I need to make sure that the sum of the lengths of these subarrays equals `n`, and that there are exactly `k` subarrays.

This seems feasible, but I need to make sure that the number of queries doesn't exceed 2n per test case.

Let me outline the steps:

- Perform a binary search on `m`, from 1 to n*n.

- For each candidate `m`, check if it's possible to split the array into exactly `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

- To check this, iterate from the start of the array, and for each starting index `l`, query the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`.

- If such an `r` exists, choose that subarray and move to the next `l = r + 1`.

- Count how many such subarrays I can form.

- If the count equals `k` and the entire array is covered, then `m` is achievable.

- If `m` is achievable, try a larger `m`; otherwise, try a smaller `m`.

This seems like a valid approach, but I need to ensure that the number of queries per `m` doesn't exceed the limit.

Since each check for a specific `m` requires up to `n` queries (one for each starting index `l`), and I can have up to log(n^2) = 2 log(n) iterations for binary search, the total number of queries could be up to 2n log(n), which for n=10^4 is too large.

But the problem allows up to 2n queries per test case, which is much less than 2n log(n).

So, I need a better way to check for each `m` whether it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`, using fewer queries.

I need to optimize this.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, I can find all possible subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m`.

But since the array is hidden, I need to use queries to find these subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to group possible `m` values or find a pattern in the array that allows me to determine the splits with fewer queries.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the maximum possible `m` without explicitly checking each possible `m`.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix `m`, and I want to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

Given that `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r) = m`, I can think of possible lengths and maximum values that satisfy this equation.

For a given `m`, possible lengths `len` and maximum values `max_val` must satisfy `len * max_val = m`, with `len` between 1 and `n`, and `max_val` between 1 and `n`.

So, for a fixed `m`, the possible pairs `(len, max_val)` are those where `len` divides `m` and `max_val = m / len`.

This means that for each possible length `len` that divides `m`, the maximum value in the subarray must be `m / len`.

This could be useful, but again, without knowing the array, it's hard to utilize directly.

I need to find a way to maximize `m` while ensuring that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each satisfying `f(l, r) = m`.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Find the maximum possible `m` for the entire array, which would be `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`.

2. Then, try to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

But this might not be possible, so I need to find the largest `m` that allows such a split.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible `m` values in a smart way, leveraging the query operation.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases `t`.

- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

- It sets `v` to 1.

- Then, it iterates from `n` down to 1, querying `? 1 i*n` and getting `v = func_2()`. If `v == n`, it sets `v = i` and breaks.

- Then, it iterates from 1 to `n//k + 1`, for each `i`:

- It initializes `cnt = k` and `l = 1`.

- While `cnt > 0` and `l < n + 1`:

- It queries `? l i*v` and gets `r = func_2() + 1`.

- Decrements `cnt`.

- If after this loop `cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`, it prints `! i*v` and reads the result.

- If no such `i*v` is found, it prints `! -1` and reads the result.

I need to understand what this code is trying to do.

First, it seems to find some value `v` by querying from index 1 with `x = i*n` for `i` from `n` down to 1.

It stops when the query returns `r = n`, and sets `v = i`.

Then, it tries `m = i*v` for `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, checking if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

But I'm not entirely sure about the logic behind setting `v` and choosing `m = i*v`.

This seems a bit convoluted.

Let me try to understand the initial part:

- It queries `? 1 i*n` for `i` from `n` down to 1, and gets `r`.

- When `r == n`, it sets `v = i` and breaks.

What does this achieve?

Well, `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, so querying `? 1 x` with `x = i*n` and getting `r = n` suggests that `f(1, n) = x = i*n`.

So, it's trying to find the `i` such that `f(1, n) = i*n`.

But `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, so `i = max(a1 to an)`.

Wait, no. Because `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, and `x = i*n`, so if `x = f(1, n)`, then `i = max(a1 to an)`.

But the code sets `v = i` when `r = n`.

So, `v = max(a1 to an)`.

Wait, but in the code, it's `v = i`, and `x = i*n`, so `x = i*n = f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, which implies `i = max(a1 to an)`.

So, `v = max(a1 to an)`.

Interesting.

Then, it iterates `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, and sets `m = i*v`, which is `m = i * max(a1 to an)`.

Then, it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

It does this by repeatedly querying `? l m` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`, and moves `l` to `r + 1`, decrementing `cnt` each time.

If after `k` such steps, `l` reaches `n + 1`, it means the array is fully covered by `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`, so it prints `! m`.

It does this for decreasing `m`, starting from smaller `i`, so larger `m`, and stops at the first achievable `m`.

Wait, but it iterates `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, so `m` increases as `i` increases, since `v` is fixed.

Wait, but I need the largest `m`, so I should be iterating `i` from higher to lower.

But in the code, it iterates `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, which is from lower to higher `m`.

So, it's trying `m` from smaller to larger values, and taking the first one that works.

But I need the largest `m`, so perhaps it should iterate `i` from higher to lower.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me think again.

Given that `m = i * v`, and `v = max(a1 to an)`, then `m = i * max(a1 to an)`.

But `m` should be equal to `(r - l + 1) * max(a_l to a_r)`, which for a subarray is length times maximum in that subarray.

So, for a subarray with maximum value `max(a_l to a_r)`, its `m` is `length * max(a_l to a_r)`.

Given that `v = max(a1 to an)`, and `m = i * v`, it seems arbitrary.

I'm not sure about this logic.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that for the entire array, `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, which is the maximum possible `m` for a single subarray.

If `k = 1`, then `m = f(1, n)`.

But for `k > 1`, I need to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

I need to maximize `m`, so I should try to make `m` as large as possible while still being able to split the array into `k` such subarrays.

One way to maximize `m` is to minimize the number of subarrays, but `k` is given.

Wait, no, `k` is fixed.

So, I need to split the array into exactly `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`, and maximize `m`.

This seems like I need to maximize `m` under the constraint that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

I need to find the largest `m` such that there exists a splitting of the array into `k` subarrays, each satisfying `f(l, r) = m`.

I need an efficient way to find this `m`.

Given the query limit, I need to minimize the number of queries.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, I can check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to find the subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` without querying too much.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and for each starting index `l`, find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`, and keep track of how many such subarrays I can form.

But since the array is hidden, I need to use queries to find `r` for each `l`.

Given that `n` can be up to `10^4` and `t` up to `10^3`, and I have up to `2n` queries per test case, I need to optimize this.

Perhaps I can perform a binary search on `m`, and for each candidate `m`, check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`, using no more than `2n` queries in total per test case.

But I'm not sure how to implement this efficiently.

Let me consider that for each `m`, I need to find if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

To do this, I can greedily select subarrays starting from the left.

For each starting index `l`, find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`, and then set `l = r + 1`, and repeat until the end.

If the number of such subarrays equals `k`, then it's achievable.

The problem is that for each `m`, this could take up to `n` queries, which is too much for the query limit.

I need a way to check for a range of `m` values with fewer queries.

Perhaps I can find a way to group possible `m` values or find a pattern in the array that allows me to determine the splits with fewer queries.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the maximum possible `m` directly without checking each possible `m` individually.

Let me consider that for the entire array, `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, which is the largest possible `m` for a single subarray.

If I can split the array into `k` subarrays with `m` as large as possible, it would be ideal.

But I need to ensure that each subarray has the same `m`.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the constraints on `m`.

Given that `m = length * max_value`, and I need to maximize `m`, I should aim for subarrays with larger lengths and larger maximum values.

But I need to balance this across `k` subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible `m` values in a smart way.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the number of subarrays that can be formed with `f(l, r) = m` is limited by the array's structure.

But again, without knowing the array, it's challenging.

Let me consider that for larger `m`, fewer subarrays can satisfy `f(l, r) = m`, and for smaller `m`, more subarrays can.

So, there is a decreasing function of achievable `m` values with respect to the number of subarrays.

Thus, I can perform a binary search on `m` to find the largest `m` where the number of subarrays equals `k`.

But I need to optimize the number of queries.

Let me consider that for each `m`, I can find the number of subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` by iteratively querying for each starting index `l`.

But this would take `n` queries per `m`, which is too slow.

I need a way to reduce the number of queries.

Perhaps I can find a way to query for multiple `l` values at once or find a pattern in the responses.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the minimal number of queries by reusing some queries across different `m` values.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` have specific properties based on `m`.

Given that `m = length * max_value`, for a fixed `m`, possible lengths and corresponding maximum values are pairs `(length, max_value)` where `length * max_value = m`, and `1 <= length <= n`, `1 <= max_value <= n`.

So, for each `m`, I can list all possible `(length, max_value)` pairs that satisfy this equation.

But again, without knowing the array, it's hard to proceed.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, I can iterate through the array and look for subarrays where `f(l, r) = m`.

But since the array is hidden, I need to use queries to find these subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to cover the array with subarrays of `f(l, r) = m` using the query operation efficiently.

But I'm still stuck on how to do this within the query limit.

Let me consider that for each starting index `l`, I can find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`, and then move to `l = r + 1`, and repeat until the end.

If I can perform this with a limited number of queries, it might work.

But with `n` up to `10^4` and `t` up to `10^3`, and only `2n` queries per test case, I need to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute some information about possible `m` values.

Let me consider that `m` must be a multiple of the maximum value in the subarray, and the length must be `m / max_value`.

Given that `max_value` is at least 1 and at most `n`, and `length` is at least 1 and at most `n`, `m` must be a multiple of some integer between 1 and `n`.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix `m`, and I want to split the array into `k` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = m`.

I can try to find the minimal number of such subarrays needed to cover the array, and see if it equals `k`.

If it's equal to `k`, then `m` is achievable; if it's less than `k`, I can try a larger `m`; if it's more than `k`, I need to try a smaller `m`.

This sounds like a binary search on `m`.

But again, performing this naively would exceed the query limit.

I need to find a way to perform this check with fewer queries.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the array can be split into subarrays where each subarray has `f(l, r) = m`.

I can try to iterate through the array, and for each starting index `l`, find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`, and then set `l = r + 1`, and repeat.

If I can do this with exactly `k` subarrays covering the entire array, then `m` is achievable.

But this would require `n` queries per `m`, which is too much.

I need to optimize this.

Perhaps I can find a way to group queries or find a pattern in the responses to reduce the number of queries.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to determine the largest achievable `m` without checking each possible `m` individually.

Let me consider that for the entire array, `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`, which is the maximum possible `m` for a single subarray.

If I set `m = f(1, n)`, then for `k = 1`, it's achievable.

For `k > 1`, I need to split the array into more subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

But it might not be possible, so I need to decrease `m`.

I need to find the largest `m` such that it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

This sounds like I need to maximize `m` under the constraint that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

I need to think of a way to maximize `m` efficiently.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the number of subarrays that can be formed with `f(l, r) = m` is limited by the array's structure.

If I can find a way to maximize `m` while ensuring that exactly `k` such subarrays cover the array, I can solve the problem.

But I need to find a way to do this within the query limit.

Let me consider that for each `m`, the number of subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` is limited, and I need exactly `k` of them.

I need to maximize `m` such that there are at least `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

But I need exactly `k` subarrays covering the entire array.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for larger `m`, fewer subarrays can satisfy `f(l, r) = m`, and for smaller `m`, more can.

So, there should be a decreasing function of `m` with respect to the number of achievable subarrays.

Thus, I can perform a binary search on `m` to find the largest `m` where the number of subarrays equals `k`.

But again, I need to optimize the number of queries.

Let me consider that for each `m`, I can check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m` using at most a certain number of queries.

Given that I have up to `2n` queries per test case, I need to make sure that the total number of queries across all `m` values doesn't exceed this limit.

Perhaps I can limit the number of `m` values I check.

Given that `m` can be from 1 to `n*n`, but `n` is up to `10^4`, `n*n` is up to `10^8`, which is too large for binary search.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the number of subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` is limited, and I need exactly `k` of them to cover the array.

But without more information about the array, I can't find a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through possible values of `m` in a specific order, starting from the largest possible `m` and decreasing, and check for each `m` if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`, stopping at the first achievable `m`.

But this would still require too many queries.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, I can find the minimal number of subarrays needed to cover the array with `f(l, r) = m`.

If this number is less than or equal to `k`, then `m` is achievable.

Otherwise, it's not.

Then, I can perform a binary search on `m` to find the largest `m` where the minimal number of subarrays is exactly `k`.

But again, performing this check for each `m` would require too many queries.

I need to find a way to maximize `m` without checking each possible `m` individually.

Let me consider that the largest possible `m` is `n * n`, and the smallest is 1.

I can perform a binary search on `m`, from `n * n` down to 1, and check for each `m` if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

But with `n` up to `10^4` and `t` up to `10^3`, this is not feasible due to query limits.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the number of subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` is limited, and I need exactly `k` of them.

Perhaps I can find a way to group possible `m` values or find a pattern in the array that allows me to determine the splits with fewer queries.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the maximum possible `m` directly by considering the array's properties.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a subarray to have `f(l, r) = m`, its length and maximum value must satisfy `length * max_value = m`.

Given that `max_value` is at least 1 and at most `n`, and `length` is at least 1 and at most `n`, `m` must be a multiple of some integer between 1 and `n`.

So, for each `m`, I can list all possible `(length, max_value)` pairs where `length * max_value = m`, and `1 <= length <= n`, `1 <= max_value <= n`.

Then, for each such pair, I can try to find subarrays that match this criterion.

But again, without knowing the array, it's challenging.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix `m`, and for each starting index `l`, I query the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = m`.

Then, I can greedily choose that subarray and move to the next `l = r + 1`, and repeat until the end.

If the number of such subarrays equals `k`, then `m` is achievable.

But this would require `n` queries per `m`, which is too much.

I need to optimize this.

Perhaps I can find a way to perform this check with fewer queries by reusing some queries across different `m` values.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` have specific properties, and I can find a way to group them.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to determine the largest possible `m` by considering the maximum values in the array and the lengths of subarrays.

But without knowing the array, this is difficult.

Let me consider that for the entire array, `f(1, n) = n * max(a1 to an)`.

If I set `m = f(1, n) / k`, but `m` needs to be an integer, and `f(l, r)` must equal `m` for each subarray.

But this might not be directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the sum of `m` over `k` subarrays must equal the sum of `f(l, r)` over the entire array, but that's not necessarily true.

Wait, no, `f(l, r)` is defined for individual subarrays, and I need each subarray to have `f(l, r) = m`.

So, the sum of `m` over `k` subarrays would be `k * m`, but I don't have information about the sum of `f(l, r)` over the entire array.

This seems unrelated.

Let me consider that for a fixed `m`, the number of subarrays that satisfy `f(l, r) = m` is limited, and I need exactly `k` of them.

I need to maximize `m`, so perhaps I can iterate `m` from high to low and take the first `m` that allows splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

But with the query limit, I need to optimize this.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to set `v = max(a1 to an)` by querying `f(1, n)`.

Then, it iterates `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, setting `m = i * v`, and checks if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`.

This seems like it's trying `m` values that are multiples of `v`, starting from `v` up to `(n//k + 1) * v`.

But I need to maximize `m`, so perhaps it's trying `m` from smaller to larger values, and taking the largest achievable `m`.

But in the code, it iterates `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, so `m` increases with `i`.

Thus, it's trying smaller `m` first and taking the first achievable `m`, which is not optimal for maximizing `m`.

I think this is a mistake.

I need to iterate `i` from higher to lower values so that `m` decreases, and take the smallest `m` that is achievable, but I need the largest `m`.

Wait, no, to maximize `m`, I should iterate `i` from higher to lower values, so `m` decreases, and take the highest `m` that is achievable.

But in the code, it's iterating `i` from 1 to `n//k + 1`, which is from lower to higher `m`.

This seems incorrect for maximizing `m`.

Perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

Let me consider that `v = max(a1 to an)`, and `m = i * v`.

So, `m` is a multiple of `v`.

But `m` should be maximized, so I should iterate `i` from higher to lower values, but within certain bounds.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that since `m = i * v`, and `v = max(a1 to an)`, then `m` can be thought of as `length * max_value`, where `max_value` is at most `v`.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose `n = 3`, `k = 2`, and the array is `[1, 2, 3]`.

Then, `v = 3`.

The code iterates `i` from 1 to `3//2 + 1 = 2`, so `i = 1` and `i = 2`.

For `i = 1`, `m = 1 * 3 = 3`.

It then tries to split the array into `k = 2` subarrays, each with `f(l, r) = 3`.

- Start with `l = 1`, query `? 1 3`, which would return the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = 3`.

- `f(1, 1) = 1 * 1 = 1 != 3`

- `f(1, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 != 3`

- `f(1, 3) = 3 * 3 = 9 != 3`

- So, no `r` exists for `l = 1`, so `r = n + 1 = 4`.

- Since `cnt = 2`, and `l = 4`, which is `n + 1`, but `cnt` is not 0, because only one subarray was considered.

- So, it doesn't satisfy `cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`.

- Move to `i = 2`, `m = 2 * 3 = 6`.

- Start with `l = 1`, query `? 1 6`.

- `f(1, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4 != 6`

- `f(1, 3) = 3 * 3 = 9 != 6`

- So, `r = n + 1 = 4`.

- Only one subarray, but `k = 2`, so doesn't satisfy.

- Thus, no `m` is achievable, so output `-1`.

But in reality, for this example, is there any `m` that allows splitting into `k = 2` subarrays with `f(l, r) = m`?

Let's see:
