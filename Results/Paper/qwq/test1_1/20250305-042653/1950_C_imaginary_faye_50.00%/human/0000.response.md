Alright, I've got this problem to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. The input is a string in the format "hh:mm", where hh is the hour from 00 to 23, and mm is the minutes from 00 to 59. I need to output the time in 12-hour format, like "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM", depending on the hour.

First, I need to understand the difference between 24-hour and 12-hour formats. In 24-hour format, the day is divided into 24 hours, from 00 to 23. In 12-hour format, the day is divided into two cycles of 12 hours each: AM (ante meridiem) for the first half and PM (post meridiem) for the second half.

So, for hours from 00 to 11 in 24-hour format, they correspond to 12-hour format's AM, and hours from 12 to 23 correspond to PM.

But there's a catch: in 12-hour format, the hours are numbered from 12 to 11, then back to 12 again. So, 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format, and 12:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 PM in 12-hour format.

Let me try to outline the steps I need to take:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read the time string s in "hh:mm" format.

b. Extract the hour part (hh) and the minutes part (mm).

c. Determine whether it's AM or PM based on the hour.

d. Convert the hour to the 12-hour format.

e. Print the converted time with the appropriate AM or PM.

Okay, let's think about how to handle the hour conversion.

- If the hour is 00, it should be 12:00 AM.

- If the hour is from 01 to 11, it should be the same hour with AM.

- If the hour is 12, it should be 12:00 PM.

- If the hour is from 13 to 23, it should be converted to hour - 12 with PM.

Wait, but in the example, "00:59" is "12:59 AM", and "12:00" is "12:00 PM". That makes sense.

So, to generalize:

- If hour is 00, print "12" followed by minutes and "AM".

- If hour is from 01 to 11, print the hour as is, followed by minutes and "AM".

- If hour is 12, print "12" followed by minutes and "PM".

- If hour is from 13 to 23, subtract 12 from the hour, print the result followed by minutes and "PM".

Also, need to make sure that the hour is always two digits, with leading zero if necessary.

Let me look at the code provided and see if it follows these rules.

The code is:

def func_1():

for t in range(int(input())):

s = input()

h = s[:2]

if h == '00':

print('12', end='')

elif int(h) <= 12:

print(h, end='')

else:

print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')

print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])

So, let's break this down.

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case, it reads the time string s.

3. Extracts the first two characters as the hour, h.

4. Checks if h is '00':

- If so, prints '12' without changing the minutes and appends 'AM'.

5. Else, if the integer value of h is less than or equal to 12:

- Prints h as is, then the minutes, and determines AM or PM based on whether h is less than 12 or not.

6. Else (h is greater than 12):

- Prints '0' followed by (h - 12), then the minutes, and 'PM'.

Wait, let's look closely at the condition when int(h) <= 12.

- For h from '01' to '12', it prints h as is.

- For h '00', it's handled separately to print '12'.

- For h greater than '12', it subtracts 12 from h and prints with 'PM'.

But there's a potential issue here.

Consider h = '12':

- According to the condition, int(h) <= 12, so it prints h as is, which is '12', and then appends 'PM' because int(h) >= 12.

That seems correct.

Consider h = '13':

- int(h) > 12, so it prints '0' followed by (13 - 12) = '01', and appends 'PM'.

So, '13:45' becomes '01:45 PM', which is correct.

Wait, but in 12-hour format, '13:45' should be '01:45 PM', which matches.

Similarly, '00:59' is handled as '12:59 AM', which is correct.

'12:00' is handled as int(h) <= 12, but since int(h) == 12, it prints '12' and appends 'PM' because int(h) >= 12. So, '12:00 PM', which is correct.

'23:59' becomes '11:59 PM', which is correct.

Seems like it's handling all cases properly.

But wait, let's check h = '00':

- It prints '12' followed by the minutes and 'AM', which is correct.

h = '01' to '11':

- Prints the hour as is, followed by minutes and 'AM', which is correct.

h = '12':

- Prints '12' followed by minutes and 'PM', which is correct.

h = '13' to '23':

- Prints '0' followed by (h - 12), followed by minutes and 'PM', which is correct.

I think this covers all possible cases.

Also, the problem states that the input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format, so no need to handle invalid inputs.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
