Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array `c` of length `n`, and each element is positive. Then, there are `q` queries, each asking whether a subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" based on the conditions provided.

First, I need to understand what makes an array "good." According to the problem, an array `a` of length `m` is good if there exists another integer array `b` of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in `a` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.

2. For every index `i`, `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.

3. All elements in `b` are positive integers.

So, for each query, I need to check if the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` meets these criteria.

Let me try to rephrase this in my own words. Given a subarray, I need to find another array of the same length and sum, where none of the elements match the original subarray's elements, and all elements are positive integers.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky. Let's think about what this really means.

First, since the sum of `a` and `b` must be equal, and `b` must have positive integers, and `b_i` cannot be equal to `a_i`, what does that imply?

Let's consider that for each element `a_i`, `b_i` must be a positive integer not equal to `a_i`. Additionally, the total sum must remain the same.

Wait a minute, if I have to change every `a_i` to some `b_i` that is different, but the sum remains the same, that seems impossible in general. Because if I change each `a_i` to something else, how can the sum stay the same unless some increases offset some decreases?

But the problem specifies that `b_i` must be positive, which is an additional constraint.

Let me try some small examples to get a better understanding.

Take `a = [1, 2, 3]`, so sum is 6.

Possible `b` could be [2, 1, 3], but that doesn't satisfy `a_i != b_i` for all `i` because the third element is the same.

Another try: [2, 3, 1]. Here, all elements are different, and the sum is still 6. So, this subarray is good.

Another example: `a = [1, 1]`, sum is 2.

Possible `b` could be [2, 0], but `b_i` must be positive, so 0 is invalid.

Alternatively, [3, -1], but -1 is invalid.

Wait, seems like it's impossible to find such a `b` for `a = [1, 1]`.

So, in this case, the subarray is not good.

Wait, but the problem states that all elements in `c` are positive integers, and `b_i` must be positive integers. So, `b_i` cannot be zero or negative.

So, for `a = [1, 1]`, is there any `b` where `b_i > 0`, `b_i != 1`, and sum is 2?

Let's see, possible `b` pairs:

- [2, 0]: 0 is not positive.

- [3, -1]: -1 is not positive.

- [4, -2]: same issue.

It seems impossible for `a = [1, 1]`.

Another example: `a = [1, 2]`, sum is 3.

Possible `b`: [2, 1], which satisfies all conditions.

So, seems like for subarrays of length 1, it might be impossible, because you can't change `a_i` to something else while keeping the sum the same.

Wait, for length 1, `a = [x]`, you need `b = [y]` where `y != x`, `y > 0`, and `y = x`. But `y` can't be equal to `x` and not equal to `x` at the same time. So, impossible. Hence, subarrays of length 1 are never good.

Wait, but what about `a = [1]`? Can `b` be [2]? But then sum is not equal. Or [0], but 0 is not positive. So, no.

Hence, subarrays of length 1 are never good.

Similarly, for subarrays of length 2, it depends. If the elements are different, perhaps it's possible.

Wait, in the sample input:

`1 2 1 4 5`

Queries:

`1 5`: YES

`4 4`: NO

`3 4`: YES

`1 3`: NO

So, subarray from 1 to 5 is good, from 4 to 4 is not, from 3 to 4 is good, and from 1 to 3 is not.

Looking back, from 1 to 5: [1,2,1,4,5], length 5, seems yes.

From 4 to 4: [4], length 1, no.

From 3 to 4: [1,4], length 2, yes.

From 1 to 3: [1,2,1], length 3, no.

Wait, why is [1,2,1] not good?

Let's see: sum is 4.

Possible `b` with sum 4, all positive integers, and none equal to original.

Try [2,1,1]: sum is 4, but third element is same as original.

[2,2,0]: 0 is not positive.

[3,0,1]: 0 is not positive.

[2,1,1]: already checked.

Seems like it's impossible. So, indeed, it's NO.

Another example: [1,2], sum 3.

Possible `b`: [2,1], which works.

But [1,1,1], sum 3.

Possible `b`: [2,1,0]: 0 invalid.

[3,-1,1]: -1 invalid.

Seems impossible, so NO.

Wait, but [1,2,1] is sum 4, and seems impossible.

So, it seems that for some subarrays longer than 2, it's still impossible.

Hmm, so length is not the only factor; the contents matter.

I need a general way to determine if a subarray is good.

Let me think about the conditions more carefully.

Given `a` and `b`, both arrays of length `m`, with:

1. `sum(a) = sum(b)`

2. `a_i != b_i` for all `i`

3. `b_i > 0` for all `i`

I need to find if such a `b` exists.

Let me consider that `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`.

So, for each `i`, `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`.

And the sum of all `b_i` should equal the sum of all `a_i`.

Let me denote `sum(a) = s`.

So, `sum(b) = s`, and for each `i`, `b_i != a_i`, `b_i > 0`.

I need to assign `b_i` such that all these conditions hold.

This seems similar to some assignment problem.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal possible sums for `b`.

Since `b_i > 0`, the minimal sum is `m`, when all `b_i = 1`.

The maximal sum is unbounded, since `b_i` can be arbitrarily large.

But in our case, `sum(b) = s`, which is fixed.

Also, `b_i` cannot equal `a_i`.

So, for each `i`, `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`.

I need to choose `b_i` in this manner such that the total sum is `s`.

Wait, but since `sum(b) = s`, and `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`, as long as the sum matches, it should be possible, right?

But earlier examples suggest that it's not always possible, even if the length is greater than 1.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Suppose I set `b_i = a_i + d_i`, where `d_i != 0` for all `i`, and `b_i > 0`.

But then `sum(b) = sum(a) + sum(d_i) = sum(a)`, so `sum(d_i) = 0`.

Also, `b_i > 0`, so `a_i + d_i > 0`, which implies `d_i > -a_i`.

Additionally, `d_i != 0`.

So, I need to find integers `d_i` not equal to zero, summing to zero, and `d_i > -a_i` for all `i`.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that for each `i`, `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`.

I need the sum to remain the same.

Perhaps I can try to change the elements in such a way that the changes cancel each other out.

For example, increase some elements and decrease others so that the total sum remains the same.

But since `b_i` must be positive, I have to be careful with decreases.

Wait, in the earlier example [1,2,1], sum is 4.

Possible `b`:

Suppose I set `b1 = 2`, `b2 = 1`, `b3 = 1`. Sum is 4, but `b3 = a3`, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, `b1 = 2`, `b2 = 2`, `b3 = 0`. But `b3 = 0` is invalid.

`b1 = 3`, `b2 = 1`, `b3 = 0`. Again, `b3 = 0` is invalid.

`b1 = 2`, `b2 = 3`, `b3 = -1`. Invalid.

Seems like no valid `b` exists for [1,2,1].

So, what's the general condition?

Let me consider the minimal possible sum for `b` where `b_i > 0` and `b_i != a_i`.

For each `i`, the minimal `b_i` is `1` if `a_i != 1`, otherwise `2`.

Wait, more precisely:

- If `a_i > 1`, then `b_i` can be `1`.

- If `a_i = 1`, then `b_i` must be at least `2`.

So, the minimal possible `b_i` is `1` if `a_i != 1`, else `2`.

Hence, the minimal possible sum for `b` is `sum(minimal b_i)`.

Similarly, there's no upper limit on `b_i`, as `b_i` can be arbitrarily large.

But since `sum(b) = sum(a)`, I need to ensure that `sum(a) >= sum(minimal b_i)`.

Moreover, the difference `sum(a) - sum(minimal b_i)` must be achievable by adjusting `b_i`'s while respecting the constraints.

Wait, perhaps that's the key.

Let me define `minimal_b_sum` as sum over `i` of `1` if `a_i != 1`, else `2`.

Then, for the subarray to be good, `sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum` is necessary.

But is it sufficient?

Wait, in the earlier example [1,2,1], sum is 4.

`minimal_b_sum` is 2 (for a1=1, b1>=2; a2=2, b2>=1; a3=1, b3>=2) → 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

But sum(a) = 4 < 5, so not sufficient, hence NOT GOOD.

In another example [1,2], sum=3.

`minimal_b_sum` = 2 (a1=1, b1>=2; a2=2, b2>=1) → 2 + 1 = 3.

sum(a) = 3 >= 3, so possible.

Similarly, [1,1], sum=2.

`minimal_b_sum` = 2 + 2 = 4.

sum(a) = 2 < 4, so NOT GOOD.

[2,2], sum=4.

`minimal_b_sum` = 1 + 1 = 2.

sum(a) = 4 >= 2, so possible.

Wait, but in this case, can I set b = [1,1]? sum is 2, which is less than sum(a)=4.

Wait, no, sum must be equal to sum(a).

So, in this case, I need sum(b) = 4, with b1 != 2, b2 != 2, and b1,b2 > 0.

Possible options:

b1=1, b2=3 (sum=4), both different from a_i.

Or b1=3, b2=1 (sum=4).

Both work.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Another example: [1,1,1], sum=3.

`minimal_b_sum` = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

sum(a)=3 < 6, so NOT GOOD.

Another example: [1,2,3], sum=6.

`minimal_b_sum` = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

sum(a)=6 >=4.

Is it possible?

Yes, for example, b=[2,1,3], sum=6, all b_i != a_i.

So, in this case, it's GOOD.

Wait, but in the earlier example [1,2,1], sum=4, `minimal_b_sum`=5, which is greater than sum(a), hence NOT GOOD.

Seems like a pattern.

So, general condition: sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum.

But wait, in the earlier example [2,2], sum(a)=4 >= minimal_b_sum=2, and it's possible.

Whereas [1,2,1], sum(a)=4 < minimal_b_sum=5, not possible.

Similarly, [1,2], sum=3 >= minimal_b_sum=3, possible.

[1,1], sum=2 < minimal_b_sum=4, not possible.

Seems like this condition holds.

But is this the only condition?

Wait, in the sample input, for subarray [1,2,1,4,5], sum=13.

`minimal_b_sum` =2 +1 +2 +1 +1=7.

sum(a)=13 >=7, so YES.

For [4], sum=4.

`minimal_b_sum`=2 (since a_i=4 !=1, so minimal b_i=1, but a_i != b_i, so b_i >=1 and !=4.

Wait, a_i=4, so b_i can be any positive integer except 4.

So, minimal b_i=1 (if 1 !=4, which it is, since 1 !=4.

Wait, a_i=4, b_i cannot be 4, but can be 1.

Hence, minimal b_i=1.

Similarly, for a_i=1, minimal b_i=2.

Wait, in this case, for a_i=4, minimal b_i=1.

Hence, `minimal_b_sum` for [4]=1.

sum(a)=4 >=1, so should be YES.

But in the sample input, it's NO.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.

Hmm, seems like I have a mistake here.

Wait, in the sample input, for [4], it's NO.

But according to my earlier logic, sum(a)=4 >= minimal_b_sum=1, so should be YES.

But it's NO.

So, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each `a_i`, `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`.

So, for `a_i = x`, `b_i` can be any positive integer except `x`.

Hence, the minimal `b_i` is `1` if `x !=1`, else `2`.

Wait, for `a_i =1`, `b_i` must be at least `2`.

For `a_i >1`, `b_i` can be `1`.

Hence, `minimal_b_sum` is sum over `i` of `1` if `a_i !=1`, else `2`.

In the sample input, for [4], `minimal_b_sum`=1, since a_i=4 !=1.

sum(a)=4 >=1, but it's NO.

So, what's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps there's an additional condition.

Suppose I have sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum, but I also need to ensure that the differences can be distributed in such a way that sum of differences is zero.

Wait, maybe it's not sufficient just to have sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum.

Perhaps there's an additional constraint based on the number of elements or something else.

Let me think about [4], sum=4.

`minimal_b_sum`=1.

But to achieve sum(b)=4 with b_i !=4 and b_i >0.

Possible options:

b=[1], but sum is 1 !=4. Doesn't work.

b=[2], sum=2 !=4.

b=[3], sum=3 !=4.

b=[4], but b_i cannot be 4. Invalid.

b=[1,1], but subarray is of length 1, so not allowed.

Wait, no, for subarray of length 1, b must also be of length 1.

Hence, no possible b for [4].

Hence, it's NO.

Similarly, for [1,2,1], sum=4, `minimal_b_sum`=5, which is greater, so NO.

Wait, no, earlier I thought `minimal_b_sum` for [1,2,1] is 2+1+2=5, which is greater than sum(a)=4, hence NO.

But in the sample input, for [1,2,1], it's NO.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, for [4], `minimal_b_sum`=1, sum(a)=4 >=1, but it's NO.

So, perhaps my condition is not sufficient.

Maybe there's an additional condition based on the number of elements.

Wait, perhaps for the subarray to be good, it must have length at least 2.

In the sample input:

- [1,2,1,4,5]: length 5, YES

- [4]: length 1, NO

- [1,4]: length 2, YES

- [1,2,1]: length 3, NO

So, perhaps subarrays of length 1 are always NO, and subarrays of length at least 2 are YES if sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum.

Wait, but in the earlier example [1,2,1], length 3, sum(a)=4 < minimal_b_sum=5, so NO.

And [1,2], length 2, sum(a)=3 >= minimal_b_sum=3, YES.

[1,1], length 2, sum(a)=2 < minimal_b_sum=4, NO.

[2,2], sum(a)=4 >= minimal_b_sum=2, YES.

Seems like length is not the deciding factor, but rather the relationship between sum(a) and minimal_b_sum.

But in the sample input, [4] has sum(a)=4 >= minimal_b_sum=1, but it's NO.

This suggests that there's another condition at play.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible to adjust the sums properly when the subarray has only one element.

Because for single elements, you can't adjust the sum by changing the element's value without changing the sum.

Wait, for a single element `a_i`, to have `b_i != a_i` and `b_i >0`, and sum(b) = sum(a), which is `b_i = a_i`.

But `b_i` cannot be equal to `a_i`. So, it's impossible.

Hence, all subarrays of length 1 are NO.

For subarrays of length greater than 1, it's possible if sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum.

Wait, but in the earlier example [1,2,1], length 3, sum(a)=4 < minimal_b_sum=5, which is NO.

And [1,2], length 2, sum(a)=3 >= minimal_b_sum=3, YES.

Seems like this holds.

Hence, the general condition is:

- If the subarray length is 1, it's always NO.

- If the subarray length >=2, and sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum, then YES; else NO.

Where `minimal_b_sum` is sum over `i` of 1 if `a_i !=1` else 2.

Wait, but in the sample input, [4] is length 1, sum(a)=4 >= minimal_b_sum=1, but it's NO.

So, even if length >=2 and sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum, it's not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps there's an additional condition related to the number of elements equal to 1.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray of length m.

I need to change each a_i to b_i != a_i, b_i >0, and sum(b) = sum(a).

I can think of it as adjusting each a_i to b_i, with b_i != a_i, and b_i >0.

The total sum must remain the same.

So, the adjustments must cancel out.

Let me define d_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, sum(d_i) = 0.

Also, b_i != a_i, so d_i !=0.

And b_i >0, so d_i > -a_i.

So, d_i >=1 if a_i != b_i, and d_i <= -1 if a_i != b_i.

Wait, more precisely, d_i can be any integer except 0, and d_i >= -a_i +1.

Because b_i = a_i + d_i >0, so d_i > -a_i.

But since d_i !=0, d_i >=1 or d_i <= -1.

So, for each i, d_i >=1 if a_i =1, else d_i >= -a_i +1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me consider that for each a_i, b_i can be any positive integer except a_i.

I need to choose b_i such that sum(b_i) = sum(a_i).

This is equivalent to choosing b_i != a_i, b_i >0, and sum(b_i) = sum(a_i).

I can think of it as assigning to each b_i a value different from a_i, and then ensuring the total sum remains the same.

One way to approach this is to minimize the sum of b_i, given the constraints, and check if sum(a_i) >= minimal possible sum of b_i.

As earlier, minimal_b_sum is sum over i of (1 if a_i !=1 else 2).

Then, if sum(a_i) >= minimal_b_sum, and some additional condition, it should be possible.

But in the sample input, for [4], sum(a)=4 >= minimal_b_sum=1, but it's NO.

So, perhaps for subarrays of length >=2, it's possible if sum(a_i) - minimal_b_sum >= number of a_i that are 1.

Wait, let's think about it.

In [1,2,1], sum(a)=4, minimal_b_sum=5, which is already greater, so not possible.

In [1,2], sum(a)=3, minimal_b_sum=3, which is equal, so possible.

In [2,2], sum(a)=4, minimal_b_sum=2, which is less, so possible.

In [1,1], sum(a)=2, minimal_b_sum=4, which is greater, so not possible.

In [4], sum(a)=4, minimal_b_sum=1, but it's NO.

So, perhaps for subarrays of length >=2, if sum(a_i) >= minimal_b_sum, it's possible.

But in the sample input, [4] is length 1, which is NO.

Hence, the general condition is:

- If length ==1, NO.

- If length >=2, and sum(a_i) >= minimal_b_sum, then YES; else NO.

In the sample input, [1,2,1,4,5]: length 5, sum=13, minimal_b_sum=2+1+2+1+1=7, 13>=7, YES.

[4]: length 1, NO.

[1,4]: length 2, sum=5, minimal_b_sum=2+1=3, 5>=3, YES.

[1,2,1]: length 3, sum=4, minimal_b_sum=2+1+2=5, 4<5, NO.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, the condition is:

- If length of subarray is 1, output NO.

- Else, compute minimal_b_sum as sum over i of (1 if a_i !=1 else 2).

- If sum(a_i) >= minimal_b_sum, output YES; else NO.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, given the constraints.

Constraints:

- t <=10^4

- for each test case, n,q <=3*10^5

- sum of n over all test cases <=3*10^5

- sum of q over all test cases <=3*10^5

Hence, overall time complexity should be O(n + q).

Now, for each test case, I need to process the array c of length n, and answer q queries.

Each query asks whether the subarray from l_i to r_i is good, based on the above condition.

To answer this efficiently, I need to precompute some prefix sums.

Specifically, I need to compute:

- prefix_sum: prefix sums of c

- prefix_minimal_b_sum: prefix sums of (1 if c_i !=1 else 2)

Then, for each query, I can compute sum(a) = prefix_sum[r_i] - prefix_sum[l_i-1]

And minimal_b_sum = prefix_minimal_b_sum[r_i] - prefix_minimal_b_sum[l_i-1]

Then, if r_i - l_i +1 ==1, output NO

Else if sum(a) >= minimal_b_sum, output YES

Else, output NO

This should be efficient enough, as it's O(n + q) per test case.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = [0]

c = [0]

(i, j) = (0, 0)

for x in l:

if x ==1:

j +=1

i +=x

p.append(i)

c.append(j)

else:

i +=x

p.append(i)

c.append(j)

for _ in range(m):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

i = c[b] - c[a-1]

s = p[b] - p[a-1]

if b - a +1 >1 and s - (b -a +1) >=i:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

So, it's reading t test cases, then for each test case, reading n and q, then the array l.

Then, it initializes p and c as lists with initial value 0.

Then, it iterates through l, and for each x in l:

- if x ==1, it increments j and i by x

- else, it only increments i by x

- then appends i and j to p and c respectively.

Wait, but j is only incremented when x==1.

So, p seems to be the prefix sum of l.

c seems to be the count of 1's in the prefix.

Wait, no, c is the count of x==1 up to that point.

Wait, but j is initialized to 0, and for each x==1, j +=1, and c appends j.

Hence, c is the prefix count of 1's in l.

Similarly, p is the prefix sum of l.

Then, for each query, it reads a and b (1-based indices).

Computes i = c[b] - c[a-1], which is the number of 1's in the subarray from a to b.

Computes s = p[b] - p[a-1], which is the sum of the subarray from a to b.

Then, it checks if (b - a +1 >1) and (s - (b -a +1) >=i):

If yes, prints YES; else, NO.

Wait, let's see what s - (b -a +1) represents.

s is the sum of the subarray.

(b -a +1) is the length of the subarray.

So, s - (b -a +1) is the sum minus the length.

Similarly, i is the number of 1's in the subarray.

So, the condition is:

if length >1 and (s - length) >= number of 1's:

YES

else:

NO

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the minimal_b_sum is sum over i of (1 if a_i !=1 else 2), which is equal to (sum(a_i) - number of a_i that are not 1) + 2 * number of a_i that are 1.

Wait, let's compute minimal_b_sum properly.

minimal_b_sum = sum over i of (1 if a_i !=1 else 2)

Which is equal to (number of a_i !=1) *1 + (number of a_i ==1) *2

Which is equal to (sum(a_i) - sum(a_i !=1)) + 2 * (number of a_i ==1)

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, no, it's simply count of a_i !=1 plus twice the count of a_i ==1.

Wait, but sum(a_i !=1) is not directly sum(a_i).

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me denote:

- k = number of a_i ==1

- m = length of subarray

Then, sum(a_i) = sum of all a_i

minimal_b_sum = (m - k) *1 + k *2 = m + k

Hence, minimal_b_sum = m + k

Then, the condition is sum(a_i) >= m + k

Which is sum(a_i) - m >=k

But sum(a_i) - m is equal to sum(a_i) - (number of elements), which is like the excess sum.

And k is the number of 1's.

So, the condition is sum(a_i) - m >= number of 1's.

Wait, in the code, it's checking s - (b -a +1) >=i, where i is the number of 1's.

Which matches sum(a_i) - length >= number of 1's.

Hence, it's implementing the correct condition.

So, the code is correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given subarray is "good" based on specific conditions. An array is considered good if there exists another array with the same sum, all elements are positive, none of the elements are equal to the original array's elements, and the array length is appropriate.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if a subarray from `l` to `r` is "good."
   - For the subarray to be good, it must satisfy:
     - The sum of the subarray should be equal to the sum of another array `b`.
     - All elements in `b` should be positive and not equal to the corresponding elements in the subarray.
   
2. **Key Observations:**
   - For subarrays of length 1, it's impossible to find such a `b` because changing the single element while keeping the sum the same isn't feasible.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, compute the minimal possible sum of `b`:
     - If the original element is not 1, the minimal `b_i` is 1.
     - If the original element is 1, the minimal `b_i` is 2.
   - The sum of the subarray should be greater than or equal to this minimal sum for the subarray to be considered good.

3. **Efficient Calculation:**
   - Use prefix sums to quickly compute the sum of any subarray.
   - Use prefix counts to count the number of 1's in any subarray.
   - For each query, check if the subarray length is greater than 1 and if the sum of the subarray minus the length is greater than or equal to the number of 1's in the subarray.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [0]
        c = [0]
        (i, j) = (0, 0)
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

```

### Explanation
- **Prefix Sum and Count:**
  - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array.
  - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1's in the array.
  
- **Query Processing:**
  - For each query, extract the subarray sum `s` and the number of 1's `i` in the subarray using the prefix sums and counts.
  - Check if the subarray length is greater than 1 and if `s - (subarray length)` is greater than or equal to the number of 1's.
  - Print 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise print 'NO'.

This approach ensures efficient handling of multiple queries and large input sizes by leveraging prefix sums and counts for quick computations.
