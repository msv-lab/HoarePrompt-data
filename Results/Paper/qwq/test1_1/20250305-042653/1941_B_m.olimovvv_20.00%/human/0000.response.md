Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (between 2 and n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to make all elements of the array zero.

First, I need to understand what this operation does. It seems like it's a way to reduce the values in the array, particularly targeting the center element among three consecutive elements. By performing this operation, we're effectively distributing a decrement of 4 across three elements: the center gets decremented by 2, and its neighbors each by 1, totaling a decrement of 4 per operation.

My task is to determine whether it's possible to apply this operation multiple times (possibly zero) to make the entire array zero.

Let's consider the constraints and properties of the array. The array has at least 3 elements, and the operations can be applied to any index between 2 and n-1, meaning the first and last elements have special treatment since they can only be affected by operations involving their neighboring elements.

I need to find a way to model this problem to check if it's possible to reach an array of all zeros.

One approach is to think of this as a system of linear equations. Each operation corresponds to subtracting specific amounts from certain elements, and I need to see if I can reach zero for all elements by combining these operations.

However, since the operations can be applied any number of times, and the array can be quite large (up to 2*10^5 elements), I need an efficient way to check this condition.

Let me think about the effects of the operations in terms of differences between consecutive elements.

Suppose I look at the differences between consecutive elements. Let's denote d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n-1, assuming a[0] is zero for indexing convenience.

Wait, maybe I should consider the array in terms of its prefix sums or something similar.

Actually, another way is to consider that each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4. So, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to reduce it to zero using these operations.

But that's not sufficient, because the operations have specific patterns in which elements they affect.

Let me try to simulate the operations on a small array to see what happens.

Take the first example:

n = 5

a = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]

Operation 1: choose i=4

a[3] = 5 - 1 = 4

a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3

a[5] = 2 - 1 = 1

So, new a = [1, 3, 4, 3, 1]

Operation 2: choose i=3

a[2] = 3 - 1 = 2

a[3] = 4 - 2 = 2

a[4] = 3 - 1 = 2

new a = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]

Operation 3: choose i=2

a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0

a[2] = 2 - 2 = 0

a[3] = 2 - 1 = 1

new a = [0, 0, 1, 2, 1]

Operation 4: choose i=4

a[3] = 1 - 1 = 0

a[4] = 2 - 2 = 0

a[5] = 1 - 1 = 0

new a = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

So, it's possible to make all elements zero in this case.

Now, let's see what condition makes this possible.

Looking at the operations, each operation reduces the sum by 4, as 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 4.

In this example, sum is 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 2 = 16, which is divisible by 4.

But is this the only condition?

Looking at the second example:

n = 5

a = [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]

Sum is 2 + 4 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 16, which is divisible by 4, but the answer is "NO".

So, there must be another condition besides the sum being divisible by 4.

Let me see what's different in this case.

Following similar operations:

Operation 1: choose i=4

a[3] = 4 - 1 = 3

a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3

a[5] = 1 - 1 = 0

new a = [2, 4, 3, 3, 0]

Operation 2: choose i=3

a[2] = 4 - 1 = 3

a[3] = 3 - 2 = 1

a[4] = 3 - 1 = 2

new a = [2, 3, 1, 2, 0]

Operation 3: choose i=2

a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1

a[2] = 3 - 2 = 1

a[3] = 1 - 1 = 0

new a = [1, 1, 0, 2, 0]

Operation 4: choose i=4

a[3] = 0 - 1 = -1 (but we can't have negative numbers, as the problem likely assumes non-negative integers)

Wait, but the problem states that a_j >= 0, and operations can't make them negative.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that after each operation, the elements remain non-negative.

In this case, choosing i=4 would make a[3] = 0 - 1 = -1, which is invalid.

So, maybe the sum being divisible by 4 isn't the only condition.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I consider the operations as a way to reduce the array step by step.

I need to find a sequence of operations that leads to all zeros.

Alternatively, I can think of starting from an array of zeros and applying the inverse operations to build up to the given array.

The inverse operation would be:

Choose an index i (2 <= i <= n-1)

Set:

a[i-1] += 1

a[i] += 2

a[i+1] += 1

This would allow me to build up the array from zeros.

But I need to see if the given array can be reached by applying such operations.

This seems similar to solving for the number of operations needed at each position.

But it's still not clear.

Another approach is to consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n, with a[0] = 0.

Then, the operation at index i would change d[i] by -1 and d[i+1] by -1, since:

a[i-1] -=1 => d[i] = (a[i] - (a[i-1] -1)) = d[i] +1

Wait, maybe I need to redefine d[i].

Actually, let's try to model the operations in terms of differences.

Initially, d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1].

After an operation at index i:

a[i-1] -=1 => d[i] = a[i] - (a[i-1] -1) = d[i] +1

a[i] -=2 => d[i+1] = a[i+1] - (a[i] -2) = d[i+1] +2

a[i+1] -=1 => d[i+1] = (a[i+1] -1) - (a[i] -2) = d[i+1] +1

Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Maybe differences aren't the best way to model this.

Let me consider the parity of the elements.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to check the parity of the first and last elements under certain conditions.

Specifically, it checks:

if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, it's checking if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first plus 2, or if the last element is odd and the second-to-last is not equal to the last plus 2.

If either of these conditions is true, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, 'YES'.

Is this correct?

Looking back at the examples:

First example:

a = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]

b[0] = 1 (odd), b[1] = 3, which is equal to 1 + 2 = 3. So, the condition b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 is False.

b[-1] = 2 (even), so the second part is not checked.

Hence, outputs 'YES', which matches the correct answer.

Second example:

a = [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]

b[0] = 2 (even), so first condition is False.

b[-1] = 1 (odd), b[-2] = 5, which is not equal to 1 + 2 = 3. So, condition is True, outputs 'NO', which matches.

Third example:

a = [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]

b[0] = 0 (even), so first condition False.

b[-1] = 1 (odd), b[-2] = 3, which is not equal to 1 + 2 = 3. Wait, 3 == 3, so condition is False, outputs 'YES', which matches.

Fourth example:

a = [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]

b[0] = 5 (odd), b[1] = 6, which is not equal to 5 + 2 = 7. So, condition is True, outputs 'NO', which matches.

Fifth example:

a = [1, 2, 7, 2]

b[0] = 1 (odd), b[1] = 2, which is not equal to 1 + 2 = 3. So, condition is True, outputs 'NO', which matches.

Sixth example:

a = [7, 1, 0]

b[0] = 7 (odd), b[1] = 1, which is not equal to 7 + 2 = 9. So, condition is True, outputs 'NO', which matches.

Seventh example:

a = [1, 1, 1, 1]

b[0] = 1 (odd), b[1] = 1, which is not equal to 1 + 2 = 3. So, condition is True, outputs 'NO', which matches.

So, in all the examples, this simple condition seems to work.

But is this condition sufficient in general?

Let me try to think of a case where this condition allows 'YES', but it's actually impossible to make all elements zero.

Or vice versa.

Consider n=3, a=[0,0,0]. Should output 'YES', and the program would output 'YES' since b[0]=0 (even), b[-1]=0 (even).

Good.

n=3, a=[1,1,1]. b[0]=1 (odd), b[1]=1 != 1+2=3, so 'NO'. Is this correct?

Let's see: can we make [1,1,1] zero?

Operation at i=2:

a[1] -=1 -> 0

a[2] -=2 -> -1 (invalid)

So, no, it's impossible. Correct.

Another test case: n=3, a=[2,4,2]

b[0]=2 (even), b[-1]=2 (even), so 'YES'.

Can we make it zero?

Operation at i=2:

a[1]=2-1=1

a[2]=4-2=2

a[3]=2-1=1

Now, array is [1,2,1]

Operation at i=2 again:

a[1]=1-1=0

a[2]=2-2=0

a[3]=1-1=0

Yes, it works. 'YES' is correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[0,2,2,0]

b[0]=0 (even), b[-1]=0 (even), so 'YES'.

Can we make it zero?

Operation at i=2:

a[1]=0-1=-1 (invalid)

Can't do that. So, it's impossible. But the program says 'YES'.

Wait, this is a problem.

So, for a=[0,2,2,0], the program outputs 'YES', but it's impossible because any operation at i=2 would try to set a[1]=-1, which is invalid.

Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the condition is not sufficient.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, it seems to work.

But as I just found, there's a case where it says 'YES' but it's actually impossible.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to check if it's possible to make all elements zero.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a system of equations.

Letâ€™s denote the number of times we apply the operation at position i as x[i] (for i from 2 to n-1).

Then, for each position j from 1 to n, the total decrement is:

- For j=1: decrement is x[2]

- For j=2: decrement is x[2] + 2*x[3] + x[4], and so on.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up equations for each a[j] - decrement[j] = 0.

But this seems too time-consuming for large n.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider the sum of the array.

Each operation reduces the sum by 4, as mentioned earlier.

So, the total sum must be divisible by 4.

But in the second example, the sum is 16, which is divisible by 4, but it's 'NO'.

So, there must be another constraint.

Looking back at the operation, it seems to affect three consecutive elements each time.

Maybe I can think in terms of prefixes or suffixes.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to process the array from left to right or right to left, keeping track of some invariant.

Let me try processing from left to right.

Start with a[1].

Since we can't apply any operation that affects a[1] except through operations at i=2.

Each operation at i=2 decreases a[1] by 1, a[2] by 2, and a[3] by 1.

Similarly, operations at higher i affect later elements.

So, perhaps I can iterate from left to right, deciding how many operations to apply at each i to make a[i] zero, and see if it's consistent.

Let me try this on the first example:

a = [1,3,5,5,2]

Start with a[1]=1.

To make a[1]=0, I need to apply some operations that decrease a[1] by 1.

The only operation that affects a[1] is at i=2, which decreases a[1] by 1.

So, apply x[2] operations at i=2, where x[2] >= 1 (since a[1]=1).

Now, a[1] is zero.

Move to a[2]=3.

Operations at i=2 decrease a[2] by 2, and operations at i=3 decrease a[2] by 1.

So, the total decrement on a[2] is 2*x[2] + x[3].

We need 2*x[2] + x[3] = 3.

Since x[2] >=1 (from earlier), let's set x[2]=1.

Then, 2*1 + x[3]=3 => x[3]=1.

Now, move to a[3]=5.

Operations at i=2 decrease a[3] by 1, operations at i=3 decrease a[3] by 2, and operations at i=4 decrease a[3] by 1.

So, decrement is x[2] + 2*x[3] + x[4] = 1 + 2*1 + x[4] = 3 + x[4].

We need 3 + x[4] =5 => x[4]=2.

Now, move to a[4]=5.

Operations at i=3 decrease a[4] by 1, operations at i=4 decrease a[4] by 2, and operations at i=5 decrease a[4] by 1.

So, decrement is x[3] + 2*x[4] + x[5] =1 + 2*2 + x[5]=5 + x[5].

We need 5 + x[5]=5 => x[5]=0.

Finally, a[5]=2.

Operations at i=4 decrease a[5] by 1, and operations at i=5 decrease a[5] by 1.

So, decrement is x[4] + x[5]=2 +0=2.

We need 2=2, which is satisfied.

So, all elements can be zero with x[2]=1, x[3]=1, x[4]=2, x[5]=0.

This matches the first example.

Now, let's try the second example:

a = [2,4,4,5,1]

Follow the same procedure.

a[1]=2, can only be decreased by operations at i=2.

So, x[2]=2.

Then, a[2]=4.

Decrement is 2*x[2] + x[3]=4 + x[3]=4 => x[3]=0.

Then, a[3]=4.

Decrement is x[2] + 2*x[3] + x[4]=2 +0 + x[4]=2 + x[4]=4 => x[4]=2.

a[4]=5.

Decrement is x[3] + 2*x[4] + x[5]=0 +4 + x[5]=4 + x[5]=5 => x[5]=1.

a[5]=1.

Decrement is x[4] + x[5]=2 +1=3.

But a[5]=1, so 1 -3 = -2, which is invalid.

Hence, it's impossible, which matches the 'NO' answer.

So, this seems to be a correct way to check.

I need to implement this check efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Implementing this step-by-step assignment of x[i] and checking for validity should work.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the provided program, it only checks the parity of the first and last elements under certain conditions.

Which seems too simplistic compared to the actual requirements.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to reduce an array of integers to all zeros by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and modifying the elements at positions \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Operation**:
    - Each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 4.
    - We need to ensure that the sum of the array is divisible by 4.
    - Additionally, we need to ensure that the operations can be applied in such a way that no element becomes negative during the process.

2. **Simulate the Operations**:
    - We iterate through the array from left to right, calculating the required number of operations for each position.
    - For each position, we calculate the number of operations needed based on the remaining value and the contributions from previous operations.

3. **Check Validity**:
    - If at any point, the required number of operations results in a negative value or an inconsistency, it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros.

### Solution Code
```python
def can_reduce_to_zero(n, a):
    # Initialize the array with zeros
    operations = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Process the first element
    operations[2] = a[0]
    a[0] -= operations[2]
    if a[0] != 0:
        return False
    
    # Process elements from the second to the second last
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        required = a[i] - (operations[i+1] + 2 * operations[i+2])
        if required < 0:
            return False
        operations[i+2] += required
        a[i] -= (operations[i+1] + 2 * operations[i+2])
        if a[i] != 0:
            return False
    
    # Process the last element
    required = a[-1] - (operations[n-1] + operations[n])
    if required < 0:
        return False
    operations[n] += required
    a[-1] -= (operations[n-1] + operations[n])
    if a[-1] != 0:
        return False
    
    return True

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        if can_reduce_to_zero(n, a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization and Processing**:
  - We initialize an array `operations` to keep track of the number of operations applied at each index.
  - We process the first element to determine the number of operations needed at index 2.
  - We iterate through the array, calculating the required operations for each position and updating the array values accordingly.
  
- **Validation**:
  - At each step, we check if the required operations lead to non-negative values and consistent reductions.
  - If any inconsistency or negative value is found, we conclude that it is impossible to reduce the array to all zeros.
  
- **Efficiency**:
  - The algorithm processes each test case in linear time relative to the size of the array, making it efficient for large inputs.
