Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stepan has to send n messages at specific moments, m1 to mn, and these moments are in increasing order. At the beginning, at moment 0, his phone has f units of charge, and it loses a units of charge per unit of time that it's on. Also, he can turn the phone off and on again, but each time he does that, it costs b units of charge.

The goal is to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below at any moment.

First, I need to understand the charge consumption. The phone loses charge over time while it's on, and there's an additional charge cost for each time he turns it off and then turns it on again.

So, between sending messages, if he keeps the phone on, the charge will decrease by a units per unit of time. Alternatively, he can turn the phone off during some intervals to save charge, but each time he does that, he has to pay the b units of charge for turning it off and on again.

I need to find a strategy for when to keep the phone on and when to turn it off to minimize charge consumption and ensure that the phone has enough charge to send all the messages.

Looking at the sample input and output, in the first test case:

1 3 1 5

3

So, n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, and m1=3.

If he keeps the phone on from moment 0 to 3, the charge will decrease by 1*3=3 units, so f becomes 0. But at moment 3, he needs to send a message, and if the charge is zero, it's not enough. So, he cannot send the message. Alternatively, if he turns the phone off and on at moment 3, it costs b=5, but f=3 < 5, so that's not possible either. Hence, "NO".

In the third test case:

5 10 1 2

1 2 3 4 5

Here, n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2, and messages are at moments 1,2,3,4,5.

One possible strategy is to turn the phone on just before each message and then turn it off after sending it, paying b=2 each time he turns it on again.

Let's see:

- At moment 0, f=10.

- Turn on at moment 1, cost b=2, f=8.

- Send message at moment 1, charge decreases by a*(1-0)=1, f=7.

- Turn off at moment 1.

- Turn on at moment 2, cost b=2, f=5.

- Send message at moment 2, charge decreases by a*(2-1)=1, f=4.

- Turn off at moment 2.

- Turn on at moment 3, cost b=2, f=2.

- Send message at moment 3, charge decreases by a*(3-2)=1, f=1.

- Turn off at moment 3.

- Turn on at moment 4, cost b=2, but f=1 < 2, so cannot turn on.

This strategy fails at moment 4.

But in the sample output, it's "YES", so there must be a better strategy.

Maybe keep the phone on from moment 1 to 5.

- At moment 0, f=10.

- Turn on at moment 0.

- At moment 1, send message, f = 10 - 1*1 = 9.

- At moment 2, send message, f = 9 - 1*1 = 8.

- At moment 3, send message, f = 8 - 1*1 = 7.

- At moment 4, send message, f = 7 - 1*1 = 6.

- At moment 5, send message, f = 6 - 1*1 = 5.

- So, f=5 >0, "YES".

This makes sense.

Another strategy is to turn the phone on only at moments when messages are due, but paying b each time.

But in this case, keeping it on all the time from moment 1 to 5 is more efficient in terms of charge.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input(''))

while t > 0:

(n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))

ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

if f > 0:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

t -= 1

So, the program reads the number of test cases, t, and for each test case, it reads n, f, a, b, and the list of message moments, ls.

It prepends 0 to ls, so ls is now [0, m1, m2, ..., mn].

Then, for each i from 1 to n:

f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)

After processing all intervals, if f > 0, it prints "YES", else "NO".

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

So, the logic seems to be that for each interval between two consecutive messages (or from moment 0 to the first message), it subtracts the minimum of either the charge lost while keeping the phone on during that interval or the charge lost by turning the phone off and on again.

In other words, for each interval, it chooses the cheaper option: either keep the phone on and lose a * (time difference) units of charge, or turn the phone off and on, losing b units of charge.

By choosing the minimum of these two for each interval, it tries to minimize the total charge loss.

At the end, if the remaining charge f is greater than 0, it means it's possible to send all messages; otherwise, it's not.

This seems logical.

Let me test it with the first sample input:

n=1, f=3, a=1, b=5, ls=[0,3]

For i=1:

f = 3 - min(1*(3-0), 5) = 3 - min(3,5) = 3-3 =0

Then, f=0, which is not greater than 0, so "NO", which matches the sample output.

Third sample input:

n=5, f=10, a=1, b=2, ls=[0,1,2,3,4,5]

For i=1: f=10 - min(1*(1-0),2)=10-1=9

For i=2: f=9 - min(1*(2-1),2)=9-1=8

For i=3: f=8 - min(1*(3-2),2)=8-1=7

For i=4: f=7 - min(1*(4-3),2)=7-1=6

For i=5: f=6 - min(1*(5-4),2)=6-1=5

f=5 >0, "YES", which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

1000000000

f=1000000000 - min(1000000000*(1000000000-0), 1000000000)

But 1000000000*(1000000000-0) is 1000000000*1000000000, which is 10^18, which is larger than f=1000000000, so min is 1000000000, so f=0, "NO", which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

3 11 9 6

6 8 10

ls=[0,6,8,10]

f=11 - min(9*(6-0),6)=11 - min(54,6)=11-6=5

f=5 - min(9*(8-6),6)=5 - min(18,6)=5-6=-1

Since f becomes -1, "NO", which matches the sample output.

Last sample input:

12 621526648 2585904 3566299

51789 61859 71998 73401 247675 298086 606959 663464 735972 806043 806459 919683

Need to check if the program can handle large numbers and large lists without integer overflow or other issues.

Given that the program uses standard Python integers, which can handle arbitrary sizes, it should be fine.

Also, the constraints say that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5, so it should be efficient enough.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]
