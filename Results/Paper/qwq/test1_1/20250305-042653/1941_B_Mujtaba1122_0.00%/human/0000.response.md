Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1), and then decrementing a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] by 1, 1, and 1 respectively, but a[i] is decremented by 2. The goal is to make all elements of the array zero using these operations. I need to determine whether it's possible to achieve that for each test case.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. So, for any index i between 1 and n-1, I can subtract 1 from a[i-1], subtract 2 from a[i], and subtract 1 from a[i+1]. This operation can be applied any number of times, and any index can be chosen zero or more times.

My task is to find out if, after applying these operations repeatedly, I can make all elements of the array zero.

Let me think about what this operation does. It seems like it's reducing the values in a specific pattern, affecting three consecutive elements each time.

I need a strategy to see if it's possible to reduce the entire array to zeros using these operations.

One way to approach this is to model the problem mathematically. Let's consider that each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific vector from the array. The vector would be [0, ..., 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, ..., 0], where the -1, -2, -1 are at positions i-1, i, i+1 respectively.

So, if I can find a combination of such operations that results in subtracting exactly the initial values of the array, then I can make all elements zero.

This sounds like solving a system of linear equations, where each operation is a equation, and I need to find non-negative integer solutions for the number of times each operation is applied.

However, solving a system of equations for each test case might be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5.

I need a more efficient way to check if it's possible to make all elements zero.

Let me look for patterns or invariants in the operations.

First, notice that the operation only affects positions i-1, i, and i+1, and the changes are -1, -2, -1 respectively.

I need to see how these operations can be chained or combined to affect the entire array.

Perhaps I can think of this operation as propagating changes through the array.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to process the array from one end to the other, applying operations in a systematic way.

Let me consider the constraints imposed by the operations.

Each operation reduces a[i] by 2, which is more than the reduction on its neighbors. So, a[i] needs to be at least 2 for the operation to be applicable.

Also, a[i-1] and a[i+1] need to be at least 1 for the operation to be applicable.

But in the while loop of func_2, it's checking if list[i] > 1 and list[i-1] > 0 and list[i+1] > 0, and then performing the operation.

Wait, but in the operation, it's subtracting 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1], but in the code, it's doing list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1], which seems incorrect.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1] would subtract list[i - 1] from itself, making it zero, which is not the intended operation.

I think there's a mistake in the code.

It should be list[i - 1] -= 1, list[i] -= 2, and list[i + 1] -= 1.

But in the code, it's list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1], which is equivalent to list[i - 1] -= list[i - 1], making it zero.

That can't be right.

Wait, maybe it's a typo in the code.

Let me check the problem statement again.

The operation is:

- a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1

- a_i = a_i - 2

- a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1

So, in code, it should be:

list[i - 1] -= 1

list[i] -= 2

list[i + 1] -= 1

But in the given program, it's:

list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]

list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]

This seems incorrect because it's using list[i - 1] as a multiplier, which doesn't match the problem description.

This suggests that the code is flawed.

But perhaps it's intended to apply the operation list[i - 1] times, which doesn't make sense either because list[i - 1] could be large, leading to negative values or incorrect updates.

I think the code is incorrect in how it applies the operation.

It should simply subtract 1 from a[i-1], 2 from a[i], and 1 from a[i+1], not multiplied by list[i - 1].

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
