Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers. For example, if n is 12, the original numbers are 1 to 12, and after replacing each with the sum of its digits, they become 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3, and their sum is 51.

First, I need to understand what the problem is really asking. It's clear that for each number from 1 to n, I have to calculate the sum of its digits and then add all those sums together. So, the task is to compute the total sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, efficiency is key here. If I were to naively iterate through each number for each test case, calculating the digit sum every time, it would be too slow because the time limit is only 0.5 seconds per test. That's way too tight for such a nested loop approach.

So, I need a smarter way to handle this. One efficient method is to precompute the cumulative sums of digit sums up to the maximum possible n, which is 2*10^5. That way, for each test case, I can just retrieve the precomputed sum for that n instantly.

Let me think about how to implement this. I can create an array where the i-th element contains the cumulative sum of digit sums from 1 to i. Then, for each test case, I can simply output the value at index n-1 in this array (since indices start at 0).

To compute the digit sum of a number, I can define a function that takes a number and returns the sum of its digits. This function will repeatedly take the last digit using modulo 10, add it to a total, and then remove the last digit by integer division by 10, until the number is zero.

Once I have this digit sum function, I can iterate from 1 to 2*10^5, compute the digit sum for each number, add it to the cumulative sum, and store this cumulative sum in the array.

Given that 2*10^5 is 200,000, and with 10^4 test cases, precomputing the cumulative sums should be efficient enough to fit within the time constraints.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems to follow this approach. Let's analyze it step by step.

The program starts by initializing an empty list A and a variable sum to 0. Then, it loops from 1 to 200,000 (inclusive), calculates the digit sum of each number using the function func_1, adds it to the cumulative sum, and appends this cumulative sum to the list A.

After that, it reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads n and prints A[n-1], which should be the cumulative sum up to n.

The function func_1 takes a number num, initializes a variable a to 0, and then in a loop, adds the last digit of num to a and removes the last digit by integer division by 10, until num becomes 0. Finally, it returns a, which is the sum of the digits of num.

This seems correct. But I need to make sure that there are no off-by-one errors or issues with the indexing.

Given that the list A is zero-indexed, and n ranges from 1 to 2*10^5, A[n-1] should correctly correspond to the cumulative sum up to n.

Also, the precomputation is done from 1 to 200,000, which covers the maximum possible n.

Let me check the example given in the problem to verify.

For n=12, the cumulative sum should be 51, as shown in the example. Let's see if the program would output that.

The list A would have A[11] corresponding to n=12, which should be the sum of digit sums from 1 to 12, which is 51, as per the example.

Seems correct.

Another thing to consider is the efficiency. Precomputing up to 2*10^5 is feasible, as it's only 200,000 iterations, and handling 10^4 test cases is just array lookups, which are O(1).

Given that, the program should run well within the 0.5-second time limit.

Are there any potential issues with this approach?

One thing to consider is the data types. Since n can be up to 2*10^5, and the sum of digit sums can be large, but in Python, integers can handle arbitrary sizes, so no problem there.

Another thing is that the problem allows multiple test cases, and the program reads t followed by t integers n. The program seems to handle that correctly.

Also, the function func_1 is correctly calculating the sum of digits.

I don't see any flaws in this approach.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**
