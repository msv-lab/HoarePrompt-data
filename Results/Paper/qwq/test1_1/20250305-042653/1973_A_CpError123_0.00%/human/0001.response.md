Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are three friends playing chess together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario is impossible.

First, I need to understand the scoring system. Each game can result in either a win or a draw. In a win, the winner gets 2 points, and the loser gets 0. In a draw, both players get 1 point each. So, for each game played, the total points distributed are either 2 (in case of a win) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, that's interesting. Regardless of whether it's a win or a draw, each game always adds 2 points to the total points pool.

So, if there are G games played in total, the total points should be 2G. Because each game contributes 2 points to the total, regardless of the outcome.

Given that p1 + p2 + p3 = total points = 2G.

Therefore, the sum of their scores must be even; otherwise, it's impossible, and I should return -1.

So, first check: if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0, then return -1.

Next, I need to find the maximum number of draws. Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, just like a win, but in a draw, both players get 1 point each.

To maximize the number of draws, I need to maximize the number of games that ended in a draw.

But there are constraints based on their individual scores.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, I need to ensure that the distribution of points is possible given the rules.

Let me think about how points are allocated.

Let's denote:

- W: number of games that ended in a win.

- D: number of games that ended in a draw.

Total games: G = W + D.

Total points: 2G = 2W + 2D.

But in terms of individual scores, it's more complex.

Each win increases the winner's score by 2, and the loser's score by 0.

Each draw increases both players' scores by 1.

I need to maximize D, the number of draws.

But I have to ensure that the individual scores p1, p2, p3 can be achieved with some combination of wins and draws.

Let me consider the maximum possible D.

If all games are draws, then each game would contribute 2 points to the total, and the points would be distributed such that each draw increases two players' scores by 1 each.

But since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and draws involve two players, I need to make sure that the highest scorer isn't too high to be achievable.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total points and the individual maximum scores.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example:

0 0 0

Here, no games were played, so D = 0.

Second example:

0 1 1

This could be achieved by one draw between player 2 and player 3, both getting 1 point each, and player 1 getting 0.

So D = 1.

Third example:

0 2 3

Wait, in the provided program, it's (0,2,3), but in the problem statement, it's (1,1,10). Wait, maybe the test cases are different in the program and the problem statement. I need to make sure I'm looking at the right ones.

Wait, in the problem statement, the test cases are:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

And the output is:

0

1

-1

2

-1

6

2

Okay, so in the program, it's using cas_de_test = [(0,0,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,3), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10), (0,0,6)]

Wait, but in the problem statement, the third test case is 1 1 1, not 0 2 3. So there might be a discrepancy here.

I need to make sure I'm analyzing the correct test cases.

Assuming that the program's cas_de_test is correct, then it's using (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,3), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10), (0,0,6).

But in the problem statement, it's (0,0,0), (0,1,1), (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10).

So there is a difference. I need to consider the program's test cases.

But for the purpose of verifying the program's correctness, I need to consider the logic based on the problem's constraints.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and all are integers between 0 and 30, inclusive.

First, total_points = p1 + p2 + p3 must be even, as each game contributes 2 points to the total.

If total_points is odd, it's impossible, return -1.

Next, the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible end in draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total (1 for each of the two players involved).

Each win also contributes 2 points to the total (2 for the winner and 0 for the loser).

So, the total number of games G = total_points / 2.

Now, to maximize draws, we need to maximize D, the number of draws, which is equal to the number of games that ended in a draw.

But we have to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved.

Let me think about the constraints on individual scores.

Each player's score can be expressed in terms of the number of wins and draws they were involved in.

Let me denote for each player:

- w_i: number of wins for player i.

- d_i: number of draws for player i.

Then, player i's score is: p_i = 2 * w_i + d_i.

Also, the total number of wins and draws should match the total number of games.

But since each win involves one winner and one loser, and each draw involves two players, we have to account for that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total number of wins and draws.

Let me denote:

- W: total number of wins.

- D: total number of draws.

Then, G = W + D.

Total points: 2G = 2W + 2D.

But from the individual scores:

p1 = 2 * w1 + d1

p2 = 2 * w2 + d2

p3 = 2 * w3 + d3

And the total points: p1 + p2 + p3 = 2W + D1 + D2 + D3.

Wait, but each draw involves two players, so D = d1/2 + d2/2 + d3/2.

Wait, no. Each draw involves two players, so for each draw, two players each get 1 point, meaning d1, d2, d3 count the number of draws each player was involved in.

But since each draw involves two players, the sum d1 + d2 + d3 = 2D.

Because each draw is counted twice.

Similarly, the total points are:

p1 + p2 + p3 = 2(w1 + w2 + w3) + (d1 + d2 + d3) = 2W + 2D = 2G.

Which matches.

Now, to maximize D, we need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of wins.

But we have to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with some combination of wins and draws.

Let me consider the minimal number of wins required to achieve the scores.

Since each win contributes 2 points to one player, and 0 to the other, while each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved.

I need to ensure that the difference in scores can be achieved through some combination of wins and draws.

Let me consider the highest scorer, p3.

Since p3 is the highest score, it's at least as much as p2 and p1.

To maximize draws, I need to see how many draws can be involved with p3.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the total points and the individual maximum scores.

Let me consider that the sum of points is 2G, and I need to distribute the points such that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

I need to find if there exists a combination of W wins and D draws such that the points are achievable.

Moreover, I need to maximize D.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from D = G down to D = 0, and check if for each D, the points can be achieved.

But that might not be efficient.

Let me see if there's a better way.

Looking at the program provided:

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):

resultats = []

for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:

total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

if total_points % 2 != 0:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

total_matchs = total_points // 2

if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

if egalites < 0:

resultats.append(-1)

else:

resultats.append(egalites // 2)

return resultats

So, the program first checks if the total points is even. If not, return -1.

Then, it calculates total_matchs = total_points // 2.

Then, it checks if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, return -1.

Then, it calculates egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1).

If egalites < 0, return -1, else return egalites // 2.

Wait, this seems a bit arbitrary. Where do these calculations come from?

Let me try to understand.

First, total_matchs = total_points // 2 is correct, as each match contributes 2 points.

But why check if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs?

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times, possibly zero, and it's also possible that no games were played at all.

There's no mention of a maximum number of matches being 3.

Perhaps this is a mistake in the program.

Looking back at the example, in the third test case, (1,1,1), it returns -1.

But according to the program, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=1:

total_points = 3, which is odd, so return -1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's (1,1,1), and the output is -1, which matches.

But in the program's test cases, it's (0,2,3), which is different.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion between the problem statement's test cases and the program's test cases.

Looking back, the problem statement has test cases:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

1 1 1

1 1 2

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

And the program has:

cas_de_test = [(0,0,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,3), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10), (0,0,6)]

So, the third test case in the problem statement is (1,1,1), which corresponds to -1, and in the program, it's (0,2,3), which is different.

Wait, perhaps the program has a different set of test cases than the problem statement.

But for verifying the program's correctness, I need to consider the logic based on the problem's constraints, not necessarily the test cases provided in the program.

Let's focus on the logic.

So, the program checks:

1. If total_points is odd, return -1.

2. If total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, return -1.

3. Otherwise, calculate egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1).

4. If egalites < 0, return -1, else return egalites // 2.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, checking if total_points is even is correct.

Second, checking if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:

Wait, why is there a check for total_matchs > 3?

In the problem statement, there's no mention of a maximum number of matches being 3.

Perhaps this is a mistake in the program.

Looking back at the example, in the third test case, (1,1,1), which is impossible because total_points = 3, which is odd, so return -1.

In the fourth test case, (1,1,2), output is 2.

Let me see.

Total points = 1+1+2=4, which is even.

Total matches = 4 // 2 = 2.

Now, according to the program, if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, return -1.

Here, total_matchs = 2, p3 = 2.

So, 2 > 3 is False, and p3 = 2 <= total_matchs = 2, so proceed.

Then, egalites = 4 - 2*(2-1) - 2*(2-1) = 4 - 2*1 - 2*1 = 4 - 2 - 2 = 0.

0 < 0 is False, so return 0 // 2 = 0.

But in the example, for (1,1,2), the output is 2.

Wait, that's a discrepancy.

So, the program would return 0 for (1,1,2), but the expected output is 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for (1,1,2), the output is 2.

But according to the program's logic, it would return 0.

So, there's an error in the program's logic.

Hence, Correctness: False.

But let's see if there's any way to fix the program.

Alternatively, perhaps I misread the example.

Wait, in the problem statement's example, for (1,1,2), the output is 2.

But according to the program's logic, it calculates egalites = 0, and returns 0.

So, it's incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
