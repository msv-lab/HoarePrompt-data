Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are three friends playing chess together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario isn't possible.

First, I need to understand the scoring system. Each game can result in either a win or a draw. In a win, the total points awarded are 2 (winner gets 2, loser gets 0). In a draw, both players get 1 point, so total points awarded are 2 again. So, regardless of the outcome, each game contributes 2 points to the total points pool.

Given that, the total points scored by all three players should be equal to 2 times the number of games played. So, p1 + p2 + p3 should be even, because it's twice the number of games. If it's odd, that's impossible, and the answer should be -1.

Also, since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, the highest score p3 should be at least the sum of p1 and p2, but I need to think about that carefully.

Wait, no. Actually, p3 can't be more than the total points possible from the games they played. But I need to think about how the points are distributed.

Let me consider the number of games played. Let’s denote the number of games played as g. Then, total points is 2g, since each game awards 2 points.

Given that, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g.

Since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 ≤ 2g - p1 - p2. But I need to find a way to maximize the number of draws.

Let me think about how draws affect the points. Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, just like a win. But in a draw, both players get 1 point each.

To maximize the number of draws, I need to maximize the number of games that ended in a draw, while still achieving the given scores p1, p2, p3.

Let me denote the number of draws as d, and the number of wins as w. Then, d + w = g, and 2d + 2w = p1 + p2 + p3.

Wait, but 2d + 2w = 2g, which is equal to p1 + p2 + p3. So that checks out.

But I need to consider how the points are distributed among the players.

Let me think about the possible ways the players can earn points.

Each player's score comes from the games they played. Each player plays against each other player in some number of games.

There are three pairs of players: let's call them player A, B, and C. So the pairs are AB, AC, and BC.

Let’s denote the number of games played between AB as g_ab, between AC as g_ac, and between BC as g_bc.

Then, the total number of games is g = g_ab + g_ac + g_bc.

Each of these games can be a win or a draw.

Let’s denote the number of draws in AB games as d_ab, in AC games as d_ac, and in BC games as d_bc.

Then, the number of wins in AB games is g_ab - d_ab, in AC games is g_ac - d_ac, and in BC games is g_bc - d_bc.

The points earned by each player can be calculated as follows:

- Player A: points from AB games: d_ab * 1 + (g_ab - d_ab) * 2 (if A won) or 0 (if A lost)

Wait, but I don't know who won in the win cases. This seems complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let’s consider the total points and try to find constraints based on p1, p2, p3.

First, as I said, p1 + p2 + p3 must be even, since each game contributes 2 points.

If p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, it's impossible, and the answer is -1.

Also, since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 must be at least as large as p2 and p1.

But I need to think about the maximum possible p3.

In the extreme case, one player could have won all their games against the other two players.

Wait, but it's not that simple because draws are possible.

Let me think about the maximum possible p3.

Player C (p3) could have played only against A and B.

The maximum p3 can be is 2 * (g_ac + g_bc), if player C wins all those games.

But since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and p1 and p2 could have points from their games against each other and against C.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for necessary conditions that the scores must satisfy, and then find a way to maximize the draws.

First necessary condition: p1 + p2 + p3 is even.

Second: since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, p3 must be at least as large as p2 and p1.

But I need to ensure that the scores can be achieved through some combination of wins and draws in the games.

Let me look at some examples from the problem.

First example: 0 0 0.

No games were played, so no draws. Answer is 0.

Second: 0 1 1.

This is achievable with one draw between players 2 and 3, giving each 1 point, and player 1 has 0 points. So, one draw. Answer is 1.

Third: 0 2 3.

Wait, this is not in the example, but in the code as test case 3.

Fourth: 3 3 3.

This is not possible, as the total points are 9, which is odd, so -1.

Wait, no, 3+3+3=9, which is odd, so it's impossible. Answer is -1.

Fifth: 3 4 5.

Total points is 12, which is even.

Is this possible?

Sixth: 1 1 10.

Total points is 12, which is even.

Is this possible?

Seventh: 0 0 6.

Total points is 6, which is even.

Is this possible?

Looking at the code provided:

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):

resultats = []

for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:

total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

if total_points % 2 != 0:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

total_matchs = total_points // 2

if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)

if egalites < 0:

resultats.append(-1)

else:

resultats.append(egalites // 2)

return resultats

Wait, but in the problem statement, t=7 and cas_de_test are provided.

But in the code, t=7 and cas_de_test is a list of tuples.

But in the actual problem, t is given, and then t lines follow with p1, p2, p3.

But in the code, it's hardcoded.

Anyway, focusing on the function.

It first checks if total_points is even. If not, -1.

Then, total_matchs = total_points // 2.

Then, if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, -1.

Wait, why total_matchs > 3? Where did 3 come from? In the problem statement, it says "it is possible that no games were played at all. It is also possible that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero)."

So, there's no restriction on the number of games played, other than it being non-negative.

So, why is there a condition total_matchs > 3?

That seems off.

Maybe it's a mistake in the code.

Then, it calculates egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1).

Wait, that's unclear.

Let me try to derive a formula for the maximum number of draws.

Let’s denote d as the total number of draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total points (1 for each player).

Each win contributes 2 points to the total points (2 for the winner, 0 for the loser).

So, total points = 2 * (number of games).

Let’s denote g as the total number of games.

So, p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g.

Our goal is to maximize d, the number of draws.

To maximize d, we need to minimize the number of wins.

Each win contributes 2 points to the winner and 0 to the loser, while each draw contributes 1 point to each player.

Given the scores p1, p2, p3, we need to see how to distribute the wins and draws to achieve these scores.

Let me consider that.

Let’s denote:

For each player, their score comes from the draws they participated in and the wins they had.

Wait, more precisely:

Each draw increases a player's score by 1.

Each win increases a player's score by 2.

So, for each player, their score is equal to the number of wins they had plus the number of draws they participated in.

But, in reality, it's more complex because the number of wins and draws depends on who played against whom.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for upper and lower bounds on the number of draws.

Let’s think about the maximum possible number of draws.

To maximize draws, we need as many games as possible to end in a draw.

But, we need to satisfy the given scores.

Let’s consider that the total points are 2g, and p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g.

The maximum number of draws would be g, if all games are draws.

But, in reality, not all games can be draws because the scores might require some wins.

So, to maximize draws, we need to minimize the number of wins.

Each win affects the score difference between players.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the differences between the scores.

Let me consider the differences between p3 and p2, and p3 and p1.

Let me denote d = p3 - p2 and e = p3 - p1.

These represent how much p3 exceeds p2 and p1, respectively.

In order to have p3 be higher than p2 and p1, there must be some wins for p3 against the others.

Each win by p3 against another player increases p3 by 2 and does not change the other player's score.

Each draw between p3 and another player increases both by 1.

Similarly, draws between p1 and p2 increase both by 1.

I need to find a combination of wins and draws that achieves the given p1, p2, p3.

Let me try to express p1, p2, p3 in terms of the number of wins and draws in each pair.

Let’s denote:

- g_ab: number of games between a and b.

- d_ab: number of draws between a and b.

- w_ab: number of wins between a and b. So, w_ab = g_ab - d_ab.

Similarly for g_ac, d_ac, w_ac, and g_bc, d_bc, w_bc.

Then, the points for each player can be expressed as:

- p_a = d_ab + d_ac + 2 * (w_ab where a won + w_ac where a won)

- Similarly for p_b and p_c.

But the problem is that we don't know who won in the win games.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that in the win games, one player wins and the other loses, so the winner gets 2 points and the loser gets 0.

But since we don't know who won, it's tricky.

Maybe I need to set up equations based on the total points.

Let me try to find expressions for p1, p2, p3 in terms of the number of wins and draws.

Let’s denote:

- d_ab: draws between a and b.

- w_ab: wins in ab games, which can be either a wins or b wins.

Similarly for d_ac, w_ac, d_bc, w_bc.

Then, p_a = d_ab + d_ac + 2 * (number of wins a had against b and c).

Similarly for p_b and p_c.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to find a way to express the differences in scores.

Let me consider that the difference between p3 and p2 is due to the games played between c and the others.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of wins required to achieve the score differences.

Let me try to find a formula for the minimal number of wins needed, and then the maximal number of draws would be total games minus minimal wins.

But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the code provided:

egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)

if egalites < 0:

resultats.append(-1)

else:

resultats.append(egalites // 2)

I need to understand where this formula comes from.

Let me plug in the example values to see if it makes sense.

First example: 0 0 0.

total_points = 0, p3 - p2 = 0, p3 - p1 = 0.

egalites = 0 - 0 - 0 = 0.

So, egalites // 2 = 0, which matches the expected output.

Second example: 0 1 1.

egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) - 2*(1-0) = 2 - 0 - 4 = -2.

Which is negative, but in the expected output it's 1.

Wait, but in the code, it's cas_de_test = [(0,0,0), (0,1,1), (0,2,3), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10), (0,0,6)]

But in the problem statement, the input is 7 test cases:

0 0 0 → 0

0 1 1 → 1

0 2 3 → ?

3 3 3 → -1

3 4 5 → 6

1 1 10 → 2

0 0 6 → ?

Wait, the code has (0,2,3) instead of (0,1,1), but in the problem statement, the second test case is (0,1,1).

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code's test cases.

Assuming that the code's test cases are correct, then for (0,1,1), egalites = 2 - 2*(1-1) -2*(1-0) = 2 -0 -2 = 0.

Then, egalites // 2 = 0, but the expected output is 1.

Hmm, inconsistency here.

Wait, maybe the formula is different.

Let me try to think differently.

Let’s consider that the total points are 2g, and the sum of p1, p2, p3 is 2g.

The number of draws is d, and the number of wins is w, with d + w = g.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, and each win contributes 2 points as well.

But to maximize d, we need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of wins.

However, the wins are necessary to account for the differences in scores.

Specifically, the differences between the players' scores must be accounted for by the wins.

Let’s consider that the difference between p3 and p2 must be due to wins by p3 against p2 or against p1.

Similarly, the difference between p3 and p1 must be due to wins by p3 against p1 or against p2.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for a formula that directly calculates the maximum number of draws.

Let me consider that in order to maximize draws, as many points as possible should come from draws rather than wins.

Each draw gives 2 points (1 to each player), and each win gives 2 points (2 to the winner, 0 to the loser).

So, to maximize draws, we should maximize the number of times points are distributed as 1-1 instead of 2-0.

Given that, the minimal number of wins is determined by the maximal player's score, p3.

p3 can gain points from wins and draws.

Each win gives p3 2 points, and each draw gives p3 1 point.

Similarly, p2 and p1 gain points from their wins and draws.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I should look for a way to express the total points and the individual points in terms of the number of wins and draws.

Let’s denote d as the total number of draws, and w as the total number of wins.

Then, d + w = g, and 2d + 2w = p1 + p2 + p3.

But 2d + 2w = 2(g), which equals p1 + p2 + p3.

So, that holds.

Now, to maximize d, we need to maximize d given the constraints on p1, p2, p3.

I need to find a way to express p1, p2, p3 in terms of d and w.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to consider the minimal number of wins required to achieve the given scores.

Each win can increase one player's score by 2, and a draw can increase two players' scores by 1 each.

I need to minimize the number of wins, which would maximize the number of draws.

To minimize wins, I need to maximize the number of draws.

But I need to ensure that the score differences are accounted for.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the score differences.

Let’s consider that p3's score can be achieved by a combination of wins and draws.

Similarly for p2 and p1.

But I need to consider the interactions between the players.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order for the scores to be achievable, the sum of the scores must be even, as established earlier.

Additionally, the maximal score p3 must be less than or equal to the total points divided by 2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, p3 can be at most the total points, which is 2g.

But I need to find constraints on p3 based on p1 and p2.

Let me consider that p3 can be at most p1 + p2, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. p3 can be higher than p1 + p2 if p3 wins all their games against p1 and p2.

Wait, no, p3 can't be higher than the total points available.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think about the maximum possible p3.

If p3 plays g3 games against p1 and p2, then p3 can earn up to 2*g3 points.

So, p3 ≤ 2*(g_ab + g_ac), where g_ab and g_ac are the games p3 plays against p1 and p2.

But I don't know g_ab and g_ac.

This is too vague.

Maybe I should look for inequalities that p1, p2, p3 must satisfy.

One thing I can think of is that the sum of p1, p2, p3 must be even, as established.

Additionally, the individual scores must be achievable given the possible outcomes of the games.

I need to find a way to check if p1, p2, p3 can be achieved through some combination of wins and draws.

Let me consider that in a set of games between three players, the number of games between each pair can be any non-negative integer.

Each game between two players can be a win for one or a draw.

So, for games between a and b, c and a, and c and b, I need to assign wins and draws such that the total points add up to p1, p2, p3.

This seems too complex to handle directly.

Maybe I can look for a way to compute the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the score differences.

Let’s consider that p3 - p2 must be achieved through wins by p3 against p2 or against p1.

Similarly, p3 - p1 must be achieved through wins by p3 against p1 or against p2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of wins each player has.

Let’s denote w1, w2, w3 as the number of wins for each player.

Then, p1 = w1*2 + d1, where d1 is the number of draws involving player 1.

Similarly, p2 = w2*2 + d2, and p3 = w3*2 + d3.

But d1, d2, d3 are related to the draws between the pairs.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that the total number of wins is equal to the number of games minus the number of draws.

Wait, yes, w = g - d.

And since p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g, and p1 = 2w1 + d1, p2 = 2w2 + d2, p3 = 2w3 + d3.

But d1 + d2 + d3 = 2d, because each draw involves two players.

This might be a way to set up equations.

So, we have:

p1 = 2w1 + d1

p2 = 2w2 + d2

p3 = 2w3 + d3

And d1 + d2 + d3 = 2d

Also, w1 + w2 + w3 = w = g - d

And p1 + p2 + p3 = 2g

So, summing the first three equations:

p1 + p2 + p3 = 2(w1 + w2 + w3) + (d1 + d2 + d3) = 2(w) + 2d = 2(g)

Which checks out, since w + d = g.

So, the equations are consistent.

Now, to maximize d, we need to maximize d while satisfying the individual equations.

This seems like a system of linear equations with integer solutions.

But solving this directly might be too time-consuming.

Maybe I can look for a way to express d in terms of p1, p2, p3.

Let me try to find an expression for d.

From the equations:

p1 = 2w1 + d1

p2 = 2w2 + d2

p3 = 2w3 + d3

And d1 + d2 + d3 = 2d

Also, w1 + w2 + w3 = g - d

We can express d1, d2, d3 in terms of w1, w
