Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, making it n+1 people in total. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to move up in the queue to be among the first m people. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places. Each swap with person j (where j is before i) costs a_j coins, and additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins each. He can do this multiple times, and he wants to spend as little as possible to reach a position among the first m.

Okay, so I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position that is at most m from the front.

First, I need to understand the operations he can perform. He can choose any person j in front of him (j < i) and swap places with them, paying a_j coins, and also pay b_k coins to everyone between j and i. So, if he's at position i, and he chooses to swap with j, the cost is a_j plus the sum of b_k for all k from j+1 to i-1.

My goal is to get him from position n (since he's at the end) to some position between 1 and m.

This sounds like a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1. Then, I can find the minimum cost path from n to any of the first m positions.

But with n up to 200,000, building a graph explicitly is not feasible due to time and space constraints. I need a smarter way to model this.

Let me think differently. Since the operations allow swapping with anyone in front, and there are costs associated, perhaps I can find a way to calculate the minimum cost incrementally.

Let's consider that Kirill starts at position n+1 (since he's at the end). But in the problem, it seems position indexing starts at 1, with person 1 being at the front. So, position 1 is the first in the queue, position 2 is behind them, and so on, up to position n+1 where Kirill is.

Wait, but in the input, n is the number of people already in the queue, and Kirill is n+1. But in the code, it seems to treat na_frente as n, and pos_final as m.

Looking at the code:

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case, it reads n and m.

- Then reads a list of a_i for n people.

- Then reads a list of b_i for n people.

- Then, it sets na_frente -=1 and pos_final -=1, meaning it's adjusting indices to be 0-based.

Then, it initializes total to 0 and best to a large number.

It loops from v = na_frente down to 0.

In each iteration:

- If v <= pos_final, it checks if total + a[v] is less than best, and updates best if so.

- Then, it decides whether to add a[v] or b[v] to total, depending on which is smaller, but only if v <= pos_final.

- If v > pos_final, it always adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to total.

Wait, this seems a bit confusing. Let's try to understand what's happening.

First, na_frente is n-1, since it's adjusted by -=1.

pos_final is m-1, similarly adjusted.

So, v goes from n-1 down to 0.

For each v:

- If v <= pos_final, it considers updating the best cost by adding a[v] to the current total.

- Then, it adds to total the smaller of a[v] or b[v], but only if v <= pos_final.

- If v > pos_final, it always adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v].

This seems off. I need to think about what the code is trying to do.

Maybe it's trying to simulate moving Kirill forward by choosing to either swap with someone or pay the b_k for the people in between.

But I'm not sure this approach is correct.

Let me think about a different approach.

Perhaps I can use dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to m, and then take the minimum among them.

To compute dp[i], I can consider all possible j > i from which I can swap to i, and take the minimum cost among those swaps.

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a shortest path problem and use a priority queue (Dijkstra's algorithm).

Each position is a node, and there are directed edges from j to i (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is the sum of b[k] for k from j+1 to i-1.

This sum can be calculated using prefix sums.

Let's define prefix_b[i] as the sum of b[k] for k from 0 to i-1.

Then, sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

So, the cost to swap from j to i is a_j + (prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1]).

In Dijkstra's algorithm, I can maintain a priority queue of positions to explore, along with the current cost to reach them.

I start from position n, with cost 0.

I keep relaxing the distances to other positions until I reach positions 1 to m.

But even Dijkstra's algorithm might be too slow for n=2e5, unless it's optimized.

Wait, maybe I can find a way to calculate the minimum cost without explicitly running Dijkstra.

Let me think about the operations.

Suppose Kirill starts at position n.

He can choose to swap with anyone in front of him, say position j (j < n), paying a_j + sum of b_k from j+1 to n-1.

After swapping with j, he's now at position j, and can repeat the process.

He wants to reach any position <= m.

Alternatively, he can choose to "pass" through position j, which means paying b_j to skip over j.

Wait, but in the problem, paying b_k for k between j and i is a bit different.

Wait, no. When he swaps with j, he pays a_j and also pays b_k for all k between j and i.

But actually, in the swap operation, it's specified that he pays a_j to swap with j, and b_k for each k between j and i.

But in the code, it seems to be handling this in a loop from back to front, deciding whether to swap or pass.

I need to think differently.

Maybe I can consider the cost to move from position n to position 1 step by step.

Let's think about moving one step at a time.

At each position i, Kirill can choose to swap with any j < i, paying a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1.

But this is complicated.

Perhaps I can consider the cumulative cost to reach each position.

Let me try to find a way to compute the minimum cost to reach position i.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

We need to compute dp[1] to dp[m], and take the minimum among them.

To compute dp[i], we can consider all j > i, and set dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i).

But this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate from n down to 1, keeping track of the minimum cost to reach each position.

Let me try.

Initialize dp[n] = 0, since starting at n with cost 0.

Then, for i from n-1 down to 1:

dp[i] = min over j from i+1 to n of (dp[j] + a_i + sum b_k from i+1 to j-1)

Wait, no.

Wait, if Kirill is at position i, and swaps with position j (j < i), he moves to position j, paying a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in this case, j < i, so j+1 to i-1 is correct.

But in my earlier dp definition, I have dp[i] as the cost to reach i.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to define dp[i] as the minimum cost to move from position i to some position <= m.

Then, for dp[i], I can consider swapping with any j < i, paying a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1, and then add dp[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1) + dp[j]

And dp[i] for i <= m should be 0, since he's already in the desired position.

But again, this is O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Perhaps I can use prefix sums for the sum b_k.

Let's define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

Then, sum b_k from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

So, the cost to swap from j to i is a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

In the dp formula, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1]) + dp[j]

This can be rearranged as:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) + prefix_b[i]

Notice that prefix_b[i] is independent of j, so it can be added at the end.

So, dp[i] = (min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1])) + prefix_b[i]

Now, the term in the min is (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]), which depends only on j.

So, if I can keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) for j < i, then I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

This suggests that I can keep a variable current_min = min_j (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) for j < i

Then, dp[i] = current_min + prefix_b[i]

And after computing dp[i], I can update current_min if necessary.

Wait, but I need to update current_min only if i < some value, depending on the position.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate from i = 1 to n, and keep track of the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) for j < i.

But I need to make sure that dp[j] is already computed for j < i.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate from i = 1 to n, and maintain the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1]) for j < i.

Yes, that seems possible.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize dp[i] for i <= m as 0, since no cost is needed if already in position <= m.

Compute prefix_b[i] for all i.

Then, iterate i from 1 to n:

If i <= m:

dp[i] = 0

Else:

dp[i] = min_over_j< i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to i-1)

But using the earlier transformation:

dp[i] = (min_over_j < i of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1])) + prefix_b[i]

So, I can maintain a variable current_min = min_over_j (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j+1])

Then, for each i from m+1 to n:

dp[i] = current_min + prefix_b[i]

And after computing dp[i], update current_min if necessary.

But I need to make sure that I'm only considering j < i.

So, I can iterate i from 1 to n:

If i <= m:

dp[i] = 0

current_min = min(current_min, dp[i] + a_i - prefix_b[i+1])

Else:

dp[i] = current_min + prefix_b[i]

current_min = min(current_min, dp[i] + a_i - prefix_b[i+1])

Wait, but I need to make sure that when i > m, dp[i] is computed based on j < i.

And also, when updating current_min, I need to ensure that j < i.

Wait, perhaps this approach needs more careful consideration.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take the first test case:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

Kirill starts at position 5 (n+1=5)

He wants to be in position 1 or 2.

So, possible swaps:

From 5, he can swap with 1,2,3,4, paying a_j + sum b_k from j+1 to 4.

For example, swap with 1: pay a_1=7 + sum b_2 to b_4 = b[2]+b[3]+b[4]=3+8+5=16, total 23

Swap with 2: pay a_2=3 + sum b_3 + b_4 =8+5=13, total 16

Swap with 3: pay a_3=6 + sum b_4=5, total 11

Swap with 4: pay a_4=9 + sum nothing, total 9

So, directly swapping to 1 costs 23, to 2 costs 16, to 3 costs 11, to 4 costs 9.

But he can perform multiple swaps.

For example, from 5, swap to 4 for 9, then from 4, swap to 2 for a_2=3 + sum b_3 + b_4=8+5=13, total 16, plus previous 9, total 25.

But that's worse than swapping directly to 2 for 16.

Wait, no, because swapping directly to 2 costs 16, but swapping to 4 for 9, then to 2 for 3 + 8 +5=16, total 25, which is worse.

So, direct swaps are better.

But perhaps in other cases, multiple swaps are better.

Wait, in this case, it seems direct swaps are sufficient.

But I need to consider that multiple swaps might lead to lower costs in other scenarios.

Looking back at the code provided:

It sets na_frente = n-1 =3, pos_final = m-1=1

Then loops from v=3 down to 0:

If v <=1, i.e., v=0,1:

Check if total + a[v] < best, then update best.

Then, if v <=1, add min(a[v], b[v]) to total.

Else, add min(a[v], b[v]) to total.

Wait, this seems unclear.

In the first iteration, v=3:

v >1, so add min(a[3]=9, b[3]=5)=5 to total. total=5

v=2:

v >1, add min(a[2]=6, b[2]=8)=6 to total. total=11

v=1:

v <=1, check if total + a[1]=3 +11=14 < best, then best=14

Then, since v <=1, if a[1]=3 < b[1]=3, which is not, so add b[1]=3 to total. total=14

v=0:

v <=1, check if total + a[0]=7 +14=21 < best=14, no.

Then, since v <=1, if a[0]=7 < b[0]=4, no, so add b[0]=4 to total. total=18

Finally, best=14

Which matches the first output.

Seems correct for this case.

But let's check another test case.

Second test case:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

n=6, m=2

a=[6,9,7,1,8,3]

b=[5,8,8,1,4,1]

na_frente=5, pos_final=1

Loop from v=5 down to 0:

v=5:

v >1, add min(a[5]=3, b[5]=1)=1 to total. total=1

v=4:

v >1, add min(a[4]=8, b[4]=4)=4 to total. total=5

v=3:

v >1, add min(a[3]=1, b[3]=1)=1 to total. total=6

v=2:

v >1, add min(a[2]=7, b[2]=8)=7 to total. total=13

v=1:

v <=1, check if total + a[1]=9 +13=22 < best, set best=22

Then, since a[1]=9 > b[1]=8, add b[1]=8 to total. total=21

v=0:

v <=1, check if total + a[0]=6 +21=27 < best=22, no.

Then, a[0]=6 < b[0]=5, so add a[0]=6 to total. total=27

Finally, best=22

Which matches the second output.

Third test case:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

n=7, m=7

a=[7,2,9,2,6,5,9]

b=[9,1,10,7,1,4,9]

na_frente=6, pos_final=6

Loop from v=6 down to 0:

v=6:

v >6, no. v<=6, so check if total + a[6]=9 < best, say best=10^12, so best=9

Then, a[6]=9 > b[6]=9, so add b[6]=9 to total. total=9

v=5:

v <=6, check if total + a[5]=5 +9=14 < best=9, no.

Then, a[5]=5 < b[5]=4, no, so add b[5]=4 to total. total=13

v=4:

v <=6, check if total + a[4]=6 +13=19 < best=9, no.

Then, a[4]=6 > b[4]=1, so add b[4]=1 to total. total=14

v=3:

v <=6, check if total + a[3]=2 +14=16 < best=9, no.

Then, a[3]=2 < b[3]=7, yes, so add a[3]=2 to total. total=16

v=2:

v <=6, check if total + a[2]=9 +16=25 < best=9, no.

Then, a[2]=9 > b[2]=10, no, so add b[2]=10 to total. total=26

v=1:

v <=6, check if total + a[1]=2 +26=28 < best=9, no.

Then, a[1]=2 < b[1]=1, no, so add b[1]=1 to total. total=27

v=0:

v <=6, check if total + a[0]=7 +27=34 < best=9, no.

Then, a[0]=7 > b[0]=9, no, so add b[0]=9 to total. total=36

Finally, best=9

Which matches the third output.

Fourth test case:

2 1

2 3

1 1

n=2, m=1

a=[2,3]

b=[1,1]

na_frente=1, pos_final=0

Loop from v=1 down to 0:

v=1:

v <=0, no. v>0, add min(a[1]=3, b[1]=1)=1 to total. total=1

v=0:

v <=0, check if total + a[0]=2 +1=3 < best, set best=3

Then, a[0]=2 > b[0]=1, so add b[0]=1 to total. total=2

Finally, best=3

Which matches the fourth output.

So, in all these test cases, the code seems to produce the correct output.

But I need to make sure that the logic is sound.

Looking back at the code:

- It initializes best to a large number.

- It iterates from v=na_frente down to 0.

- If v <= pos_final, it checks if total + a[v] < best, and updates best if so.

- Then, if v <= pos_final, it adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to total.

- Else, it adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to total.

I need to understand why this works.

It seems that when v <= pos_final, it's considering that Kirill can reach position v+1 (since positions are 0-based now) by paying a[v], and then the total cost up to that point is total + a[v]. If this is better than the current best, update best.

Then, it adds the smaller of a[v] or b[v] to total, meaning that it's choosing to either swap with v or pay b[v] to pass v.

But I'm not entirely sure if this captures all possible scenarios.

Wait, perhaps it's modeling the cost to reach position v, and then deciding whether to swap or pass.

But I'm still a bit unclear.

Let me try to think of a different test case.

Suppose n=3, m=1

a=[1,100,100]

b=[100,100,100]

Kirill starts at position 4.

He can swap directly to position 1, paying a_1=1 + sum b_2+b_3=100+100=200, total 201.

Or, he can swap to position 2 for a_2=100 + b_3=100, total 200, then from position 2, swap to position 1 for a_1=1 + b_2=100, total 1 + 100 = 101, plus the previous 200, total 301.

Which is worse than swapping directly to position 1 for 201.

So, direct swap is better.

According to the code:

na_frente=2, pos_final=0

Loop from v=2 down to 0:

v=2:

v >0, add min(a[2]=100, b[2]=100)=100 to total. total=100

v=1:

v >0, add min(a[1]=100, b[1]=100)=100 to total. total=200

v=0:

v <=0, check if total + a[0]=1 +200=201 < best, set best=201

Then, a[0]=1 < b[0]=100, so add a[0]=1 to total. total=201

Finally, best=201

Which matches the direct swap cost.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=3, m=2

a=[1,2,3]

b=[10,10,10]

Kirill starts at position 4.

He can swap to position 1 for a_1=1 + sum b_2+b3=10+10=20, total 21.

Or to position 2 for a_2=2 + sum
