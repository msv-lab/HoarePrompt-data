Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: one every 'a' minutes and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the timings work. Let's say the first installation launches fireworks at times a, 2a, 3a, and so on. Similarly, the second installation launches at times b, 2b, 3b, and so on. Each firework is visible from the time it's launched up to m minutes after that.

So, for any given time t, the number of fireworks visible in the sky would be the sum of fireworks launched by both installations that are still visible at time t.

My goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time t.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the time intervals when fireworks are visible and see how they overlap.

But since a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through all possible times.

I need to find a mathematical way to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks.

Let's consider the launches of each installation separately first.

For the first installation, fireworks are launched at multiples of a, and each is visible for m minutes.

So, for a launch at time ka (where k is a positive integer), the visibility interval is [ka, ka + m].

Similarly, for the second installation, launches are at multiples of b, with visibility [lb, lb + m].

Now, to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time, I need to find a time t where the sum of the number of visibility intervals from both installations that include t is maximized.

This sounds like finding the maximum overlap of intervals from two different sets.

I recall that in scheduling problems, we can find overlaps by sorting the start and end times and then sweeping through them.

But given the large values of a, b, and m, sorting and sweeping isn't feasible here.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the possible times when the number of visible fireworks could change.

These times are the launch times and the times when a firework's visibility ends.

So, the critical times are ka, ka + m, lb, and lb + m for all positive integers k and l.

But again, with large a, b, and m, I can't iterate through all these times.

I need to find a way to calculate the maximum overlap without enumerating all possibilities.

Let me think about the periodicity.

Since both installations launch fireworks periodically, the pattern of visible fireworks repeats every least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

But even the LCM of a and b can be up to 10^18, which is still too large to handle directly.

I need to find a way to calculate the maximum overlap within one period efficiently.

Wait, maybe I don't need to consider the entire period. Maybe there's a mathematical formula or some properties I can use.

Let me consider the number of launches from each installation within a certain time frame.

For a given time t, the number of launches from the first installation that are still visible is the number of k such that ka <= t and ka + m >= t, which simplifies to floor(t / a) minus floor((t - m - 1) / a).

Similarly for the second installation.

So, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

But this seems complicated to maximize directly.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the maximum possible number of overlapping fireworks.

One approach is to consider the maximum number of launches from each installation that can be visible at the same time.

For the first installation, the number of launches visible at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a).

Similarly for the second installation.

So, the maximum overlap would be the sum of these two.

But I need to find the maximum value of this sum over all t.

Let me try to find an expression for t that maximizes this sum.

I need to choose t such that both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b) are maximized.

I recall that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

So, it's essentially counting the number of launches from each installation whose visibility overlaps with time t.

To maximize the total, I need to choose t where both counts are as high as possible.

What's the maximum possible value for floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a)?

Well, t / a - (t - m - 1)/a = (t - m - 1)/a - t/a = (t - m - 1 - t)/a = (-m -1)/a, which is negative, but floor functions make this tricky.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Actually, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m, t].

Which is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

This expression can be simplified.

I recall that floor(x) - floor(y) is equal to floor(x - y), but only under certain conditions.

Wait, no. That's not generally true.

Actually, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) can be up to ceil((m + 1)/a).

Because the number of multiples of a in an interval of length m + 1 is floor((m + 1)/a) or floor((m + 1)/a) + 1 if there's an extra multiple within the interval.

Wait, more precisely, the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

This is equal to floor((t mod a + m)/a) + 1 if t mod a + m >= a, else floor((t mod a + m)/a).

But this seems complicated.

Maybe instead of trying to maximize the sum, I can consider specific times where overlaps are likely to be maximum.

For example, at t = LCM(a, b), or at t = multiples of a and b.

Wait, but LCM(a, b) could be very large.

Alternatively, perhaps t = 0 is a good candidate, but at t = 0, only fireworks launched at t = 0 are visible, but m is positive, so fireworks launched at t = 0 are visible until t = m.

But maybe other fireworks launched later are also visible.

Wait, no. At t = 0, only fireworks launched at t = 0 are visible, because others haven't been launched yet.

So, at t = 0, only one firework is visible, from the first installation if a = 0, but a is at least 1, so t = 0 might not be useful.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t, and I want to compute the number of fireworks visible at that time.

I need to maximize the sum of fireworks from both installations.

Let me consider the possible values for floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

This represents the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at time t.

Similarly for the second installation.

I need to maximize the sum of these two.

Let me consider that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

So, the total number of visible fireworks is the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] plus the number of multiples of b in [t - m, t].

I need to maximize this sum.

Let me denote na = number of multiples of a in [t - m, t]

And nb = number of multiples of b in [t - m, t]

I need to maximize na + nb.

Now, na is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for nb.

I need to find t that maximizes na + nb.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that na can be up to floor(m / a) + 1, similarly for nb.

But I need to consider how na and nb overlap.

Wait, no, na and nb are counts from two different installations, so they don't directly overlap in terms of launches, but in terms of visibility at time t.

I need to consider the times when both installations have multiple fireworks visible at the same time.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for patterns or mathematical properties that can help.

I recall that in number theory, the number of multiples of a in an interval can be calculated using floor functions, as I've done.

But perhaps I can consider the time t such that t is close to multiples of a and b.

In other words, t should be such that t mod a is small, and t mod b is small.

This way, there will be more launches from both installations whose visibility includes t.

So, t should be close to a common multiple of a and b.

Wait, perhaps t should be a multiple of LCM(a, b).

But again, LCM(a, b) could be very large.

Alternatively, perhaps t should be such that t is within m of multiples of a and b.

Wait, maybe I can set t to be the smallest time where both installations have launched fireworks that are still visible.

Let me consider that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the time t where the number of visible fireworks from each installation is maximized individually, and then sum them up.

But I need to consider if there are overlaps in their launch schedules.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the maximum number of visible fireworks from each installation separately and then add them up.

But that might not be accurate because there could be interference or overlaps in their launch schedules.

Let me consider specific examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the sample input:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, m + 1 = 5 minutes visibility.

First installation launches at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc.

Second installation launches at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, etc.

Each firework is visible for 5 minutes after launch.

So, for instance, the first firework from installation 1 launched at t=6 is visible from t=6 to t=10.

The second firework from installation 1 launched at t=12 is visible from t=12 to t=16, and so on.

Similarly for installation 2: t=7 to t=11, t=14 to t=18, etc.

Now, if I look at t=7:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at t=6 is visible (t=7 is within [6,10])

- Firework from installation 2 launched at t=7 is visible (t=7 is within [7,11])

- So, total visible fireworks: 2

Similarly, at t=14:

- Fireworks from installation 1: t=12 (visible until t=16), t=18 (not yet launched)

- Fireworks from installation 2: t=14 (visible until t=18)

- So, total visible fireworks: 2

At t=21:

- Installation 1: t=18 (visible until t=22), t=24 (not yet launched)

- Installation 2: t=21 (visible until t=25)

- Total: 2

At t=112 in the third sample input:

a=7, b=8, m=56

So, m + 1 = 57 minutes visibility.

Installation 1 launches at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,70,...

Installation 2 launches at 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,72,...

Each firework is visible for 57 minutes.

So, at t=112:

- Installation 1: launches at t=56 (visible until t=56+57=113), t=63 (visible until t=63+57=120), t=70 (visible until t=70+57=127), t=77, t=84, t=91, t=98, t=105, t=112, etc.

Wait, t=56 is visible until t=113, which includes t=112.

Similarly, t=63 is visible until t=120, which includes t=112.

t=70 is visible until t=127, which includes t=112.

t=77 is visible until t=134, which includes t=112.

t=84 is visible until t=141, which includes t=112.

t=91 is visible until t=148, which includes t=112.

t=98 is visible until t=155, which includes t=112.

t=105 is visible until t=162, which includes t=112.

t=112 is visible until t=169, which includes t=112.

So, from installation 1, the launches at t=56,63,70,77,84,91,98,105,112 are visible at t=112.

That's 9 fireworks from installation 1.

From installation 2:

Launches at t=56,64,72,80,88,96,104,112, etc.

Each visible until t=56+57=113, t=64+57=121, etc.

So, at t=112:

- t=56 (visible until t=113)

- t=64 (visible until t=121)

- t=72 (visible until t=129)

- t=80 (visible until t=137)

- t=88 (visible until t=145)

- t=96 (visible until t=153)

- t=104 (visible until t=161)

- t=112 (visible until t=169)

That's 8 fireworks from installation 2.

Total visible at t=112: 9 + 8 = 17, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of the number of launches from each installation that are visible at t=112.

Now, how can I generalize this?

It seems that to maximize the number of visible fireworks, I need to choose a time t where as many launches as possible from both installations are still visible.

Given that launches are periodic, I need to choose t such that t is close to multiples of a and b, but also considering the visibility period m.

Wait, actually, from the sample, it seems that choosing t such that it's a multiple of both a and b would maximize the overlap, but in the first sample, t=7 is a multiple of b but not a, and still, it's only 2 fireworks.

In the third sample, t=112 is a multiple of both a and b (since 112 is divisible by both 7 and 8), which might be why it has a higher overlap.

Wait, is that the case?

Let's check:

a=7, b=8, m=56

t=112 is divisible by both 7 and 8.

Similarly, in the first sample, a=6, b=7, m=4

Choosing t=42, which is divisible by both 6 and 7:

At t=42:

Installation 1: launches at t=6,12,18,24,30,36,42

Visibility until t=6+5=11, t=12+5=17, t=18+5=23, t=24+5=29, t=30+5=35, t=36+5=41, t=42+5=47

So, at t=42, only the launch at t=36 and t=42 are visible (t=36 to 41 and t=42 to 47).

Similarly, installation 2: launches at t=7,14,21,28,35,42

Visibility until t=7+5=12, t=14+5=19, t=21+5=26, t=28+5=33, t=35+5=40, t=42+5=47

At t=42, only t=35 and t=42 are visible.

So, total visible fireworks: 2 from installation 1 and 2 from installation 2, totaling 4.

But in the first sample, the output is 2, which is less than 4.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the first sample explanation, it says that at t=7, there are 2 visible fireworks: one from each installation.

But according to my calculation at t=42, there are 4 visible fireworks.

But the sample output is 2, so perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the installations do not launch fireworks at t=0, but start at t=a and t=b respectively.

Wait, in the first sample, m=4, so visibility is t to t+4.

At t=7:

- Installation 1: t=6 (visible from 6 to 10), t=12 (visible from 12 to 16), etc.

- Installation 2: t=7 (visible from 7 to 11), t=14 (visible from 14 to 18), etc.

At t=7:

- From installation 1: t=6 (visible at t=7)

- From installation 2: t=7 (visible at t=7)

Total: 2 fireworks.

At t=42:

- Installation 1: t=36 (visible from 36 to 40), t=42 (visible from 42 to 46)

- Installation 2: t=35 (visible from 35 to 39), t=42 (visible from 42 to 46)

At t=42:

- t=36 to 40: t=42 is not within this range.

- t=42 to 46: t=42 is within this range.

- t=35 to 39: t=42 is not within this range.

- t=42 to 46: t=42 is within this range.

So, only the fireworks launched at t=42 from both installations are visible at t=42.

So, total visible fireworks at t=42: 2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

At t=42:

- Installation 1: t=36 (36 to 40): t=42 is not in this range.

t=42 (42 to 46): t=42 is in this range.

So, only one from installation 1.

- Installation 2: t=35 (35 to 39): t=42 is not in this range.

t=42 (42 to 46): t=42 is in this range.

So, only one from installation 2.

Total: 2.

So, the sample output is correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in this case, even at a time that's a multiple of both a and b, only two fireworks are visible.

But in the third sample, at t=112, which is a multiple of both 7 and 8, 17 fireworks are visible.

So, perhaps there's more to it than just choosing a common multiple.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of the number of launches from each installation that occur within m of t.

In other words, for installation 1, the number of launches between t - m and t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

So, the total visible fireworks is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this sum.

But how?

I need to choose t such that this sum is maximized.

I recall that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

So, I need to maximize the sum of the counts of multiples of a and b in [t - m, t].

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can consider that the maximum occurs when t is such that both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b) are maximized.

But these two might not be maximized at the same t.

Wait, perhaps I can consider t such that t is congruent to 0 modulo a and b, i.e., t is a common multiple of a and b.

But in the first sample, t=42 is a common multiple, but the number of visible fireworks is 2, not higher.

In the third sample, t=112 is a common multiple, and the number is 17.

So, perhaps there's a pattern based on the number of multiples of a and b within m of t.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] and the number of multiples of b in [t - m, t], and sum them up.

To maximize this sum, I need to choose t such that both counts are as high as possible.

The number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

This seems complicated to maximize directly.

Let me consider that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is at most floor(m / a) + 1

Similarly for b.

So, the maximum possible sum is floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But in the first sample, m=4, a=6, b=7

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the third sample, m=56, a=7, b=8

floor(56 / 7) = 8, floor(56 / 8) = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches the sample output.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, in general, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But in the second sample:

a=3, b=4, m=10

floor(10 / 3) = 3, floor(10 / 4) = 2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth sample:

a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

floor(78123459896 / 5) = 15624691979, floor(78123459896 / 6) = 13020576649, so 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

In the fifth sample:

a=1, b=1, m=1

floor(1 / 1) = 1, floor(1 / 1) = 1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

In the sixth sample:

a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000, floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, in all the sample inputs, this formula seems to work.

Therefore, the general formula for the maximum number of visible fireworks is:

floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But wait, in the first sample, m=4, a=6, b=7

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

In the third sample, floor(56 / 7) = 8, floor(56 / 8) = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17

In the fourth sample, floor(78123459896 / 5) = 15624691979, floor(78123459896 / 6) = 13020576649, so 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630

In the fifth and sixth samples, it works as well.

So, it seems that the formula is correct.

But let's verify it with another example.

Suppose a=2, b=3, m=5

floor(5 / 2) = 2, floor(5 / 3) = 1, so 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

Let's see if this is possible.

Installation 1 launches at t=2,4,6,8,...

Installation 2 launches at t=3,6,9,12,...

Visibility is m+1=6 minutes.

So, at t=6:

- Installation 1: t=2 (2 to 7), t=4 (4 to 9), t=6 (6 to 11)

- Installation 2: t=3 (3 to 8), t=6 (6 to 11)

Total visible at t=6: 3 from installation 1 and 2 from installation 2, totaling 5, which matches the formula.

Another example: a=2, b=3, m=1

floor(1 / 2) = 0, floor(1 / 3) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

At t=2:

- Installation 1: t=2 (2 to 2+1=3)

- Installation 2: t=3 (3 to 4), but t=2 is before that.

Wait, t=2 is within t=2 to 3 for installation 1, and t=3 to 4 for installation 2 is not visible at t=2.

So, only one firework from installation 1 is visible at t=2.

Similarly, at t=3:

- Installation 1: t=2 (2 to 3), t=4 (4 to 5)

- Installation 2: t=3 (3 to 4)

At t=3: t=2 to 3 and t=3 to 4, so two fireworks visible.

So, the formula holds.

Another example: a=1, b=2, m=0

floor(0 / 1) = 0, floor(0 / 2) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

At t=1:

- Installation 1: t=1 (1 to 1)

- Installation 2: t=2 (2 to 2), but t=1 is before that.

So, only one firework visible at t=1.

At t=2:

- Installation 1: t=1 (1 to 1), t=2 (2 to 2)

- Installation 2: t=2 (2 to 2)

So, two fireworks visible at t=2.

So, the formula holds.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = floor(0 / 1) + floor(0 / 2) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

So, the formula seems correct.

Wait, but in this case, m=0, so each firework is only visible at the launch time.

So, at t=2, both installations have launched at t=2, so two fireworks are visible.

At other times, only one is visible.

So, the maximum is indeed 2.

Therefore, the formula seems to work.

Hence, the general solution is:

floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But wait, in the first sample, m=4, a=6, b=7

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

In the second sample, m=10, a=3, b=4

floor(10 / 3) = 3, floor(10 / 4) = 2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches.

In the third sample, m=56, a=7, b=8

floor(56 / 7) = 8, floor(56 / 8) = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches.

In the fourth sample, m=78123459896, a=5, b=6

floor(78123459896 / 5) = 15624691979, floor(78123459896 / 6) = 13020576649, so 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches.

In the fifth sample, m=1, a=1, b=1

floor(1 / 1) = 1, floor(1 / 1) = 1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches.

In the sixth sample, m=1000000000000000000, a=1, b=1

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) = 1000000000000000000, so 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, in all these cases, the formula works.

Therefore, the solution is to compute floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 for each test case.

But wait, in the earlier example where a=2, b=3, m=5, it worked.

Similarly, for a=2, b=3, m=1, it worked.

And for a=1, b=2, m=0, it worked.

So, it seems that the formula is correct.

Hence, the program should implement this formula.

But looking back at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

mn = min(a, b) + m

if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):

print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)

else:

print(mn // a + mn // b)

This seems different from what I derived.

In my reasoning, the formula is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But in the provided program, it calculates mn = min(a, b) + m

Then, if m is divisible by both a and b and a and b are not 1, it prints mn // a + mn // b + 1

Else, it prints mn // a + mn // b

This seems inconsistent with my formula.

Let me check with the first sample:

a=6, b=7, m=4

mn = min(6,7) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

m is not divisible by a (4 % 6 != 0), so it's the else case: mn // a + mn // b = 10 // 6 + 10 // 7 = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the third sample:

a=7, b=8, m=56

mn = min(7,8) + 56 = 7 + 56 = 63

m=56 is divisible by a=7 and b=8, and a and b are not 1, so print(63 // 7 + 63 // 8 + 1) = 9 + 7 + 1 = 17, which matches.

In the fourth sample:

a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

mn = min(5,6) + 78123459896 = 5 + 78123459896 = 78123459901

m=78123459896 is divisible by a=5 and b=6, and a and b are not 1, so print(78123459901 // 5 + 78123459901 // 6 + 1) = 15624691980 + 13020576650 + 1 = 28645268631

But according to my formula, it should be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = floor(78123459896 / 5) + floor(78123459896 / 6) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630

But in the sample output, it's 28645268630, which is one less than the provided program's output.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Similarly, in the fifth sample:

a=1, b=1, m=1

mn = min(1,1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

m=1 is divisible by a=1 and b=1, and a and b are 1, so it's the else case: mn // a + mn // b = 2 // 1 + 2 // 1 = 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

In the sixth sample:

a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

mn = min(1,1) + 1000000000000000000 = 1 + 1000000000000000000 = 1000000000000000001

m=1000000000000000000 is divisible by a=1 and b=1, and a and b are 1, so it's the else case: mn // a + mn // b = 1000000000000000001 // 1 + 1000000000000000001 // 1 = 1000000000000000001 + 1000000000000000001 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, the provided program gives the correct output, but it differs from my formula.

Wait, in the fourth sample, according to my formula, it should be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630

But according to the provided program, it calculates mn // a + mn // b + 1 = 15624691980 + 13020576650 + 1 = 28645268631, which is one more than the sample output.

So, the provided program is incorrect in this case.

But in the first sample, it gives the correct output.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Let me check with a=2, b=3, m=5

mn = min(2,3) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7

m=5 is not divisible by a=2 and b=3 (since 5 % 2 != 0), so it's the else case: mn // a + mn // b = 7 // 2 + 7 // 3 = 3 + 2 = 5, which matches my earlier calculation.

Another example: a=1, b=2, m=0

mn = min(1,2) + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1

m=0 is divisible by a=1 and b=2, and a !=1, b=2 !=1, so print(1 // 1 + 1 // 2 +1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2, which matches my earlier calculation.

Wait, but according to my formula, it should be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = floor(0 / 1) + floor(0 / 2) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

But in the fourth sample, the program gives 28645268631, but according to the sample output, it should be 28645268630.

So, the program is off by one in that case.

Wait, perhaps there's a need to adjust the formula based on whether m is divisible by a and b.

In the fourth sample, m=78123459896 is divisible by a=5 and b=6.

So, according to the program, it's mn // a + mn // b + 1 = 78123459901 // 5 + 78123459901 // 6 + 1 = 15624691980 + 13020576650 + 1 = 28645268631

But according to the sample output, it should be 28645268630.

So, the program is adding one extra in this case.

Perhaps the correction should be to add 1 only in certain cases.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.

Let me think differently.

Instead of using m, perhaps I should consider the interval [t - m, t]

And count the number of multiples of a and b in this interval.

So, for installation 1, the number of launches in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

To maximize the sum, I need to choose t such that both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b) are maximized.

But perhaps there's a better way.

I recall that the maximum number of overlapping intervals can be calculated by considering the density of launches within m.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the least common multiple of a and b to find the periodicity.

But LCM can be very large, up to a*b, which is 10^36, which is not feasible to handle directly.

So, perhaps I need to find a mathematical expression that can be computed efficiently.

Given that, perhaps the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 is correct in general, except when a or b divide m, in which case there might be an overlap.

Wait, in the fourth sample, floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

But according to the program, it's calculating mn // a + mn // b + 1 = 15624691980 + 13020576650 + 1 = 28645268631, which is one more.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is flawed.

The correct formula should be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 in all cases.

Wait, but in the case where a=1, b=1, m=0, it's floor(0 / 1) + floor(0 / 1) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches the sample output of 4.

Wait,
