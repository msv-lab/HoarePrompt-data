Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1 and others are 2x2. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up a 2x2 square, which is 4 cells. The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to figure out how to maximize the usage of each screen to fit as many icons as possible, thereby minimizing the number of screens required.

Let me think about the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, 2x2 icons occupy a 2x2 block of cells. Given the grid's dimensions, I need to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

Looking at the grid, a 2x2 icon can be placed in positions that allow for a 2x2 block:

- Positions for 2x2 icons:

- Cells (1,2,4,5)

- Cells (2,3,5,6)

- Cells (4,5,7,8)

- Cells (5,6,8,9)

- Cells (7,8,10,11)

- Cells (8,9,11,12)

- Cells (10,11,13,14)

- Cells (11,12,14,15)

So, there are 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons on a single screen.

But wait, some of these positions might overlap. For example, cells (1,2,4,5) and (2,3,5,6) overlap on cells 2 and 5. So, I need to ensure that the 2x2 icons don't overlap.

Let me try to see the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 icons that can be placed on a single screen.

If I place one 2x2 icon in cells (1,2,4,5), then I can't place another in (2,3,5,6) because of overlapping cells. So, perhaps I can place another 2x2 icon in cells (7,8,10,11), and another in cells (13,14,10,11)? Wait, that overlaps.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think in terms of layers or groups that don't overlap.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate how many 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Given that each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and there are 15 cells per screen, naively, you might think 15 / 4 = 3.75, so 3 icons per screen. But in reality, due to the grid structure, you might not be able to place 3 non-overlapping 2x2 icons.

Let me try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible without overlapping.

Start by placing one 2x2 icon in cells (1,2,4,5). Then, another in cells (7,8,10,11). Then, another in cells (13,14,10,11), but this overlaps with the previous one. So, can't place there.

Alternatively, place another 2x2 icon in cells (3,6,9,12). Let's see:

- First icon: cells (1,2,4,5)

- Second icon: cells (3,6,9,12)

- Third icon: cells (7,8,10,11)

- Fourth icon: cells (13,14,15)

Wait, but the fourth one doesn't make sense because 15 is a single cell.

Wait, maybe only two 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Let's check:

- Icon 1: cells (1,2,4,5)

- Icon 2: cells (7,8,10,11)

- Icon 3: cells (3,6,9,12)

But icon 3 overlaps with icon 1 in cell 6 (if icon 1 is in cells (1,2,4,5), and icon 3 is in cells (3,6,9,12), they don't overlap directly, but let's check the positions.

Wait, in row 1: cells 1,2,3

Row 2: cells 4,5,6

Row 3: cells 7,8,9

Row 4: cells 10,11,12

Row 5: cells 13,14,15

So, icon 1: cells (1,2,4,5) – that's rows 1 and 2, columns 1 and 2.

Icon 2: cells (7,8,10,11) – that's rows 3 and 4, columns 1 and 2.

Icon 3: cells (3,6,9,12) – that's rows 1 to 4, columns 3.

Wait, cell 3 is row 1, column 3; cell 6 is row 2, column 3; cell 9 is row 3, column 3; cell 12 is row 4, column 3. So, this is a vertical 2x2 icon.

So, it seems possible to place three 2x2 icons without overlapping: positions (1,2,4,5), (7,8,10,11), and (3,6,9,12).

Is there room for a fourth? Let's see.

Potential fourth icon could be in cells (13,14,15), but that's only three cells, which isn't a complete 2x2 icon. So, only three 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, but in the earlier example, placing three 2x2 icons seems to cover cells:

- Icon 1: 1,2,4,5

- Icon 2: 7,8,10,11

- Icon 3: 3,6,9,12

- Remaining cells: 13,14,15

So, only three 2x2 icons per screen.

But in the problem statement, it shows examples where fewer screens are used. For example, in the first test case, x=1, y=1, and it's possible to fit both on one screen.

Looking back at the first test case:

Input:

1 1

Output:

1

And the provided grid shows one screen with one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon.

So, apparently, it's possible to place both on one screen.

Similarly, for x=7, y=2, it's still one screen.

So, perhaps the approach is to prioritize placing the 2x2 icons first, as they take up more space, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

But I need a systematic way to calculate the minimum number of screens required.

Let me think about the total space required.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes 1 cell.

So, naively, the total cell requirement is 4*y + x cells.

Then, the minimum number of screens would be ceil((4*y + x)/15).

But wait, this doesn't account for the fact that 2x2 icons must be placed in 2x2 blocks, not just any 4 cells.

So, it's possible that even if the total cell requirement is satisfied, the icons might not fit due to grid constraints.

Looking back at the grid, each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, as per the earlier analysis, and some remaining space for 1x1 icons.

Let me calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, using 12 cells (3*4=12), leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if fewer 2x2 icons are placed, more space is left for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps the approach is:

1. Calculate how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons, since they take up more space.

2. Then, see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining space of those screens.

3. If there aren't enough spaces, add more screens accordingly.

Let's formalize this.

Let z be the number of screens needed.

Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons.

So, z = ceil(y / 3)

But wait, in the first test case, y=1, which is less than 3, so z=1, and x=1, which can be placed in the remaining space.

Similarly, for y=2, z=1, and x=7, which can be placed in the remaining space.

Wait, but in z=1, with y=2, the screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, but only two are used, leaving 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons, which matches x=7.

In another test case, x=12, y=4.

z = ceil(4 / 3) = 2 screens.

In two screens, can hold up to 6 2x2 icons, but only 4 are needed, using 16 cells.

Total cells used by 2x2 icons: 16.

Remaining cells in two screens: 30 - 16 = 14.

But x=12, which is less than 14, so fits in two screens.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

z = ceil(3 / 3) = 1 screen.

But in one screen, can hold up to three 2x2 icons, which is exactly y=3, so no problem.

But according to the sample input, for x=0, y=9, the output is 5.

Wait, y=9.

z = ceil(9 / 3) = 3 screens.

But in three screens, can hold up to 9 2x2 icons, which matches y=9.

But in the sample input, for x=0, y=9, output is 5, not 3.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the earlier analysis.

Let me check the sample input again.

Sample Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Sample Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

1

5

Wait, for y=9, z=ceil(9/3)=3, but sample output is 5.

Wait, perhaps each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons instead of three.

Let me re-examine the grid.

Earlier, I thought each screen can hold three 2x2 icons without overlapping.

But perhaps that's not possible.

Let me try to place three 2x2 icons on a single screen.

Option 1:

- Icon 1: cells (1,2,4,5)

- Icon 2: cells (7,8,10,11)

- Icon 3: cells (3,6,9,12)

Wait, do these icons overlap?

Looking at the cells:

- Icon 1: cells 1,2,4,5

- Icon 2: cells 7,8,10,11

- Icon 3: cells 3,6,9,12

Do any of these cells overlap? No, they are distinct.

So, it seems possible to place three 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Then, for y=9, z=ceil(9/3)=3 screens.

But according to the sample, it's 5 screens.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the icons can't be placed in certain positions due to the grid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2x2 icons must be placed in positions that align with the grid in a specific way.

Let me try to visualize this.

Considering the grid:

Row 1: 1 2 3

Row 2: 4 5 6

Row 3: 7 8 9

Row 4: 10 11 12

Row 5: 13 14 15

Now, a 2x2 icon can be placed starting at cells 1,2,4,5 or 2,3,5,6, etc.

But, in the earlier option, placing icons at (1,2,4,5), (7,8,10,11), and (3,6,9,12), these don't overlap.

So, perhaps my initial thought is correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 2x2 icons cannot be placed in a way that their positions don't allow for the maximum packing.

Alternatively, perhaps the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons isn't sufficient to place the 1x1 icons, requiring additional screens.

Wait, in the sample input where x=0, y=9, output is 5.

According to my earlier calculation, z=ceil(9/3)=3, but sample output is 5.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Let me consider that each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons.

Then, z=ceil(y/2).

For y=9, z=ceil(9/2)=5, which matches the sample output.

Wait, that seems to fit.

Similarly, for y=4, z=ceil(4/2)=2, which matches the sample input where x=12, y=4 outputs 2.

For y=2, z=1, which matches x=7, y=2 outputs 1.

For y=3, z=2, which matches x=0, y=3 outputs 2.

Yes, this seems consistent.

So, perhaps each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons.

But earlier, I thought it could hold three.

But according to the sample input, it seems that each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons.

So, maybe my initial assumption was wrong.

Perhaps there is a constraint I'm missing.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider the number of 2x2 icons per screen.

Given that each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells.

But 15 is not divisible by 4, so there will be some leftover cells.

If I place two 2x2 icons per screen, that's 8 cells used, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If I try to place three 2x2 icons, that would require 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

But in the sample input, for x=0, y=9, output is 5.

If each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, then z=ceil(9/2)=5 screens, which matches the sample.

If each screen could hold three 2x2 icons, z=ceil(9/3)=3 screens, which doesn't match the sample.

So, apparently, the constraint is that each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons.

But earlier, I thought it could hold three without overlapping.

Perhaps there's a restriction on the placement that I'm not considering.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to calculate this.

Let me consider the total space required.

Each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells, and each 1x1 icon requires 1 cell.

So, total cells needed: 4*y + x

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, naively, z = ceil((4*y + x)/15)

But in the sample input where x=0, y=9:

4*9 + 0 = 36 cells needed.

z = ceil(36/15) = ceil(2.4) = 3 screens, but sample output is 5.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Hence, the naive cell calculation doesn't work because of the grid constraints.

Therefore, there must be a different way to calculate the number of screens.

Looking back, if each screen can only hold two 2x2 icons, then z=ceil(y/2)

Then, remaining cells for 1x1 icons: 15 - 8 = 7 per screen.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed: 7 * z

If x <= 7 * z, then z screens are sufficient.

Else, need additional screens.

But in the sample input, for x=12, y=4:

z=ceil(4/2)=2 screens.

Remaining space for 1x1 icons: 7*2=14, which is greater than x=12, so fits.

For x=0, y=9:

z=ceil(9/2)=5 screens.

Remaining space for 1x1 icons: 7*5=35, which is more than x=0.

This matches the sample output.

Another sample input: x=7, y=2:

z=ceil(2/2)=1 screen.

Remaining space for 1x1 icons: 7*1=7, which is equal to x=7.

Hence, fits in one screen.

So, this seems consistent with the sample outputs.

Therefore, the approach should be:

- Calculate z = ceil(y / 2)

- Then, check if the remaining space can fit x 1x1 icons.

- If x <= 7 * z, then z screens are sufficient.

- Else, need additional screens to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

- The number of additional screens needed can be calculated as ceil((x - 7*z)/15)

- But need to ensure that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed in the additional screens.

Wait, but if z screens are already used for y 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons, and if x > 7*z, then need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The additional screens can hold up to 15 1x1 icons each.

So, additional screens needed = ceil((x - 7*z)/15)

Then, total screens = z + additional screens.

But in the sample inputs, it seems that z=ceil(y/2) is sufficient.

Wait, in the sample input where x=12, y=4:

z=ceil(4/2)=2 screens.

Remaining space for 1x1 icons: 7*2=14, which is greater than x=12, so no additional screens needed.

Hence, total screens = z = 2.

Another sample input: x=0, y=9:

z=ceil(9/2)=5 screens.

No 1x1 icons to place, so total screens = z = 5.

Seems consistent.

Another sample input: x=7, y=2:

z=ceil(2/2)=1 screen.

Remaining space for 1x1 icons: 7*1=7, which equals x=7, so fits in one screen.

Hence, total screens = z =1.

Seems correct.

Now, consider x=15, y=0:

z=ceil(0/2)=0 screens.

But x=15, which needs ceil(15/15)=1 screen.

So, in this case, total screens = max(z, ceil(x/15)) = max(0,1)=1.

But according to the sample input, for x=15, y=0, output is 1, which matches.

Another sample input: x=8, y=1:

z=ceil(1/2)=1 screen.

Remaining space for 1x1 icons: 7*1=7.

But x=8, which is more than 7.

So, additional screens needed: ceil((8-7)/15)=ceil(1/15)=1 screen.

Hence, total screens = z + 1 = 1 +1 =2.

But in the sample input, for x=8, y=1, output is 1.

Wait, this contradicts.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=8, y=1, output is 1.

But according to my calculation,
