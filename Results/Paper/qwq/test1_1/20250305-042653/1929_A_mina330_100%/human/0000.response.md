Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example to see what's going on. Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. The beauty would be (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Hmm, that's interesting. It seems like a lot of the differences might cancel out or have some pattern.

Wait a minute, if I look at the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) from i=2 to n, this is a telescoping sum. That means most terms cancel out. Let's see:

Sum = (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1})

When I expand this, all the a2, a3, ..., a_{n-1} terms cancel out, leaving me with an - a1. So, the beauty of the array is simply an - a1, where an is the last element and a1 is the first element in the rearranged array.

Wait, but Sasha can rearrange the array in any way he wants. So, he can choose the order of the elements to maximize this beauty, which is an - a1.

So, to maximize an - a1, I need to maximize an and minimize a1. In other words, make an as large as possible and a1 as small as possible.

Given that, the maximum possible beauty would be the maximum value in the array minus the minimum value in the array.

Wait, but in the example provided, for the array [2, 1, 3], the beauty is 2, which matches 3 - 1 = 2. And in the second test case, all elements are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0, which matches the output. In the third test case, [100, 54, 80, 43, 90], the beauty is 100 - 43 = 57, which matches the output.

So, it seems like the strategy is to sort the array and then subtract the smallest element from the largest element.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

ntest = int(input())

for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a, sorts it, and prints the difference between the last and first elements.

This aligns perfectly with the strategy I just derived. So, it seems correct.

But let me double-check with another example. Suppose the array is [3, 4, 3, 3]. According to the program, it would sort to [3, 3, 3, 4], and then 4 - 3 = 1, which matches the sample output.

Another example: [2, 1], sorted to [1, 2], and 2 - 1 = 1, which again matches the sample output.

Edge cases: What if all elements are the same? Like [5, 5, 5]. Then, sorted, it's still [5, 5, 5], and 5 - 5 = 0, which makes sense.

What if the array is already sorted? Like [1, 2, 3]. Beauty is 3 - 1 = 2, as in the first sample.

What if the array is sorted in reverse? Like [3, 2, 1]. Sorting it would still give 3 - 1 = 2.

So, in all these cases, the program seems to be giving the correct output.

Is there any case where this might not work? Let me think.

Suppose the array has negative numbers. For example, [-1, -3, -2]. Sorting gives [-3, -2, -1], and -1 - (-3) = -1 + 3 = 2, which seems correct.

Another case: [1, -1, 0]. Sorted: [-1, 0, 1], and 1 - (-1) = 2, which seems right.

What about an array with a single element? Wait, the problem says n >= 2, so I don't need to worry about that.

What about n = 2, the smallest possible n? For example, [5, 6], sorted to [5, 6], beauty is 6 - 5 = 1, which is correct.

Also, the constraints mention that n can be up to 100, and t up to 500, which is manageable in terms of time complexity, since sorting an array of 100 elements is fast.

So, overall, the program seems correct. It implements the strategy of sorting the array and subtracting the smallest element from the largest one, which matches the telescoping sum simplification I did earlier.

Therefore, the correctness is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
