Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should have two properties:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except for k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to make sure that my sequence doesn't exceed 25 elements.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is about selecting a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but every other value from 1 to n (except k) can be achieved as a sum of some subsequence.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the constraints on n are up to 10^6, it seems like the sequence should be carefully chosen to cover as much of the sum space as possible without hitting k.

One approach that comes to mind is to use a combination of small numbers and some specific larger numbers to cover the sum space efficiently. For example, using powers of 2, which allow you to represent any number by including or excluding certain elements.

Let's consider the binary representation. With powers of 2, you can represent any number uniquely. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], you can make any number from 1 to 15 by selecting appropriate subsets.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k while being able to make all other sums from 1 to n.

So, maybe I can start with a base sequence that covers all sums from 1 to some value, and then adjust it to avoid the sum k.

Let me think about the properties required.

If I have a set of numbers where all possible subsets sum to unique values, then I can control which sums are possible by choosing which subsets to include.

But ensuring that no subset sums to k while still covering all other sums is tricky.

Perhaps I can use the idea of inclusion-exclusion. That is, include some elements that allow me to make certain sums, and exclude others to block the sum k.

Another idea is to have a sequence where the sums cover a range up to a certain point, but then have a gap at k, and then continue covering up to n.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and the sequence can have at most 25 elements, so I need a sequence that can generate a lot of different sums.

I recall that with a set of 25 elements, the number of possible subsets is 2^25, which is over 33 million, but since we're dealing with sums, there might be overlaps.

But in this problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so I need to find a way to construct such a sequence.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first example:

Input:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Output:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

So, for n=2, k=2, the sequence is [1], which can only sum to 1, which is fine because we cannot sum to 2.

For n=6, k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which cannot sum to 1, but can sum to all other values from 2 to 6.

For n=8, k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum to any value from 1 to 7, but not 8.

For n=9, k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which should not have any subsets summing to 3, but can sum to all other values from 1 to 9 except 3.

Similarly, for n=10, k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], which should not have any subsets summing to 7, but can sum to all other values from 1 to 10 except 7.

From these examples, I can see that the sequences are chosen such that they cover the required sums but explicitly avoid the sum k.

Now, how can I generalize this?

One approach could be:

1. Start with a base sequence that can generate sums from 1 to n-k.

2. Then, add elements that allow generating sums from k+1 to n.

But this might not be straightforward.

Another approach is to use a sequence that includes small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that no combination adds up to k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where the sums can represent all numbers except k.

One way to achieve this is to have a sequence where the sums cover the entire range from 1 to n, except for k.

But constructing such a sequence directly is not easy.

An alternative idea is to start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

For example, if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I want to exclude the sum k, I can try to remove or adjust certain elements in the sequence so that k cannot be achieved, while keeping the ability to achieve all other sums.

But this might not be straightforward, as removing an element affects multiple sums.

Another idea is to split the sum space into parts: one part that includes sums up to k-1, and another part that includes sums from k+1 to n.

I can try to construct two subsequences: one that covers sums from 1 to k-1, and another that covers sums from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that these two parts don't combine to form the sum k.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need a sequence that can generate a large number of different sums.

Powers of 2 are good for this purpose because they can represent any number via their subsets.

For example, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...] can represent any number by including or excluding these elements.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k while still covering all other sums up to n.

So, maybe I can start with a set of powers of 2 up to some limit, and then adjust it to exclude the sum k.

Wait, but with powers of 2, each sum is unique, so if I exclude k, I just need to make sure that k is not present in any subset sum.

But since powers of 2 allow unique subset sums, if k is not present in the sequence, then no subset will sum to k.

But I need to make sure that all other sums from 1 to n are achievable.

However, with powers of 2, the sums can go up to the sum of the sequence, but the sequence size is limited to 25 elements.

So, with 25 elements, the maximum sum is very large, much larger than n=10^6.

But the problem is that if I use powers of 2, I can represent any number uniquely up to the sum of the sequence, but I need to exclude only one specific sum, k.

So, if I include all powers of 2 up to a certain point, I can represent all sums except k, but I need to make sure that k cannot be formed.

But with powers of 2, each sum is unique, so if k is not in the sequence, then no subset sums to k.

Wait, but k could be a sum of a subset even if it's not directly an element.

So, if k is not among the powers of 2, but it can be formed by summing some subset of them, then I need to adjust the sequence to prevent that.

Wait, but with powers of 2, each number has a unique binary representation, so only one subset sums to each number.

Therefore, if k is within the sum range, there is exactly one subset that sums to k.

To prevent any subset from summing to k, I need to exclude at least one element that would otherwise allow the sum k to be formed.

But if I exclude the element that corresponds to k in its binary representation, then no subset will sum to k.

But I need to ensure that all other sums are still achievable.

This seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Suppose I have a sequence consisting of powers of 2: [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^{24}], since 25 elements are allowed.

The sum of this sequence is 2^{25} - 1, which is way larger than n=10^6.

Now, for a given k, if I exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, then the subset sums will cover all numbers except those that include that particular bit.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me think differently.

If I have the full set of powers of 2 up to some m, I can represent any number up to m.

To exclude k, I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

Then, any subset that would have included that element to reach k is no longer possible, because that element is missing.

However, this might also affect other sums that require that bit.

So, perhaps I need a more精细的 approach.

Wait, perhaps I can include all powers of 2 except the one that is equal to k, if k is a power of 2.

But if k is not a power of 2, then k is a sum of multiple powers of 2.

In that case, excluding one of those powers would prevent k from being formed, but might also affect other sums.

This seems too simplistic.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=10, k=7.

Powers of 2 up to 16 are: [1,2,4,8].

Sum of these is 15, which is greater than n=10.

Now, 7 in binary is 111, which is 1+2+4.

So, if I exclude any of 1,2, or 4, I can prevent the sum 7 from being formed.

But if I exclude 4, then I can't form sums that require 4, like 5 (1+4), 6 (2+4), etc.

Similarly, excluding 2 would prevent sums like 3,6, etc.

Excluding 1 would prevent sums like 1,3,5,7, etc.

None of these seem suitable because they prevent too many sums.

Alternatively, maybe I can include an element that is equal to k, but then adjust the sequence so that k cannot be formed.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can.

Another idea: maybe include elements that cover the sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

But how to do that efficiently in at most 25 elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed to cover sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

If I use a greedy approach, starting with the smallest elements to cover the lower sums, and then adding larger elements to cover higher sums, while skipping k.

But this might not be efficient enough, especially since n can be up to 10^6.

Wait, perhaps I can use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and then add larger numbers to cover the higher sums, ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with an empty sequence.

- Iteratively add elements that allow me to cover as many new sums as possible without allowing the sum k to be formed.

This sounds similar to building a set that covers all sums except k.

But implementing this directly might be too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the properties of the sequence.

Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and n can be up to 10^6, I need elements that can cover a large range of sums.

Powers of 2 are good for this, as they allow for a lot of unique sums.

But as I thought earlier, excluding k is tricky.

Another idea: include elements that are just 1's.

For example, if I have m=7 elements, all equal to 1, then I can form sums from 0 to 7.

But in this case, I can only form sums up to m, which is 7, but n can be up to 10^6, so this isn't sufficient.

Wait, but in one of the examples, for n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can form sums from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

But in this case, n=8, and k=8, so it's acceptable.

But for larger n, this approach won't work.

So, perhaps a combination of 1's and larger numbers.

Wait, in the example where n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can form sums like 1,2 (1+1), 4, 5 (1+4), 7, 8 (1+7), 11 (7+4), etc., but not 3.

So, it's possible to skip certain sums by carefully choosing the elements.

This seems promising.

Let me think about how to generalize this.

One possible approach is:

- Start with a base sequence that can cover sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

- To do this, include elements that allow covering the required sums without allowing the sum k to be formed.

But this is still too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a sequence A with m elements.

The sum of subsets of A can be represented as the set of all possible sums of combinations of these elements.

I need to ensure that k is not in this set, but all other sums from 1 to n are present.

Given that m <= 25, and n can be up to 10^6, it's crucial to choose A such that it can generate a wide range of sums.

One way to maximize the number of sums is to have elements that are powers of 2, as they can generate any sum uniquely.

But since I need to exclude k, I need to modify this approach.

An alternative idea is to use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, making sure that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Start with an empty sequence A.

2. Initialize a set S that represents the sums that can be formed with subsets of A. Initially, S = {0}.

3. Iterate through numbers from 1 to n, and for each number v:

a. If v != k and v is not in S, find an element x to add to A such that v can be formed with subsets of A.

b. Ensure that k cannot be formed with any subset of A.

This seems too vague and may not be efficient enough for n up to 10^6.

I need a more efficient method.

Let me consider the fact that with m elements, I can have up to 2^m subsets, which for m=25 is over 33 million, way more than n=10^6.

So, it's feasible to cover all required sums with 25 elements.

But how to choose those elements optimally?

Another idea: use a minimal set of elements to cover all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

This sounds similar to a set cover problem, but for sums.

But set cover is NP-hard, and I need an efficient solution.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to select the elements.

Define dp[v] to be True if sum v can be formed with the current sequence A.

Initialize dp[0] = True.

Then, iteratively add elements to A such that new sums are covered, avoiding k.

But n is up to 10^6, so a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to select the elements.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence A, and I want to ensure that no subset sums to k, but all other sums from 1 to n are possible.

One way to ensure that no subset sums to k is to make sure that any subset that would sum to k is blocked.

But this is too vague.

Another idea: use the fact that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then I'm done.

But how to construct such a sequence?

Wait, perhaps I can start with a sequence that generates all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

For example, if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I want to prevent the sum k, I can remove or adjust certain elements so that k cannot be formed, while keeping the ability to form all other sums.

But this seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n - k.

- Then, add k + 1 to the sequence.

- This way, sums from k + 1 to n can be generated by adding k + 1 to the sums from 1 to n - k.

- However, this might not cover all sums, especially around k.

This needs more thought.

Wait, perhaps I can split the sum range into two parts: 1 to k - 1 and k + 1 to n.

Then, construct two separate sequences that cover these ranges, and combine them.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This might work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let A be the sequence for sums 1 to k - 1.

Let B be the sequence for sums k + 1 to n.

Then, the combined sequence C = A + B should not have any subset that sums to k.

But I need to ensure that no subset of C sums to k.

This could be achieved if no subset of B sums to k, and no combination of A and B sums to k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to choose A such that:

- For every v from 1 to n, v != k, there exists a subset of A that sums to v.

- No subset of A sums to k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and m <= 25, I need an efficient way to cover the sum space except for k.

Another idea: use a sequence that includes all numbers from 1 to some value, but exclude k.

But if I include numbers up to k - 1, I can cover sums up to (k - 1)*m, which for m=25 and k up to 10^6 is not sufficient.

Wait, for example, if k=1000000 and n=1000000, and m=25, including 25 ones would only allow sums up to 25, which is far from 1000000.

So, that won't work.

I need larger elements in the sequence to cover larger sums.

But including large elements might allow sums that exceed n, which is acceptable, as long as all sums from 1 to n except k are covered.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, so I need a sequence that can cover sums up to 10^6 with 25 elements.

This suggests that the sequence should include some large elements, possibly powers of 2 or something similar.

But as previously thought, powers of 2 allow unique subset sums, but I need to adjust them to exclude k.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I have a sequence A, and I want to ensure that no subset sums to k.

One way to do this is to ensure that for any subset that would sum to k, there's some element in A that, if included or excluded, changes the sum in such a way that k cannot be reached.

This sounds too vague; I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following algorithm:

- Start with an empty sequence A.

- Initialize a set S that represents the sums that can be formed with subsets of A. Initially, S = {0}.

- For each integer v from 1 to n, if v != k and v not in S:

- Add v to A.

- Update S with all new sums that can be formed with the current A.

- After adding elements in this way, check that k is not in S.

This is a greedy approach to cover all sums except k.

But in this approach, I might end up with more than 25 elements, which is not allowed.

So, I need to modify this approach to limit the number of elements to 25.

Moreover, for n up to 10^6, this approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements required to cover sums from 1 to n excluding k.

If I use powers of 2, I can cover a large sum range with few elements.

But I need to adjust it to exclude k.

Another idea: use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But again, this is too vague.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: k = 1.

In this case, I need to ensure that no subset sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are possible.

One way to do this is to include elements all greater than 1, such as [2, 3, 4, ..., up to some value].

But with m <= 25, I need to choose elements carefully.

For example, for n=6 and k=1, the sample output is [2,3,4,5,6], which can cover sums from 2 to 6, and no subset sums to 1.

This works because all elements are >=2.

Similarly, for n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum to 1 through 7, but not 8.

Wait, but in this case, m=7, which is within 25.

But for larger n, this approach may not suffice.

Another example: n=9 and k=3, sequence is [7,1,4,1].

This can sum to:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1,1]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1,4]

- 6: [1,1,4]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [1,7]

- 9: [1,1,7]

But it cannot sum to 3.

So, it's possible to construct such sequences.

Looking at this sequence, [7,1,4,1], it's a combination of small numbers and a large number.

The small numbers cover the lower sums, and the large number allows covering higher sums.

This seems like a general approach.

So, perhaps I can include some small numbers to cover the lower sums and include larger numbers to cover higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

Another idea: use the minimal number of elements to cover the required sums.

For example, use as many 1's as needed to cover sums up to some value, and then include larger elements to cover higher sums.

But again, this needs to be formalized.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with an empty sequence A.

- Initialize a set S = {0}.

- For each integer v from 1 to n, if v != k and v not in S:

- Add v to A.

- Update S with all new sums that can be formed with the current A.

- After adding elements, check that k is not in S.

- If k is in S, remove the element that causes the sum k to be formed.

But this might not work, as removing an element could affect other sums.

This seems too ad-hoc.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the fact that with m=25 elements, I can cover a large sum range, but I need to ensure that k is excluded.

Another idea: use a base sequence that can cover sums up to some value, and then adjust it to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sequence that covers all sums from 1 to n except k by carefully choosing elements that allow overlapping sums.

But this is still too vague.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

In the first sample:

Input:

2 2

Output:

1

1

Here, n=2, k=2.

Sequence: [1]

This can sum to 1, but not 2.

Simple enough.

Second sample:

6 1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Here, n=6, k=1.

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

This can sum to 2,3,4,5,6, but not 1.

Third sample:

8 8

Output:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Sums: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, but not 8.

Fourth sample:

9 3

Output:

4

7 1 4 1

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Sums: 1,2 (1+1), 4,5 (1+4), 7,8 (1+7),9 (1+1+7), but not 3.

Fifth sample:

10 7

Output:

4

1 2 8 3

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Sums:

1: [1]

2: [2]

3: [3]

4: [1,3]

5: [2,3]

6: [1,2,3]

7: [7] (Wait, but 7 is in the sequence, so this is invalid.

Wait, no, the sequence is [1,2,8,3], and 7 is not directly in the sequence, but 7 can be formed by 1+2+4, but 4 is not in the sequence.

Wait, 8 is in the sequence, but 8 cannot be used to form 7.

Wait, actually, with [1,2,8,3], possible sums are:

1: [1]

2: [2]

3: [3]

4: [1,3]

5: [2,3]

6: [1,2,3]

7: [1,2,4] (but 4 is not in the sequence)

Wait, but 8 can be combined with others, but 8 is larger than 7, so it's unlikely to be used in summing to 7.

So, in this sequence, sums from 1 to 6 and 8,9,10 can be formed, but not 7.

This seems correct.

So, in this sequence, by choosing elements 1,2,3,8, we can cover sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

This suggests that with careful selection of elements, we can cover the required sums while excluding k.

Now, I need to generalize this approach.

One possible way is:

- Start by including elements that cover the sums from 1 to k-1.

- Then, include elements that cover the sums from k+1 to n.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

But I need to make sure that the elements are chosen in such a way that k cannot be formed.

Let me consider the following plan:

- If k == 1:

- Include elements all >=2, up to n.

- For example, [2,3,4,...,n].

- But m can be up to n-1, which may exceed 25.

- So, need a better way.

- Else:

- Include small elements to cover sums up to k-1.

- Include elements to cover sums from k+1 to n, without allowing any subset to sum to k.

This still needs refinement.

Let me think about the case when k !=1.

In such cases, I can include elements that are >=2, but I need to cover sums up to n, which may require larger elements.

Wait, perhaps I can include some 1's to cover the lower sums and then include larger elements to cover the higher sums.

For example, in the fourth sample, [7,1,4,1], which includes two 1's and then 4 and 7.

This allows covering sums up to 9, excluding 3.

Similarly, in the fifth sample, [1,2,8,3], which covers sums up to 10, excluding 7.

So, perhaps including some small numbers and one large number that is greater than k.

Let me think about this.

Suppose I include elements that are less than k and one large element that is greater than k.

Then, I can cover sums up to the large element plus the sum of the small elements, excluding k.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

- If k ==1:

- Include elements all >=2, such that their sums cover 2 to n.

- For example, [2,3,4,...], but need to limit the number of elements to 25.

- Else:

- Include elements less than k and one or more elements greater than k.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k ==1:

- Include elements [2,3,4,..., up to some value], but need to limit to 25 elements.

- For example, include [2,3,4,...,26], which is 25 elements.

- This can cover sums from 2 to the sum of these elements, which is much larger than n=10^6.

- For k !=1:

- Include some small elements to cover sums up to k-1.

- Include some larger elements to cover sums from k+1 to n.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

But I need to make sure that the combination of small and large elements doesn't allow summing to k.

This is still too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a base sequence and then adjust it based on k.

For example, start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the sum k.

One way to do this is to remove an element that is necessary to form the sum k.

But this might affect other sums as well.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=9, k=3.

Base sequence: [1,2,4,2].

Sum of subsets:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2], [1+1]

- 3: [1+2]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1+4]

- 6: [2+4], [1+1+4]

- 7: [1+2+4]

- 8: [2+4+2], [1+1+4+2]

- 9: [1+2+4+2]

But I need to exclude sum 3, which is [1+2].

So, if I remove the element 2, then sum 2 and sum 3 are both impossible.

But I need sum 2 to be possible.

Alternatively, if I remove one 2, then sum 3 becomes impossible, but sum 2 is still possible via the other 2.

But in this case, sum 3 is still possible via [1+2] if there's another 2.

Wait, in the sequence [1,2,4,2], sum 3 can be formed by [1+2], and also by [1+2] using the other 2.

So, to prevent sum 3, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to 3.

One way is to remove one of the 2's, so the sequence becomes [1,4,2], which can sum to:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1+2]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1+4]

- 6: [2+4]

- 7: [1+2+4]

But sum 3 is still possible.

Wait, maybe I need to remove 1 and one 2, but then sum 3 becomes impossible.

Wait, if I have [4,2], sums are 2,4,6.

But then sums like 1,3,5,7 are impossible.

This doesn't cover all sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

So, this approach isn't working.

Another idea: include elements such that their sums cover all values except k.

But I need a systematic way to choose the elements.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, modify the sequence to prevent the sum k from being formed.

- Ensure that all other sums from 1 to n are still possible.

But how to modify the sequence to exclude only k?

This seems difficult.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

If I use powers of 2, each sum is unique.

So, if I exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, then sum k cannot be formed.

But this might affect other sums.

Wait, let's see.

Suppose k=5, which is 101 in binary.

If I have [1,2,4,8], sum k=5 is formed by 1+4.

If I exclude 4, then sum 5 cannot be formed, but sums that require 4 are also affected.

For example, sum 5, sum 6 (2+4), sum 7 (1+2+4), etc., are all affected.

This is not desirable, as I need to cover all sums except k.

So, excluding a single element might not be sufficient.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider including elements that sum to all values except k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that cover the sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n by carefully choosing elements that don't allow the sum k to be formed.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to s, except k.

If I can find such a sequence with m elements, that would suffice.

But I need to find a general method to construct such a sequence for any n and k.

This is proving to be challenging.

Let me look back at the problem constraints.

- t <=1000 test cases.

- n <=10^6, k <=n.

- Sum of n over all test cases <=10^7.

- Sequence size m <=25.

Given that, I need an efficient solution, both in terms of time and space.

Let me consider precomputing some sequences or using precalculated values.

But with t=1000 and n up to 10^6, precomputing might not be feasible.

I need a per-test-case solution.

Let me consider the following approach:

- If k ==1:

- Include elements starting from 2 up to some value, ensuring that their sums cover 2 to n.

- Since m <=25, I can include [2,3,4,...,26], which allows sums up to 351, which is sufficient for n=10^6.

- Wait, but 2+3+...+26 is (26*27)/2 -1 = 351 -1=350, which is still far from n=10^6.

- So, I need to include larger elements.

- For k !=1:

- Include some small elements to cover sums up to k-1.

- Include some larger elements to cover sums from k+1 to n.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

Let me think about the fact that with m=25 elements, I can cover a large sum range, but I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

This reminds me of the concept of a minimal set that covers all sums except k.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Start with a base sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, excluding k.

- To do this, choose elements such that their subset sums cover all values from 1 to n except k.

- To achieve this, include elements that allow generating the required sums without allowing the sum k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element that is necessary for sum k, then sum k cannot be formed.

But this might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, if I can find a sequence where sum k cannot be formed, but all other sums can, that would suffice.

But how to construct such a sequence?

Let me consider the following approach:

- Choose a sequence that includes elements that are just 1's and one large element.

- For example, include m-1 elements of 1 and one large element.

- This way, sums from 1 to m-1 can be formed with the 1's, and larger sums can be formed by adding the large element to the 1's.

- However, this might not cover all sums up to n, especially for larger n.

Wait, for example, with m=4:

- Include [1,1,1,1000000].

- Sums: 1,2,3,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003.

- But this doesn't cover sums from 4 to 999999.

So, this approach isn't sufficient.

I need a better way to choose the elements.

Let me consider including elements that are powers of 2, but adjust them based on k.

For example, if k is a power of 2, exclude that specific power.

But if k is not a power of 2, it's more complicated.

Wait, in the earlier example, for n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1].

Here, sums are:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [1,1]

- 4: [4]

- 5: [1,4]

- 6: [1,1,4]

- 7: [7]

- 8: [1,7]

- 9: [1,1,7]

- And no sum to 3.

So, in this case, by choosing elements 7,1,4,1, sums cover all from 1 to 9 except 3.

This suggests that including a large element (7) and some small elements (1,1,4) allows covering the required sums.

Similarly, in the fifth sample, for n=10 and k=7, sequence is [1,2,8,3].

Sums:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [3]

- 4: [1,3]

- 5: [2,3]

- 6: [1,2,3]

- 7: cannot be formed.

- 8: [8]

- 9: [1,8]

- 10: [2,8]

So, it covers all sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

This indicates that with careful selection of elements, I can cover the required sums while excluding k.

Now, I need to generalize this approach.

One possible way is to include elements that cover the sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n, without allowing any subset to sum to k.

But I need a systematic way to choose these elements.

Let me consider the following plan:

- If k ==1:

- Include elements starting from 2 up to some value, ensuring that their sums cover 2 to n.

- To limit the number of elements to 25, include [2,3,4,...,26], which can cover sums up to 351, but for n=10^6, this is insufficient.

- Wait, but n=2 in the first sample, so for larger n, this approach needs adjustment.

- Perhaps include larger elements in addition to small ones.

- For k !=1:

- Include some small elements to cover sums up to k-1.

- Include some larger elements to cover sums from k+1 to n.

- Ensure that no subset sums to k.

But I need a better way to choose the elements.

Let me consider that with m=25 elements, I can cover a large sum range by including elements that are powers of 2, but adjust for k.

Wait, perhaps I can include powers of 2 up to a certain point, and then adjust the sequence to exclude k.

For example, include [1,2,4,8,..., up to 2^{m-1}], which allows covering all sums from 1 to 2^m -1.

Then, to exclude k, I can remove the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

But as I thought earlier, this might affect other sums.

Another idea: include elements that are just enough to cover the required sums.

For example, include elements that are differences between consecutive sums needed.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for k ==1, it's straightforward: include elements starting from 2 upwards.

For k !=1, I need to ensure that sum k is impossible, but all other sums are possible.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are multiples of some value, but this might not cover all sums.

This seems too simplistic.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are all greater than or equal to some value, I can exclude certain sums.

But I need a more precise approach.

Let me consider that in order to prevent any subset from summing to k, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

This is equivalent to saying that the set of elements does not contain any subset that sums to k.

This is similar to the subset sum problem, which is NP-complete, but since m is small (<=25), it's feasible to check all subsets.

But generating
