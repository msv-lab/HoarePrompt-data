Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, using this process.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of its sides. So, if he has a rectangle of size a by b, he can cut it into two rectangles of sizes, say, a by c and a by (b - c), if he cuts horizontally, or b by c and b by (a - c), if he cuts vertically. Here, c is some integer between 1 and b-1 for horizontal cuts, or between 1 and a-1 for vertical cuts.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles, and he can rotate and move them around to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle's area will be the same as the original one, since he's just rearranging the pieces. But the dimensions might be different, considering rotations.

The problem states that two rectangles are considered the same if they are rotations of each other. So, for example, a 2x3 rectangle is the same as a 3x2 rectangle.

My task is to determine, for given a and b, whether Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering the rotation rule.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

1 1

He has a 1x1 square. He can't cut it into two smaller rectangles because one of the dimensions would have to be zero, which doesn't make sense. So, he can't get another rectangle, and the answer is "No."

In the second test case:

2 1

He can cut it into two 1x1 squares. From these two squares, he can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original rectangle up to rotation. So, no new rectangle, answer is "No."

In the third test case:

2 6

He can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles. From these, he can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle, even after rotation. So, answer is "Yes."

In the fourth test case:

3 2

He can cut it into two 3x1 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2 rectangle. So, "Yes."

In the fifth test case:

2 2

He can cut it into two 1x2 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2 square. So, "Yes."

In the sixth test case:

2 4

He can cut it into two 2x2 rectangles. From these, he can form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4 rectangle up to rotation. Wait, but according to the example, the answer is "Yes." Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let's look back at the example outputs:

7

1 1 No

2 1 No

2 6 Yes

3 2 Yes

2 2 Yes

2 4 Yes

6 3 No

So, for 2 4, it's "Yes," but according to my earlier thought, forming a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4 up to rotation. So why is it "Yes"? Maybe there's another way to cut and rearrange.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider different cutting options.

For 2x4:

- If he cuts horizontally, he can get two 2x2 rectangles. From these, he can put them side by side to make a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

- Alternatively, he can put them one above the other to make a 2x4 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- Is there another way to cut the 2x4 rectangle?

- If he cuts vertically, say into two 1x4 rectangles. Then, he can put them side by side to make a 2x4 rectangle, or one above the other to make a 1x8 rectangle.

- A 1x8 rectangle is different from the original 2x4 rectangle, so that would be a new rectangle.

- Therefore, the answer is "Yes."

Ah, I see. So, in this case, cutting vertically into two 1x4 rectangles allows him to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4 rectangle.

Similarly, in the 6x3 case:

- If he cuts horizontally, he can get two 6x1 and 6x2 rectangles. From these, he can try to form new rectangles.

- For example, putting two 6x1 rectangles side by side makes a 6x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3 if 6x2 is considered the same as 3x4, but I'm not sure.

- Wait, 6x2 is different from 6x3, so maybe it's considered different.

- Alternatively, cutting vertically, he can cut into two 3x3 rectangles. From these, he can put them side by side to make a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original up to rotation.

- Or, put them one above the other to make a 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

- So, in this case, it seems like he can't form a new rectangle, hence "No."

Okay, so from these examples, I need to find a way to cut the rectangle such that the two pieces can be rearranged into a new rectangle that isn't the same as the original up to rotation.

Let me try to generalize this.

Given a rectangle of size a x b, Bob can:

1. Cut it horizontally into two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where 1 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

2. Cut it vertically into two rectangles of size c x b and (a - c) x b, where 1 ≤ c ≤ a-1.

Then, from these two pieces, he can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle.

Considering that rotation is allowed, two rectangles are the same if one can be rotated to match the other.

So, for example, a x b is the same as b x a.

My task is to check if there's any way to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a rectangle that is not the same as the original one.

In other words, can Bob form a rectangle with dimensions p x q, where p x q = a x b (since area remains the same), but p x q is not the same as a x b up to rotation? Meaning, p != a or p != b, considering p and q can be rotated.

Wait, more precisely, p x q is different from a x b and b x a.

So, to rephrase, can Bob form a rectangle with dimensions p x q such that p != a and q != b, or p != b and q != a?

Because if p == a and q == b, or p == b and q == a, it's the same as the original.

But, since he's forming a new rectangle from two pieces, there might be constraints on what p and q can be.

Let me think differently.

Suppose the area is A = a * b.

Bob needs to form a new rectangle with the same area A, but with dimensions p and q such that p * q = A, and (p, q) is not the same as (a, b) up to rotation.

But, he has constraints because he's forming it from two smaller rectangles.

Let me consider the possible ways to cut the original rectangle.

Case 1: Horizontal cut.

- He gets two rectangles: a x c and a x (b - c).

- He can arrange these two rectangles either side by side horizontally or vertically.

- If he puts them side by side horizontally, he gets a rectangle of size a x (c + (b - c)) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- If he puts them one above the other vertically, he gets a rectangle of size (a + a) x c or (a + a) x (b - c), depending on how he arranges them.

Wait, no.

If he has two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), and he puts them side by side horizontally, he gets a rectangle of size a x (c + (b - c)) = a x b, which is the original.

If he puts them one above the other vertically, he gets a rectangle of size (a + a) x c, but that doesn't make sense because the heights would need to match.

Wait, no. If he has two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), both have height a and widths c and b - c.

If he puts them side by side horizontally, he gets a rectangle of size a x (c + (b - c)) = a x b.

If he puts them one above the other vertically, he needs to align their widths, but their widths are different (c and b - c), so unless c = b - c, which would require c = b/2, which may not be integer, he can't put them one above the other vertically.

Wait, actually, if he rotates one of them, he can make their widths match.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Each rectangle is a x c and a x (b - c).

If he rotates the a x c rectangle to c x a, and the a x (b - c) rectangle to (b - c) x a, then he can put them side by side horizontally to get a rectangle of size (c + (b - c)) x a = b x a, which is the same as the original.

Or, he can put them one above the other vertically, but their widths are a, so the total height would be c + (b - c) = b, so b x a, same as original.

So, in this case, he can't get a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the 2x6 example, the solution says "Yes," so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the 2x6 example, if he cuts horizontally into two 2x3 rectangles, then he can put them side by side horizontally to get 2x6, which is the original, or one above the other to get 4x3, which is different.

So, in this case, he can get a 4x3 rectangle from the original 2x6.

Similarly, in the 3x2 example, he can cut into two 3x1 rectangles and put them side by side to get 3x2, or one above the other to get 6x1, which is different from the original 3x2.

Wait, but in the 2x1 example, he cuts into two 1x1 squares and can only form 1x2, which is the same as 2x1.

So, what's the general rule here?

Let me see.

It seems that if at least one of the dimensions is even, he can cut it in half and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle.

Wait, in the 2x6 example, a = 2 (even), b = 6 (even).

In the 3x2 example, a = 3, b = 2, where a is odd, b is even.

In the 2x2 example, both even.

In the 2x4 example, both even.

In the 6x3 example, a = 6 (even), b = 3 (odd).

From the examples, the answers are:

1x1: No

2x1: No

2x6: Yes

3x2: Yes

2x2: Yes

2x4: Yes

6x3: No

Looking for a pattern:

- If both a and b are odd: No

- If one is even and one is odd: Yes?

Wait, 3x2: a=3 (odd), b=2 (even): Yes

2x1: a=2 (even), b=1 (odd): No

Wait, conflicting.

- 2x1: even and odd: No

- 3x2: odd and even: Yes

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's more about whether a and b share any common factors.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both powers of the same prime.

Wait, I need a better approach.

Let me think in terms of the greatest common divisor (GCD).

If GCD(a, b) > 1, then perhaps he can form a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, GCD(2,1)=1: No

In 2x2, GCD(2,2)=2: Yes

In 3x2, GCD(3,2)=1: Yes?

Wait, conflicting again.

Hmm.

Maybe it's about whether a*b is a perfect square.

If a*b is a perfect square, then the rectangle is "square-like," but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even or both odd.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, both even: Yes

In the 3x2 case, one odd, one even: Yes

In the 2x1 case, one even, one odd: No

In the 1x1 case, both odd: No

In the 2x2 case, both even: Yes

In the 2x4 case, both even: Yes

In the 6x3 case, one even, one odd: No

So, when both are even, Yes

When one is even and one is odd, sometimes Yes, sometimes No

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, one even, one odd: No

In the 3x2 case, one odd, one even: Yes

So, perhaps it's about whether the smaller dimension is even.

Wait, in 2x1, the smaller is 1, which is odd: No

In 3x2, smaller is 2, which is even: Yes

In 2x6, both even: Yes

In 1x1, both odd: No

In 2x2, both even: Yes

In 2x4, both even: Yes

In 6x3, smaller is 3, which is odd: No

So, perhaps if the smaller dimension is even, then Yes, else No.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, smaller is 1, odd: No

In the 3x2 case, smaller is 2, even: Yes

In the 1x1 case, smaller is 1, odd: No

In the 2x2 case, smaller is 2, even: Yes

In the 2x4 case, smaller is 2, even: Yes

In the 6x3 case, smaller is 3, odd: No

So, this seems to hold.

Hence, the rule is: if the smaller dimension is even, then Yes, else No.

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, smaller is 1, which is odd: No

In the 2x6 case, smaller is 2, even: Yes

In the 3x2 case, smaller is 2, even: Yes

In the 6x3 case, smaller is 3, odd: No

So, this seems consistent with the examples.

Therefore, the condition is: if the smaller dimension is even, output "Yes"; else, "No."

But wait, in the 1x1 case, smaller is 1, odd: No

In the 2x2 case, smaller is 2, even: Yes

So, seems consistent.

But, is this always true?

Let me think of another test case.

Take a=4, b=2

Smaller is 2, even: Yes

Can I cut it and form a new rectangle?

If I cut horizontally into two 4x1 rectangles, then I can put them side by side to get 4x2, which is the original, or one above the other to get 8x1, which is different from the original 4x2.

So, yes, "Yes."

Another test case: a=5, b=3

Smaller is 3, odd: No

Can I cut it and form a new rectangle?

If I cut horizontally into two 5x1 and 5x2 rectangles.

From these, I can put them side by side to get 5x3, which is the original, or one above the other.

If I rotate them, I can get 1x5 and 2x5, put them side by side horizontally to get (1+2)x5 = 3x5, which is the same as 5x3, so no new rectangle.

Hence, "No."

Another test case: a=4, b=3

Smaller is 3, odd: No

Can I cut it and form a new rectangle?

If I cut horizontally into two 4x1 and 4x2 rectangles.

From these, I can put them side by side to get 4x3, original.

Or one above the other to get 8x1, which is different from 4x3.

Wait, but 8x1 has area 8, while original area is 12, which doesn't match.

Wait, area must be the same, so I must arrange two rectangles of 4x1 and 4x2 to form a new rectangle with area 12.

If I put them side by side horizontally, 4x(1+2)=4x3, original.

If I put them one above the other vertically, I need to align their widths.

If I rotate the 4x1 to 1x4 and the 4x2 to 2x4, then I can put them side by side horizontally to get (1+2)x4=3x4, which is the same as 4x3.

So, no new rectangle.

Hence, "No."

Another test case: a=6, b=4

Smaller is 4, even: Yes

Can I cut it and form a new rectangle?

If I cut horizontally into two 6x2 rectangles.

From these, I can put them side by side to get 6x4, original, or one above the other to get 12x2, which is different from 6x4.

So, "Yes."

Another test case: a=5, b=5

Smaller is 5, odd: No

Can I cut it and form a new rectangle?

If I cut horizontally into two 5x2 and 5x3 rectangles.

From these, I can put them side by side to get 5x5, original, or one above the other to get 10x2, which is different from 5x5.

But 10x2 has area 20, while original area is 25, which doesn't match.

Wait, area must be the same.

So, I must arrange two rectangles of 5x2 and 5x3 to form a new rectangle with area 25.

If I put them side by side horizontally, 5x(2+3)=5x5, original.

If I put them one above the other vertically, I need to align their widths.

If I rotate them to 2x5 and 3x5, then put them side by side horizontally to get (2+3)x5=5x5, original.

So, no new rectangle.

Hence, "No."

So, based on these test cases, the rule seems to hold: if the smaller dimension is even, then "Yes"; else, "No."

But, is this always true?

Let me think about a general case.

Let a and b be the dimensions, with a ≤ b.

If a is even, then we can cut the rectangle horizontally into two rectangles of size a/2 x b.

Then, we can put these two rectangles side by side horizontally to get a x b, original, or one above the other vertically to get a x (b + b) = a x (2*b), which is different from the original a x b.

Wait, but area would be a * 2b, which is twice the original area, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

No, when cutting into two a x (b/2) rectangles, if b is even.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider both dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that at least one of the dimensions is even.

In the 2x1 case, one dimension is even: Yes, but according to our earlier rule, it's "No."

Wait, no, in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd): "No"

But according to the earlier rule, if at least one is even, it should be "Yes," but in the example, it's "No."

So, that can't be it.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether both dimensions are odd or not.

If both are odd, "No"; otherwise, "Yes."

But in the 6x3 case, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd): "No"

Which contradicts this rule.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether a divides b or b divides a.

In the 2x1 case, 2 divides 1? No.

In the 2x6 case, 2 divides 6: Yes.

In the 3x2 case, 3 divides 2: No.

Wait, no, 2 divides 6: Yes, but in the 3x2 case, 3 doesn't divide 2.

Wait, perhaps it's more about whether a or b is divisible by 2.

But that seems similar to the earlier idea.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both powers of the same prime.

But that seems too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b have a common factor greater than 1.

In the 2x1 case, GCD(2,1)=1: No

In the 2x6 case, GCD(2,6)=2: Yes

In the 3x2 case, GCD(3,2)=1: Yes?

Wait, but according to the example, it's "Yes"

Wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, GCD(3,2)=1: Yes

In the 2x1 case, GCD(2,1)=1: No

In the 2x2 case, GCD(2,2)=2: Yes

In the 6x3 case, GCD(6,3)=3: No

So, when GCD(a,b) > 1, it's "Yes"; when GCD(a,b)=1, it's "Yes" in some cases and "No" in others.

Wait, no, in the 3x2 case, GCD=1: Yes

In the 2x1 case, GCD=1: No

In the 6x3 case, GCD=3: No

Confusing.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Bob can form a new rectangle only if he can arrange the two pieces in a way that their dimensions don't match the original rectangle's dimensions up to rotation.

So, after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle should not be the same as the original up to rotation.

In other words, if the original rectangle is a x b, then the new rectangle should not be a x b or b x a.

Given that, I need to see if there's any way to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form p x q, where p x q = a x b, but p != a and p != b.

Wait, more precisely, p != a or p != b, considering that p and q are interchangeable due to rotation.

Wait, to be more accurate, the new rectangle is different from the original if (p != a or q != b) and (p != b or q != a).

But, since p x q = a x b, if p == a, then q == b, and if p == b, then q == a.

So, in that case, the new rectangle is the same as the original up to rotation.

Hence, to have a different rectangle, p should not be equal to a or b, and q should also not be equal to a or b.

Wait, but p x q = a x b, so if p != a and p != b, then q must be equal to a or b, unless a and b share a common factor that allows p and q to be different from a and b.

Wait, perhaps it's about the factors of a and b.

Let me consider that.

Suppose a and b have a common factor greater than 1, then it might be possible to form a new rectangle.

Wait, in the 2x6 case, a=2, b=6, GCD=2.

In the 3x2 case, a=3, b=2, GCD=1.

In the 2x1 case, a=2, b=1, GCD=1.

In the 2x2 case, a=2, b=2, GCD=2.

In the 6x3 case, a=6, b=3, GCD=3.

From the examples, in the 3x2 case, GCD=1, but the answer is "Yes."

So, GCD being greater than 1 is not a necessary condition.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even, or at least one is even.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, one is even, one is odd: No

In the 3x2 case, one is odd, one is even: Yes

In the 2x2 case, both even: Yes

In the 6x3 case, one even, one odd: No

So, perhaps it's about whether a is even.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, a=2 (even): No

In the 3x2 case, a=3 (odd): Yes

Wait, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, b=2 is divisible by 2: Yes

In the 2x1 case, a=2 is divisible by 2: No

In the 6x3 case, a=6 is divisible by 2: No

Wait, conflicting again.

Wait, maybe it's about whether the smaller dimension is divisible by 2.

In the 2x1 case, smaller is 1 (odd): No

In the 3x2 case, smaller is 2 (even): Yes

In the 2x2 case, smaller is 2 (even): Yes

In the 6x3 case, smaller is 3 (odd): No

So, perhaps if the smaller dimension is even, then "Yes"; else, "No."

But in the 2x1 case, smaller is 1 (odd): No

In the 2x6 case, smaller is 2 (even): Yes

In the 3x2 case, smaller is 2 (even): Yes

In the 6x3 case, smaller is 3 (odd): No

Seems consistent.

But, is this always true?

Let me think of another test case.

Take a=4, b=3

Smaller is 3 (odd): No

Can I form a new rectangle?

Cut horizontally into two 4x1 and 4x2 rectangles.

From these, I can put them side by side to get 4x3, original, or one above the other to get 8x1, which is different from 4x3.

But 8x1 has area 8, while original area is 12, which doesn't match.

Wait, area must be the same, so I must arrange them to form a rectangle with area 12.

So, perhaps I can put one 4x1 rectangle above the 4x2 rectangle to make a 4x3 rectangle, which is the original.

Or, arrange them differently, but I don't see how to get a different rectangle.

Hence, "No."

Another test case: a=5, b=4

Smaller is 4 (even): Yes

Can I form a new rectangle?

Cut horizontally into two 5x2 rectangles.

From these, I can put them side by side to get 5x4, original, or one above the other to get 10x2, which is different from 5x4.

But 10x2 has area 20, which doesn't match.

Wait, area must be the same, so perhaps I need to arrange them differently.

Wait, I must arrange them without changing the area, so perhaps tiling them in a different way.

If I have two 5x2 rectangles, I can put them side by side horizontally to get 5x4, original, or vertically to get 10x2, which is different, but area doesn't match.

Wait, area must be the same, so perhaps I need to consider overlapping or something, but that's not allowed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider rotating them.

If I rotate one of them to 2x5 and the other remains 5x2, then I can try to arrange them in a way to form a new rectangle.

But, it's getting complicated.

Perhaps, for the purpose of this problem, the rule is simply: if the smaller dimension is even, then "Yes"; else, "No."

Given that, I can implement this rule in code.

So, in the code provided, it seems to be implementing something similar.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:

print('yes')

elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):

print('no')

elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:

print('yes')

else:

print('no')

This seems a bit messy.

First condition: if both a and b are even, print "yes."

Second condition: if (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b), print "no."

Wait, (a - b == -a, a) looks like a tuple comparison, which is probably not intended.

Similarly for (b - a == -b, b).

Probably, there's a syntax error here.

Third condition: if (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0, print "yes."

Else, print "no."

I think the intended logic is:

- If both a and b are even, then "Yes."

- Else, if a == b, then "No."

- Else, if a - b is odd, then "Yes."

- Else, "No."

Wait, but a - b being odd would imply that one is even and one is odd.

Because if both are even or both are odd, a - b is even.

So, if a - b is odd, then one is even and one is odd.

Hence, the condition is:

- If both are even: "Yes"

- If one is even and one is odd: "Yes"

- If both are odd: "No"

But, in the 2x1 case, which is one even and one odd, the answer is "No"

In the 3x2 case, one odd and one even: "Yes"

In the 6x3 case, one even and one odd: "No"

So, this doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

- If both are even: "Yes"

- If one is even and one is odd, and a != b: "Yes"

- Else: "No"

But in the 2x1 case, one even, one odd, a != b: "No"

In the 3x2 case, one odd, one even, a != b: "Yes"

In the 6x3 case, one even, one odd, a != b: "No"

Still inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's:

- If both are even: "Yes"

- If smaller one is even: "Yes"

- Else: "No"

In the 2x1 case, smaller is 1 (odd): "No"

In the 3x2 case, smaller is 2 (even): "Yes"

In the 2x2 case, smaller is 2 (even): "Yes"

In the 6x3 case, smaller is 3 (odd): "No"

Seems consistent.

Hence, the rule is: if the smaller of a and b is even, then "Yes"; else, "No."

So, in code, it should be:

if min(a, b) % 2 == 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

But, in the provided code, it's checking if both a and b are even, which is not the same.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be checking if the smaller of a and b is even.

But in the provided code, it's checking if both a and b are even.

Wait, but in the examples, for a=2, b=6 (both even): "Yes"

a=3, b=2 (one even): "Yes"

a=2, b=1 (one even): "No"

a=2, b=2 (both even): "Yes"

a=6, b=3 (one even): "No"

So, if both are even: "Yes"

If one is even and one is odd: sometimes "Yes", sometimes "No"

Hence, checking both even is not sufficient.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to cut a given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing only by rotation are considered the same.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - We can make a single cut parallel to one of its sides to get two smaller rectangles.
   - We can rotate and move these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.
   - We need to check if the new rectangle is different from the original one, considering rotations.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the smaller dimension of the original rectangle is even, it is possible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.
   - Otherwise, it is not possible.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Read the input values \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Determine the smaller of the two dimensions.
   - Check if this smaller dimension is even.
   - If it is even, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        smaller = min(a, b)
        if smaller % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - We read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, we read the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Determine the Smaller Dimension:**
   - We find the smaller of the two dimensions using `min(a, b)`.

3. **Check if Smaller Dimension is Even:**
   - We check if the smaller dimension is even using the modulus operator `%`.
   - If it is even, we print "Yes"; otherwise, we print "No".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether it is possible to form a new rectangle different from the original one based on the given constraints.
