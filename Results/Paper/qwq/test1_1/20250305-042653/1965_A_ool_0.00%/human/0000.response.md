Alright, I've got this problem to figure out. It's about a game that Alice and Bob are playing with piles of stones. The rules are a bit unusual compared to standard stone-removal games. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the game setup: There are n piles of stones, and each pile has a certain number of stones, given by a_1, a_2, up to a_n. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player chooses a positive integer k that is less than or equal to the smallest number of stones in any non-empty pile and removes k stones from each non-empty pile. The player who can't make a move because all piles are empty loses.

So, the key here is that in each move, you're removing the same number of stones from every non-empty pile, and that number k has to be at most the smallest pile's size.

I need to determine, given the initial configuration of the piles, who will win if both play optimally. That means I have to find out if Alice can force a win, or if Bob can always win no matter what Alice does.

Let's look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 5

piles: 3 3 3 3 3

Alice can choose k=3 and remove 3 stones from each pile, emptying all piles at once. So, she wins immediately.

In the second test case:

n=2

piles: 1 and 7

Alice must choose k=1 (since 1 is the smallest pile), and remove 1 from each pile, making them 0 and 6. Now, Bob chooses k up to 6 (since 6 is the smallest non-empty pile), and removes 6 from the second pile, emptying it. Now, only the first pile is empty, so Alice can't make a move and loses.

In the third test case:

n=7

piles: 1,3,9,7,4,2,100

Alice chooses k=1 (smallest pile is 1), removes 1 from each pile, making them 0,2,8,6,3,1,99.

Now, Bob looks at the non-empty piles: 2,8,6,3,1,99

Smallest is 1, so he chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making them 1,7,5,2,0,98.

Alice looks at 1,7,5,2,98

Smallest is 1, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,6,4,1,97.

Bob looks at 6,4,1,97

Smallest is 1, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 5,3,0,96.

Alice looks at 5,3,96

Smallest is 3, chooses k=3, removes 3 from each, making 2,0,93.

Bob looks at 2,93

Smallest is 2, chooses k=2, removes 2 from each, making 0,91.

Alice looks at 91, which is non-empty, so she chooses k=91, removes 91, emptying the last pile. Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, Alice wins this case, which matches what I just did.

Looking at the fourth test case:

n=3

piles:1,2,3

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,2.

Bob looks at 1 and 2, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1.

Alice looks at 1, chooses k=1, removes 1, making 0.

Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

But according to the sample output, Alice wins, which matches.

Fifth test case:

n=6

piles:2,1,3,4,2,4

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 1,0,2,3,1,3.

Bob looks at 1,2,3,1,3, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,2,0,2.

Alice looks at 1,2,2, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,1.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,0,0. Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Sample output says Bob wins, which matches.

Sixth test case:

n=8

piles:5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2

Alice chooses k=2, removes 2 from each, making 3,5,0,7,4,1,1,0.

Bob looks at 3,5,7,4,1,1, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 2,4,6,3,0,0.

Alice looks at 2,4,6,3, chooses k=2, removes 2 from each, making 0,2,4,1.

Bob looks at 2,4,1, chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,3,3.

Alice looks at 3,3, chooses k=3, removes 3 from each, making 0,0. Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Sample output says Alice wins, which matches.

Seventh test case:

n=1

pile:1000000000

Alice chooses k=1000000000, removes all stones, wins immediately.

Sample output says Alice wins, which matches.

So, from these examples, it seems that Alice can win in some cases, and Bob in others, depending on the initial configuration.

Now, I need to find a general way to determine the winner based on the initial pile sizes.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory, specifically impartial games, since the moves available don't depend on which player is moving, only on the game state.

This seems similar to the game of Nim, where players remove objects from piles, but with a different removal rule.

In standard Nim, the winning strategy is based on the XOR of the pile sizes. But here, the moves are different: you have to remove the same number of stones from all non-empty piles, up to the size of the smallest pile.

So, this is not standard Nim, and I need to find a different way to analyze it.

Let me think about the possible moves and the game states.

Let's consider the game state as the multiset of pile sizes (since the order doesn't matter).

A move consists of choosing a positive integer k less than or equal to the minimum pile size, and removing k stones from each pile.

This operation reduces each pile by k, which is equivalent to replacing each pile size a_i with a_i - k.

The game ends when all piles are empty, and the player who makes the last move wins.

This seems similar to the game of Nim with a misère rule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this game as a subtraction game, but subtraction games usually deal with a single pile.

Wait, maybe I can think of this game as a variant of Nim where multiple piles are reduced by the same amount.

This might be similar to misère Nim, but I need to find a way to determine the winning strategy.

Let me consider the mex function from combinatorial game theory, which is used to determine the nimber of a game position.

The mex (minimum excludant) of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

In standard Nim, the nimber of a position is the XOR of the pile sizes.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, the standard Nimber calculation might not apply directly.

Perhaps I need to find a way to calculate the nimber for this game.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical formula that can determine the winner based on the initial pile sizes.

Let me consider small cases to see if I can find a pattern.

Case 1: n=1, pile size a_1.

- If a_1 >=1, Alice can remove a_1 stones, winning immediately.

- So Alice wins.

Case 2: n=2, pile sizes a and b.

- Without loss of generality, assume a <= b.

- Alice can choose k up to a.

- After removing k from both piles, the piles become a - k and b - k.

- If a - k = 0, then the second pile is b - k >= a - k = 0.

- So, the remaining piles are 0 and (b - k).

- If b - k > 0, Bob can then choose k up to b - k, remove k from both piles, but since one pile is already 0, he effectively removes k from the remaining pile.

- This continues until the pile is empty.

- Wait, this seems like Alice can force a win by choosing k=a, making both piles 0, but that only works if a = b.

- If a < b, and Alice chooses k=a, then the piles become 0 and b - a.

- Then Bob can choose k up to b - a, remove k from the remaining pile, making it (b - a) - k.

- Alice then chooses k up to (b - a) - k, but since one pile is already 0, it's like playing with a single pile.

- In this case, Bob can choose k = b - a, removing all stones and winning.

- Wait, but according to the first example, when all piles are equal, Alice can win by choosing k equal to the pile size.

- In the second example, with piles 1 and 7, Alice chooses k=1, making piles 0 and 6, then Bob chooses k=6, making piles 0 and 0, so Alice loses.

- So, in the case where piles are not all equal, it's possible for Bob to win.

- Maybe the key is whether all piles are equal.

- But in the seventh test case, there's only one pile, which Alice wins by taking all stones.

- In the first test case, all piles are equal, and Alice wins.

- In the second test case, piles are not equal, and Bob wins.

- In the third test case, piles are not equal, and Alice wins.

- So, it's not just about whether all piles are equal.

- Maybe it's about the number of distinct pile sizes.

- In the first test case, only one distinct size, Alice wins.

- Second test case, two distinct sizes, Bob wins.

- Third test case, multiple distinct sizes, Alice wins.

- This doesn't seem consistent.

- Perhaps it's about the parity of something.

- In the first test case, 5 piles, all 3s, Alice wins.

- Second test case, 2 piles, 1 and 7, Bob wins.

- Third test case, 7 piles with various sizes, Alice wins.

- Fourth test case, 3 piles, 1,2,3, Alice wins.

- Fifth test case, 6 piles, 2,1,3,4,2,4, Bob wins.

- Sixth test case, 8 piles, 5,7,2,9,6,3,3,2, Alice wins.

- Seventh test case, 1 pile, 1000000000, Alice wins.

- So, it doesn't seem directly related to the number of piles or the number of distinct sizes.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can sort the piles and look for a pattern.

Let's sort the piles in non-decreasing order.

In the first test case: 3,3,3,3,3

Alice chooses k=3, removes 3 from each, all piles are empty.

Alice wins.

Second test case:1,7

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0 and 6.

Bob chooses k=6, removes 6 from the second pile, making 0 and 0.

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Third test case:1,2,3,4,7,9,100

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,2,3,6,8,99.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, making 0,0,1,2,5,7,98.

Alice chooses k=1 again, removes 1 from each, making 0,0,0,1,4,6,97.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,0,0,0,3,5,96.

Alice chooses k=3, removes 3 from each, making 0,0,0,0,0,2,93.

Bob chooses k=2, removes 2 from the last two piles, making 0,0,0,0,0,0,91.

Alice removes 91 from the last pile, making all piles empty. Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

So, in this case, Alice wins by continuing to reduce the piles.

In the fourth test case:1,2,3

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,2.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, making 0,0,1.

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from the last pile, making all piles empty. Bob can't move, so Alice wins.

Fifth test case:1,2,2,3,4,4

Alice chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,1,2,3,3.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each non-empty pile, making 0,0,0,1,2,2.

Alice looks at the non-empty piles:1,2,2

Chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,1,1.

Bob chooses k=1, removes 1 from each, making 0,0,0. Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins.

Looking for a pattern, perhaps it's about the number of times you can reduce the piles before they all become zero.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the minimal excludant approach.

In standard Nim, the XOR of pile sizes determines the winner.

But here, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, it might be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the game in terms of its nimber, which is the mex of the nimbers of the positions that can be reached in one move.

But calculating that seems complicated for large pile sizes.

Maybe there's a mathematical shortcut.

Let me consider the sequence of moves.

Each move consists of choosing a k and subtracting k from all piles.

This is equivalent to replacing all a_i with a_i - k.

This is similar to subtracting the same amount from all piles simultaneously.

This operation is akin to cutting all piles by k.

Perhaps I can think of it in terms of the differences between pile sizes.

Wait, in the third test case, the sorted piles are 1,3,9,7,4,2,100.

Alice chooses k=1, reducing all to 0,2,8,6,3,1,99.

Then Bob chooses k=1, reducing to 0,1,7,5,2,0,98.

Alice chooses k=1 again, making 0,0,6,4,1,0,97.

Bob chooses k=1, making 0,0,5,3,0,0,96.

Alice chooses k=3, making 0,0,2,0,0,0,93.

Bob chooses k=2, making 0,0,0,0,0,0,91.

Alice chooses k=91, making all zeros.

So, Alice wins by choosing ks that eventually empty all piles.

But in the second test case, Alice chooses k=1, making 0 and 6.

Then Bob chooses k=6, making both zeros.

Alice loses.

So, perhaps the key is to force the opponent into a position where the smallest pile is 1, and there are multiple piles.

But that doesn't seem consistent across all test cases.

Wait, in the second test case, Alice is forced to choose k=1 because the smallest pile is 1.

Then Bob can choose k up to the next smallest pile, which is 6, and choose k=6, winning.

In the third test case, after Alice chooses k=1, Bob chooses k=1, and so on, until Alice can choose a k that reduces some piles to zero, leaving Bob with only one pile, which Alice can then empty.

So, perhaps the key is whether the number of times you can subtract the minimal pile size is odd or even.

Wait, that might be a lead.

Let me think recursively.

Define the function f(piles) that returns True if the first player wins from that position.

Base case: if all piles are empty, the current player loses.

Otherwise, the current player can choose any k from 1 to the smallest pile size.

After choosing k, subtract k from all piles, and recurse to f(new_piles).

If any choice of k leads to the opponent losing, then the current player can win.

Else, the current player loses.

But this recursive approach is too slow for large n and large pile sizes.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Perhaps I can find a way to calculate the nimber of the position based on the pile sizes.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mathematical formula based on the pile sizes.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps it's related to the number of distinct pile sizes.

In the first test case, only one distinct size, Alice wins.

In the second test case, two distinct sizes, Bob wins.

In the third test case, multiple distinct sizes, Alice wins.

In the fourth test case, three distinct sizes, Alice wins.

Fifth test case, three distinct sizes, Bob wins.

Sixth test case, four distinct sizes, Alice wins.

Seventh test case, one distinct size, Alice wins.

This doesn't seem consistent.

Maybe it's about the number of times the pile sizes are consecutive.

Wait, in the fourth test case: piles are 1,2,3.

These are consecutive.

Alice chooses k=1, making 0,1,2.

Then Bob chooses k=1, making 0,0,1.

Alice chooses k=1, making 0,0,0. Alice wins.

In the second test case:1 and 7.

Not consecutive.

Alice chooses k=1, making 0 and 6.

Bob chooses k=6, making 0 and 0. Bob wins.

In the third test case:1,3,9,7,4,2,100.

Not all consecutive.

Alice wins.

In the fifth test case:2,1,3,4,2,4.

After sorting:1,2,2,3,4,4.

Not all consecutive.

Bob wins.

This seems inconsistent.

Maybe it's about whether the pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

In the fourth test case, they do:1,2,3.

Alice wins.

In the second test case:1 and 7.

Not consecutive.

Bob wins.

In the third test case:1,2,3,4,7,9,100.

Not all consecutive.

Alice wins.

In the seventh test case:only 1 pile, which is trivial.

Alice wins.

This doesn't seem to be the pattern.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider the minimal pile size.

If the minimal pile size is 1, then the first player must choose k=1, removing one stone from each pile.

This effectively reduces each pile by 1.

If any pile was 1, it becomes 0.

Then, the next player faces a new set of piles, with the minimal pile size possibly still 1, or higher.

This seems like the game progresses by repeatedly reducing the piles by 1, until some piles are empty.

This continues until all piles are empty.

This seems similar to the concept of the mex in impartial games.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the number of times we can subtract 1 from the piles until some pile becomes zero.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the game in terms of its nimber.

The nimber of a position is the mex of the nimbers of the positions that can be reached in one move.

In this game, choosing k corresponds to moving to a position where all piles have been reduced by k.

But calculating nimbers for large pile sizes is not practical.

Is there a way to simplify this?

Let me consider the sequence of moves.

Each move consists of choosing k and subtracting k from all piles.

This is equivalent to replacing all a_i with a_i - k.

This is similar to saying that the game progresses in steps where the smallest pile is reduced to zero, and the remaining piles are reduced by that amount.

Wait, that might be a way to model it.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I sort the piles in ascending order: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Then, the first move can choose k up to a1.

After choosing k, all piles become a1 - k, a2 - k, ..., an - k.

But since a1 - k could be zero, and we can ignore zero piles.

So, effectively, after choosing k, the remaining piles are a2 - k, a3 - k, ..., an - k, provided they are greater than zero.

This is similar to the game of Nim, where each pile is independent.

But in this case, moves affect all piles simultaneously.

This makes it different from standard Nim.

Perhaps I can consider the game as equivalent to a single pile game, where the pile size is the number of non-empty piles.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have piles: a1, a2, ..., an.

Let me consider the minimal pile size m.

Then, the first move is to choose k between 1 and m.

After choosing k, all piles are reduced by k.

This is equivalent to subtracting k from each pile.

This operation can be repeated until m becomes zero.

The number of times I can subtract k from m is floor(m/k).

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case:1 and 7.

Alice chooses k=1, subtracts 1 from each, making 0 and 6.

Bob chooses k=6, subtracts 6 from the second pile, making 0 and 0.

Alice can't move, so Bob wins.

Alternatively, if Alice could choose k=1, but that leads to Bob winning.

Is there another choice for Alice?

Wait, in this case, Alice must choose k=1 because it's the smallest pile.

So, she has no choice but to choose k=1.

Hence, Bob wins.

In the first test case, Alice can choose k=3, making all piles zero, and wins immediately.

So, if there exists a k that makes all piles zero in one move, Alice wins.

Otherwise, it depends on the resulting position after her move.

This seems to suggest that Alice wins if she can make all piles zero in one move, or force Bob into a losing position.

But I need a general way to determine this.

Let me consider the game in terms of its nimber being zero or non-zero.

If the nimber is zero, the position is losing for the current player.

If the nimber is non-zero, the current player can make a move to a position with nimber zero.

In standard Nim, this is determined by the XOR of pile sizes.

But in this game, since moves affect all piles simultaneously, it's different.

Perhaps I need to find a way to calculate the nimber for this game.

Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on the number of piles and their sizes.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting to determine the winner based on whether the pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

In the code:

def func_1(arr):

A = False

if arr[0] != 1:

return 'Alice'

set_ = list(set(arr))

set_.sort()

not_c = True

for i in range(1, len(set_)):

if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:

not_c = False

break

A = not A

if not_c:

A = not A

return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'



So, the code first checks if the smallest pile is not 1, in which case Alice wins.

Otherwise, it checks if the pile sizes form a consecutive sequence starting from 1.

If they do, it sets A to the opposite, and if they don't, it keeps A as is.

Finally, it returns 'Alice' if A is True, else 'Bob'.

But this seems inconsistent with the sample inputs.

In the fourth test case: piles=1,2,3

They are consecutive starting from 1.

According to the code:

arr[0]=1, so check if set_ is consecutive.

set_=[1,2,3], which is consecutive, so not_c=True

Then, A = not A, so A=True

Then, since not_c=True, A = not A, so A=False

Return 'Bob'

But according to the sample output, Alice wins.

So, the code seems incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the sample input, the fourth test case is:

3

1 2 3

And the output is "Alice"

But according to the code, it would return 'Bob', which contradicts the sample output.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
