Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. Vlad wants to hold m rounds of something, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. So, seven different difficulty levels in total.

He already has a bank of n problems, each with one of these difficulty levels. But it's possible that he doesn't have enough problems for m rounds, meaning that for some difficulty levels, he might not have m problems available. So, he needs to create additional problems to make sure that each round has one problem of each difficulty.

My task is to find out the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

3

10 1

BGECDCBDED

10 2

BGECDCBDED

9 1

BBCDEFFGG

Output:

2

5

1

So, for the first test case:

n=10, m=1, problems='BGECDCBDED'

From this string, let's count the frequency of each difficulty:

B: 3

G: 2

E: 2

C: 2

D: 2

So, frequencies:

A: 0

B: 3

C: 2

D: 2

E: 2

F: 0

G: 2

Since m=1, he needs at least 1 problem of each difficulty. So, for A and F, which have 0 problems, he needs to create 1 problem for each. Hence, total 2 problems to create.

That makes sense.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, problems='BGECDCBDED'

Frequencies:

B: 3

G: 2

E: 2

C: 2

D: 2

Again, A and F are missing. Since m=2, he needs 2 problems of each difficulty.

So, for A: needs 2, has 0, so needs to create 2.

For F: needs 2, has 0, so needs to create 2.

Total: 4.

Wait, but the output is 5. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back: m=2 means he needs 2 problems of each difficulty level.

From the string 'BGECDCBDED':

B:3, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:2

Missing A and F, which are needed twice each.

So, 2 for A and 2 for F, total 4.

But output is 5. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps he needs to have m problems for each difficulty level, and the problems can be reused across rounds, but each round needs distinct problems.

Wait, no, the problem says each round should contain one problem of each difficulty level.

So, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each difficulty level, all distinct.

So, for m=1, he needs 7 distinct problems, one of each difficulty.

For m=2, he needs 14 distinct problems, two of each difficulty.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=10, m=1, and he had 10 problems, but only missing A and F, so needed to create 2 problems.

Wait, but 10 problems, but only certain difficulties, missing A and F.

Wait, perhaps the problems can be reused across rounds, but each round needs its own set of problems.

Wait, no, I think for m rounds, he needs m distinct sets of problems, each set containing one of each difficulty.

So, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each difficulty.

Wait, but looking at the example, for m=1, he needed 2 problems (A and F), meaning he was missing two difficulties.

For m=2, he needed 5 problems.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate for each difficulty, the number of problems needed is m, and subtract the number of problems he already has for that difficulty, but not less than zero.

So, for each difficulty, missing = max(0, m - freq[difficulty])

Then, sum up missing for all difficulties.

Let's apply this to the first test case:

m=1

freq:

A:0, B:3, C:2, D:2, E:2, F:0, G:2

missing:

A:1, B:0, C:0, D:0, E:0, F:1, G:0

total missing: 2

Second test case:

m=2

freq same as above.

missing:

A:2, B:0, C:0, D:0, E:0, F:2, G:0

total missing: 4

But output is 5, which contradicts my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the frequency counts.

Wait, let's count the frequencies again for the second test case.

n=10, m=2, problems='BGECDCBDED'

B:3, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:2

A:0, F:0

So, for m=2:

A needs 2, has 0: missing 2

F needs 2, has 0: missing 2

Total missing: 4

But output is 5, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe some problems are being used in multiple rounds, but the problem says each round needs one problem of each difficulty, and presumably, problems cannot be reused across rounds.

So, for m rounds, he needs m distinct problems for each difficulty level.

Hence, for difficulties A and F, since he has 0, he needs to create 2 problems for A and 2 for F, total 4.

But output is 5, so perhaps there's an additional problem needed.

Wait, maybe there's an overlap or something I'm missing.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"Each round should contain one problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'."

So, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each difficulty level.

So, for m=2, he needs 2 problems of each difficulty.

Given that, in the second test case, he has:

A:0, B:3, C:2, D:2, E:2, F:0, G:2

So, for A: needs 2, has 0: missing 2

F: needs 2, has 0: missing 2

Total missing: 4

But output is 5, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe he needs to have distinct problems for each round, meaning that even if he has multiple problems of the same difficulty, they can't be used in the same round.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify that problems must be distinct within a round; it just says each round should contain one problem of each difficulty.

Assuming that problems of the same difficulty but different instances are distinct, so he can use different problems of the same difficulty in different rounds.

But in the second test case, for difficulties A and F, he has 0 problems, so he needs to create 2 problems for A and 2 for F, total 4.

But output is 5, so perhaps there's an error in the problem description or the example.

Wait, maybe I misread the input.

Wait, in the input, it's:

3

10 1

BGECDCBDED

10 2

BGECDCBDED

9 1

BBCDEFFGG

And output:

2

5

1

Wait, perhaps in the second test case, the string is 'BGECDCBDED', which has 10 problems:

B G E C D C B D E D

So, frequencies:

B:3, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:3, A:0, F:0

Wait, earlier I thought D had 2, but actually, D appears 3 times.

So, for m=2:

Needs 2 problems each difficulty.

Has:

A:0, B:3, C:2, D:3, E:2, F:0, G:2

So, missing:

A:2, F:2

Total missing: 4

But output is 5, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe he can't reuse problems across rounds. Meaning, for m rounds, he needs m distinct problems for each difficulty, and the problems cannot be used in multiple rounds.

But in that case, for m=2:

He has for B:3 problems, which is enough for 2 rounds.

Similarly, D:3, which is enough for 2 rounds.

Others have at least 2, except A and F have 0.

So, missing A:2, F:2, total 4.

But output is 5, so perhaps there's a miscount.

Wait, maybe one of the problems is being overcounted.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that problems cannot be used in multiple rounds, and for some difficulties, he has exactly m problems, but needs more.

Wait, in this case, for B:3, m=2, so he has enough.

D:3, enough.

Others have at least m, except A and F have 0.

So, still, missing 4, but output is 5.

Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or the example.

Wait, perhaps the problems must be unique across all rounds, meaning no problem can be used more than once in total, regardless of the round.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem says each round needs one problem of each difficulty.

I think my initial approach is correct: for each difficulty, calculate the difference between needed (m) and available, and sum up the positives.

So, in the second test case, it should be 4, but output is 5. Maybe there's an error in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the string has duplicates that I didn't account for.

Wait, in the first test case:

n=10, m=1, problems='BGECDCBDED'

Frequencies:

B:3, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:3, A:0, F:0

Needed for m=1: 1 of each.

So, missing A and F, total 2, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, problems='BGECDCBDED'

Frequencies:

B:3, G:2, E:2, C:2, D:3, A:0, F:0

Needed for m=2: 2 of each.

Missing A:2, F:2, total 4.

But output is 5. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Looking back:

"Each round should contain one problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'."

So, for m rounds, he needs m problems for each difficulty level.

And he has a bank of n problems with certain difficulties.

He may need to create additional problems to reach m problems for each difficulty.

So, for each difficulty, if he has fewer than m problems, he needs to create m - freq[d] problems for that difficulty.

Sum over all difficulties the max(0, m - freq[d]).

In the second test case, sum is 2 + 2 = 4, but output is 5. So perhaps there's a misprint in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problems cannot be assigned to rounds in a way that satisfies all rounds.

Wait, maybe there's a constraint that the same problem cannot be used in multiple rounds.

But according to the problem statement, it seems that each problem can only be used in one round.

So, for m rounds, he needs m distinct problems for each difficulty.

In the second test case, for difficulties A and F, he has 0 problems, so needs to create 2 problems for A and 2 for F, total 4.

But output is 5, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem or the example.

Wait, maybe for other difficulties, he needs to create more problems.

Wait, he has for B:3, which is enough for m=2.

D:3, enough.

C:2, enough.

E:2, enough.

G:2, enough.

A:0, needs 2.

F:0, needs 2.

Total: 4.

But output is 5, so perhaps there's an error in the problem.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscount in the frequencies.

Looking at 'BGECDCBDED':

B:3

G:2

E:2

C:2

D:3

A:0

F:0

Yes, sum is 10, which matches n=10.

So, according to this, missing should be 4, but output is 5.

Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problems are not assignable to rounds due to some constraint.

Wait, maybe some problems are needed to fill in for missing difficulties.

But according to the problem, each problem can only be used in one round.

So, my initial approach seems correct.

Let's look at the third test case:

n=9, m=1, problems='BBCDEFFGG'

Frequencies:

B:3, C:1, D:1, E:1, F:2, G:2, A:0

Needed for m=1: 1 of each.

Missing A:1, total missing:1, which matches the third output.

So, in this case, my approach works.

But in the second test case, according to my calculation, it should be 4, but output is 5.

Maybe there's a misprint in the problem or the example.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some problems cannot be assigned to rounds due to limitations.

Wait, perhaps some problems are used in multiple rounds accidentally.

But according to the problem, each problem can only be used in one round.

I think my approach is correct, and perhaps there's an error in the problem's example output.

So, moving forward, I'll assume that my approach is correct: for each difficulty, calculate max(0, m - freq[d]), sum over all difficulties.

Now, looking at the given program:

t = 3

test_cases = [(10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED'), (10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED'), (9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG')]

results = func_1(t, test_cases)

for result in results:

print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):

results = []

for _ in range(t):

(n, m, a) = test_cases[_]

freq = [0] * 7

for prob in a:

freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1

missing = sum((max(0, m - f) for f in freq))

results.append(missing)

return results

So, this function iterates through each test case, calculates the frequency of each difficulty in the problem bank, then for each difficulty, calculates the missing number of problems as max(0, m - freq[d]), sums them up, and appends the result to the results list.

Finally, it prints each result.

This seems to match my understanding of the problem.

However, in the second test case, according to this function, it should output 4, but the example output is 5.

So, perhaps there's an error in the problem or the example.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem constraints.

Wait, perhaps m can be up to 5, and n can be up to 50, but in this case, it's fine.

Given that, I think the function is correct, and the example might have a mistake.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
