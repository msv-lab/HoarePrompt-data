Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Timur is in a car traveling on a number line from point 0 to point n. The car starts at minute 0, and there are k+1 signs at points 0, a1, a2, ..., ak, with ak being equal to n. The car arrives at these points at minutes 0, b1, b2, ..., bk, respectively. These sequences a and b are strictly increasing, which makes sense because the car is moving forward in both position and time.

The key here is that between any two adjacent signs, the car travels at a constant speed. So, between sign i and sign i+1, the speed is constant. Timur has q queries, each being an integer d, and he wants to know how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d, rounded down to the nearest integer.

First, I need to understand the input and what needs to be output. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with n, k, and q, followed by the a and b sequences, and then q distances d for queries.

My task is, for each query d, to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach that point d, rounded down.

Given that the car travels at constant speeds between signs, I need a way to determine, for any point d, which segment it falls into and then calculate the time based on the speed in that segment.

Let me think about how to model this.

I have points a0 to ak, with a0=0 and ak=n, and corresponding times b0=0 to bk.

Between ai-1 and ai, the car travels distance (ai - ai-1) in time (bi - bi-1), so the speed in that segment is (ai - ai-1)/(bi - bi-1). Wait, no, actually, speed is distance over time, so speed = (ai - ai-1)/(bi - bi-1). But, actually, no. If the car travels from ai-1 to ai in time (bi - bi-1), then the speed is (ai - ai-1)/(bi - bi-1). So, speed = distance / time.

Wait, no, speed is distance per unit time, so it should be distance / time. So, yes, speed = (ai - ai-1)/(bi - bi-1).

But, in the problem, it's given that the car arrives at ai at time bi, so the time taken to travel from ai-1 to ai is (bi - bi-1), and the distance is (ai - ai-1). So, speed is distance over time: (ai - ai-1)/(bi - bi-1).

Okay, so for each segment i from 1 to k, speed[i] = (ai - a[i-1]) / (bi - b[i-1]).

Now, for a query d, I need to find which segment d falls into.

Let me consider the list of a[i], which are the positions of the signs. Since they are strictly increasing, I can use binary search to find the segment that d falls into.

Specifically, find the largest i such that a[i] <= d. Then d is in the segment between a[i] and a[i+1].

Wait, more precisely, find the smallest i such that a[i] >= d. If a[i] == d, then the time is b[i]. Otherwise, it's between a[i-1] and a[i].

Wait, to be more precise, use bisect_left to find the insertion point for d in the a list.

In Python, bisect_left(a, d) returns the index where d would be inserted in a to keep it sorted. If d is equal to an element in a, it returns the leftmost occurrence.

So, s = bisect_left(a, d)

Then, if a[s] == d, time is b[s].

Otherwise, d is between a[s-1] and a[s].

So, I need to calculate the time to reach d in that segment.

The speed in that segment is (a[s] - a[s-1]) / (b[s] - b[s-1])

Then, the time to travel from a[s-1] to d is (d - a[s-1]) / speed.

Wait, no. Time is distance divided by speed.

Speed is distance over time, so time is distance divided by speed.

So, time = (d - a[s-1]) / speed.

But speed is (a[s] - a[s-1]) / (b[s] - b[s-1]), so time = (d - a[s-1]) * (b[s] - b[s-1]) / (a[s] - a[s-1])

Then, the total time is b[s-1] + time.

And finally, floor that to get the integer part.

So, in code, it would be:

if a[s] == d:

print(b[s])

else:

time = b[s-1] + (d - a[s-1]) * (b[s] - b[s-1]) / (a[s] - a[s-1])

print(floor(time))

Also, need to handle the case when d == 0, which should return 0.

And d == n, which should return b[k].

Also, need to make sure that the division doesn't cause floating point issues.

Given that n and a[i] can be up to 1e9, and b[i] up to 1e9, the intermediate calculations could be large, but since we're dealing with integers, need to ensure that the division is handled correctly.

Wait, in the problem, a[k] = n, and b[k] is given.

Also, need to read q queries after each test case.

Given that t can be up to 1e4, but sum of k over all test cases <=1e5, and sum of q over all test cases <=1e5, so need an efficient solution.

So, per test case, k and q can be up to 1e5, but t is up to 1e4, so need an efficient way to handle this.

I think using bisect_left for each query is acceptable, since log(k) is fine.

Now, in terms of implementing this, I need to:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, k, q.

- Read the a list of size k, but since a[0]=0 and a[k]=n, I need to add those.

- Read the b list of size k, but b[0]=0 and b[k] is given.

- Then, for each query d, find the time to reach d.

- Print the floor of the time for each query.

Wait, in the input description, it says:

"The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n; a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1; a_k = n)."

So, a_i are given from a1 to ak, but a0=0 is implicit.

Similarly, b_i are given from b1 to bk, with b0=0 implicit.

So, in code, I need to add 0 to the front of a and b.

Then, a becomes [0, a1, a2, ..., ak=n]

b becomes [0, b1, b2, ..., bk]

Then, for each query d, find s = bisect_left(a, d)

If a[s] == d, print b[s]

Else, s -= 1

time = b[s] + (d - a[s]) * (b[s+1] - b[s]) / (a[s+1] - a[s])

print floor(time)

Need to make sure that s is within bounds.

Also, need to handle d=0 separately, which should just print 0.

Wait, no, bisect_left(a, 0) will return 0, and a[0]==0, so print b[0]==0.

So, it should handle d=0 correctly.

Also, d=n should be handled by checking if a[s]==n.

Wait, a[k]=n, so if d==n, s=bisect_left(a, n)=k

If a[k]==n, then print b[k]

Otherwise, s=k-1, and calculate the time.

But according to the problem, a[k]=n, so a[s]==n, print b[k]

Yes, makes sense.

Also, need to make sure that when s=0 and d < a[1], handle it correctly.

But since a[0]=0, and s=bisect_left(a, d), if d < a[1], s=0, a[0]=0, so time = b[0] + (d - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0])

Which is correct.

So, seems like this approach should work.

Now, need to implement this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Also, need to read q queries after each test case.

Given that t can be up to 1e4, but sum of k and q over all test cases is up to 1e5, using bisect_left should be fine, since log(k) is small.

Now, in terms of floating point precision, need to be careful with the division.

In Python, floating point should handle this, but need to make sure to use integer division where appropriate.

Also, need to floor the final time, so use math.floor or int().

In Python, casting to int() truncates towards zero, which is equivalent to floor for positive numbers.

So, int(time) should give the floor of time.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

The provided program is:

from bisect import bisect_left

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k, q) = map(int, input().split())

a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

ad = [0]

bd = [0]

for i in range(1, len(a)):

ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])

for i in range(1, len(b)):

bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])

v = [0]

for i in range(1, len(a)):

v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])

for l in range(q):

m = 0

i = 1

ql = int(input())

s = bisect_left(a, ql)

if a[s] == ql:

print(b[s], end=' ')

continue

ql -= a[s - 1]

m += b[s - 1]

m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]

print(int(m), end=' ')

print()

So, let's analyze this.

First, it reads t, then for each test case, reads n, k, q, then reads a and b sequences, adding 0 to the front of each.

Then, it calculates ad, which is the list of distances between signs: ad[i] = a[i] - a[i-1]

Similarly, bd[i] = b[i] - b[i-1]

Then, v[i] = ad[i] / bd[i], which is the speed in segment i.

Then, for each query ql:

s = bisect_left(a, ql)

if a[s] == ql:

print(b[s])

else:

ql -= a[s - 1]

m += b[s - 1]

m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]

print(int(m), end=' ')

So, this seems to be implementing the logic I described.

Let's see:

- It finds s = bisect_left(a, ql), which gives the insertion point for ql in a.

- If a[s] == ql, it prints b[s], which is correct.

- Else, it calculates the time as b[s-1] + (ql - a[s-1]) * (bd[s] / ad[s])

Wait, no.

Wait, in the code, it does:

ql -= a[s - 1]

m += b[s - 1]

m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]

So, m = b[s-1] + (b[s] - b[s-1]) * (ql - a[s-1]) / (a[s] - a[s-1])

Which is the same as:

m = b[s-1] + (ql - a[s-1]) * (b[s] - b[s-1]) / (a[s] - a[s-1])

Which matches the formula I derived earlier.

So, this seems correct.

Also, finally, it prints int(m), which floors the time.

Seems correct.

Let me check with the example given.

First test case:

4

10 1 3

10

10

0

6

7

So, n=10, k=1, q=3

a = [0, 10]

b = [0,10]

So, ad = [0,10]

bd = [0,10]

v = [0,1.0] (since 10/10=1)

Queries: 0,6,7

For d=0: a[s]=0==0, so print b[0]=0

For d=6: s=1, a[1]=10 !=6, so s=0

m = b[0] + (6-0)*(10-0)/(10-0) = 0 + 6*10/10 = 6

print 6

For d=7: similarly, m = 0 + (7-0)*10/10 =7

So, output should be 0 6 7, which matches the first line of the sample output.

Second test case:

10 2 4

4 10

4 7

6

4

2

7

So, n=10, k=2, q=4

a=[0,4,10]

b=[0,4,7]

ad=[0,4,6]

bd=[0,4,3]

v=[0,1.0, 2.0] (since 4/4=1, 6/3=2)

Queries:6,4,2,7

For d=6:

s=bisect_left(a,6)=1, a[1]=4 <6, a[2]=10>=6, so s=2

But a[2]=10 !=6, so s=1

m = b[1] + (6 - a[1]) * (b[2] - b[1]) / (a[2] - a[1]) = 4 + (6-4)*(7-4)/(10-4) =4 +2*3/6=4+1=5

So, 5

For d=4:

a[1]=4==4, so print b[1]=4

For d=2:

s=bisect_left(a,2)=1, since a[1]=4>=2

But a[1]=4 !=2, so s=0

m = b[0] + (2 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0]) =0 +2*4/4=2

So, 2

For d=7:

s=bisect_left(a,7)=2, a[2]=10 !=7, so s=1

m = b[1] + (7 - a[1]) * (b[2] - b[1]) / (a[2] - a[1])=4 + (7-4)*3/6=4+9/6=4+1.5=5.5, floor to 5

So, output is 5 4 2 5, matching the sample output.

Third test case:

1000000000 1 1

1000000000

1000000000

99999999

So, n=10^9, k=1, q=1

a=[0,10^9]

b=[0,10^9]

ad=[0,10^9]

bd=[0,10^9]

v=[0,1.0]

Query: d=99999999

s=bisect_left(a,99999999)=1, a[1]=10^9 !=99999999, so s=0

m = b[0] + (99999999 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0])=0 +99999999*10^9/10^9=99999999

So, 99999999, matching the sample output.

Fourth test case:

6 1 3

6

5

2

6

5

So, n=6, k=1, q=3

a=[0,6]

b=[0,5]

ad=[0,6]

bd=[0,5]

v=[0,1.2] (6/5=1.2)

Queries:2,6,5

For d=2:

s=bisect_left(a,2)=1, a[1]=6 !=2, so s=0

m = b[0] + (2 - a[0]) * (b[1] - b[0]) / (a[1] - a[0])=0 +2*5/6≈1.666, floor to 1

For d=6:

a[1]=6==6, so print b[1]=5

For d=5:

s=bisect_left(a,5)=1, a[1]=6 !=5, so s=0

m =0 + (5 -0)*5/6 ≈4.166, floor to 4

So, output is 1 5 4, matching the sample output.

Therefore, the provided program seems to be correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
