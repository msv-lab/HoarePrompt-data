Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Essentially, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x and y should differ in all the first 31 bits. Given that we're dealing with 31 bits, that's a lot of constraints.

I recall that in binary representation, each bit can be either 0 or 1. So, for two numbers to have different bits in all 31 positions, their bitwise XOR should have all 31 bits set to 1. Wait, actually, no. If two numbers differ in all bits, their XOR would be a number with all those differing bits set. But I need to make sure that for every bit position, the bits are different.

Wait, let's think differently. If two numbers are in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits must be different. That means, for each pair of numbers in a group, their bitwise AND should be zero for bits 1 to 31, right? Because if any bit is set in both numbers, their AND would have that bit set, which violates the condition.

Hmm, but that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think with an example. Suppose we have two numbers, 1 (binary 001) and 2 (binary 010). Their AND is 0, which seems to satisfy the condition, but actually, in this case, they differ in all bit positions. Wait, no, in the least significant bits, they have:

1: 001

2: 010

Their AND is 000, but they share the same bit in the middle position (both have 0 in the second bit). Wait, no, 1 is 001, 2 is 010, so in binary, they are:

1: 001

2: 010

Their AND would be 000, but they actually differ in all bit positions. Wait, in the first bit, both have 0, but the problem says from the 1st to the 31st bit, and indices start from 1 on the right. So, for 1, bit 1 is 1, bit 2 is 0, bit 3 is 0. For 2, bit 1 is 0, bit 2 is 1, bit 3 is 0. So, in bit position 3, they both have 0, which means they don't differ there. Wait, but the problem says that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x_2(i) != y_2(i) for all 1 <= i < 32."

So, for all bit positions from 1 to 31, the bits must be different between any two numbers in the same group.

That means, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise XOR for bits 1 to 31 must be all 1's. Because XOR of two different bits is 1, and same bits is 0.

So, if two numbers differ in all 31 bits, their XOR for these bits would be a number with all 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, but the problem says that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 <= i < 32, x_2(i) != y_2(i). That means, for each bit position, the bits are different.

So, for two numbers to be in the same group, their bitwise XOR for the first 31 bits must be a number with all 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, no. If two numbers differ in all bits, their XOR would have all those bits set to 1.

But the problem says that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 <= i < 32, x_2(i) != y_2(i). That is, for every bit position, the bits are not equal.

So, for two numbers to be in the same group, their bitwise XOR must have all 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, but that's only for two numbers. For a group of more than two numbers, this condition must hold for every pair.

So, in other words, for a group of numbers, every pair must have XOR of all 1's for the first 31 bits.

But, if we have three numbers where each pair has XOR of all 1's, that would mean that for each bit position, the bits are different between any two numbers.

Wait, but in practice, this is only possible for groups of up to two numbers, because if you have three numbers, it's impossible for all three to differ in all bit positions pairwise.

Wait, let's consider a smaller example. Suppose we have three numbers: a, b, c.

For a and b, a XOR b should have all 31 bits set to 1.

Similarly, a XOR c should have all 31 bits set to 1.

And b XOR c should have all 31 bits set to 1.

But, if a XOR b = all 1's, and a XOR c = all 1's, then b XOR c = (a XOR c) XOR (a XOR b) = a XOR c XOR a XOR b = b XOR c, which should be zero. But we also have b XOR c should be all 1's. So, this is a contradiction.

Therefore, it's impossible to have a group of three or more numbers where every pair has all bits differing.

Therefore, the maximum group size is two.

Wait, but the problem allows groups of any size, as long as the condition holds.

But based on the above, it seems that groups can have at most two numbers.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 4, which suggests that some numbers must be in their own groups.

Let me look at the first test case:

Output:

In the first test case, n=4, and the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, n=2, numbers are 0 and 2147483647, which is output as 1, meaning they can be in the same group.

Looking at the explanation, in the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so each must be in its own group.

Wait, but 1 and 3 have different bits: 1 is 001, 3 is 011; they share the least significant bit.

Wait, but according to the problem, they need to have different bits in all positions from 1 to 31.

So, in this case, 1 and 3 share the least significant bit being 1, so they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 4 and 4 have identical bits, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, each number must be in its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are binary 000...0 and 111...1, so their bits are all different, hence they can be in the same group.

So, the key is to group numbers where no two numbers in the group have the same bit in any of the first 31 positions.

Given that, I need to find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy this condition.

This sounds like a graph coloring problem, where each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they cannot be in the same group, i.e., if they have at least one bit in common in the first 31 positions.

Wait, but that seems computationally expensive for n up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, with a total n sum not exceeding 2e5.

Wait, but t=1e4 and n=2e5 total, so per test case, n can be up to 2e5, but the sum over all test cases is 2e5.

Wait, no, it's t <= 1e4, and n <= 2e5 per test case, with the sum of n over all test cases <= 2e5.

So, overall, we have up to 2e5 numbers to process.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the first 31 bits of each number.

I need to ensure that for any two numbers in the same group, their bits are different in all positions from 1 to 31.

That means, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND for these 31 bits should be 0.

Wait, but that's similar to saying that the numbers are pairwise disjoint in terms of their bit patterns in these 31 bits.

Wait, but actually, it's stronger than that. It's not just that their AND is 0, but that for every bit position, they differ.

That is, for each bit position, one has 0 and the other has 1.

Wait, that's the same as saying that their XOR for these 31 bits is all 1's.

Because if for every bit, they differ, XOR would be all 1's.

So, for two numbers to be in the same group, their XOR for the first 31 bits must be a number with all 31 bits set to 1.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, for more than two numbers, this condition is impossible to satisfy because of the transitivity issue.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of complementing the bits.

Suppose I have a number a, and its complement ~a (with respect to the first 31 bits).

Then, a and ~a can be in the same group because their bits differ in all positions.

Any other number that differs from both a and ~a in all positions could also be in the same group.

But I think in practice, for minimality, grouping a with ~a is sufficient.

Wait, but from the earlier test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because they are complements.

Similarly, in the first test case, numbers are not complements of each other, so they need their own groups.

So, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs of numbers that are complements plus the number of numbers that don't have their complements present.

Wait, but I need to generalize this.

Let me consider that for each number, its complement is unique.

So, I can pair each number with its complement, and each such pair can be in the same group.

If a number doesn't have its complement present, it needs its own group.

But wait, in the first test case, none of the numbers are complements of each other, so each number needs its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, so they can be in the same group.

In the third test case, with 5 numbers, perhaps some are complements and some are not.

Wait, but in the third test case, the output is 3, meaning that some numbers can be grouped together.

I need to verify this.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for the minimal number of groups, I should maximize the number of pairs of complements in each group.

But earlier, I thought that more than two numbers can't be in the same group, but perhaps there are exceptions.

Wait, in the second test case, only two numbers are present, and they are complements, so they go into one group, hence output is 1.

In the first test case, no complements are present, so each number goes into its own group, hence output is 4.

In the third test case, with 5 numbers, perhaps there are two pairs of complements and one number without its complement, resulting in 3 groups.

Wait, but the output is 3.

So, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs of complements plus the number of numbers without their complements.

But, in the second test case, there is one pair of complements, so one group.

In the first test case, no pairs of complements, so four groups.

In the third test case, perhaps there are two pairs of complements and one number without its complement, but output is 3, which would make sense if only one pair can be grouped together.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of graph coloring, where each number is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if they cannot be in the same group.

Then, the minimal number of groups is the chromatic number of this graph.

But with n up to 2e5, computing the chromatic number is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the properties of the complements.

Given a number a, its complement is (1 << 31) - 1 - a, since we're considering the first 31 bits.

Wait, (1 << 31) is 2^31, so (1 << 31) - 1 is all 31 bits set to 1, which is 2147483647.

So, the complement of a is 2147483647 - a.

Wait, no, complement would be ~a & ((1 << 31) - 1), because we're only considering the first 31 bits.

In Python, since integers can be negative due to bitwise operations, but we can ensure we're dealing with 31-bit unsigned integers.

Wait, in Python, integers are signed, but for bitwise operations, as long as we mask appropriately, we can handle them as unsigned.

So, the complement of a number a is ((1 << 31) - 1) ^ a.

Yes, XOR with all 1's flips all the bits.

So, complement of a is mask ^ a, where mask is (1 << 31) - 1.

Now, if I have a and its complement, they can be in the same group.

Any other number that is the complement of another number can be in a different group.

So, perhaps I can collect all numbers and their complements and pair them up.

Then, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of such pairs plus the number of numbers that don't have their complements present.

Wait, but in the first test case, none have their complements present, so each number needs its own group.

In the second test case, the two numbers are complements, so they can be in the same group.

In the third test case, perhaps there are three numbers, one of which doesn't have its complement present, so two groups for the pairs and one for the single, but the output is 3, which might indicate that only two numbers can be paired, and the third needs its own group.

Wait, I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that each pair of complements can be in the same group, and any number without its complement needs its own group.

But in the first test case, no complements are present, so each number needs its own group.

In the second test case, the two numbers are complements, so they can be in the same group.

In the third test case, with five numbers, perhaps two pairs of complements and one single, resulting in three groups.

But the output is 3.

So, this seems consistent.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs of complements plus the number of numbers without their complements.

Wait, but in this approach, each pair of complements goes into one group, and singles go into their own groups.

But in the third test case, with five numbers, if there are two pairs and one single, that would be three groups.

But in the first test case, no pairs, four singles, so four groups.

In the second test case, one pair, no singles, so one group.

Seems correct.

But in the seventh test case, input is 4, with numbers 0,0,2147483647,2147483647.

Output is 2.

According to my earlier logic, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, so they can be in the same group.

But there are two 0s and two 2147483647s.

So, can both 0s and both 2147483647s be in the same group?

Wait, no, because 0 and 0 have the same bits, so they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, two 2147483647s have the same bits, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, we need to have two groups: one group with one 0 and one 2147483647, and another group with the other 0 and the other 2147483647.

Hence, two groups.

So, in this case, even though 0 and 2147483647 are complements and can be in the same group, having multiple copies requires separate groups.

Hence, for each pair of a number and its complement, they can be in the same group, but multiple copies need separate groups.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs of complements plus the number of singles without complements.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, we have two pairs of complements, and they need two groups.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of such pairs needed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of counting the frequency of each number and its complement.

For each number, if its complement is present, they can be paired together in one group.

If a number doesn't have its complement present, it needs its own group.

But if there are multiple copies, we need to account for that.

Wait, perhaps I can use a counting approach.

Let me define a dictionary to count the frequency of each number.

Then, for each number, check if its complement exists.

If it does, and the frequency of the number and its complement are both greater than zero, pair them together and decrement their counts.

Each such pair goes into one group.

Then, for the remaining numbers that don't have their complements, each needs its own group.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs of complements plus the number of remaining singles.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, we have two 0s and two 2147483647s.

0 and 2147483647 are complements.

So, we can pair one 0 with one 2147483647 in one group, and the other 0 with the other 2147483647 in another group, hence two groups.

Similarly, in the first test case, no complements are present, so each number needs its own group, totaling four groups.

In the second test case, one pair of complements, so one group.

This seems consistent.

Hence, the approach is:

- Create a frequency dictionary for the numbers.

- For each number, check if its complement exists and has a positive frequency.

- If so, pair them together, decrement their counts, and consider them in one group.

- After pairing, the remaining numbers without complements need their own groups.

- The total number of groups is equal to the number of pairs found plus the number of remaining singles.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, we have two pairs, so two groups.

In the first test case, no pairs, four singles, so four groups.

In the second test case, one pair, no singles, so one group.

Seems correct.

But in the third test case, with five numbers, output is 3.

Suppose among the five numbers, there are two pairs of complements and one single, which aligns with the output of 3.

Hence, this approach seems valid.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

if count[num] == 0:

del count[num]

return res

So, in func_1, it initializes a result counter res to 0 and a dictionary count.

Then, for each number num in the input list a:

- If num is not in count, it adds the complement of num to count, increments res by 1.

- If num is in count, it decrements count[num], and if count[num] reaches 0, deletes it.

Wait, this seems different from what I thought earlier.

Let me understand this logic.

It seems like it's trying to group numbers based on their complements.

When it encounters a number num not in count, it adds its complement to count and increments res.

If it encounters a number num that is in count, it decrements the count of num and possibly deletes it if the count reaches zero.

Wait, but in this logic, res is incremented only when a number's complement is added to count.

But in the first iteration, when num is not in count, it adds the complement to count and increments res.

In the next iteration, if it encounters the complement, it would decrement the count of num (which is the original number), and if the count reaches zero, deletes it.

Wait, this seems like it's trying to pair numbers with their complements.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case:

n=2, a=[0, 2147483647]

First, num=0, not in count, so complement of 0 is (1<<31)-1 ^ 0 = 2147483647, so count[2147483647] = 1, res=1.

Then, num=2147483647, which is in count, so decrement count[2147483647] to 0, delete it.

Hence, res=1, which matches the output.

In the first test case:

n=4, a=[1,4,3,4]

First, num=1, not in count, complement is (1<<31)-1 ^ 1, let's say comp1.

count[comp1] = 1, res=1.

Next, num=4, not in count, complement is comp4, count[comp4]=1, res=2.

Next, num=3, not in count, complement is comp
