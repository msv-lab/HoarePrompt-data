Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have a square grid of size n x n, and we need to color some cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells colored.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, diagonals can be categorized into two types: main diagonals (those that slope down to the right) and anti-diagonals (those that slope down to the left). For a grid of size n, there are 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, making a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Wait, hold on. Actually, that seems off. Let's think carefully. In an n x n grid, the number of diagonals sloping one way is 2n - 1, and similarly for the other direction, so total diagonals would be 4n - 2. Yes, that matches the problem statement.

Now, the problem is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to cover at least k diagonals with the fewest cells possible.

Let me consider some small values of n to get an intuition.

Let's take n=2.

For n=2, the grid has 2 rows and 2 columns. The diagonals are:

- Main diagonals: one diagonal with cells (1,1) and (2,2)

- Anti-diagonals: one diagonal with cells (1,2) and (2,1)

So, total diagonals: 4n - 2 = 6, which matches: two main, two anti, and two more.

Wait, for n=2, 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Yes, that makes sense.

Now, if k=1, meaning we need at least one diagonal to have at least one colored cell, we can color just one cell, which would cover one diagonal.

But wait, each cell is on two diagonals, one main and one anti.

So, coloring one cell would cover two diagonals.

Wait, no. In n=2, coloring one cell actually covers two diagonals, but in general, a cell is part of one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Wait, but in n=2, the main diagonal has cells (1,1) and (2,2), and the anti-diagonal has cells (1,2) and (2,1). So, each cell is on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

But in larger n, some diagonals are shorter than others.

Wait, no, in n=2, all diagonals have exactly two cells.

Wait, actually, in n=2, the main diagonals are:

- One diagonal with cells (1,1) and (2,2)

- Another with cells (1,2) and (2,1)

Similarly for anti-diagonals.

Wait, no, in n=2, the main diagonals are the ones with cells (1,1)-(2,2), and anti-diagonals are (1,2)-(2,1).

So, total diagonals: 4n - 2 = 6, but in n=2, actually, there are only these two main and two anti-diagonals, but according to the formula, it's 4*2 - 2 = 6, which seems inconsistent with my initial thought.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Let me think differently. In a grid, diagonals can be identified by their slopes. There are diagonals with positive slopes (main diagonals) and negative slopes (anti-diagonals).

For an n x n grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and similarly for anti-diagonals, totaling 4n - 2 diagonals.

Okay, so for n=2, 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

But visually, in n=2, I only see two main diagonals and two anti-diagonals, totaling four. So perhaps I'm missing some diagonals.

Wait, perhaps there are diagonals of different lengths. In n=2, there are diagonals of length 1 and 2.

Specifically, for main diagonals:

- Diagonals with two cells: (1,1)-(2,2) and (1,2)-(2,1)

- Diagonals with one cell: none in n=2

Wait, no, in n=2, all main diagonals have exactly two cells.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition of a diagonal.

Let me refer back to the problem: "Note that the square grid of size n×n has a total of 4n−2 diagonals."

So, apparently, for n=2, there are 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Perhaps, in addition to the two main diagonals and two anti-diagonals, there are also diagonals of shorter lengths.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid:

- Main diagonals: one with cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- Anti-diagonals: one with cells (1,2)-(2,1)

- Additionally, perhaps diagonals consisting of single cells?

Wait, no, a diagonal should consist of multiple cells.

Wait, maybe the problem considers each cell as a diagonal of length 1.

But in the problem statement, it says "diagonals to have at least one colored cell", implying that even a single cell diagonal needs to have its cell colored to count as having at least one colored cell.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the example provided in the problem.

Wait, the problem provides an example with n=3 and k=4, and the answer is 2.

Let's consider n=3.

For n=3, there are 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals.

In a 3x3 grid, the main diagonals are:

- One diagonal with cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Another with cells (1,2), (2,3)

- Another with cells (1,3)

- And similarly for anti-diagonals: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- (1,2), (2,1)

- (1,1)

Wait, perhaps I need to list all possible diagonals.

In n=3, the main diagonals are:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,3)

- Diagonal with cells (2,1), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (3,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,3)

Similarly, anti-diagonals:

- Diagonal with cells (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (1,1)

- Diagonal with cells (3,3)

Wait, that seems like 8 diagonals, but according to the formula, it should be 10.

Maybe I'm missing some.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all possible diagonals, including those with length 1.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of a different approach.

Let me consider that each cell belongs to exactly two diagonals: one main and one anti-diagonal.

Then, the problem reduces to covering at least k diagonals by selecting cells, where each cell covers two diagonals.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but given the large constraints (n up to 1e8), there must be a smarter way to compute this.

Perhaps there's a mathematical formula or pattern that can be exploited here.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

For n=3 and k=4, the answer is 2.

Similarly, for n=3 and k=3, it's 2.

For n=3 and k=10, it's 6.

For n=3 and k=9, it's 5.

For n=4 and k=7, it's 4.

For n=7 and k=11, it's 6.

For n=2 and k=3, it's 2.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can produce these outputs given n and k.

Looking at n=3:

- For k=4, answer is 2

- For k=3, answer is 2

- For k=9, answer is 5

- For k=10, answer is 6

Wait, for n=3, there are 4n - 2 = 10 diagonals.

So, for k=10, we need to cover all diagonals.

Similarly, for k=9, we need to cover at least 9 diagonals.

Looking at n=2:

For n=2, 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

In the sample input, for n=2 and k=3, the answer is 2.

Wait, but in n=2, each cell covers 2 diagonals.

So, coloring one cell would cover 2 diagonals.

Coloring two cells would cover up to 4 diagonals, but there are only 6 diagonals in total.

Wait, perhaps in n=2, to cover at least 3 diagonals, we need to color 2 cells.

Because one cell covers 2 diagonals, and the second cell can cover 2 more diagonals, totaling 4 diagonals covered.

But there are 6 diagonals in total, so to cover at least 3 diagonals, 2 cells are sufficient.

Wait, but 2 cells cover 4 diagonals, which is more than 3, so for k=3, 2 cells are enough.

Similarly, for k=4, it would still be 2 cells.

But in the sample input, for n=2 and k=3, the answer is 2.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=2 and k=3 is not present. Wait, in the example provided, n=2 and k=3 is the last test case, with output 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2).

But looking at n=3 and k=4, answer is 2, which is ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=3, answer is 2, which is ceil(3/2)=2.

For n=3 and k=9, answer is 5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=3 and k=10, answer is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but wait, ceil(10/2)=5, but the answer is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(k, 2n-1).

But for n=3 and k=10, 2n-1=5, but the answer is 6, which is more than 5.

So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ceiling of k/2, but with some adjustments for larger k.

Looking back, for n=3 and k=10, answer is 6, which is 2n-1 + something.

Wait, n=3, 2n-1=5, but answer is 6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps when k <= 2n-2, the answer is ceil(k/2), and when k >= 2n-1, it's 2n-1.

But for n=3 and k=9, answer is 5, which is 2n-1=5.

For k=10, it's 6, which is more than 2n-1.

So perhaps, for k <= 2n-2, it's ceil(k/2), for k >= 2n-1, it's 2n-1 + ceil((k - (2n -1))/something).

Wait, that seems complicated.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

n=3, k=4 -> 2

n=3, k=3 ->2

n=3, k=10->6

n=3, k=9->5

n=4, k=7->4

n=7, k=11->6

n=2, k=3->2

I need to find a pattern.

Looking at n=3:

- For k=1 to 4, ceil(k/2)

- For k=5 and 6, ceil(k/2)=3

- For k=7 and 8, ceil(k/2)=4

- For k=9, ceil(k/2)=5

- For k=10, ceil(k/2)=5, but answer is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(k, 2n-1).

But for n=3 and k=10, 2n-1=5, but answer is 6, which is more than 5.

So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k/2), but with a cap at 2n-1.

But again, for k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but answer is 6.

So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the number of diagonals that must be covered beyond 2n-2.

Wait, for n=3, 2n-2=4, and 2n-1=5.

For k<=4, ceil(k/2) seems to work.

For k=5 and 6, it's 3.

For k=7 and 8, it's 4.

For k=9, it's 5.

For k=10, it's 6.

Wait, that seems like ceil(k/2), but for k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but answer is 6.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps there is a distinction based on whether k is less than or equal to 2n-2 or greater than or equal to 2n-1.

Wait, for n=3:

- 2n-2=4

- 2n-1=5

- 4n-2=10

So, for k <= 4, it's ceil(k/2)

For k=5 to 9, it's 2n-1=5

For k=10, it's 2n=6

Looking at the sample inputs:

n=3, k=4 ->2

n=3, k=3 ->2

n=3, k=10->6

n=3, k=9->5

n=4, k=7->4

n=7, k=11->6

n=2, k=3->2

Wait, for n=2, 2n-2=2, 2n-1=3, 4n-2=6

For k=3, which is less than or equal to 2n-1=3, it's ceil(k/2)=2

Similarly, for n=3 and k=4, ceil(4/2)=2

For n=3 and k=9, it's 2n-1=5

For n=3 and k=10, it's 2n=6

For n=4 and k=7, it's ceil(7/2)=4

For n=7 and k=11, it's ceil(11/2)=6

So, perhaps the formula is:

- If k <= 2n-2, then ceil(k/2)

- Else if k <= 4n-3, then 2n-1

- Else, for k=4n-2, it's 2n

Wait, but in n=3, 2n-2=4, 2n-1=5, 4n-3=9, 4n-2=10

- For k=4, ceil(4/2)=2

- For k=5 to 9, it's 2n-1=5

- For k=10, it's 2n=6

But in the sample input, for n=3 and k=9, answer is 5, and for k=10, it's 6.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=7, answer is 4, which is ceil(7/2)=4

Wait, but according to the above, for n=4 and k=7, since 2n-2=6, and k=7 > 2n-2=6, it should be 2n-1=7, but the answer is 4, which is ceil(7/2)=4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the conditions.

Looking at n=4 and k=7:

- 2n-2=6

- 2n-1=7

- 4n-3=13

- 4n-2=14

According to the above, for k<=2n-2, it's ceil(k/2)

For k>2n-2 and k<=4n-3, it's 2n-1

For k=4n-2, it's 2n

But for n=4 and k=7, 7 > 2n-2=6, so it should be 2n-1=7, but the answer is 4, which is ceil(7/2)=4, which is less than 7.

This suggests that the formula needs further refinement.

Perhaps the correct formula is:

- If k <= 2n-2, then ceil(k/2)

- Else if k <= 4n-3, then 2n-1

- Else for k=4n-2, it's 2n

But for n=4 and k=7, according to this, since k=7 <=4n-3=13, it should be 2n-1=7, but the sample input has n=4 and k=7 with answer 4, which is ceil(7/2)=4, not 7.

This indicates that the formula is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the condition is k <= 2n-1, not 2n-2.

Let me try that.

For n=3:

- If k <= 2*3 -1=5, then ceil(k/2)

- Else if k <=4n-3=10, then 2n-1=5

- Else for k=4n-2=10, it's 2n=6

But for k=9, according to this, it should be 2n-1=5, but sample input has k=9 with answer 5, and k=10 with answer 6.

Similarly, for n=4 and k=7, according to this, since k=7 <=4n-3=13, it should be 2n-1=7, but sample input has answer 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

I must be missing something.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, the minimal number of cells required is equal to the minimal number of rows or columns that can cover at least k diagonals.

Wait, but that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of cells needed to intersect with at least k diagonals.

In graph theory terms, this might be similar to a set cover problem, but that's too slow for large n.

Given the time constraints, there must be a mathematical formula.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

n=3, k=4 ->2

n=3, k=3 ->2

n=3, k=10->6

n=3, k=9->5

n=4, k=7->4

n=7, k=11->6

n=2, k=3->2

Wait, for n=2 and k=3, answer is 2.

For n=2, 2n-1=3, and ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

For n=3 and k=4, ceil(4/2)=2, which matches.

For n=3 and k=9, it's 5, which is 2n-1=5.

For n=3 and k=10, it's 2n=6.

For n=4 and k=7, ceil(7/2)=4, which matches.

For n=7 and k=11, ceil(11/2)=6, which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for k <= 2n-2, it's ceil(k/2), else for k >= 2n-1, it's 2n-1, except for k=4n-2, it's 2n.

But in n=4 and k=7, 7 <= 2n-2=6 is false, so it should be 2n-1=7, but sample input has 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, maybe it's:

- If k <= 2n-2, then ceil(k/2)

- Else if k <= 4n-3, then 2n-1

- Else for k=4n-2, it's 2n

But for n=4 and k=7, 7 <= 2n-2=6 is false, so it's 2n-1=7, but sample input is 4.

This suggests that the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be k <= 2n-1.

Wait, for n=3:

- If k <=2n-1=5, then ceil(k/2)

- Else if k <=4n-3=9, then 2n-1=5

- Else for k=4n-2=10, it's 2n=6

But for n=3 and k=9, it's 5, which matches.

For n=4 and k=7, 7 <=2n-1=7, so ceil(7/2)=4, which matches the sample input.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, the formula is:

- If k <= 2n-1, then ceil(k/2)

- Else if k <= 4n-3, then 2n-1

- Else for k=4n-2, it
