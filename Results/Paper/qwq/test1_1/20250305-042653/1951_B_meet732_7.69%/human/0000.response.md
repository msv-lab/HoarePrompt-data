Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there are n cows with unique ratings, each in their initial positions from 1 to n. They participate in a coding tournament with n-1 matches. The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I can choose to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once or choose not to swap at all. The goal is to find the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with this option.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses and how my cow can participate in as many matches as possible.

Let's think about the tournament structure. It's a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line. The tournament proceeds until all matches are done, and there's a final winner.

But in this problem, I'm not interested in who wins the entire tournament; I just want my cow to win as many matches as possible.

Given that the cow with the higher rating always wins, my cow will keep winning as long as it has a higher rating than the cows it faces. Eventually, it will lose to a cow with a higher rating.

My option to swap positions allows me to change my cow's initial position, which might affect the sequence of matches it participates in.

I need to find the best position for my cow to maximize its wins.

Let me consider the original setup without any swaps.

In the original setup, my cow is at position k. The tournament starts with match 1 between position 1 and 2. The winner of match 1 then plays against position 3, and so on, until all matches are done.

I need to simulate this process to see how many wins my cow gets in the original setup.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Let me try to model the tournament.

Let's consider the tournament as a sequence of matches where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

I need to track the path my cow takes in this tournament, i.e., which matches it participates in and how many it wins.

First, I need to understand how to maximize the number of wins for my cow by choosing its position optimally.

One approach is to find the position where my cow can face the weakest possible opponents for as long as possible.

Given that the cow with the higher rating always wins, my cow will keep winning until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is determined by how many cows with lower ratings are before it in the sequence.

Wait, no. Since the tournament is structured in a specific way, it's not just about the number of cows with lower ratings before it.

I need to consider the actual sequence of matches.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow. Then, I need to simulate the tournament to see how many matches it wins.

But simulating the tournament for each possible position would be too slow, given the constraints.

I need a smarter way to calculate the number of wins for my cow in any position.

Let me consider that the tournament is a series of matches where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

So, starting from position 1 and 2, the winner faces position 3, and so on, until position n.

But actually, it's a bit more involved because after each match, the loser is eliminated, and the winner proceeds to the next match.

Wait, in this problem, it's specified that in each match, the winner proceeds to the next match against the next cow in position.

So, it's like a chain: match 1 is pos1 vs pos2, then the winner vs pos3, then vs pos4, and so on.

So, my cow can only participate in the matches if it is either in one of the positions or if it is the current winner proceeding to the next match.

Therefore, if my cow is in position m, it will participate in the match against the current winner when it's its turn.

Moreover, it can participate in previous matches if it is the winner proceeding through.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to position my cow such that it can win as many consecutive matches as possible.

I need to find a position where my cow's rating is higher than all the cows before it in the sequence, so it can keep winning until it faces a stronger cow.

Wait, but it's not just about the position; it's also about how the tournament progresses.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, in the tournament, matches are played sequentially:

- Match 1: pos1 vs pos2

- Match 2: winner of match1 vs pos3

- ...

- Match m: winner of match m-1 vs pos m+1

And so on, until all matches are done.

My cow at position p will participate in the match when it's pos p's turn, against the current winner up to that point.

I need to calculate how many matches it can win from that point.

This seems complicated to simulate directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the path my cow takes in the tournament.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings that come before my cow in the sequence.

But again, it's not just about the number before it, but also about the sequence in which matches are played.

Let me consider that my cow can win all the matches against cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position p, I need to see how many cows with lower ratings are between position 1 and p-1.

But considering the tournament structure, it's not just about the number before it; it's about whether those cows are defeated before my cow gets to play against them.

Wait, maybe I need to find the number of cows with lower ratings that are before my cow in the sequence and ensure that my cow can defeat them in the matches.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the tournament is essentially a linked list of matches, where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow at position p, it will face the current winner up to position p.

To maximize wins, I need to place my cow such that the current winner up to position p has the lowest possible rating, so my cow can defeat it and then proceed to defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can precompute for each position, what is the rating of the winner up to that position.

Then, if I place my cow at position p, it will face the winner up to position p-1.

If my cow's rating is higher, it wins and becomes the new winner for the next matches.

Otherwise, it loses.

So, the number of wins is the number of positions where my cow's rating is higher than the winner up to that point.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s define w(p) as the winner up to position p.

w(1) = pos1

w(2) = higher of pos1 and pos2

w(3) = higher of w(2) and pos3

and so on.

If I place my cow at position p, then:

- For positions 1 to p-1, my cow hasn't participated yet, so the winners are determined by the existing cows.

- At position p, my cow faces w(p-1). If my cow's rating > w(p-1), it wins and becomes the new winner.

- Then, at position p+1, the new winner faces pos p+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins for my cow is:

- 1 for winning at position p (if it wins there)

- Plus the number of subsequent positions it can win against.

But to maximize this, I need to choose p such that:

- The winner up to p-1 is as low as possible, so my cow can defeat it.

- And then, after p, there are as many cows as possible with lower ratings that my cow can defeat.

This seems optimal.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose p such that:

- The winner up to p-1 is less than my cow's rating.

- And then, from p onwards, my cow can defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

So, the number of wins is:

- If w(p-1) < my cow's rating, then 1 (for defeating w(p-1)) plus the number of cows from p+1 to n with ratings less than my cow's rating, until it faces a cow with higher rating.

- Else, 0.

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me think differently.

Let’s precompute for each position p, the winner up to p, w(p).

Then, for my cow placed at position q, the number of wins is:

- If q = 1: my cow faces pos2, pos3, ..., posn, as long as its rating is higher.

- If q > 1: my cow faces w(q-1), then pos q+1, pos q+2, ..., posn, as long as its rating is higher.

So, for each q, I need to:

- Check if w(q-1) < my cow's rating.

- If yes, then my cow wins against w(q-1), and then can win against all subsequent cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with higher rating.

- If no, then my cow doesn't win any match.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose q such that w(q-1) < my cow's rating, and then count the number of subsequent cows with lower ratings.

But computing this for each possible q would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that w(p) is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p.

Because the winner up to p is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to p.

Wait, is that correct?

Actually, no.

Because the tournament is not necessarily choosing the highest rated cow overall, but rather based on the match sequence.

Wait, let's think carefully.

In the first match, pos1 vs pos2, the higher rated cow wins.

Then, in the second match, the winner of match1 vs pos3, again, the higher rated cow wins.

And so on.

So, w(p) is the higher of w(p-1) and pos p+1.

Wait, let's define w(p) properly.

Let’s define w(p) as the winner of the first p matches.

Then:

w(1) = higher of pos1 and pos2

w(2) = higher of w(1) and pos3

w(3) = higher of w(2) and pos4

and so on.

So, w(p) is the higher rated cow among positions 1 to p+1.

Wait, no.

Actually, w(p) is the winner of the first p matches.

Given the way matches are structured, w(p) is the higher rated cow among positions 1 to p+1.

Wait, but that might not be true.

Let me take an example.

Suppose n=3, pos1=10, pos2=20, pos3=15.

Match1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is pos2 (20).

Match2: pos2 vs pos3, winner is pos2 (20).

So, w(1)=20, w(2)=20.

But according to the highest rating among positions 1 to p+1:

For p=1, positions 1 to 2: higher is 20.

For p=2, positions 1 to 3: higher is 20.

So in this case, w(p) is indeed the highest rating among positions 1 to p+1.

Wait, is this always true?

Let’s take another example.

n=4, pos1=10, pos2=15, pos3=20, pos4=25.

Match1: pos1 vs pos2, winner is pos2 (15).

Match2: pos2 vs pos3, winner is pos3 (20).

Match3: pos3 vs pos4, winner is pos4 (25).

So, w(1)=15, w(2)=20, w(3)=25.

But the highest rating among positions 1 to p+1:

p=1: pos1 to pos3: highest is 20.

p=2: pos1 to pos4: highest is 25.

p=3: pos1 to pos5: but n=4, so undefined.

Wait, this doesn't match the actual winners.

So, w(p) is not always equal to the highest rating among positions 1 to p+1.

In the above example, w(1)=15, which is not the highest among pos1 to pos3 (which is 20).

So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps w(p) is equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p+1, but only if that maximum rating has not been defeated before.

Wait, that might be too vague.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that the winner up to match p is the cow with the highest rating among all the cows that have participated in the first p matches.

Wait, but in the second example:

n=4, pos1=10, pos2=15, pos3=20, pos4=25.

Match1: pos1 (10) vs pos2 (15), winner is pos2 (15).

Match2: pos2 (15) vs pos3 (20), winner is pos3 (20).

Match3: pos3 (20) vs pos4 (25), winner is pos4 (25).

So, the winner up to match1 is 15, up to match2 is 20, up to match3 is 25.

So, w(p) is indeed the highest rating among all cows that have participated in the first p matches.

Wait, but in match1, cows 1 and 2 participate, so w(1)=15.

In match2, winner of match1 (15) vs pos3 (20), so w(2)=20.

In match3, w(2)=20 vs pos4=25, so w(3)=25.

So, w(p) is the highest rating among all cows that have participated in the first p matches.

Therefore, w(p) is equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p+1.

Wait, in the earlier example, w(1)=15, which is the max of pos1 and pos2.

w(2)=20, which is the max of pos1, pos2, pos3.

w(3)=25, which is the max of pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4.

So, indeed, w(p) is equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p+1.

Wait, but in the earlier smaller example, it seemed consistent.

Wait, perhaps it is always true.

Let me check another example.

n=3, pos1=10, pos2=20, pos3=15.

Match1: pos1 (10) vs pos2 (20), winner is 20.

Match2: pos2 (20) vs pos3 (15), winner is 20.

So, w(1)=20, w(2)=20.

The maximum rating among positions 1 to 2 is 20, positions 1 to 3 is 20.

So, in both cases, w(p) is equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p+1.

Wait, in the previous example where n=4, pos1=10, pos2=15, pos3=20, pos4=25:

w(1)=15 (max of pos1 and pos2)

w(2)=20 (max of pos1, pos2, pos3)

w(3)=25 (max of pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4)

So, yes, w(p) is equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p+1.

Therefore, I can define w(p) = max(a[0] to a[p]) for p from 0 to n-2.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n, indices from 0 to n-1.

So, w(p) for match p is the max of a[0] to a[p+1].

Because match p is between w(p-1) and a[p+1], and w(p) is the max of w(p-1) and a[p+1], which is the max of a[0] to a[p+1].

Wait, yes.

So, w(p) = max(a[0] to a[p+1])

Therefore, I can precompute w(p) for all p from 0 to n-2 as the maximum of a[0] to a[p+1].

Now, if I place my cow at position q, then:

- If q == 1:

  - My cow faces pos2, then pos3, etc.

  - The number of wins is the number of cows from pos2 to posn with lower ratings than my cow.

- If q > 1:

  - My cow faces w(q-2), which is the winner up to match q-1.

  - If my cow's rating > w(q-2), it wins and becomes the new winner.

  - Then, it faces pos q+1, pos q+2, etc., as long as its rating is higher.

So, in general, for q from 1 to n:

- If q == 1:

  - Wins against all pos2 to posn with lower ratings, until it faces a higher rated cow.

- If q > 1:

  - First, check if my cow's rating > w(q-2).

  - If yes, it wins against w(q-2), and then can win against all subsequent cows with lower ratings.

  - If no, it doesn't win any match.

So, for each possible q, I can calculate the number of wins.

But iterating over all q from 1 to n is too slow for the given constraints.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the original sequence, without swapping, my cow is at position k.

I can calculate the number of wins for my cow in its original position.

Then, consider the option to swap it with another position.

I need to find the best position to place my cow to maximize its wins.

Given that w(p) is known for all p, I can precompute for each possible q, the number of wins if my cow is placed at q.

Then, choose the q that gives the maximum number of wins.

But again, this is too slow for n up to 1e5 per test case.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the number of wins my cow can achieve.

In the original setup, my cow at position k can win against all the cows before it that it can defeat in the tournament path.

But with the option to swap, I can place my cow elsewhere to potentially increase its wins.

I need to find the optimal position for my cow to maximize its wins.

Let me consider that the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that my cow can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is:

- If p == 1: the number of cows from pos2 to posn with lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a higher rated cow.

- If p > 1: if my cow's rating > w(p-2), then 1 (for defeating w(p-2)) plus the number of subsequent cows with lower ratings.

Wait, p-2 might be negative. Let's adjust the indices.

Wait, w(p-1) is the winner up to match p-1.

So, for q == p, if q > 1, my cow at q faces w(q-2), because w(q-2) is the winner up to match q-2, which is the winner before q.

Wait, I'm getting confused with the indices.

Let me try to rephrase.

Let’s precompute w(p) for p from 0 to n-2, where w(p) is the winner of the first p+1 matches, and it's equal to the maximum rating among positions 1 to p+2.

Then, if I place my cow at position q (1-based), I need to consider:

- If q == 1: my cow faces pos2, pos3, ..., in sequence.

- If q > 1: my cow faces the winner up to q-1, which is w(q-2), because w(q-2) is the winner up to match q-2, which is the winner before q.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the sequence of matches.

Let’s consider that in the tournament, the current winner starts from the first match.

If I place my cow at position q, then:

- Up to match q-1, the winner is w(q-2).

- Then, in match q-1, w(q-2) faces my cow at position q.

- If my cow's rating > w(q-2), it wins and becomes the new winner.

- Then, in match q, my cow faces pos q+1.

- And so on, as long as my cow's rating is higher than the next cow.

So, the number of wins for my cow is:

- 1 if it wins against w(q-2) (when q > 1)

- Plus the number of subsequent cows (from q+1 to n) that have lower ratings than my cow.

But need to ensure that my cow keeps winning against each subsequent cow until it faces one with a higher rating.

So, the total wins are:

- If q == 1: number of subsequent cows with lower ratings than my cow.

- If q > 1: 1 (for beating w(q-2)) plus the number of subsequent cows with lower ratings, provided that my cow's rating > w(q-2).

But again, iterating over all q is too slow.

I need a way to find the optimal q without checking all possibilities.

Let me consider that to maximize the number of wins, I need to place my cow in a position where:

- The winner up to q-1 is as low as possible, so my cow can defeat it.

- And then, my cow can defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

So, I need to find a q where w(q-2) is less than my cow's rating, and the number of subsequent cows with lower ratings is maximized.

But w(q-2) is the maximum rating among positions 1 to q-1.

So, w(q-2) = max(a[0] to a[q-1]) for q >= 2.

For q == 1, w(-1) doesn't exist, so my cow directly faces pos2.

So, for q == 1, the number of wins is the number of subsequent cows with lower ratings until it faces a higher rated cow.

Similarly, for q > 1, if a[q-1] > w(q-2), then it wins 1 (against w(q-2)) plus the number of subsequent cows with lower ratings.

Wait, no.

If I place my cow at q, its rating is x.

Then, if q == 1:

- It faces pos2, pos3, ..., as long as x > pos i.

- So, the number of wins is the length of the longest prefix of pos2 to posn where x > pos i.

If q > 1:

- It faces w(q-2).

- If x > w(q-2), it wins 1 (against w(q-2)), and then can face pos q+1, pos q+2, ..., as long as x > pos i.

So, in both cases, it's about how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat, starting from its position.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of cows with lower ratings that come after the position where I place my cow, including the possibility of defeating the winner up to that point.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me consider that in order to maximize the number of wins, I should place my cow in a position where:

- It can defeat the winner up to that point (if any).

- And then defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

So, the number of wins is:

- 0, if it can't defeat the winner up to that point.

- 1 (for defeating the winner up to that point) plus the number of subsequent cows it can defeat.

Therefore, the total wins are:

wins(q) = 0 if x <= w(q-2)

         1 + suffix_wins(q) otherwise

where suffix_wins(q) is the number of consecutive cows after q with ratings less than x.

But again, iterating over all q is too slow.

I need a way to compute the maximum wins over all possible q efficiently.

Let me consider that the optimal q is where w(q-2) < x and suffix_wins(q) is maximized.

Given that w(q-2) is the maximum of a[0] to a[q-1], and suffix_wins(q) is the length of the longest suffix from q where x > a[q], a[q+1], etc.

So, to maximize wins, I need to choose q where:

- w(q-2) < x

- And suffix_wins(q) is maximized.

But since w(q-2) is the maximum of a[0] to a[q-1], to have w(q-2) < x, x must be greater than the maximum of a[0] to a[q-1].

So, for a given x, I need to find q where:

- q == 1: x > a[1]

- q > 1: x > max(a[0] to a[q-1])

And then,
