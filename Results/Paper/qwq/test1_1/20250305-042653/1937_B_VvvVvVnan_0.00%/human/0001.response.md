Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones. There's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) and it needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only jump one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we can form a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this smallest string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, each path from (1,1) to (2,N) will consist of exactly N-1 right moves and 1 down move, making a total of N steps.

Wait, no. Let's think about it. Starting at (1,1), to reach (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make moves that are either right or down. Each path will consist of a sequence of these moves, and the total number of moves will be N-1 right moves (to go from column 1 to column N) and 1 down move (to go from row 1 to row 2). So, in total, there will be N moves: N-1 right and 1 down.

But actually, that's not accurate. Let's consider a smaller grid to visualize.

Suppose N=2, so a 2x2 grid:

Row 1: a11 a12

Row 2: a21 a22

Possible paths from (1,1) to (2,2):

1. Right to (1,2), then down to (2,2). The string is a11, a12, a22.

2. Down to (2,1), then right to (2,2). The string is a11, a21, a22.

So, in both paths, the string ends up being a11, a12, a22 or a11, a21, a22.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for N=2 with all zeros, the smallest string is "000" and there are two paths that give this string.

So, in general, for N, each path will have N+1 characters in the string because you start at (1,1) and make N moves to reach (2,N), collecting the values of the cells you land on.

Wait, no. In the N=2 case, there are two paths, each resulting in a string of length 3 (N+1=3).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the goal is, among all possible paths, find the lexicographically smallest string, and count how many paths result in that string.

Lexicographical order means comparing strings character by character from left to right, and the smallest string is the one that has the smallest character at the first position where they differ.

So, to find the smallest string, we need to choose paths that lead to the smallest possible sequence of zeros and ones.

I need to think about how to efficiently find this smallest string and count the number of paths that give this string, especially since N can be up to 2*10^5, and the total sum of N over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so it needs to be efficient.

First, I need to think about how to find the smallest possible string.

One way to approach this is to consider the grid as a graph where the grasshopper can move right or down, and we need to find the path that gives the smallest sequence of cell values.

Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, the paths have a specific structure.

I need to find a way to choose the path that minimizes the string lexicographically.

I recall that in grid paths, especially with such movement constraints, dynamic programming can be useful.

Maybe I can use dynamic programming to keep track of the smallest string achievable up to each cell.

But, since we're dealing with strings, it might be tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can greedily choose the smallest possible character at each step.

Let me think about that.

Starting at (1,1), the first character of the string is a11.

Then, at each step, I can choose to move right to the next cell in the same row or down to the next row.

I need to choose the move that leads to the smallest possible string.

So, perhaps at each step, I should choose the move that allows the smallest possible character to be appended to the string.

But, it's not that straightforward because the choice affects future choices.

Wait, maybe I can think of it recursively.

Define a function that, given the current position in the grid, returns the smallest possible string from that position to the end.

But with N up to 2*10^5, a recursive approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the path consists of moving right most of the time and moving down at some point.

In other words, the grasshopper will move right a certain number of times and then move down and then move right to the end.

Wait, no. Actually, the grasshopper can interleave right and down moves, but given that there are only two rows, the down moves can only be from row 1 to row 2, and once you move down, you can't move up.

So, in reality, the path can be represented by when you decide to move down.

You have to move down exactly once, from some column x to column x+1.

Wait, not necessarily. You can move down at any step, but in practice, since there are only two rows, once you move down, you can't move back up.

So, the path can be characterized by the point where you switch from row 1 to row 2.

Suppose you move right k times in row 1, and then move down to row 2, and then move right (N - k - 1) times in row 2.

So, the string would be: a11, a12, ..., a1(k+1), a2(k+1), a2(k+2), ..., a2N.

Wait, no. If you move right k times in row 1, you land on a1(k+1), then move down to a2(k+1), then move right to a2(k+2), and so on to a2N.

So, the string is: a11, a12, ..., a1(k+1), a2(k+1), a2(k+2), ..., a2N.

And the number of such paths is determined by the choice of k, but with possible overlaps.

Wait, actually, it's not just about choosing k, because you can interleave right and down moves.

Wait, perhaps another way: since you have to make exactly one down move and N right moves, the total path length is N+1 moves, and the down move can be at any step from the first to the Nth step.

Wait, no. Wait, in total, you have to make N-1 right moves and 1 down move, but starting from (1,1), to reach (2,N), you need to make exactly one down move and N-1 right moves, in any order, but constrained by the grid.

Wait, actually, in a 2xN grid, with moves only right or down, the number of paths from (1,1) to (2,N) is N, because you can choose at which column you make the down move.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Starting at (1,1), you can choose to move right to (1,2), then right to (1,3), and so on up to (1,N), and then down to (2,N). Or, you can move right to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), and so on to (2,N). Or, you can move down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), and so on to (2,N).

So, in general, the down move can be at any step from the first move to the Nth move.

Therefore, there are N possible paths, each corresponding to a different position where the down move is made.

Wait, but in the first test case, N=2, and there are two paths, which matches this.

So, in general, there are N paths, each corresponding to choosing to move down at column 1 to column N.

Wait, but in the first test case, N=2, and there are two paths, as shown.

So, perhaps I can consider that there are N paths, each corresponding to moving down at a specific column.

Then, for each possible down column, I can construct the string for that path and find the lexicographically smallest one among them.

But N can be up to 2*10^5, and T up to 10^4, but with the sum of N over all test cases being up to 2*10^5, so it's manageable.

But even then, constructing each string for each path and comparing them lexicographically would be too slow, as it would be O(N^2) per test case in the worst case.

I need a smarter way to find the smallest string without generating all possible strings.

Let me think about how to compare the strings without generating them fully.

Since the strings are built by collecting the cells in order, and the paths differ based on where the down move is made, perhaps I can find a way to determine which path gives the smallest string by comparing the sequences.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the strings as being composed of the prefix in row 1 up to the point where the down move is made, plus the suffix in row 2 from that point onward.

So, for each possible down column k (from 1 to N), the string would be:

a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

And I need to find the lexicographically smallest among these strings.

To find the smallest string, I can iterate through the possible down columns and find the one that gives the smallest string.

But again, comparing the entire strings for each possible down column would be too slow for large N.

I need a way to find the smallest string more efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where the strings differ and compare them there.

But that still seems too slow.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as merging two sequences: the sequence from row 1 and the sequence from row 2, and choosing the point where to switch from row 1 to row 2 in a way that minimizes the resulting string.

This sounds similar to merging two sorted arrays, but in this case, the arrays are not sorted, and we're dealing with lexicographical order.

Let me consider the strings formed by staying in row 1 as long as possible and switching to row 2 at the optimal point.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the smallest possible string by choosing to switch rows at the right moment.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first test case:

N=2

Row 1: 00

Row 2: 00

Possible paths:

1. Right, right, down: 0,0,0

2. Right, down, right: 0,0,0

So, both paths give "000", and it's the smallest possible.

In the second test case:

N=4

Row 1: 1101

Row 2: 1100

Possible paths:

- Down at column 1: 1,1,1,0,0

- Down at column 2: 1,1,1,0,0

- Down at column 3: 1,1,0,0

- Down at column 4: 1,1,0,0

Wait, but in the example output, it's "11000" with one path.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, no, in the second test case, N=4, and the output is "11000" with one path.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, down at column 1: 1,1,1,0,0

Down at column 2: 1,1,1,0,0

Down at column 3: 1,1,0,0

Down at column 4: 1,1,0,0

Wait, but "11000" is from down at column 1 or 2, which gives "11100", which is different from "11000".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the path construction.

Wait, in the second test case, N=4.

Row 1: 1101

Row 2: 1100

In the explanation, it shows that the smallest string is "11000", achieved by one path.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the actual steps more carefully.

Let me try to list all possible paths:

1. Right, right, right, down: 1,1,0,1,0 (from a11, a12, a13, a14, a24)

2. Right, right, down, right: 1,1,0,0 (from a11, a12, a22, a23, a24)

Wait, but in the second path, it's 1,1,0,0,0.

Wait, no, wait, in the second path: right to a12, right to a13, down to a23, right to a24.

So, the string is a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

Similarly, the first path: right to a12, right to a13, right to a14, down to a24: 1,1,0,1,0 → "11010"

So, "11000" is lexicographically smaller than "11010".

Similarly, other paths:

- Down at column 1: a11, a21, a22, a23, a24: 1,1,1,0,0 → "11100"

- Down at column 2: a11, a12, a22, a23, a24: 1,1,1,0,0 → "11100"

- Down at column 3: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

- Down at column 4: a11, a12, a13, a14, a24: 1,1,0,1,0 → "11010"

So, the smallest string is "11000", achieved by the path where down is moved at column 3.

And there's only one such path that gives "11000", which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, even though down at column 3 and down at column 4 both give different strings, only down at column 3 gives "11000".

Wait, but in the first test case, down at column 1 and down at column 2 both give "000", so there are two paths giving the smallest string.

So, in general, I need to find the smallest possible string among all possible down columns and count how many down columns give that string.

But in the second test case, only down at column 3 gives "11000", while down at column 1 and 2 give "11100", and down at column 4 gives "11010", which are larger.

So, how to efficiently find the smallest string and count the number of paths giving it.

I need an efficient way to find the minimal string.

Let me think about the structure of the strings.

Each string is composed of the prefix from row 1 up to the down move, plus the suffix from row 2 starting from the down move.

So, for down at column k, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

I need to choose k such that this sequence is lexicographically smallest.

To find the minimal k, I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need a way to compare the strings efficiently without generating them fully each time.

I need a way to find the minimal starting point for switching to row 2.

Let me consider that the strings differ based on the point where we switch rows.

I can iterate through the columns and find the point where switching gives the smallest possible extension.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current minimal string prefix.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize the minimal string as the string obtained by staying in row 1 until the end and then going down, which is a11, a12, ..., a1N, a2N.

Then, iterate through each column from 1 to N-1, and consider switching down at that column, i.e., going from a11 to a1k, then a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N, and compare the resulting string with the current minimal string.

If it's smaller, update the minimal string.

But again, this seems too slow if done naively.

I need a smarter way to find the minimal string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where row 1 starts having a higher value than row 2, and switch there.

But it's not that simple because of the lexicographical order.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first column where a1k > a2k, and switch just before that.

But in the sample input, that doesn't seem to directly apply.

Wait, in the second test case, Row1: 1101, Row2:1100

Looking at each column:

Column1: a11=1, a21=1 → same

Column2: a12=1, a22=1 → same

Column3: a13=0, a23=0 → same

Column4: a14=1, a24=0 → a14 > a24

So, if I switch at column 4, I get a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

If I switch at column 3, I get a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

Wait, so switching at column 3 and 4 both give "11000", but in the explanation, only one path gives "11000".

Wait, no, in the explanation, it says there is only one path that gives "11000", which is switching at column 3.

But according to my earlier analysis, switching at column 3 and column 4 both give "11000".

Wait, no, actually, switching at column 4 gives a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

Wait, no, no, wait: if you switch at column 4, you get a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

But according to the explanation, switching at column 3 gives "11000", and switching at column 4 gives "11010", but in my calculation, switching at column 4 gives "11000".

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the path construction.

Wait, no, in the second test case, Row1:1101, Row2:1100

- Switch at column 3: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24: 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

- Switch at column 4: a11, a12, a13, a14, a24: 1,1,0,1,0 → "11010"

Ah, I see, I misremembered the path construction.

When switching at column k, the path is right to a1k, then down to a2k, then right to a2(N).

So, switching at column k means the string is a11, a12, ..., a1(k-1), a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

Wait, no, in the first path, right, right, right, down: a11, a12, a13, a14, a24 → "11010"

Second path: right, right, down, right: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 → "11000"

Third path: right, down, right, right: a11, a12, a22, a23, a24 → "11100"

Fourth path: down, right, right, right: a11, a21, a22, a23, a24 → "11100"

So, indeed, only switching at column 3 gives "11000", and switching at column 4 gives "11010".

Wait, but in my earlier thought, switching at column 3: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 → "11000"

Switching at column 4: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 → "11000"

Wait, no, switching at column 4: a11, a12, a13, a14, a24 → "11010"

Ah, I see, I was confused about the path construction.

So, switching at column k means:

- Move right to a1k

- Then down to a2k

- Then right to a2(N)

So, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

Wait, no, in the path, when you move down to a2k, then you can only move right in row 2.

So, the string is a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

So, for k=3: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 → "11000"

For k=4: a11, a12, a13, a14, a24 → "11010"

So, indeed, only k=3 gives "11000", and k=4 gives "11010".

So, in this case, the minimal string is "11000", achieved only by k=3.

So, how to generalize this.

I need to find the k that minimizes the string a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

And then count how many k give this minimal string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to find this.

Let me think about how to compare the strings for different k.

I need to find the k that gives the smallest possible a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the minimal string found so far, and the count of k that give this string.

But this would be O(N^2) in the worst case, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N and keep track of the point where switching gives the smallest extension.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal possible a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, ..., a2N by finding the minimal possible a11, a12, ..., a1k, followed by a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

But again, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k and find the minimal possible a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, ..., a2N by finding the minimal a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, ..., a2N.

Wait, maybe I can find the point where a1k is smaller than a2k, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where a1k differs from a2k, and choose to switch there.

But in the sample input, a1k and a2k are the same for some k.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal possible a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, ..., a2N by choosing the smallest possible a1k and a2k at each step.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as merging two sequences: the sequence from row 1 and the sequence from row 2, and choosing the point to switch to row 2 in a way that minimizes the resulting string.

This sounds similar to merging two sorted arrays, but again, it's not sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal possible string up to that point.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns from left to right, and at each column, I decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

I need to choose the path that gives the smallest lexicographical string.

I can use a dynamic programming approach where I keep track of the current row and the current string built so far.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need something more efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the minimal choices at each step.

Let me consider that at each column, I have to choose whether to stay in row 1 or move to row 2.

But once I move to row 2, I have to stay in row 2 for the remaining columns.

So, effectively, I have to choose the column k where I switch from row 1 to row 2, and then for k from 1 to N, I can choose to switch at k.

So, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compute the string a11 to a1k, a2k to a2N, and find the minimal such string.

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimum for row 2, so that for each k, I can quickly determine a2k to a2N.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just the minimum values.

Wait, maybe I can find the point where a1k > a2k, and switch just before that.

But in the sample input, that doesn't directly apply.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first column where a1k > a2k, and switch just before that.

But in the second test case, a1k and a2k are equal for k=1,2,3, and a14 > a24, so switching at k=3 gives the smallest string.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal possible a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, ..., a2N by choosing k such that a1k is as small as possible, and a2k is as small as possible.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the one where we stay in row 1 as long as row 1 has smaller or equal values to row 2, and switch to row 2 when row 2 has a smaller value.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and compare a1k and a2k, and switch to row 2 when a2k < a1k.

But in the second test case, a1k <= a2k for k=1,2,3, and a14 > a24, so switching at k=3 gives the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the point where a1k > a2k, and switch just before that.

In the second test case, a1k <= a2k for k=1,2,3, and a14 > a24, so switching at k=3 gives the smallest string.

Similarly, in the first test case, a1k == a2k for all k, so any switching point gives the same string.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize this.

Iterate through the columns and find the maximal k such that a11 <= a21, a12 <= a22, ..., a1k <= a2k, and then switch at column k.

In the second test case, k=3 is the maximal k where a1k <= a2k for all k=1 to 3.

So, switching at k=3 gives the smallest string.

In the first test case, since a1k == a2k for all k, any k would give the same string.

Wait, but in the first test case, switching at k=1 and k=2 both give "000", and switching at k=3 would also give "000".

Wait, but in the first test case, N=2, so k can be 1 or 2.

Switching at k=1: a11, a21, a22: 0,0,0 → "000"

Switching at k=2: a11, a12, a22: 0,0,0 → "000"

So, two paths give "000".

So, in this case, any k gives "000".

So, perhaps the minimal string is achieved by all k where a11 <= a21, a12 <= a22, ..., a1k <= a2k.

Wait, but in the second test case, only k=3 gives the minimal string "11000", while k=1 and k=2 give "11100", which is larger.

Wait, but according to my earlier condition, for k=1 and k=2, a1k <= a2k, but switching at k=3 gives a smaller string.

So, perhaps I need to find the maximal k such that a11 <= a21, a12 <= a22, ..., a1k <= a2k, and then switch at that k.

In the second test case, k=3 is the maximal k where a1k <= a2k for all k=1 to 3.

So, switching at k=3 gives the smallest string.

Similarly, in the first test case, since a1k == a2k for all k, any k would give the same string.

So, perhaps the general strategy is:

- Find the maximal k such that a11 <= a21, a12 <= a22, ..., a1k <= a2k.

- Then, switch at that k.

- The number of such k is the number of paths that give the minimal string.

Wait, but in the second test case, only k=3 satisfies this condition, and it gives the minimal string.

Wait, but in the first test case, all k satisfy a1k <= a2k, since a1k == a2k.

So, in that case, all k from 1 to N give the minimal string.

Wait, but in the first test case, N=2, and there are two paths giving "000".

So, perhaps the number of paths giving the minimal string is the number of k where a11 <= a21, a12 <= a22, ..., a1k <= a2k.

Wait, but in the second test case, only k=3 satisfies this condition.

Wait, but for k=1 and k=2, a11 <= a21 and a12 <= a22, but switching at k=1 or k=2 doesn't give the minimal string.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal string among all possible switching points, but count only those switching points that give the minimal string.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through all possible switching points, compute their strings, find the minimal string, and count how many switching points give that string.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the string is built by taking a prefix from row 1 and suffix from row 2, connected at the switching point k.

So, the string is a11 to a1k, then a2k to a2N.

To make the entire string smallest lexicographically, I need to choose k such that the sequence a11 to a1k, a2k to a2N is smallest.

To find the minimal such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compare the sequence a11 to a1k, a2k to a2N with the current minimal string.

But comparing strings directly would be too slow.

I need a way to efficiently find the minimal possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching gives the smallest extension.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize the minimal string as the string obtained by switching at k=1: a11, a21, a22, ..., a2N.

Then, for each subsequent k from 2 to N, consider switching at k: a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N.

Compare this new string with the current minimal string, and if it's smaller, update the minimal string.

But again, this is O(N^2) in the worst case.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimum for row 2 starting from each k.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string, not just the minimum values.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where a1k differs from a2k, and choose to switch there.

But in the second test case, a1k == a2k for k=1,2,3, and a14 > a24, so switching at k=3 gives the minimal string.

So, perhaps I can find the point where a1k starts being larger than a2k and switch just before that.

In other words, find the maximal k such that for all j from 1 to k, a1j <= a2j.

Then, switch at that k.

In the second test case, k=3 is the maximal k where a1j <= a2j for all j=1 to 3.

So, switching at k=3 gives the minimal string.

Similarly, in the first test case, since a1j == a2j for all j, any k satisfies this condition.

So, in that case, all k give the minimal string.

So, perhaps I can find the maximal k such that a1j <= a2j for all j from 1 to k.

Then, the minimal string is obtained by switching at that k.

Moreover, if a1j == a2j for all j from 1 to k, then any k up to that point gives the same string.

Wait, but in the second test case, only k=3 gives the minimal string, while k=1 and k=2 give larger strings.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal string among all possible switching points, but in a way that's efficient.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns from left to right, keeping track of the current minimal string prefix.

I can keep track of the current minimal string up to column i, and then extend it with the appropriate values from row 1 or row 2.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming where dp[i][r] represents the minimal string from column 1 to i, ending
