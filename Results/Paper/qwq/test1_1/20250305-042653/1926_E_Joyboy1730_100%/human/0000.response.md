Alright, I have this problem to solve. Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The rules are a bit tricky, but let's break them down.

First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. So, if n is 7, the odd cards are 1, 3, 5, and 7. He lays them down in that order.

Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest. For n=7, twice the odd numbers would be 2*1=2, 2*3=6. So, he lays down 2 and then 6.

Then, he lays down all cards that are three times an odd number. For n=7, three times odd numbers would be 3*1=3, 3*3=9, but 9 is greater than 7, so only 3 is included. But wait, 3 is already laid down in the first step as an odd number. Does that mean he doesn't lay it down again? The problem says "once Vladislav puts a card down, he cannot use that card again." So, I think 3 is already used, so he skips it here.

Next, four times an odd number. For n=7, 4*1=4, 4*3=12 (which is greater than 7), so only 4 is included.

And so on, until all cards are laid down.

So, the order would be: 1,3,5,7 (odd numbers), then 2,6 (twice odd), then 4 (four times odd). That's 1,3,5,7,2,6,4 for n=7.

Now, the task is, given n and k, to find the k-th card in this sequence.

My initial thought is to categorize the cards based on the multiples of odd numbers and their powers.

Let's try to find a pattern or a mathematical way to determine the k-th card without simulating the entire process, especially since n can be up to 10^9 and t can be up to 5*10^4, which means we need an efficient solution, probably O(1) per test case or something very fast.

First, observe that each card is a multiple of an odd number by a power of 2.

For example:

- 1 is 1*1 (1 is odd, multiplied by 2^0)

- 2 is 1*2 (1 is odd, multiplied by 2^1)

- 3 is 3*1 (3 is odd, multiplied by 2^0)

- 4 is 1*4 (1 is odd, multiplied by 2^2)

- 5 is 5*1 (5 is odd, multiplied by 2^0)

- 6 is 3*2 (3 is odd, multiplied by 2^1)

- 7 is 7*1 (7 is odd, multiplied by 2^0)

So, the sequence is ordered by the odd part and then by the power of 2.

Wait, but according to the problem's specific ordering, it's first all odd numbers, then all twice odd numbers, then all three times odd numbers, and so on.

But in the example for n=7, it's 1,3,5,7 (odd), then 2,6 (twice odd), then 4 (four times odd).

So, it's grouped by the power of 2 multiplied to the odd number.

So, groups are:

- Power 0: odd numbers

- Power 1: twice odd numbers

- Power 2: four times odd numbers

- And so on.

Within each group, they are ordered by the odd multiplier, which is the (number)/(2^power), and then in increasing order.

Wait, but in the example, for power 0: 1,3,5,7

power 1: 2,6

power 2:4

So, within each power, ordered by the odd part, which is the number divided by 2^power.

Wait, but 4 divided by 2^2 is 1, which is odd.

So, it's ordered by the odd part, which is the largest odd divisor of the number.

So, another way to look at it is that the sequence is ordered by the largest odd divisor, and within the same largest odd divisor, ordered by the power of 2.

But in the problem's description, it's specified as first all odd numbers, then all twice odd numbers, and so on.

So, it's grouped by the power of 2.

So, to find the k-th card, I need to determine which group it falls into and then find its position within that group.

First, I need to find out how many groups there are and how many cards are in each group.

Let's define group 0 as power 0, which are the odd numbers.

Group 1 as power 1, which are twice the odd numbers.

Group 2 as power 2, which are four times the odd numbers.

And so on.

For a given n, I need to find out how many groups there are.

The highest power of 2 that can be multiplied to an odd number without exceeding n is floor(log2(n)).

So, the number of groups is floor(log2(n)) + 1.

Wait, but actually, it's more nuanced because for each group, the number of cards in that group depends on how many numbers up to n are divisible by 2^power and have an odd divisor.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to realize that each group corresponds to a distinct power of 2, and within each group, the numbers are ordered by their odd divisor.

So, for group p, where p is the power, the numbers in that group are all numbers of the form (2^p)*k, where k is an odd integer, and (2^p)*k <= n.

So, for each group p, the number of cards in that group is floor(n / (2^p)) // 1 (since k must be odd).

Wait, more precisely, for group p, the number of cards is floor(n / (2^p)) // 2^0 = floor(n / (2^p)).

But actually, k is an odd integer, so the number of odd k's such that (2^p)*k <= n is ceil((floor(n / (2^p)) + 1)/2).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to note that for group p, the numbers are (2^p)*1, (2^p)*3, (2^p)*5, ..., up to the largest odd k such that (2^p)*k <= n.

So, the number of cards in group p is floor(n / (2^p) / 2) + 1 if n / (2^p) is odd, else floor(n / (2^p) / 2).

Wait, simpler: for group p, the number of cards is floor(n / (2^p) / 2) rounded up if n / (2^p) is odd.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute m = floor(n / (2^p)), then the number of odd multiples up to m is ceil(m / 2).

So, for group p, number of cards is ceil(floor(n / (2^p)) / 2).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, for each group p, from p=0 to p=log2(n), the number of cards is ceil(n / (2^p) / 2).

Wait, or ceil(floor(n / (2^p)) / 2).

Now, to find the k-th card, I need to iterate through the groups, summing up the number of cards in each group, until the sum reaches or exceeds k.

Once I find the group p where the cumulative sum reaches k, I can then find the position of k within that group and determine the corresponding card.

So, I need to compute the cumulative counts of cards in each group, and find in which group the k-th card lies.

Then, within that group, calculate which card it is based on its position in the group.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, read the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, read n and k.

Then, determine the groups and their card counts.

Initialize a list to hold the number of cards in each group.

Initialize p=0, and continue until 2^p <= n.

For each p, compute m = floor(n / (2^p)), then number of odd multiples is ceil(m / 2).

Append ceil(m / 2) to the list.

Increment p and repeat.

Once all group sizes are computed, iterate through the list, keeping a running total of cards.

When the running total equals or exceeds k, that's the group where the k-th card is.

Then, compute the position of k within that group.

Within group p, the cards are (2^p)*1, (2^p)*3, (2^p)*5, ..., up to the largest odd k such that (2^p)*k <= n.

So, the i-th card in group p is (2^p)*(2*i - 1), where i starts from 1.

Given the position j within the group, the card is (2^p)*(2*j - 1).

So, once I have the group p and the position j=k - cumulative sum up to previous groups, I can compute the card.

Wait, but I need to make sure that (2^p)*(2*j - 1) <= n, because some higher j might exceed n.

Wait, but when computing the group sizes, I already ensured that m = floor(n / (2^p)), so the largest k is floor(m / 2), which should correspond to the largest j such that (2^p)*(2*j - 1) <= n.

So, within group p, j can range from 1 to ceil(m / 2), where m = floor(n / (2^p)).

So, for the k-th card in group p, j = k - cumulative sum up to previous groups.

Then, card = (2^p)*(2*j - 1).

But need to ensure that card <=n.

Wait, but since j <= ceil(m / 2), and m = floor(n / (2^p)), then (2^p)*(2*j - 1) <= n.

Wait, no, because 2*j -1 could be larger than m.

Wait, m = floor(n / (2^p)), so (2^p)*m <=n.

But m is even or odd.

If m is even, then ceil(m / 2) = m/2, and the largest j is m/2, so (2^p)*(2*(m/2) -1) = (2^p)*(m -1), which is less than or equal to n.

If m is odd, ceil(m / 2) = (m+1)/2, so j=(m+1)/2, then (2^p)*(2*((m+1)/2) -1) = (2^p)*(m +1 -1) = (2^p)*m, which is <=n.

So, it's safe.

Hence, the k-th card in group p is (2^p)*(2*j -1), where j = k - cumulative sum up to previous groups.

Now, let's see an example.

Take n=7, k=1.

Groups:

p=0: m= floor(7/1)=7, ceil(7/2)=4 → cards:1,3,5,7

p=1: m=floor(7/2)=3, ceil(3/2)=2 → cards:2,6

p=2: m=floor(7/4)=1, ceil(1/2)=1 → card:4

p=3: m=floor(7/8)=0, ceil(0/2)=0 → no cards

Cumulative sums:

Group 0: 4 cards

Group 1: 2 cards (total 6)

Group 2:1 card (total 7)

So, for k=1, it's in group 0, j=1, card=1* (2*1 -1)=1

k=2, group 0, j=2, card=1*(2*2 -1)=3

k=3, group 0, j=3, card=1*(2*3 -1)=5

k=4, group 0, j=4, card=1*(2*4 -1)=7

k=5, group 1, j=1, card=2*(2*1 -1)=2

k=6, group 1, j=2, card=2*(2*2 -1)=6

k=7, group 2, j=1, card=4*(2*1 -1)=4

Which matches the example.

Another test case: n=1, k=1 → 1

n=34, k=14

Let's compute groups:

p=0: floor(34/1)=34, ceil(34/2)=17 → 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33

p=1: floor(34/2)=17, ceil(17/2)=9 → 2,6,10,14,18,22,26,30,34

p=2: floor(34/4)=8, ceil(8/2)=4 →4,12,20,28

p=3: floor(34/8)=4, ceil(4/2)=2 →8,24

p=4: floor(34/16)=2, ceil(2/2)=1 →16

p=5: floor(34/32)=1, ceil(1/2)=1 →32

Cumulative sums:

Group 0:17

Group 1:17+9=26

Group 2:26+4=30

Group 3:30+2=32

Group 4:32+1=33

Group 5:33+1=34

So, k=14 is within group 0, j=14, card=1*(2*14 -1)=27

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=84, k=19

Groups:

p=0: floor(84/1)=84, ceil(84/2)=42 →1,3,5,...,83

p=1: floor(84/2)=42, ceil(42/2)=21 →2,6,10,...,82

p=2: floor(84/4)=21, ceil(21/2)=11 →4,12,20,...,84

p=3: floor(84/8)=10, ceil(10/2)=5 →8,24,40,56,72

p=4: floor(84/16)=5, ceil(5/2)=3 →16,48,80

p=5: floor(84/32)=2, ceil(2/2)=1 →32,64

p=6: floor(84/64)=1, ceil(1/2)=1 →64

Wait, but p=6 is floor(84/64)=1, ceil(1/2)=1 →64, but p=5 already has 32 and 64, so p=6 would be 64, but it's already included in p=5.

Wait, but actually, p=5 is floor(84/32)=2, ceil(2/2)=1 →32, but 64 is included in p=5 as 32*2=64, but actually, p=5 is 32*1=32 and 32*3=96>84, so only 32.

Then p=6 is floor(84/64)=1, ceil(1/2)=1 →64.

So, group p=5 has 1 card:32

Group p=6 has 1 card:64

Cumulative sums:

Group 0:42

Group 1:42+21=63

Group 2:63+11=74

Group 3:74+5=79

Group 4:79+3=82

Group 5:82+1=83

Group 6:83+1=84

So, k=19 is within group 0, j=19, card=1*(2*19 -1)=37

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=1000000000, k=1000000000

This should be the last card, which is the largest number, 1000000000.

According to the sequence, it should be in the highest group.

Let's see:

p=0: floor(1000000000/1)=1000000000, ceil(1000000000/2)=500000000

p=1: floor(1000000000/2)=500000000, ceil(500000000/2)=250000000

p=2: floor(1000000000/4)=250000000, ceil(250000000/2)=125000000

...

Continuing this way, the cumulative sum should reach 1000000000 in the last group.

The last group would be p= floor(log2(1000000000))=30-1=29?

Wait, 2^30 is 1073741824, which is larger than 1000000000, so p=29 is floor(1000000000/536870912)=1, ceil(1/2)=1 →536870912

Then p=30 is floor(1000000000/1073741824)=0, so stops there.

So, the last card is 536870912, which is 2^29.

But according to the sample output, it's 536870912.

Wait, but 2^29 is 536870912, yes.

So, the k-th card is correctly computed.

Now, to implement this efficiently, especially for large n and t up to 5*10^4, I need to compute the group sizes quickly.

Computing each group size individually would be too slow for large n and t.

I need a faster way.

Let's see if there's a mathematical formula to directly compute the k-th card.

Looking back at the sample solution provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

L = []

while n:

m = (n + 1) // 2

n -= m

L.append(m)

tot = 0

pow = 1

for a in L:

if tot < k and k <= tot + a:

print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))

tot += a

pow *= 2

This seems to be doing something similar to what I described.

It's computing the number of cards in each group by repeatedly taking m = (n + 1) // 2, subtracting m from n, and appending m to a list L.

Then, it iterates through L, keeping a running total tot and a power of 2, and when k is within the current group, it prints pow * (2 * (k - tot) -1).

I need to verify if this correctly computes the group sizes.

Take n=7:

n=7

m=(7+1)//2=4, n=7-4=3, L=[4]

n=3

m=(3+1)//2=2, n=3-2=1, L=[4,2]

n=1

m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[4,2,1]

Then, tot=0, pow=1

First group: a=4, tot=0 < k <=4

If k=1, print 1*(2*(1-0)-1)=1*1=1

k=2: 1*(2*(2-0)-1)=3

k=3:5

k=4:7

tot +=4, tot=4, pow=2

Second group: a=2, tot=4 < k <=6

k=5:2*(2*(5-4)-1)=2*(2*1 -1)=2*1=2

k=6:2*(2*(6-4)-1)=2*3=6

tot +=2, tot=6, pow=4

Third group: a=1, tot=6 < k <=7

k=7:4*(2*(7-6)-1)=4*(2*1 -1)=4*1=4

Which matches the sequence 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Another test case: n=1, k=1

L=[1], tot=0, pow=1

a=1, 0<1<=1 → print 1*(2*(1-0)-1)=1*1=1

Correct.

n=34, k=14

Compute L:

n=34

m=(34+1)//2=17, n=34-17=17, L=[17]

n=17

m=(17+1)//2=9, n=17-9=8, L=[17,9]

n=8

m=(8+1)//2=4, n=8-4=4, L=[17,9,4]

n=4

m=(4+1)//2=2, n=4-2=2, L=[17,9,4,2]

n=2

m=(2+1)//2=1, n=2-1=1, L=[17,9,4,2,1]

n=1

m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[17,9,4,2,1,1]

tot=0, pow=1

a=17, 0<14<=17 → print 1*(2*(14-0)-1)=1*27=27

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=84, k=19

L:

n=84

m=(84+1)//2=42, n=84-42=42, L=[42]

n=42

m=(42+1)//2=21, n=42-21=21, L=[42,21]

n=21

m=(21+1)//2=11, n=21-11=10, L=[42,21,11]

n=10

m=(10+1)//2=5, n=10-5=5, L=[42,21,11,5]

n=5

m=(5+1)//2=3, n=5-3=2, L=[42,21,11,5,3]

n=2

m=(2+1)//2=1, n=2-1=1, L=[42,21,11,5,3,1]

n=1

m=(1+1)//2=1, n=1-1=0, L=[42,21,11,5,3,1,1]

tot=0, pow=1

a=42, 0<19<=42 → print 1*(2*(19-0)-1)=1*37=37

Which matches the sample output.

Lastly, n=1000000000, k=1000000000

Compute L:

n=1000000000

m=(1000000000+1)//2=500000000, n=1000000000-500000000=500000000, L=[500000000]

n=500000000

m=(500000000+1)//2=250000000, n=500000000-250000000=250000000, L=[500000000,250000000]

n=250000000

m=(250000000+1)//2=125000000, n=250000000-125000000=125000000, L=[500000000,250000000,125000000]

...

This process continues, halving n each time, until n=1.

Then, tot=0, pow=1

Iterate through L:

First a=500000000, tot=0 <1000000000<=500000000? No.

tot +=500000000, tot=500000000, pow=2

Second a=250000000, 500000000 <1000000000<=750000000? No.

tot +=250000000, tot=750000000, pow=4

Third a=125000000, 750000000 <1000000000<=875000000? No.

tot +=125000000, tot=875000000, pow=8

...

Continue until a=1, tot=999999999 <1000000000<=1000000000

print 2^p * (2*(1000000000 - 999999999)-1)=2^p *1

Need to find p such that tot +=a reaches 1000000000.

In this case, p=29, a=1, tot=999999999, k=1000000000

print 2^29 *1=536870912

Which matches the sample output.

So, the function seems to be correctly computing the k-th card.

But how does the while loop in the function compute the group sizes?

Looking at n and m=(n+1)//2, n -=m, L.append(m)

This seems to be repeatedly taking half of n, rounded up, and subtracting it from n.

This is effectively dividing n into groups where each group's size is roughly half of the remaining n.

In the context of the problem, it's grouping the cards by their largest odd divisor's "level".

Each iteration of the while loop corresponds to a level of the power of 2.

For example, in n=7:

L=[4,2,1]

Which corresponds to group p=0:4 cards, p=1:2 cards, p=2:1 card.

Similarly, in n=1000000000, L would be [500000000,250000000,125000000,...,1,1]

Each step is halving the remaining n, which aligns with the powers of 2.

Then, in the for loop, it iterates through L, keeping track of tot and pow.

When k is within the current group (tot < k <= tot+a), it computes the card as pow * (2*(k - tot) -1).

This seems to be correctly calculating the k-th card in the sequence.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
