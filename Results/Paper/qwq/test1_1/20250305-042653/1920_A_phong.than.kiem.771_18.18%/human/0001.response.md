Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. There are multiple test cases, and for each test case, there's a number n indicating the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing a pair of integers a and x, where a is the type of constraint and x is the value.

My task is to process these constraints and count the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to first determine the range of k based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then subtract the numbers within that range that are excluded by the constraints of type 3.

So, for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among these constraints because k needs to satisfy all constraints. Similarly, for constraints of type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among these because k has to be less than or equal to all of them.

Then, the possible values of k would be in the range from max_type1 to min_type2, inclusive.

After that, I need to account for the constraints of type 3 (k != x). For each of these, if x falls within the range [max_type1, min_type2], I need to exclude it from the count.

So, the total number of possible k would be the size of the range [max_type1, min_type2], minus the number of type 3 constraints that fall within this range.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let start = maximum of all x where a=1.

Let end = minimum of all x where a=2.

If start > end, then there are no possible k, so the answer is 0.

Otherwise, the number of possible k is (end - start + 1) minus the number of type 3 constraints that are in the range [start, end].

Wait, but I need to make sure that the type 3 constraints are only counted if they are within the range [start, end]. Because if x is outside this range, it doesn't affect the count.

So, in the code, I need to collect all the type 3 x's that are within [start, end] and count how many there are.

Then, the answer is (end - start + 1) - count of type 3 x's within [start, end].

But, I need to ensure that start <= end; otherwise, there are no possible k.

Let me look at the example to verify this logic.

In the first test case:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, constraints:

- k >= 3

- k <= 10

- k != 1

- k != 5

The range is from 3 to 10, which are the constraints from type 1 and 2.

Now, among these, k != 1 and k != 5. But 1 is outside the range, so only k != 5 matters.

So, within 3 to 10, k can be 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But k !=5, so exclude 5.

So, possible k: 3,4,6,7,8,9,10 â†’ 7 values.

Which matches the sample output.

In the second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

So, k >=5 and k <=4.

But 5 > 4, so no possible k, answer is 0.

Third test case:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

Wait, n=10.

Let's list them:

- k >=2

- k >=7

- k <=100

- k <=98

- k >=3

- k !=6

- k !=7

- k !=100

- k !=44

- k !=99

So, the effective range is max(2,7,3) to min(100,98), which is max(7) to min(98), so 7 to 98.

Now, exclude k=6 (but 6 is less than 7, so no exclusion), k=7, k=100 (100 is greater than 98, so no exclusion), k=44 (within range), k=99 (greater than 98, so no exclusion).

So, exclude only k=7 and k=44.

So, total possible k is 98 - 7 +1 = 92, minus 2 exclusions, so 90.

Which matches the sample output.

Fourth test case:

6

1 5

2 10

1 9

2 2

3 2

3 9

So, constraints:

- k >=5

- k <=10

- k >=9

- k <=2

- k !=2

- k !=9

Now, the range is max(5,9) to min(10,2), which is max(9) to min(2), which is 9 to 2. Since 9 > 2, no possible k, answer is 0.

Fifth test case:

5

1 1

2 2

3 1

3 2

3 3

So, constraints:

- k >=1

- k <=2

- k !=1

- k !=2

- k !=3

Range is max(1) to min(2), which is 1 to 2.

Possible k: 1,2.

But exclude k=1 and k=2, so no possible k, answer is 0.

Sixth test case:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

So, constraints:

- k >=10000

- k <=900000000

- k !=500000000

- k >=100000000

- k !=10000

- k !=900000001

Effective range: max(10000,100000000) to min(900000000), which is 100000000 to 900000000.

Now, exclude k=500000000 and k=10000 (which is less than 100000000, so no exclusion), and k=900000001 (which is greater than 900000000, so no exclusion).

So, only exclude k=500000000.

Total possible k: 900000000 - 100000000 +1 = 800000001, minus 1 exclusion, so 800000000.

Which matches the sample output.

So, my initial logic seems sound.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at func_7(), which seems to be the main function for processing each test case.

n = int(input())

start = -1

end = 1000000000.0

num = []

for i in range(n):

(t, v) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

if t == 1:

if start < v:

start = v

elif t == 2:

if end > v:

end = v

elif t == 3:

num.append(v)

count_num = 0

for i in num:

if i < start or i > end:

continue

else:

count_num += 1

if start > end:

return 0

return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0

Okay, so it's setting start to -1 initially and end to 1e9.

Then, for each constraint:

- If a=1, it updates start to be the maximum of current start and x.

- If a=2, it updates end to be the minimum of current end and x.

- If a=3, it collects x in the num list.

Then, it counts how many x in num are within [start, end], and subtracts that count from the size of the range [start, end].

If start > end, it returns 0.

This matches my logic.

But, I notice that end is initialized to 1000000000.0, which is a float. Shouldn't it be an integer?

Wait, in Python, when you do end - start +1, if end is a float, it will perform floating-point arithmetic, but since start is an int, it should be fine, as Python will handle it correctly.

But it's better to keep it as int.

Also, start is initialized to -1, which seems correct because any k >= some x should have start set to the maximum x.

Wait, but k cannot be negative unless specified, but in the problem, x can be any positive integer up to 1e9.

Wait, but k is an integer, and x are positive integers.

But in the constraints, a=1 means k >=x, where x is at least 1.

So, start should be at least 1.

But in the code, start is initialized to -1, and then updated to the maximum x where a=1.

Wait, but if all a=1 constraints have x less than or equal to some value, start will be set correctly.

Wait, no, because if a=1 constraints have x=3 and x=5, then start should be 5, the maximum of them.

So, initializing start to -1 is fine, as any x >=1 will be greater than -1.

Then, end is initialized to 1e9, and updated to the minimum x where a=2.

Again, if a=2 constraints have x=10 and x=5, end will be 5, the minimum of them.

Then, it collects all x where a=3 in the num list.

Then, it counts how many of these x are within [start, end], and subtracts that count from the size of the range.

This seems correct.

But, I need to make sure that if start > end, it returns 0, which it does.

Also, it checks that if the range size is less than count_num, it returns 0, otherwise, range size minus count_num.

But actually, count_num is the number of exclusions within the range, so it should just be range size minus count_num, but only if range size >=0.

Wait, in the code, it's:

return end - start +1 - count_num if end - start +1 >= count_num else 0

But logically, even if end - start +1 < count_num, the result should still be end - start +1 - count_num, which could be negative, but since it's guaranteed that the range is finite and start <= end, end - start +1 is always >=0.

So, it's safer to just return end - start +1 - count_num, and if count_num is greater than the range size, it will be 0 or negative, but since the range size is >=0, and count_num is >=0, it should be fine.

But in the code, it's checking if end - start +1 >= count_num, then return end - start +1 - count_num, else 0.

This is equivalent to max(0, end - start +1 - count_num), which is correct.

So, yes, the code seems correct.

I don't see any issues with it.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
