Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to print one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Now, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase letters. For example, if k is 2 and n is 2, the possible strings are "aa", "ab", "ba", and "bb". I need to check if each of these is a subsequence of s.

The problem asks to print "YES" if all of them are subsequences of s, and "NO" along with one missing string if not.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to solve this problem. Let's go through the code step by step to see if it's correct.

The function starts by reading the number of test cases, t. Then, for each test case, it reads n, k, m, and the string s.

Next, it initializes some variables: cnt to 0, cur to 0, and ans to an empty string.

Then, it iterates through each character in s:

- It calculates the ordinal value of the character minus 'a' to get a number between 0 and k-1.

- It checks if the bit corresponding to this number in cur is not set. If not, it sets that bit in cur.

- If cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, which is a bitmask where all k bits are set, it increments cnt and resets cur to 0, and appends the current character to ans.

After processing the entire string s, it checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n. If yes, it prints "YES"; else, it prints "NO" and tries to construct a string that doesn't exist as a subsequence in s.

Wait a minute, this seems suspicious. Let's think about what the code is actually doing.

The code is tracking, for each chunk of s, whether it contains all k characters. It does this by maintaining a bitmask cur, and when cur reaches a state where all k bits are set, it resets cur and increments cnt.

Then, cnt represents the number of times s contains all k characters in some order.

But the problem is not about counting how many times s contains all k characters. Instead, it's about checking if all possible combinations of length n using the first k characters are present as subsequences in s.

These are two different things. So, the code seems to be misaligned with the problem requirements.

Let me consider an example to see if the code works correctly.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Possible strings of length 2: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

I need to check if each of these is a subsequence of "abba".

- "aa": positions could be 1 and 3 (indices starting from 1)

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 1 (but order matters in subsequences, so positions 2 and 1 is not valid. Actually, "ba" can be positions 2 and 3.

- "bb": positions 2 and 4

Wait, positions for "ba": s[1]='a', s[2]='b', s[3]='b', s[4]='a'

To get "ba", we can take s[2]='b' and s[1]='a', but subsequence must maintain order, so we need to find 'b' first and then 'a' with increasing indices. So, s[2]='b' and s[4]='a' would give "ba".

Wait, but in the problem description, it says "without changing the order of the remaining characters." So, in "abba", "ba" can be formed by taking the second 'b' and the last 'a'.

So, all four strings are subsequences of "abba", so the answer should be "YES".

Now, let's see what the code does for this input.

s = "abba", k=2, n=2

Initialize cnt=0, cur=0, ans=''

First character 'a': cur_ss = 0

Check if cur & (1<<0) == 0: yes, because cur=0

So, cur += 1<<0 → cur=1

cur is not equal to (1<<2)-1 = 3, so move on

Next character 'b': cur_ss=1

cur & (1<<1) == 0: yes, cur=1

So, cur += 1<<1 → cur=3

Now, cur == 3, so cnt +=1, cur=0, ans+='b'

Next character 'b': cur_ss=1

cur & (1<<1)==0: yes, cur=2

cur !=3, move on

Next character 'a': cur_ss=0

cur & (1<<0)==0: yes, cur=2 +1=3

cur ==3, so cnt +=1, cur=0, ans+='a'

Now, cnt=2, which is >= n=2, so it prints "YES"

This matches the expected output.

Now, let's look at the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

Check if they are subsequences of "abb"

- "aa": positions 1 and ? (only one 'a'), so not possible

- "ab": positions 1 and 2

- "ba": positions 2 and 1 (but order matters), or positions 2='b' and positions 3='b', but need 'a' after 'b', which is not there. Wait, s[2]='b', s[3]='b', no 'a' after 'b'. So, "ba" is not a subsequence.

- "bb": positions 2 and 3

So, "aa" and "ba" are not subsequences. But according to the problem, if any of them is missing, we should print "NO" and one such string.

In this case, the code would do:

s="abb", k=2, n=2

Initialize cnt=0, cur=0, ans=''

First 'a': cur +=1<<0 → cur=1

cur !=3, move on

Next 'b': cur +=1<<1 → cur=3

cnt +=1, cur=0, ans+='b'

Next 'b': cur +=1<<1 → cur=2

cur !=3, move on

cnt=1, which is < n=2, so it prints "NO"

Then, it tries to find a character not in cur. cur=2, which is 'b', so 1<<1 is set.

It looks for the first i from 0 to k-1 where cur & (1<<i)==0, which is i=0, 'a'

So, ans += 'a' → ans='ba'

Then, ans += 'a' * (n - cnt -1) = 'a' * (2 -1 -1) = 'a' * 0 = ''

So, ans='ba'

But in the problem, the expected output is "aa". So, it's printing "ba", which is also correct because "ba" is not a subsequence of "abb". So, it's acceptable to print any missing string.

Hence, in this case, it's correct.

Now, let's look at the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Possible strings: all combinations of 'a','b','c' of length 3, total 27.

We need to check if all 27 are subsequences of s.

This is more complicated to check manually, but according to the problem, the answer is "NO" and the missing string is "ccc".

Let's see what the code does.

s="aabbccabab", k=3, n=3

Initialize cnt=0, cur=0, ans=''

Process 'a': cur +=1<<0 → cur=1

cur !=7, move on

'a': cur +=1<<0 → cur=1 (already set)

'b': cur +=1<<1 → cur=3

'b': cur +=1<<1 → cur=3

'c': cur +=1<<2 → cur=7

cnt +=1, cur=0, ans+='c'

'c': cur +=1<<2 → cur=4

cur !=7, move on

'a': cur +=1<<0 → cur=5

'b': cur +=1<<1 → cur=7

cnt +=1, cur=0, ans+='b'

'a': cur +=1<<0 → cur=1

'b': cur +=1<<1 → cur=3

'c': cur +=1<<2 → cur=7

cnt +=1, cur=0, ans+='c'

So, cnt=3, which is >= n=3, so it prints "YES"

But according to the problem, the answer is "NO" and "ccc" is missing.

So, there's a discrepancy here. The code is saying "YES", but the correct answer is "NO".

This indicates that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's recount:

s="aabbccabab"

Processing:

'a': cur=1, ans=''

'a': cur=1

'b': cur=3

'b': cur=3

'c': cur=7 → cnt=1, cur=0, ans='c'

'c': cur=4

'a': cur=5

'b': cur=7 → cnt=2, cur=0, ans='cb'

'a': cur=1

'b': cur=3

'a': cur=3

'b': cur=3

So, cnt=2, which is < n=3, so it should print "NO"

Wait, in my previous count, I had cnt=3, but actually, it's cnt=2.

So, the code should print "NO"

But according to the problem, it's "NO" and "ccc" is missing.

So, perhaps the code is correct in this case as well.

Wait, but in my earlier count, I had cnt=3, but actually, it's cnt=2.

So, it prints "NO", which is correct.

Then, it tries to find a missing string.

It sets tmp to the first character not in cur.

At the end, cur=3, which is 'a' and 'b' set, 'c' not set.

So, tmp='c', ans += 'c' → ans='cb' + 'c' = 'cbc'

Then, ans += 'a' * (n - cnt -1) = 'a' * (3 -2 -1)= 'a'*0=''

So, ans='cbc'

But the problem says to print "ccc"

So, "cbc" is also a valid missing string, as "ccc" is missing.

Wait, but "cbc" might actually be a subsequence of s.

Wait, in s="aabbccabab", let's see if "cbc" is a subsequence.

Look for 'c', 'b', 'c'

Positions:

- 'c' at positions 5 and 8

- 'b' at positions 3,4,7,9

So, take 'c' at position 5, 'b' at position 7, 'c' at position 8: indices 5,7,8 is increasing, so "cbc" is a subsequence.

But according to the code, it's supposed to be a missing string, but it's actually present.

So, this is a problem.

Moreover, the problem expects "ccc", which is indeed missing.

So, the code is incorrect because it's supposed to print a string that is not a subsequence, but it might print one that is actually a subsequence.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

I think the correct way to solve this problem is to check for each possible string of length n using the first k letters whether it's a subsequence of s.

But generating all possible strings is feasible only if n and k are small, which in this problem, n <=26 and k<=26, but with t<=1e5, it's too slow.

So, we need a smarter way.

An efficient way is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the positions in s where each prefix of all possible strings can be found.

But that's too slow for the constraints.

Wait, but in the provided code, it seems to be using a sliding window approach or some kind of bitmasking to count how many times s contains all k characters.

But as we've seen, this doesn't align with the actual requirement of checking all possible combinations of length n.

So, the code is incorrect.

Alternative Idea:

One possible optimization is to precompute for each character the positions where it appears in s.

Then, for each possible string of length n, check if there exists a subsequence in s that matches it.

But again, with t=1e5 and n=26, this is too slow.

So, perhaps the problem expects some mathematical insight.

Wait, the number of possible strings is k^n, which can be up to 26^26, which is way too big.

Hence, it's impossible to check each one individually.

So, perhaps there's a smarter way to determine if there's any missing string.

One idea is to compute the number of distinct subsequences of s that are of length n using only the first k characters.

If this number equals k^n, then the answer is "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But again, computing the number of distinct subsequences directly is not feasible for large n and k.

So, perhaps we need to find a way to compute the number of possible subsequences efficiently.

Wait, perhaps using dynamic programming to compute the number of distinct subsequences.

Define dp[i][mask], where i is the position in s, and mask is a bitmask representing the characters used so far.

But again, with m=1000 and k=26, this is too slow.

So, perhaps the problem has some mathematical shortcut.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of times s contains all possible combinations of the first k characters.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the problem expects us to find a missing string by trying to construct one that doesn't exist in s.

But the provided code doesn't seem to do that correctly, as seen in the third test case.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

**Final Verdict**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
