Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Polycarp has a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. He encodes this string using a specific algorithm, and my task is to write a program that decodes it back to the original string `s`.

First, I need to understand the encoding algorithm clearly. The steps are:

1. Construct a new auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s`, written in alphabetical order.

2. Then, each character in the string `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`. That means the first character of `r` is replaced by the last of `r`, the second by the second last, and so on.

For example, given `s = "codeforces"`, the auxiliary string `r` is "cdefors". Then, each character in `s` is replaced as follows:

- 'c' is replaced by 's'

- 'o' is replaced by 'e'

- 'd' is replaced by 'r'

- and so on, resulting in "serofedsoc".

Now, my task is to decode a given encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Looking at the example:

Encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`

Original string `s = "codeforces"`

Auxiliary string `r = "cdefors"`

So, to decode, I need to reverse this process. That means, given the encoded string `b` and knowing how it was encoded, I need to find out what the original string `s` was.

First, I need to reconstruct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`. Since `r` consists of unique sorted characters from `s`, and the encoding replaces each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`, I need to find a way to map the characters back.

Wait a minute, in the encoding process, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. So, in decoding, I need to replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r`.

But here's the catch: I don't know `r` directly; I have to deduce it from `b`.

Let me think about this.

Given that `r` is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`, and `s` is encoded by replacing each character with its symmetric counterpart in `r`, I need to reverse this process.

One approach could be:

1. Identify the unique characters in `b` and sort them to get `r`.

2. Then, for each character in `b`, find its position in `r` and map it to its symmetric position to get the original character.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let's see.

Take the example:

`b = "serofedsoc"`

Unique characters in `b` are 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's' (sorted as 'cdefors'), which matches the `r` in the example.

Now, to decode 's' back to 'c':

- In `r = "cdefors"`, 's' is at position 0, so its symmetric character is at position 6-0=6, which is 'c'.

Wait, Python uses 0-based indexing, so the positions are:

r[0] = 'c', r[1] = 'd', r[2] = 'e', r[3] = 'f', r[4] = 'o', r[5] = 'r', r[6] = 's'

So, the symmetric character for 's' (at position 6) would be 'c' (at position 0), since 6 - 6 = 0.

Similarly, 'e' is at position 2, symmetric would be position 4, which is 'o'.

Wait, but in the example, 'e' should map back to 'o', but according to this, 'e' at position 2 maps to position 4, which is 'o', which is correct.

So, the decoding seems to be mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

Hence, the decoding process should be:

- Construct `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.

- For each character in `b`, find its position in `r`, compute its symmetric position, and get the character at that position.

Wait, but in the example, 's' maps back to 'c', 'e' to 'o', 'r' to 'r', etc.

Wait, but in the symmetric mapping, 's' maps to 'c', 'e' maps to 'o', 'r' maps to 'r', which is correct.

So, this seems to work.

Hence, in the program, the function `func_1` seems to be attempting this.

Let's look at the given program:

```python

if __name__ == '__main__':

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        b = input()

        encoded_str = func_1(b)

        print(encoded_str)

def func_1(s):

    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))

    (i, j) = (0, len(unique_chars) - 1)

    for char in s:

        if char in unique_chars:

            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])

            j -= 1

        else:

            unique_chars.insert(i, char)

            i += 1

            j += 1

    return ''.join(unique_chars)

```

Wait, this doesn't seem to be implementing the decoding process correctly.

In `func_1`, it's trying to iterate through each character in `s` (which is `b`, the encoded string), and if the character is in `unique_chars`, it replaces all occurrences of that character in `s` with `unique_chars[j]`, where `j` starts from the end of `unique_chars`.

This seems incorrect for decoding.

Moreover, if a character is not in `unique_chars`, it inserts it into `unique_chars` at position `i` and increments `i` and `j`.

This doesn't make sense in the context of decoding.

I think there's a mistake in this function.

Let me try to write a correct decoding function.

Here's what I think should be done:

1. Collect all unique characters from `b` and sort them to get `r`.

2. For each character in `b`, find its index in `r`, compute its symmetric index (i.e., `len(r) - 1 - index`), and get the character at that symmetric index.

3. Replace each character in `b` with its symmetric character in `r` to get back the original string `s`.

So, in code, it would look like:

- Get `r` as sorted unique characters of `b`.

- For each character in `b`, find its index in `r`, compute symmetric index, get the character at that symmetric index, and collect them to form the original string `s`.

Also, need to handle multiple test cases.

Let me think about potential issues.

- If `b` has only one unique character, its symmetric character is itself.

- If `b` has two unique characters, they are mapped to each other.

- Need to ensure that the mapping is correctly symmetric.

- Also, need to handle cases where `b` has all identical characters.

- Edge case: single character string.

- Need to ensure that the function is efficient since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so it should be fine.

Let me consider the example again:

`b = "serofedsoc"`

Unique sorted characters: 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's'

r = "cdefors"

Now, for each character in `b`:

- 's' is at index 6 in r, symmetric is 6 - 6 = 0, which is 'c'

- 'e' is at index 2, symmetric is 6 - 2 = 4, which is 'o'

- 'r' is at index 5, symmetric is 6 - 5 = 1, which is 'd'

- and so on.

So, mapping each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r` gives back "codeforces", which is correct.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking back at the provided `func_1`, it seems to be attempting something different and incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to decode a given string `b` back to its original form `s` based on a specific encoding algorithm. The encoding algorithm involves creating a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`. Our task is to reverse this process and decode `b` to obtain `s`.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Auxiliary String `r`**:
   - The auxiliary string `r` is constructed by taking all unique characters from the original string `s` and sorting them alphabetically.
   - Since `r` is derived from the unique sorted characters of `s`, and `s` is encoded to `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character in `r`, `r` can be obtained by taking the unique sorted characters from `b`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - For each character in the encoded string `b`, find its position in `r`.
   - Determine the symmetric position in `r` (i.e., the character at the position from the end).
   - Replace the character in `b` with the character at this symmetric position in `r`.

### Solution Code

```python
def decode_string(b):
    # Step 1: Create the auxiliary string r from b
    unique_chars = sorted(list(set(b)))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from encoded character to original character
    mapping = {}
    n = len(r)
    for i in range(n):
        mapping[r[i]] = r[n - 1 - i]
    
    # Step 3: Decode b using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in b)
    return decoded

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        b = data[idx]
        idx += 1
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Identify the Auxiliary String `r`**:
   - We extract unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sort them to form `r`.

2. **Create a Mapping for Decoding**:
   - We create a mapping where each character in `r` is paired with its symmetric character in `r`. This mapping is used to decode each character in `b`.

3. **Decode the String `b`**:
   - Using the mapping, we replace each character in `b` with its corresponding original character to form the decoded string `s`.

This approach ensures that we correctly decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s` by reversing the symmetric replacement process based on the sorted unique characters.
