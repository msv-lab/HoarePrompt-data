Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a permutation of length n, and I have to figure out how many different permutations could have led to the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. Sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I need to understand what prefix and suffix maximums are. A prefix maximum at position i means that the element at that position is greater than all the elements before it. Similarly, a suffix maximum at position i means that the element at that position is greater than all the elements after it.

So, I'm given the indices of these prefix and suffix maximums, and I need to find out how many permutations satisfy these conditions.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n=1, m1=1, m2=1

p=[1]

s=[1]

Only one element, so only one permutation, which is [1]. That makes sense.

In the second test case:

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

p=[1,2]

s=[2,3,4]

The suitable permutations are:

[1,4,3,2]

[2,4,3,1]

[3,4,2,1]

So, there are 3 possible permutations.

Looking at these, I can see that the prefix maximums are at positions 1 and 2, and suffix maximums are at positions 2,3,4.

Let me try to generalize this.

I think the key is to understand the positions where the maximum elements are placed, and how they affect the prefix and suffix maximums.

First observation: The last prefix maximum should be equal to the first suffix maximum. In the second test case, p[-1]=2 and s[0]=2. If these are not equal, then there's no valid permutation, right? Because the maximum element should be at both the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum.

Yes, in the program, it checks if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] !=1 or s[-1] !=n, in which case it prints 0. That makes sense because:

- p[0] should always be 1, since the first element is always a prefix maximum.

- s[-1] should be n, since the last element is always a suffix maximum.

- p[-1] should be equal to s[0], as the maximum element should be at both the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum.

Alright, so if any of these conditions fail, there are no valid permutations.

Now, for the valid cases, we need to calculate the number of possible permutations.

I see that the program precomputes factorials up to 2*10^5 and stores them in the list 'facts'. This is probably because we'll need to compute combinations or arrange numbers in certain ways, and factorials are essential for that.

Next, in the main loop, for each test case, it reads n, m1, m2, and the lists p and s.

After checking the basic conditions, it initializes ans=1 and kol=n.

Then, it seems to iterate through the suffix maximums and compute some combinations, multiplying ans by these combinations.

Wait, I need to understand this part better.

It loops through the suffix maximums s, and for each x in s, it computes cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])

Then, ans *= cnk, and ans %= 1000000007

Also, kol = n - x

I need to understand what this is doing.

Similarly, after that, it sets kol = s[0] - 1, and then iterates through p2, which is p in reverse, excluding the last element.

For each x in p2, it computes cnk similarly and multiplies ans by it.

Then, it multiplies ans by the factorials of the differences between consecutive p's and s's.

This seems quite involved. Maybe I should think about a different approach.

Let me think about how to construct a permutation that satisfies the given prefix and suffix maximums.

First, the prefix maximums are strictly increasing in their values, because each new prefix maximum is greater than the previous ones.

Similarly, the suffix maximums are strictly decreasing in their positions because they are indices in increasing order.

Wait, no, the suffix maximums are given in increasing order of their indices, but their values should be decreasing as we move to the right.

Wait, no, suffix maximums are defined such that a_i is a suffix maximum if a_i > a_j for all j > i. So, as we move from left to right, the suffix maximums should be decreasing in value.

Similarly, prefix maximums are increasing in value as we move from left to right.

So, in the second example:

p = [1,2] meaning positions 1 and 2 are prefix maximums.

s = [2,3,4] meaning positions 2,3,4 are suffix maximums.

From this, we can see that the maximum element is at position 2, since it's both the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum.

So, in the permutation, position 2 has the maximum element, which is 4.

Then, position 1 has a value less than 4, and positions 3 and 4 have values less than 4.

In position 3, it's a suffix maximum, meaning it's greater than position 4.

So, position 3 has a value greater than position 4.

Similarly, in the prefix side, position 1 has a value less than position 2.

So, perhaps I can divide the permutation into segments based on these maximums and arrange the numbers accordingly.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I should look for a better way to model this.

I recall that in permutations with restricted positions based on maximums, it often involves dividing the permutation into blocks and arranging numbers within those blocks.

Perhaps I can think of the permutation as being divided into blocks where each block has certain constraints based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote the maximum value in the permutation as M. From the conditions, M should be at position p[-1] = s[0].

In the permutation, all elements to the left of M should be less than M, and all elements to the right of M should be less than M.

Furthermore, the prefix maximums to the left of M define the positions where the maximum so far changes, and similarly, the suffix maximums to the right of M define where the maximum from that point to the end changes.

So, perhaps I can split the permutation into segments divided by these maximum positions and arrange the numbers accordingly.

Let me try to outline an approach:

1. Identify the position of the maximum element, which is p[-1] = s[0] = k, say.

2. Split the permutation into three parts:

- Left part: positions 1 to k-1

- Middle: position k

- Right part: positions k+1 to n

3. In the left part, the prefix maximums are given by p[:-1], and in the right part, the suffix maximums are given by s[1:].

4. Assign the maximum value M to position k.

5. Assign the remaining numbers to the left and right parts, ensuring that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are met.

Now, for the left part (positions 1 to k-1):

- The prefix maximums are given by p[:-1].

- The values in these positions must be less than M, and they must be prefix maximums among themselves.

Similarly, for the right part (positions k+1 to n):

- The suffix maximums are given by s[1:].

- The values in these positions must be less than M, and they must be suffix maximums among themselves.

So, perhaps I can recursively apply this approach to the left and right parts.

But recursion might not be the most efficient way here, especially since n can be up to 2e5.

Maybe there's a better way to compute the number of valid permutations.

I notice that the program is using precomputed factorials and some combination calculations.

Perhaps it's computing the number of ways to arrange the numbers in the segments defined by the prefix and suffix maximums.

Let me look at the function func_1 and func_2.

func_1 seems to be implementing the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse modulo 1000000007.

func_2 is using func_1 to compute some value, probably a combination or something similar.

In the main loop, cnk is being computed using func_2, which takes facts[kol -1] divided by (facts[n -x] * facts[kol -1 + x -n]).

This looks like it's computing a combination C(kol-1, n-x), but I need to confirm.

Wait, C(a,b) = facts[a] / (facts[b] * facts[a-b]), modulo 1000000007.

But in the code, it's facts[kol -1] / (facts[n -x] * facts[kol -1 + x -n]).

Wait, kol -1 + x -n = kol -1 - (n -x), so it's facts[kol -1] / (facts[n -x] * facts[kol -1 - (n -x)]).

Which is C(kol-1, n-x).

So yes, it's computing C(kol-1, n-x).

But I need to understand why it's computing this combination.

Looking back at the approach, perhaps kol represents the number of elements available to choose from at each step.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of choosing positions for certain values.

Alternatively, maybe it's about assigning values to certain segments.

This is getting a bit too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of M at k.

Then, the left part (1 to k-1) must be filled with numbers less than M, and the right part (k+1 to n) must also be filled with numbers less than M.

Furthermore, in the left part, the prefix maximums are defined by p[:-1], and in the right part, the suffix maximums are defined by s[1:].

So, perhaps I can divide the problem into two subproblems: the left part and the right part.

For the left part, I have positions p[:-1] which are prefix maximums, and the values there must be increasing.

Similarly, for the right part, positions s[1:] are suffix maximums, and the values there must be decreasing.

So, perhaps I can assign the values to the prefix maximums and suffix maximums first, and then arrange the remaining numbers in the non-maximum positions.

But I need to ensure that the values assigned to the prefix maximums are less than M and increasing, and the values assigned to the suffix maximums are less than M and decreasing.

Wait, but the suffix maximums are positions where the value is greater than all to the right, but since M is already placed at position k, the suffix maximums to the right of M should be decreasing as we move to the right.

Similarly, the prefix maximums to the left of M should be increasing as we move to the left.

So, perhaps I can assign the largest available numbers to the suffix maximums and the smallest available numbers to the prefix maximums.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- L = k -1 (length of the left part)

- R = n - k (length of the right part)

We have m1 -1 prefix maximums in the left part, and m2 -1 suffix maximums in the right part.

We need to assign values to these positions such that:

- The prefix maximums in the left part are increasing from left to right.

- The suffix maximums in the right part are decreasing from left to right.

- The remaining positions can be filled with the remaining numbers, without violating the prefix and suffix maximum conditions.

So, for the left part:

- We have m1 -1 prefix maximums, and L positions in total.

- We need to choose m1 -1 values from 1 to M-1, and arrange them in increasing order in the prefix maximum positions.

- The remaining L - (m1 -1) positions can be filled with the remaining numbers from 1 to M-1, ensuring that they are less than the prefix maximums up to their positions.

Similarly, for the right part:

- We have m2 -1 suffix maximums, and R positions in total.

- We need to choose m2 -1 values from 1 to M-1, and arrange them in decreasing order in the suffix maximum positions.

- The remaining R - (m2 -1) positions can be filled with the remaining numbers from 1 to M-1, ensuring that they are less than the suffix maximums from their positions to the end.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to compute the number of ways to arrange the left part and the right part separately, and then multiply them together, along with assigning M to position k.

Wait, but in the code, it seems to be iterating through the suffix maximums and computing combinations, and then through the prefix maximums.

Maybe I can think in terms of choosing values for the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, and then arranging the remaining numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of arranging the numbers in the blocks defined by the maximums.

This is getting a bit too abstract.

Let me look at the constraints again.

Time constraints: Since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 2e5, so overall time should be O(n).

The given program seems to be O(n), as it processes each test case in time proportional to m1 and m2, which are up to n.

So, it seems efficient enough.

But I need to verify if the logic is correct.

Let me consider another example.

Take the third test case:

n=3, m1=3, m2=1

p=[1,2,3]

s=[3]

So, p=[1,2,3], meaning all positions are prefix maximums.

s=[3], meaning only position 3 is a suffix maximum.

From this, the permutation must have all elements in increasing order, because every position is a prefix maximum.

Also, position 3 is the only suffix maximum, so it must be the maximum element.

Therefore, the permutation must be [1,2,3].

Hence, only one permutation is valid.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

p=[1,2]

s=[2,3,4]

From the sample, there are 3 possible permutations.

So, the program outputs 3 for this case.

Now, let's see what the program is doing step by step for this case.

n=4, m1=2, m2=3

p=[1,2]

s=[2,3,4]

First, check if p[-1]==s[0] and p[0]==1 and s[-1]==n.

Yes, p[-1]=2 and s[0]=2, p[0]=1, s[-1]=4.

So, proceed.

Initialize ans=1, kol=4.

Then, loop through s:

For x=2:

cnk = C(kol-1, n-x) = C(3,2) = 3

ans *= 3 => ans=3

kol = n - x = 2

For x=3:

cnk = C(1,1) = 1

ans *=1 => ans=3

For x=4:

cnk = C(1-1,4-4)=C(0,0)=1

ans *=1 => ans=3

Then, kol = s[0] -1 =1

p2=[1] (since p=[1,2], p[:-1]=[1])

For x=1:

cnk = C(kol-1, x-1) = C(0,0)=1

ans *=1 => ans=3

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

ans *= facts[p[i+1]-p[i]-1]

p=[1,2], so p[1]-p[0]-1=1-1-1=0, facts[0]=1

ans *=1 => ans=3

Similarly, for suffix maximums:

for i in range(m2-1):

ans *= facts[s[i+1]-s[i]-1]

s=[2,3,4], s[1]-s[0]-1=3-2-1=0, facts[0]=1

ans *=1 => ans=3

Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, it works.

Let me check another sample.

n=6, m1=2, m2=3

p=[1,3]

s=[3,4,6]

Similarly, p[-1]=3, s[0]=3, p[0]=1, s[-1]=6.

So, proceed.

kol=6

For x=3:

cnk=C(5,3)=10

ans=10

kol=3

For x=4:

cnk=C(2,2)=1

ans=10

For x=6:

cnk=C(1,0)=1

ans=10

Then, kol=s[0]-1=2

p2=[1]

For x=1:

cnk=C(1,0)=1

ans=10

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

p[1]-p[0]-1=3-1-1=1, facts[1]=1

ans*=1 => ans=10

For suffix maximums:

for i in range(m2-1):

s[1]-s[0]-1=4-3-1=0, facts[0]=1

ans*=1 => ans=10

Which matches the sample output.

So, it seems correct for this case as well.

Now, let's see if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Consider n=1, m1=1, m2=1, p=[1], s=[1]. Output should be 1.

According to the program:

p[-1]=1, s[0]=1, p[0]=1, s[-1]=1.

So, proceed.

ans=1

kol=1

Loop through s:

x=1:

cnk=C(0,0)=1

ans=1

kol=0

Then, kol=s[0]-1=0

p2=[] (since p=[1], m1-2 to -1 is empty)

So, no operation.

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

p[1]-p[0]-1: p[1] doesn't exist, so m1-1=1, but p has only one element.

Wait, p=[1], m1=1.

So, range(0), no operation.

Similarly, for suffix maximums, m2=1, range(0), no operation.

So, ans=1, which is correct.

Another edge case: n=2, m1=1, m2=1, p=[1], s=[2]

Check p[-1]=1 != s[0]=2, so output 0.

Is this correct?

Well, if p=[1], s=[2], then p[-1]=1 != s[0]=2, which should indeed be invalid because the maximum should be at both the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum.

Hence, output 0 is correct.

Another case: n=2, m1=2, m2=2, p=[1,2], s=[1,2]

Check p[-1]=2 == s[0]=1? No, 2 !=1, so output 0.

Wait, but according to the problem, p[-1] should equal s[0], which it doesn't here, so output 0 is correct.

Another case: n=3, m1=2, m2=2, p=[1,2], s=[2,3]

Check p[-1]=2 == s[0]=2, p[0]=1, s[-1]=3. Good.

Proceed.

ans=1

kol=3

For x=2:

cnk=C(2,1)=2

ans=2

kol=1

For x=3:

cnk=C(0,0)=1

ans=2

Then, kol=s[0]-1=1

p2=[1]

For x=1:

cnk=C(0,0)=1

ans=2

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

p[1]-p[0]-1=2-1-1=0, facts[0]=1

ans*=1 => ans=2

For suffix maximums:

for i in range(m2-1):

s[1]-s[0]-1=3-2-1=0, facts[0]=1

ans*=1 => ans=2

Now, let's see what the actual number of permutations is for this case.

n=3, p=[1,2], s=[2,3]

So, position 2 is the maximum, which is 3.

Then, position 1 can be 1 or 2, but it must be less than position 2.

Position 3 must be less than position 2.

So, possible permutations:

[1,3,2]

[2,3,1]

So, 2 permutations, which matches the program's output of 2.

Wait, but according to the sample, for n=4, m1=2, m2=3, it's 3 permutations.

Wait, in my earlier calculation for n=6, m1=2, m2=3, p=[1,3], s=[3,4,6], it output 10, which matches the sample.

So, seems correct.

Now, let's consider a case where there are multiple blocks.

Suppose n=5, m1=2, m2=2, p=[1,3], s=[3,5]

Check p[-1]=3 == s[0]=3, p[0]=1, s[-1]=5. Good.

ans=1

kol=5

For x=3:

cnk=C(4,2)=6

ans=6

kol=2

For x=5:

cnk=C(1,0)=1

ans=6

Then, kol=s[0]-1=2

p2=[1]

For x=1:

cnk=C(1,0)=1

ans=6

Then, for i in range(m1-1):

p[1]-p[0]-1=3-1-1=1, facts[1]=1

ans*=1 => ans=6

For suffix maximums:

for i in range(m2-1):

s[1]-s[0]-1=5-3-1=1, facts[1]=1

ans*=1 => ans=6

Now, let's see the actual number of permutations.

n=5, p=[1,3], s=[3,5]

Position 3 is the maximum, which is 5.

Left part: positions 1 and 2, prefix maximums at position 1.

So, position 1 is the prefix maximum in the left part, and position 2 must be less than position 1.

Right part: positions 4 and 5, suffix maximums at position 5.

So, position 5 is the suffix maximum in the right part, and position 4 must be less than position 5.

So, possible permutations:

Assign position 3: 5

Assign positions 1 and 2: position 1 is greater than position 2, and both less than 5.

Assign positions 4 and 5: position 5 is greater than position 4, and both less than 5.

So, available numbers: 1,2,3,4

Assign positions 1 and 2: choose 2 numbers out of 4, arrange them in decreasing order.

Number of ways: C(4,2) * 1 = 6

Assign positions 4 and 5: choose 2 numbers out of remaining 2, arrange them in decreasing order.

Number of ways: C(2,2) * 1 = 1

Total permutations: 6 * 1 = 6

Which matches the program's output of 6.

So, seems correct.

Another test case: n=5, m1=3, m2=4, p=[1,2,3], s=[2,3,4,5]

Check p[-1]=3 == s[0]=2? No, 3 !=2, so output 0.

Indeed, in the sample input, this test case outputs 0, which is correct.

So, overall, the program seems to be correct.

I don't see any flaws in the logic or the implementation.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{True}}
