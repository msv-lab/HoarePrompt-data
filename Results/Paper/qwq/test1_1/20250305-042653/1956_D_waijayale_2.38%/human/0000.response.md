Alright, I've got this problem to solve. So, let's understand what's being asked here. I have an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on it multiple times to maximize the sum of the array. The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I need to do this in a way that the sum of the array is maximized, and I have to output the maximum sum along with a sequence of operations that achieve this sum, without exceeding 5*10^5 operations.

First things first, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. For example, MEX of [0, 1] is 2, because 0 and 1 are already present, so the smallest non-negative integer not in the set is 2. MEX of [1, 3, 9] is 0, since 0 is not in the set.

So, the operation allows me to choose any subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I can do this up to 5*10^5 times, but I don't need to minimize the number of operations, just ensure that I don't exceed the limit.

My goal is to maximize the sum of the array. So, I need to think about how to use these operations to increase the values in the array as much as possible.

Let me consider the constraints. The array length n can be up to 18, which is relatively small. The values in the array can be up to 10^7, but since I can perform operations to change them, I need to think strategically.

Given that n is small (up to 18), I might be able to consider dynamic programming or some exhaustive approach, but I need to be careful with the number of operations since it can be up to 5*10^5, which is large but manageable given the small n.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

The main function calls func_3, which reads input, calls func_2 to process the array, and then prints the result.

Func_2 seems to be the core function that maximizes the sum. It uses a recursive function called recursive_maximize_sum, which takes left and right indices as parameters.

In func_2, it initializes operations list, then calls recursive_maximize_sum with the full range of the array, and finally returns the sum, number of operations, and the operations themselves.

Now, let's look at recursive_maximize_sum.

It calculates the sum of the subarray from l to r. If this sum is less than or equal to the square of the subarray's length, it calls func_1 to perform operations on that subarray and sets all elements to the subarray's length.

Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively processes the left and right parts around this maximum.

Func_1 seems to be responsible for setting a subarray to a specific value, in this case, the length of the subarray.

Wait a minute, setting the subarray to its length seems arbitrary. Why would we set it to the length of the subarray?

Let me think about this. The MEX of a subarray could be smaller or larger than the subarray's length. For example, in a subarray [0,1], MEX is 2, which is equal to the subarray's length (2). In [1,3,9], MEX is 0, which is less than the subarray's length (3).

So, setting the subarray to its length might not always be optimal. Maybe there's a strategy behind this that I'm missing.

Let me look at the examples provided.

In the first example:

Input:

2

0 1

Output:

4 1

1 2

So, the array is [0,1], sum is 1. After one operation on the entire array, MEX is 2, so set both elements to 2, sum becomes 4.

In the second example:

Input:

3

1 3 9

Output:

13 0

So, the array is [1,3,9], sum is 13. No operations are performed because it's already optimal.

In the third example:

Input:

4

1 100 2 1

Output:

105 2

3 3

3 4

So, operations are performed on subarrays [3,3] and [3,4].

Initially, [1,100,2,1]

After first operation on [3,3]: a[3] becomes MEX of [2], which is 0, so [1,100,0,1]

After second operation on [3,4]: MEX of [0,1] is 2, so set [3,4] to 2: [1,100,2,2], sum is 105.

It seems that in this case, performing operations increased the sum from 104 to 105.

In the fourth example:

Input:

1

0

Output:

1 1

1 1

So, array is [0], sum is 0. After one operation, set it to MEX which is 1, sum becomes 1.

Okay, so in some cases, operations increase the sum, and in others, it's better to do nothing.

Now, back to the provided program.

In func_2, recursive_maximize_sum is defined to handle subarrays from l to r.

It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to (r - l + 1)^2. If so, it calls func_1 to perform operations to set the entire subarray to (r - l + 1), and records an operation.

Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively processes the left and right parts around this maximum.

Wait, why is it comparing the sum to (r - l + 1)^2?

Let me think about when sum <= (r - l + 1)^2.

Suppose we have a subarray of length k. If the sum of its elements is less than or equal to k^2, then it seems beneficial to set all elements to k, because k * k = k^2, which is equal to the sum threshold.

But in the first example, [0,1], sum is 1, which is less than 4 (2^2), so it sets both to 2, sum becomes 4, which is better.

In the third example, [1,100,2,1], sum is 104, which is greater than 16 (4^2), so it doesn't set the entire array to 4. Instead, it performs operations on subarrays [3,3] and [3,4].

Wait, but after the operations, the sum is 105, which is higher than 104. So, in this case, even though sum > k^2, performing operations could still increase the sum.

So, maybe the strategy is not perfect.

Wait, perhaps the idea is that if sum <= k^2, then setting all elements to k is beneficial because sum becomes k*k, which is equal to the threshold, and maybe without operations, the sum is less. So, it's worth performing operations to reach k*k.

But in the first example, sum was 1, which is less than 4, and after operation, it became 4, which is better.

In the third example, sum was 104, which is greater than 16, and after operations, it became 105, which is better.

So, perhaps the condition is not the best way to decide whether to perform operations or not.

Alternatively, maybe the idea is to set subarrays to their length when it's beneficial, and otherwise, leave them as is.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me look at func_1.

Func_1 seems to set a subarray from l to r to the MEX of that subarray, which is equal to r - l + 1, but only if a[l] != r - l + 1.

Wait, no. In func_1, it sets the subarray to r - l + 1, which is the length of the subarray, not necessarily the MEX.

Wait, but MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

In func_1, it sets all elements in the subarray to r - l + 1, which is the length of the subarray.

But MEX is not necessarily equal to the length of the subarray.

For example, in the first example, [0,1], MEX is 2, which is equal to the length (2). In the third example, [1,100,2,1], MEX of the entire array is 0, which is less than the length (4).

So, setting to the length may not always correspond to the MEX.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion here.

In the operation, we choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX.

But in func_1, it's setting the subarray to r - l + 1, which is the length of the subarray, not necessarily the MEX.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe the assumption is that after some operations, the MEX of the subarray is equal to its length.

But that doesn't seem generally true.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the array is [0, 0], length 2.

MEX is 1, since 0 is present.

If I set both elements to 1, then the array becomes [1,1], sum is 2.

But if I consider MEX again, MEX of [1,1] is 0, since 0 is not present.

If I set both to 0, sum becomes 0, which is worse.

So, in this case, setting to the length (2) would give sum 4, which is better than any possible MEX operation.

But MEX of [0,0] is 1, not 2.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in how MEX is calculated.

MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

So, for [0,0], MEX is 1.

For [0,1], MEX is 2.

For [1,3,9], MEX is 0.

For [1,100,2,1], MEX is 0.

Wait, in the third example, after first operation on [3,3], a[3] becomes MEX of [2], which is 0, so [1,100,0,1].

Then, second operation on [3,4], MEX of [0,1] is 2, set both to 2, resulting in [1,100,2,2], sum 105.

So, in this case, operations increased the sum.

But if I had set the entire array to its length (4), which is not the MEX, because MEX is 0, which is less than 4.

So, setting to 4 would be invalid, because MEX is 0, not 4.

Wait, no, the operation allows setting to MEX, which is 0 in this case, not 4.

So, setting to 4 would not be allowed, because MEX is 0.

Wait, but the operation is to set to MEX, which is defined as the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

So, in [1,100,2,1], MEX is 0, so I can set all elements to 0, but that would decrease the sum to 0, which is worse.

So, in this case, performing operations strategically on subarrays increases the sum.

Therefore, setting the entire array to its length is not always valid or optimal.

So, perhaps the strategy in the code is flawed.

Wait, maybe the idea is that for a subarray of length k, if its sum is less than or equal to k^2, then setting all elements to k is beneficial.

Because sum becomes k*k, which is equal to k^2, and since the original sum was less than or equal to k^2, it's an improvement or stays the same.

But in reality, setting to k may not be achievable via MEX operations, because MEX is not necessarily k.

So, perhaps this is a mistake in the code.

Alternatively, maybe there's a strategy where setting subarrays to their length in certain cases leads to an optimal sum.

But from the example above, setting the entire array to its length may not be achievable via MEX operations, because MEX is not always equal to the subarray's length.

Therefore, I think the code is incorrect because it sets subarrays to their length, which may not be equal to the MEX, and thus may perform invalid operations.

Moreover, in the recursive_maximize_sum function, it sets the subarray to its length when sum <= k^2, but as shown in the example, sometimes even when sum > k^2, performing operations on subsubarrays can increase the sum further.

So, the condition sum <= k^2 might not be the right criterion for deciding whether to perform operations or not.

I think a better approach would be to consider all possible subarrays and determine if setting them to their MEX increases the sum, and perform such operations accordingly.

But given the constraints (n <= 18), a more optimal approach might be possible.

Alternatively, perhaps a greedy approach where we repeatedly find a subarray whose MEX, when set to all elements in the subarray, increases the sum the most.

But this could be time-consuming if we need to perform up to 5*10^5 operations.

Wait, but the problem allows up to 5*10^5 operations, but with n=18, it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps a dynamic programming approach where we consider all possible ways to partition the array and set subarrays to their MEX, choosing the one that maximizes the sum.

Given that n is small (18), the number of possible subarrays is manageable.

Wait, but even with n=18, the number of subarrays is (n*(n+1))/2 = 171, which is small.

But since operations can be performed up to 5*10^5 times, it's possible to perform multiple operations on the same or different subarrays.

However, the provided code seems to have a flawed strategy, as it sets subarrays to their length rather than to their MEX, which may not be valid.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is incorrect because it performs invalid operations by setting subarrays to their length rather than to their MEX.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
