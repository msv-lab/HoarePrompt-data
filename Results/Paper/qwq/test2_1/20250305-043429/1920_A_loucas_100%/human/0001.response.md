Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. Each test case starts with an integer n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and x is the value associated with that constraint.

My task is to process these constraints and find the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the best way is to first collect all the constraints of each type separately.

So, I'll have three lists:

- big: for constraints where k >= x (type 1)

- less: for constraints where k <= x (type 2)

- no: for constraints where k != x (type 3)

Then, the possible values of k must be greater than or equal to the maximum value in the big list and less than or equal to the minimum value in the less list.

Because if k needs to be greater than or equal to several values, it must be at least the largest of those values. Similarly, if k needs to be less than or equal to several values, it can be at most the smallest of those values.

So, the range of k is from max(big) to min(less), inclusive.

Then, within this range, we need to exclude the values specified in the no list.

So, the total number of possible k values is the size of the range from max(big) to min(less), minus the number of values in that range that are present in the no list.

But I need to be careful here. First, I need to ensure that the range max(big) to min(less) is valid, meaning that max(big) should be less than or equal to min(less). If max(big) > min(less), then there are no possible values for k, and the answer is 0.

Assuming the range is valid, then the number of possible k values is min(less) - max(big) + 1, minus the number of values in the no list that fall within this range.

I need to make sure that the no list doesn't contain duplicates, but since it's guaranteed that no two constraints are the same, the no list will have unique values.

Also, since the no constraints are k != x, and x can be any integer between 1 and 10^9, I need to handle large ranges efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 100, and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 500, efficiency shouldn't be a major issue here, as the operations are straightforward.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

1. The range max(big) to min(less) is empty, i.e., max(big) > min(less). In this case, there are no possible k values.

2. The range is single-point, i.e., max(big) == min(less). In this case, k must be equal to that single value, and if there's a no constraint for that value, then the answer is 0; otherwise, it's 1.

3. There are multiple no constraints within the range.

4. No no constraints at all.

I need to make sure that the program handles all these cases correctly.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, big = [3], less = [10], no = [1,5]

Range: 3 to 10, inclusive. That's 8 values: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But k != 1 and k !=5. So, 5 is in the range, so we exclude it. So, total k values are 7.

Second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

big = [5], less = [4]

max(big) = 5, min(less) =4, 5 > 4, so no possible k, output 0.

Third test case:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

So, big = [2,7,3], less = [100,98], no = [6,7,100,44,99]

max(big) = 7, min(less) =98

Range: 7 to 98, inclusive. That's 92 values.

Now, exclude no list values that are within this range: 6 (not in range), 7, 100 (not in range), 44, 99 (not in range).

So, exclude 7 and 44, total 2.

So, 92 - 2 = 90, which matches the sample output.

Okay, seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

loop = int(input())

for iterable in range(loop):

less = []

big = []

no = []

num = 0

innerLoop = int(input())

for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):

(x, a) = map(int, input().split())

if x == 1:

big.append(a)

elif x == 2:

less.append(a)

else:

no.append(a)

num = min(less) - max(big) + 1

if num < 1:

print(0)

continue

for i in no:

if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):

num -= 1

print(num)

This seems to follow the logic I just outlined.

It separates the constraints into big, less, and no lists.

Then, it calculates the range size as min(less) - max(big) + 1.

If this is less than 1, it prints 0.

Otherwise, it iterates through the no list and subtracts 1 for each value that falls within the range.

Finally, it prints the num.

Seems correct.

Let me check against the sample input and output.

First test case:

n=4

Constraints:

1 3 → big=[3]

2 10 → less=[10]

3 1 → no=[1]

3 5 → no=[1,5]

num = 10 - 3 +1 =8

Then, check no list:

1 is not in [3,10], so no subtraction

5 is in [3,10], so num -=1 →7

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=2

1 5 → big=[5]

2 4 → less=[4]

num =4 -5 +1=0

Since num <1, print 0

Matches sample output.

Third test case:

n=10

big=[2,7,3]

less=[100,98]

no=[6,7,100,44,99]

num=98-7+1=92

Then, check no list:

6: 7<=6<=98? 6<7, so no

7: 7<=7<=98, yes, num-=1 →91

100: 100>98, no

44: 7<=44<=98, yes, num-=1 →90

99: 99>98, no

So, num=90, matches sample output.

Looks good.

I don't see any issues with this approach.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
