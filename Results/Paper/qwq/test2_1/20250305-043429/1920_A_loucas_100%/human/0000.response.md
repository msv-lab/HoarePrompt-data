Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input format. Each test case starts with an integer n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing two integers a and x, where a indicates the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and x is the value associated with it.

My task is to process these constraints and find the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the best way is to first collect all the constraints of each type separately.

So, I'll have:

- A list of all 'greater than or equal to' constraints (type 1).

- A list of all 'less than or equal to' constraints (type 2).

- A list of all 'not equal to' constraints (type 3).

Then, the possible values of k must be greater than or equal to the maximum value in the type 1 list and less than or equal to the minimum value in the type 2 list.

Because if k needs to be greater than or equal to several values, it must be at least the largest of those values. Similarly, if k needs to be less than or equal to several values, it can't exceed the smallest of those values.

So, the range of possible k is from max(type 1) to min(type 2), inclusive.

Then, from this range, I need to exclude any values that are listed in the type 3 constraints.

Wait, but type 3 is 'not equal to x', so I need to make sure that k is not equal to any of the x's in type 3 constraints.

So, the total number of possible k is the number of integers from max(type 1) to min(type 2), inclusive, minus the number of x's in type 3 that fall within this range.

But, I need to be careful because the type 3 constraints might have x's that are outside this range, so I shouldn't count those.

Also, it's guaranteed that the range is finite, so max(type 1) will be less than or equal to min(type 2).

Wait, no. Actually, since it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and that the answer is finite, I can assume that max(type 1) <= min(type 2).

But I should check that this holds true; otherwise, there are no possible k.

Wait, no, because it's guaranteed that the answer is finite, which means max(type 1) <= min(type 2).

But looking back at the problem statement, it says "there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2", and "the answer is finite".

So, I can assume that the range is valid.

But in the example, in the second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

Here, max(type 1) is 5, min(type 2) is 4, and 5 > 4, so no possible k, hence output is 0.

So, I need to handle cases where max(type 1) > min(type 2), which means no solution.

Got it.

So, the steps are:

1. Collect all type 1 constraints and find the maximum value among them.

2. Collect all type 2 constraints and find the minimum value among them.

3. If max(type 1) > min(type 2), then there are no possible k.

4. Otherwise, the range of possible k is from max(type 1) to min(type 2), inclusive.

5. Then, subtract the number of type 3 constraints where x is within this range.

That should give the final count of possible k.

Now, let's look at the code provided and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The function is defined as "func()", and it seems to handle multiple test cases.

It reads the number of test cases, loop = int(input()), and then iterates through each test case.

For each test case, it initializes three lists: less, big, and no, to store the values of type 2, type 1, and type 3 constraints, respectively.

Then it reads the number of constraints, innerLoop = int(input()), and for each constraint, it reads a and x, and appends x to the corresponding list based on the value of a.

So far, so good.

Then, it calculates num = min(less) - max(big) + 1.

This is intended to calculate the number of integers from max(big) to min(less), inclusive.

This is correct if max(big) <= min(less).

But if max(big) > min(less), this would result in a negative number, which doesn't make sense in this context.

So, it checks if num < 1, in which case it prints 0, as there are no possible k.

Otherwise, it iterates through the no list and for each i in no, checks if i is within the range [max(big), min(less)], and if so, subtracts 1 from num.

Finally, it prints num.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the first example:

Test case:

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, type 1: [3], type 2: [10], type 3: [1,5]

max(type 1) = 3, min(type 2) = 10, so num = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8.

Then, check type 3:

1 is not in [3,10], so don't subtract.

5 is in [3,10], so subtract 1.

So, num = 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the example.

Good.

Second test case:

2

1 5

2 4

type 1: [5], type 2: [4], type 3: []

max(type 1) = 5, min(type 2) = 4, so num = 4 - 5 + 1 = 0, so print 0.

Correct.

Third test case:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

type 1: [2,7,3], so max(type 1) = 7

type 2: [100,98], so min(type 2) = 98

type 3: [6,7,100,44,99]

num = 98 - 7 + 1 = 92

Then, check type 3:

6 is in [7,98], no, because 6 < 7.

7 is in [7,98], yes, subtract 1.

100 is in [7,98], no.

44 is in [7,98], yes, subtract 1.

99 is in [7,98], no.

So, num = 92 - 2 = 90, which matches the example.

Good.

Fourth test case:

6

1 5

2 10

1 9

2 2

3 2

3 9

type 1: [5,9], max=9

type 2: [10,2], min=2

Since max(type 1)=9 > min(type 2)=2, num=2-9+1=-7 <1, so print 0.

Correct, because the range is invalid.

Fifth test case:

5

1 1

2 2

3 1

3 2

3 3

type 1: [1], max=1

type 2: [2], min=2

num=2-1+1=2

type 3: [1,2,3]

1 is in [1,2], subtract 1

2 is in [1,2], subtract 1

3 is not in [1,2], don't subtract

num=2-2=0, which matches the example.

Good.

Sixth test case:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

type 1: [10000,100000000], max=100000000

type 2: [900000000,2], min=2

Wait, but in the problem, all x are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, and a is 1,2,3.

Wait, in this test case, type 2 has 900000000 and 2, so min(type 2)=2

type 1 has 10000 and 100000000, so max(type 1)=100000000

So, num=2 - 100000000 +1 = -99999998 <1, so print 0

But in the sample output, it's 800000000.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, looking back at the input:

6

1 5

2 10

1 9

2 2

3 2

3 9

This is the fourth test case, and the output is 0.

Then the fifth test case is:

5

1 1

2 2

3 1

3 2

3 3

Output:0

And the sixth test case is:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

Output:800000000

Wait, in this sixth test case:

type 1: [10000,100000000], max=100000000

type 2: [900000000,2], min=2

But 100000000 > 2, so num=2-100000000+1=<0, so print 0

But the sample output is 800000000.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, looking back:

The input is:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

So, type 1: [10000,100000000], max=100000000

type 2: [900000000,2], min=2

Wait, but 100000000 > 2, so no possible k, but sample output is 800000000.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

" It is guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same."

So, in this test case, type 1: [10000,100000000], type 2: [900000000,2], type 3: [500000000,10000,900000001]

Wait, but 10000 is in type 1 and type 3, but the problem says no two constraints are the exact same, meaning no two pairs (a,x) are the same.

So, (1,10000) and (3,10000) are different constraints.

So, it's okay.

But, back to the range: max(type 1)=100000000, min(type 2)=2.

So, range is from 100000000 to 2.

If 100000000 > 2, then no possible k, but sample output is 800000000.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, perhaps the type 2 has 900000000 and 2, but in the problem, it's possible to have multiple type 2 constraints, and the min(type 2) is the smallest of them.

But in this case, min(type 2)=2.

And max(type 1)=100000000.

Wait, but 100000000 > 2, so no possible k.

But sample output is 800000000.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, the input is:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

So, type 1: [10000,100000000], max=100000000

type 2: [900000000], min=900000000

Wait, no, wait, in the input, the second constraint is 2 900000000, which is type 2, x=900000000.

And later, there is 2 2, but I don't see that in this test case.

Wait, no, in this sixth test case, the input is:

6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

So, type 1: [10000,100000000], max=100000000

type 2: [900000000], min=900000000

So, num=900000000 - 100000000 +1 = 800000001

Then, type 3: [500000000,10000,900000001]

Check which of these are within [100000000,900000000]

500000000 is within, so subtract 1

10000 is not within, so don't subtract

900000001 is not within, so don't subtract

So, num=800000001 -1 =800000000, which matches the sample output.

Got it, so I was misreading the input earlier.

So, the code seems to be implementing the correct logic.

Now, let's look at the code again to ensure there are no mistakes in implementation.

The code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case:

- Initializes less, big, no as empty lists.

- Reads the number of constraints.

- Reads each constraint and appends x to the corresponding list based on a.

- Computes num = min(less) - max(big) +1

- If num <1, prints 0

- Else, iterates through no and subtracts 1 for each x in no that is within [max(big), min(less)]

- Prints num

This seems correct.

I need to make sure that:

- It handles cases where there are multiple constraints of the same type.

- It correctly calculates max(big) and min(less).

- It correctly identifies when the range is empty (max(big) > min(less)).

- It correctly excludes the values in type 3 that are within the range.

Also, need to ensure that it doesn't subtract for type 3 values outside the range.

In the sixth test case, it correctly handled a type 3 value outside the range (900000001).

Looks good.

I think the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
