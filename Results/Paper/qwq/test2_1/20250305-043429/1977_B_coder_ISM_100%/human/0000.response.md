Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer x, and I need to find an array of integers a_0 to a_{n-1} that satisfies a few conditions:

1. The array length n should be between 1 and 32.

2. Each element a_i in the array can only be 1, 0, or -1.

3. The sum of a_i multiplied by 2^i should equal x.

4. There shouldn't be any two consecutive elements in the array where both are non-zero.

And it's guaranteed that such an array always exists for the given constraints.

Okay, first things first, I need to understand what this sum represents. It looks like a weighted sum where each a_i is multiplied by 2 to the power of its index i. This resembles the binary representation of a number, where each bit is either 0 or 1 and multiplied by 2^i. But here, a_i can also be -1, which makes it interesting.

So, in binary representation, each bit represents a power of 2, and the sum of these gives the number. Here, since a_i can be -1, 0, or 1, it's like a signed binary representation. The constraint that no two consecutive a_i's are non-zero seems tricky; I need to make sure that in the array, if one a_i is non-zero, the next one must be zero.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start with the binary representation of x and then adjust it to fit the constraints.

Let's take an example to understand better. Suppose x = 1. The binary representation is 1, so a_0 = 1, and n = 1. That satisfies all the conditions.

Another example: x = 14. In binary, 14 is 1110, which is 1*2^3 + 1*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 0*2^0. But according to the problem's example, one valid array is [0, -1, 0, 0, 1], which corresponds to:

0*2^0 + (-1)*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^4 = 0 - 2 + 0 + 0 + 16 = 14.

So, it's using negative values to adjust the sum.

I need to find a way to convert the binary representation into this signed binary representation with the no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Let me think about the algorithm provided in the program.

The function func reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads x.

It initializes a list s to store the binary representation of x, but with some adjustments.

It sets the initial length to 30, which makes sense since x can be up to 2^30 - 1.

It then iterates from i = 0 to 29, checking if the i-th bit of x is set using x & pow(2, i). If set, it appends '1' to s, else '0'.

So, s now contains the binary representation of x, with s[0] being the least significant bit (2^0).

Then, there's a flag variable initialized to 0.

It loops from i = 0 to 28 (since i+1 goes up to 29):

- If flag is 1 and s[i] is '0', it sets s[i] to '1' and sets flag to 0.

- If flag is 0 and s[i] == s[i+1] == '1', it sets s[i] to '-1' and sets flag to 1.

- If flag is 1, it sets s[i] to '0'.

After this loop, it handles the last element (i=29):

- If flag is 1 and s[29] is '0', it sets s[29] to '1'.

- If flag is 1 and s[29] is '1', it sets s[29] to '0' and appends '1' to s, increasing the length to 31.

Wait, but the initial length was set to 30, and it's possible to increase it to 31.

Then, there's another loop from i=1 to length-1:

- If s[i] == '-1' and s[i-1] == '1', it swaps them: s[i] becomes '0' and s[i-1] becomes '-1'.

Finally, it prints the length and the array s.

I need to verify if this algorithm correctly generates an array that satisfies all the conditions.

Let's walk through the algorithm step by step with an example.

Take x = 14, which is 1110 in binary.

So, s initially would be:

Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 ... up to 29

Values: 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0

Wait, no. The least significant bit is s[0], which is 0, then s[1]=1, s[2]=1, s[3]=1, and s[4] to s[29]=0.

But in the example, the output is 5 elements: 0, -1, 0, 0, 1, which corresponds to:

0*2^0 + (-1)*2^1 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^3 + 1*2^4 = 0 -2 + 0 + 0 + 16 = 14.

So, how does the algorithm transform the full 30-bit binary representation into this 5-element array?

Let's see:

Initialize s with 30 elements, corresponding to bits 0 to 29.

Then, the flag is initially 0.

Loop from i=0 to 28:

- i=0: flag=0, s[0]='0', s[1]='1' → don't match the conditions, skip.

- i=1: flag=0, s[1]='1', s[2]='1' → match the condition, set s[1]='-1', set flag=1.

- i=2: flag=1, set s[2]='0'.

- i=3: flag=1, set s[3]='0'.

- i=4 to i=28: flag=1, set s[i]='0'.

Then, check if flag=1 and s[29]='0', set s[29]='1'.

Since s[29]='0', set s[29]='1', and length remains 30.

Then, another loop from i=1 to 29:

- i=1: s[1]='-1', s[0]='0' → no swap.

- i=2: s[2]='0', s[1]='-1' → no swap.

- i=3: s[3]='0', s[2]='0' → no swap.

- ...

- i=4: s[4]='0', s[3]='0' → no swap.

- ...

- i=24: s[24]='0', s[23]='0' → no swap.

- i=25: s[25]='0', s[24]='0' → no swap.

- i=26: s[26]='0', s[25]='0' → no swap.

- i=27: s[27]='0', s[26]='0' → no swap.

- i=28: s[28]='0', s[27]='0' → no swap.

- i=29: s[29]='1', s[28]='0' → no swap.

So, the final s is:

s[0]='0', s[1]='-1', s[2]='0', s[3]='0', ..., s[29]='1'

But according to the example, it should output only 5 elements: 0, -1, 0, 0, 1.

Wait, but in the algorithm, it sets the initial length to 30, and in some cases increases it to 31.

But in the example, it's outputting only 5 elements.

Hmm, there must be some trimming happening.

Wait, looking back at the algorithm:

After the first loop, it sets s[29]='1' if flag=1 and s[29]='0', or appends '1' and increases length to 31 if s[29]='1'.

Wait, no, in the code, it's:

if flag and s[29] == '0':

s[29] = '1'

elif flag:

s[29] = '0'

s.append('1')

length += 1

So, in this case, flag=1 and s[29]='0', so it sets s[29]='1', and length remains 30.

Then, the second loop:

for i in range(1, length):

if s[i] == '-1' and s[i-1] == '1':

s[i] = '0'

s[i-1] = '-1'

In this case, s[1]='-1' and s[0]='0', so no swap.

s[2]='0', s[1]='-1' → no swap.

...

s[29]='1', s[28]='0' → no swap.

So, the final s is:

s[0]='0', s[1]='-1', s[2]='0', ..., s[29]='1'

But the example output is only 5 elements: 0, -1, 0, 0, 1

So, it seems like it's trimming the leading zeros.

Wait, but the code doesn't show any trimming.

Wait, perhaps it's printing all 30 elements, but in the example, it's showing only 5.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking back:

print(length)

print(*s)

But in the example, it's printing 5 and then 0 -1 0 0 1

So, perhaps it's trimming the leading zeros.

Wait, but s starts from s[0] to s[29], and s[29] is '1', s[28] to s[1] are '0's except s[1]='-1', and s[0]='0'.

So, printing all 30 elements would be 0, -1, 0, ..., 0, 1

But in the example, it's printing only 5 elements.

Wait, maybe the length is being adjusted based on the highest non-zero element.

But in the code, length is set to 30 initially and might increase to 31.

Wait, perhaps the test input is different from the example.

Wait, in the example, for x=14, it's outputting n=5 and the array 0 -1 0 0 1

But according to the code, it's setting length to 30 or 31.

So, perhaps there's some misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the code is trimming the trailing zeros.

Wait, but in the code, it's printing all 'length' elements of s.

But in the example, it's only showing 5 elements.

Maybe the array is being trimmed to the minimum necessary length.

But in the code, it's set to length=30 or 31, and printing all elements.

This seems inconsistent with the example.

Wait, perhaps the example is just showing a shortened version, and in reality, it prints all 30 elements.

But the problem statement says "1 ≤ n ≤ 32", so it's allowed to output up to 32 elements.

But the example shows n=5 for x=14.

So, maybe the code is not matching the example.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array always exists."

So, I need to verify if the given code correctly generates such an array.

Looking back at the algorithm:

- It starts with the binary representation of x.

- Then, it processes the bits to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

- It uses a flag to track if there's a carry or something.

This seems similar to converting a binary number to a signed binary representation, perhaps using some form of carry propagation.

But I need to verify if this algorithm correctly generates an array that satisfies the conditions.

Let me try another example.

Take x=1.

Binary representation: 1

So, s = ['1']

But in the code, it initializes s with 30 elements, but for x=1, only s[0]='1', and the rest are '0'.

Then, in the loop:

for i from 0 to 28:

if flag=0 and s[i]=s[i+1]='1', set s[i]='-1', flag=1

But s[0]='1', s[1]='0', so no change.

Then, flag=0, so no change.

Then, for i=1 to 29, if s[i]='-1' and s[i-1]='1', swap.

But no such case.

So, it would output n=30 and s with s[0]='1' and the rest '0's.

But in the example, for x=1, it's outputting n=1 and array [1].

So, again, inconsistency between the code and the example.

This makes me think that the code is not correctly implementing the required logic.

Wait, perhaps the code is trimming the array to remove trailing zeros.

But in the code, it's printing all 'length' elements, which is set to 30 or 31.

But in the example, it's outputting only the necessary elements.

So, maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is intended to work with a fixed length of 30 or 31 bits, but the example shows a shorter array.

But the problem allows n to be between 1 and 32, so shorter arrays are acceptable as long as they satisfy the conditions.

So, perhaps the code needs to be modified to trim the leading zeros.

Wait, but in binary representation, the least significant bit is s[0], so leading zeros would be at higher indices.

So, to trim leading zeros, I need to find the highest index with a non-zero value and only consider up to that index.

In the example for x=14, the highest non-zero index is 4 (since 1*2^4=16), and the array is [0,-1,0,0,1], which corresponds to i=0 to i=4.

So, n=5.

Similarly, for x=1, only s[0]='1', so n=1.

So, the code needs to determine the minimum n such that s[n-1] is non-zero.

Then, set n to be from 0 to that index.

But in the current code, it's setting length to 30 or 31, without trimming.

So, it's likely incorrect.

Moreover, in the second loop:

for i in range(1, length):

if s[i] == '-1' and s[i-1] == '1':

s[i] = '0'

s[i-1] = '-1'

This seems like an attempt to fix any violations of the no two consecutive non-zero elements.

For example, if we have '1' and '-1' consecutively, it swaps them to '-1' and '0'.

This makes sense to maintain the sum while ensuring that consecutive non-zero elements are avoided.

But if the array isn't trimmed, it may include leading zeros, which is allowed but not optimal.

However, according to the problem, n should be as small as possible, but it's allowed to be up to 32.

So, perhaps having n=30 or 31 is acceptable, as long as it's correct.

But the example shows smaller n, which is better.

So, to make it correct, the code should trim the leading zeros.

Meaning, find the highest index k where s[k] != '0', and set n = k+1, and output s[0] to s[k].

This way, n is minimized.

But the current code isn't doing that; it's setting a fixed length of 30 or 31.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Moreover, I need to verify if the algorithm correctly transforms the binary representation into the required signed binary representation with no two consecutive non-zero elements.

Looking back at the first loop:

for i in range(0, 29):

if flag and s[i] == '0':

s[i] = '1'

flag = 0

elif flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i+1] == '1':

s[i] = '-1'

flag = 1

elif flag == 1:

s[i] = '0'

This seems like an attempt to handle consecutive '1's in the binary representation by replacing one of them with '-1' and adjusting the carry with the flag.

Then, for the last element (i=29):

if flag and s[29] == '0':

s[29] = '1'

elif flag:

s[29] = '0'

s.append('1')

length += 1

This handles the carry for the last bit.

Finally, the second loop fixes any occurrences of '1' and '-1' being consecutive.

But without trimming the leading zeros, the array may contain unnecessary zeros, which is not optimal, but perhaps still acceptable since n can be up to 32.

However, in the example, it's showing a shorter array, which is better.

Therefore, to make the code correct, I need to adjust it to trim the leading zeros.

Moreover, I need to ensure that the generated array satisfies the sum condition and the no two consecutive non-zero elements condition.

Given that, I think the code is almost correct, but it needs to be modified to trim the leading zeros.

So, after all the processing, find the maximum i where s[i] != '0', set n = i+1, and output s[0] to s[i].

This way, n is minimized, and the array is correct.

Therefore, with this modification, the code would be correct.

But as it stands, it's setting a fixed length of 30 or 31, which is suboptimal and may be incorrect if there are leading zeros that should be trimmed.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an array of integers \( a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} \) that satisfies specific conditions based on a given positive integer \( x \). The conditions include constraints on the array length, element values, the sum of elements multiplied by powers of 2, and the absence of consecutive non-zero elements.

### Approach

1. **Binary Representation Conversion**:
   - Convert the given integer \( x \) into its binary representation and store it in a list `s`.

2. **Adjusting the Array**:
   - Process the binary list to ensure no two consecutive elements are non-zero by using a flag to handle carries and adjustments.
   - Adjust the array elements to include -1, 0, or 1, ensuring the sum condition is met.

3. **Trimming Leading Zeros**:
   - Trim leading zeros from the array to minimize its length.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the length of the adjusted array and the array itself.

                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        # Trim leading zeros
        for i in reversed(range(length)):
            if s[i] != '0':
                n = i + 1
                break
        print(n)
        print(' '.join(s[:n]))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the input values, including the number of test cases and the values of \( x \) for each test case.

2. **Binary Conversion**:
   - Convert each \( x \) into its binary representation stored in a list `s`.

3. **Array Adjustment**:
   - Use a flag to handle cases where consecutive '1's are present, adjusting them to include '-1' and manage carries.
   - Ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist by swapping and setting elements appropriately.

4. **Trimming Leading Zeros**:
   - Determine the minimal array length by removing leading zeros, ensuring the array is as short as possible while retaining the necessary elements.

5. **Output**:
   - Print the optimized array length and the adjusted array for each test case.

This approach ensures that the generated array meets all the problem constraints efficiently.
