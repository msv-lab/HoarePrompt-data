Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2, and I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. These arrays have specific properties:

1. l is a subset of the first n elements of the array a.

2. r is a subset of the last n elements of the array a.

3. The bitwise XOR of elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, and if there are multiple, I can output any one of them.

First, I need to understand what a subset means here. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging the remaining elements. So, it's just any collection of elements from the original sequence, not necessarily contiguous.

Given that, I need to select 2k elements from the first n elements for l and 2k elements from the last n elements for r, such that the XOR of elements in l equals the XOR of elements in r.

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, once in the first half and once in the second half, or vice versa.

Wait, no. Actually, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, but not necessarily once in each half. Wait, the array is of length 2n, and it's split into two halves, each of length n. But the problem says:

"l is a subset of [a1, a2, … an]"

"r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, … a2n]"

And each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a.

So, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array a, and these two occurrences can be in any positions, but for l and r, l is a subset of the first n elements, and r is a subset of the last n elements.

I need to choose 2k elements from the first n for l and 2k elements from the last n for r, such that the XOR of elements in l equals the XOR of elements in r.

Also, k can be up to floor of n/2, so 2k can be up to n.

Given that, I need to find a way to select these subsets.

First, I need to think about the properties of XOR. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order doesn't matter, and it's its own inverse. So, XOR of a set of numbers is just the XOR of all of them together.

Given that, I need to have l1 XOR l2 XOR ... XOR l2k equal to r1 XOR r2 XOR ... XOR r2k.

An idea that comes to mind is to select pairs of equal elements for l and r, since equal elements will have the same XOR contribution.

But, since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and the two occurrences could be in the first half, the second half, or one in each.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a, but it doesn't specify that each number appears once in the first half and once in the second half. It's possible that for some numbers, both occurrences are in the first half, and for others, both are in the second half, or one in each.

Wait, no, actually, since the array is of length 2n, and split into two halves of n each, and there are 2 occurrences of each number, it's possible to have both occurrences in the first half, both in the second half, or one in each.

But, in the problem statement, it's given that we need to choose subsets from the first half for l and from the second half for r.

Given that, I need to find a way to select 2k elements from the first half and 2k from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

Also, it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, so I don't need to worry about the case where no solution exists.

I need to find an efficient way to do this, considering that n can be up to 5*10^4 and t up to 5000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^4.

So, time complexity needs to be decent.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

If I have two sets, l and r, and their XORs are equal, that means that the XOR of all elements in l XOR all elements in r is zero.

Wait, no. If l XOR r = 0, then l = r, but in this context, l and r are sets of elements from different halves.

Wait, actually, that's not directly helpful.

Another way to think about it is that the XOR of all elements in l and r together should equal the XOR of l with r.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me recall that for two sets A and B, if XOR(A) = XOR(B), then XOR(A U B) = XOR(A) XOR (A ∩ B), but since A and B are disjoint in this context, XOR(A U B) = XOR(A) XOR (B).

Wait, perhaps that's not the best way.

Let me consider that I need to choose 2k elements from the first half and 2k from the second half such that their XORs are equal.

One approach could be to select k pairs of equal elements, one from the first half and one from the second half, but that might not always be possible, especially since k can be up to n/2.

Wait, but k can be up to floor of n/2, and n can be up to 5*10^4, so 2k can be up to n.

But in the worst case, n=5*10^4, t=5000, sum of n over all test cases <=5*10^4, so time complexity should be O(n log n) per test case or something like that.

I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider the following approach:

Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, I can group the positions where each number appears.

For each number, I have two positions where it appears, say p1 and p2.

I need to decide which subset to include each number in.

Wait, but I need to choose subsets from the first half and the second half, not necessarily pairing the two occurrences of each number.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the XOR properties of the numbers.

Let me consider that the XOR of all elements in the first half is equal to the XOR of all elements in the second half, because each number appears twice in the entire array.

Wait, actually, since each number appears twice in the entire array, the XOR of all elements in the array is zero, because each number XORed with itself is zero.

Therefore, the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of the second half.

Wait, is that true?

Yes, because XOR of all elements in the array is zero (since each number from 1 to n appears twice, and a XOR a = 0, so XOR of all is 0).

Therefore, XOR(first n elements) = XOR(last n elements).

Because XOR(first n) XOR XOR(last n) = XOR(all elements) = 0, so XOR(first n) = XOR(last n).

Given that, I need to choose subsets l from first n and r from last n, each of size 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that XOR(first n) = XOR(last n), maybe I can choose l and r such that l and r together have the same XOR as the first n and last n.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

An alternative approach: since XOR(first n) = XOR(last n), and I need to choose subsets l from first n and r from last n such that XOR(l) = XOR(r), and both l and r have size 2k.

Given that, perhaps I can choose l to be any subset of size 2k from the first n, and then choose r to be a subset of size 2k from the last n such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

But finding such an r might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, since XOR(first n) = XOR(last n), and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r), perhaps I can choose l and r such that l and r together have XOR equal to XOR(first n) XOR XOR(last n) = 0.

Wait, but l is a subset of first n, and r is a subset of last n, so XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) should be equal to XOR(first n) XOR XOR(last n) XOR (first n \ l) XOR (last n \ r).

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to choose 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n such that their XORs are equal.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers and try to balance the XOR contributions.

But that seems vague.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the first and second halves.

For each number from 1 to n, it appears exactly twice in the entire array, so it can appear:

- Once in the first half and once in the second half.

- Twice in the first half.

- Twice in the second half.

I need to consider these cases.

Let me denote for each number, the count in the first half and the second half.

For example, for number x, let’s say it appears cnt1[x] times in the first half and cnt2[x] times in the second half, where cnt1[x] + cnt2[x] = 2.

Given that, I can think about selecting certain occurrences for l and r.

But I need to select exactly 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

This is getting tricky.

Maybe I can start by selecting pairs of equal numbers, one from the first half and one from the second half, and include them in l and r respectively.

But I need to select 2k elements, not just k elements.

Wait, no, 2k elements in total for l and r, each of size 2k.

Wait, no, l and r each should have 2k elements.

Wait, the problem says "each of length 2k", so l has 2k elements, r has 2k elements.

So total selected elements are 4k.

But I need to choose 2k elements from the first n for l and 2k from the last n for r.

Wait, but 2k elements for l and 2k for r, so total 4k elements.

But n can be up to 5*10^4, and k up to n/2, which is 2.5*10^4, so 4k can be up to 10^5, which is manageable.

But I need an efficient way to select these elements.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Compute the XOR of the first n elements and the XOR of the last n elements. Since XOR of first n equals XOR of last n, let's denote this common XOR as X.

2. I need to choose l from first n and r from last n, each with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

3. Since XOR(first n) = X and XOR(last n) = X, and l is a subset of first n with 2k elements, and r is a subset of last n with 2k elements, I need to choose l and r such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, perhaps I can choose l to be any subset of first n with 2k elements, and then choose r from last n with 2k elements such that XOR(r) = XOR(l).

But finding such an r efficiently is not straightforward.

An alternative idea: since XOR is involved, perhaps I can work with the XOR properties of the elements.

Wait, maybe I can select elements such that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

But I need a better plan.

Let me consider that I need to choose 2k elements from first n for l and 2k from last n for r, and I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, perhaps I can choose l and r such that the XOR of their symmetric difference is zero.

But again, that seems too vague.

Let me try to look at small examples to see a pattern.

Take the first example in the sample input:

2 1

1 2 2 1

So n=2, k=1

First half: 1,2

Second half: 2,1

Possible l of size 2: [1,2]

Possible r of size 2: [2,1]

XOR(l) = 1 XOR 2 = 3

XOR(r) = 2 XOR 1 = 3

So, they are equal.

Another possible l: [2,1], r: [2,1], both XOR to 3.

So, in this case, any permutation of the first and second halves works.

But in general, it might not be that straightforward.

Look at the second sample input:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

So n=6, k=1

First half: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Second half: 1,6,3,5,5,4

Need to choose 2 elements from first half for l, and 2 from second half for r, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r)

In the sample output, l=[6,4], r=[1,3], both XOR to 2.

Another possible solution might exist, but this one works.

How did they choose [6,4] and [1,3]?

Let me see:

6 XOR 4 = 2

1 XOR 3 = 2

So, both equal to 2.

How can I generalize this selection process?

Perhaps I can look for pairs of elements, one from first half and one from second half, that have the same XOR.

But in this case, it's not just one pair, but 2k elements.

Wait, k=1, so 2k=2 elements in l and r.

In this case, they chose two elements for l and two for r.

Wait, but k=1, so 2k=2, which matches.

I need to find a way to select 2k elements from first n and 2k from last n with equal XOR.

An idea: since XOR is involved, maybe I can select elements in such a way that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that I need to choose subsets l and r such that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, which is equivalent to XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR of first n equals XOR of last n, perhaps I can make use of this property.

Wait, perhaps I can choose l and r such that the XOR of l and r together equals the XOR of first n and last n.

But since XOR of first n equals XOR of last n, their XOR together is zero.

So, if I choose l and r such that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, which is the same as XOR(l) = XOR(r), then that aligns with the overall XOR being zero.

But I need a way to select such subsets efficiently.

Let me consider another approach: since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and I need to choose subsets from the first and second halves, perhaps I can group the numbers based on their positions.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the numbers that appear in both halves.

Wait, but the numbers are from 1 to n, and each appears exactly twice.

So, for each number, it appears in two positions, which could be in the same half or in different halves.

I need to consider the distribution of these numbers across the two halves.

Let me try to categorize the numbers based on where their two occurrences are:

1. Both occurrences are in the first half.

2. Both occurrences are in the second half.

3. One occurrence is in the first half, and the other is in the second half.

For each number, one of these three cases holds.

Now, for numbers where both occurrences are in the first half, selecting both in l would contribute their XOR, which is zero, since a XOR a = 0.

Similarly, for numbers where both occurrences are in the second half, selecting both in r would contribute zero.

For numbers where one occurrence is in the first half and the other in the second half, selecting one in l and the other in r would contribute the number itself to both XORs.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting complete pairs or selecting individual occurrences.

This seems promising.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let S be the set of numbers that appear in both halves, i.e., one occurrence in the first half and one in the second half.

- Let A be the set of numbers that appear twice in the first half.

- Let B be the set of numbers that appear twice in the second half.

Note that S, A, and B are disjoint partitions of the numbers from 1 to n.

Given that, I can analyze the XOR contributions.

First, the XOR of the first half is the XOR of:

- Both occurrences of numbers in A.

- One occurrence of numbers in S.

Similarly, the XOR of the second half is the XOR of:

- Both occurrences of numbers in B.

- One occurrence of numbers in S.

Since XOR of both occurrences of a number is zero, the XOR of the first half simplifies to the XOR of the single occurrences in S, i.e., XOR of the numbers in S that have one occurrence in the first half.

Similarly, the XOR of the second half is the XOR of the numbers in S that have one occurrence in the second half.

Wait, but in reality, for S, each number appears once in the first half and once in the second half, so the XOR of the first half is XOR of all numbers in S that have their first occurrence in the first half, and similarly for the second half.

But since each number in S appears once in each half, the XOR of the first half is equal to the XOR of the second half, which is equal to the XOR of all numbers in S.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's think carefully.

Let’s denote S1 as the set of numbers in S with their first occurrence in the first half.

Similarly, S2 as the set of numbers in S with their first occurrence in the second half.

Then, the XOR of the first half is XOR of:

- Both occurrences of numbers in A (which is zero).

- One occurrence of each number in S1.

Similarly, the XOR of the second half is XOR of:

- Both occurrences of numbers in B (which is zero).

- One occurrence of each number in S2.

But since for S, each number appears once in each half, S1 and S2 together make up S, but depending on where the first occurrence is.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let’s consider that for each number in S, its two occurrences are split across the two halves.

So, in the first half, I have one occurrence of each number in S, and in the second half, I have the other occurrence.

Therefore, the XOR of the first half is XOR of:

- Both occurrences of numbers in A.

- One occurrence of each number in S.

Similarly, the XOR of the second half is XOR of:

- Both occurrences of numbers in B.

- One occurrence of each number in S.

But since XOR of both occurrences of a number in A or B is zero, the XOR of the first half is equal to XOR of the numbers in S that have their occurrence in the first half, and similarly for the second half.

But since each number in S appears once in each half, the XOR of the first half is equal to XOR of all numbers in S.

Similarly, the XOR of the second half is equal to XOR of all numbers in S.

Therefore, XOR of first half = XOR of second half = XOR of all numbers in S.

Given that, I need to choose l from first n and r from last n, each with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, perhaps I can select l and r such that the XOR of l and r are both equal to the XOR of S.

Wait, but I need to choose subsets with exactly 2k elements each.

Wait, but I need to choose subsets of size 2k, not necessarily XOR equal to XOR of S.

Wait, perhaps I can select l to be some subset of first n with 2k elements, and r to be a subset of last n with 2k elements, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR of first n = XOR of last n = XOR of S, perhaps I can select l and r such that XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR of S.

But I need to ensure that l and r each have exactly 2k elements.

This seems a bit vague.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I need to choose 2k elements from the first n and 2k from the last n such that their XORs are equal.

I can try to iteratively build these subsets by selecting elements in pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can group the elements into groups that can be selected together.

Wait, maybe I can look at the numbers in S, A, and B separately and decide how many elements to pick from each group.

Let’s try to think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), where XOR corresponds to addition modulo 2.

In this setting, selecting elements for l and r can be seen as solving a system of linear equations.

But given the time constraints, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) or O(n log n) per test case.

Let me consider that for numbers in A, both occurrences are in the first half, so selecting both in l contributes zero to XOR(l).

Similarly, for numbers in B, selecting both in r contributes zero to XOR(r).

For numbers in S, selecting one in l and one in r contributes the number itself to both XOR(l) and XOR(r).

Wait, that might be useful.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- For each number in A, I can select both in l or neither.

- For each number in B, I can select both in r or neither.

- For each number in S, I can select one in l and one in r.

If I select both occurrences of a number in A for l, their XOR contribution is zero.

Similarly for B and r.

If I select one occurrence of a number in S for l and the other for r, their XOR contributions to l and r are both equal to that number.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting complete pairs.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as selecting certain pairs to include in l and r.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that I need to choose a certain number of elements from A, B, and S to make up the 2k elements in l and r.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look back at the sample input.

In the second sample input:

6 1

6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4

First half: 6,4,2,1,2,3

Second half:1,6,3,5,5,4

From first half, l=[6,4]

From second half, r=[1,3]

XOR(l)=6 XOR 4 = 2

XOR(r)=1 XOR 3 = 2

So, they chose 6 and 4 from the first half, and 1 and 3 from the second half.

Note that 6 and 4 are both in A, since both 6 and 4 appear twice in the first half.

Wait, 6 appears twice in the first half, and 4 appears twice in the first half.

Wait, no, 6 appears at positions 1 and 7, which are first half and second half, so 6 is in S.

Wait, positions are 1-based, so positions 1 to 6 are first half, 7 to 12 are second half.

So, 6 is at position 1 and 7, so one in first half, one in second half, so 6 is in S.

Similarly, 4 is at positions 2 and 12, so one in first half, one in second half, so 4 is in S.

Wait, but in the sample, l=[6,4], which are both from first half, but 6 is in S, and 4 is in S.

Wait, but in S, one occurrence is in first half and one in second half.

In l, they selected the first occurrence of 6 and the first occurrence of 4, both from first half.

In r, they selected the second occurrence of 1 and the second occurrence of 3, both from second half.

Wait, but 1 appears at positions 4 and 8, so first occurrence in first half, second in second half.

Similarly, 3 appears at positions 6 and 7, so first in first half, second in second half.

Wait, but in r, they selected 1 from second half and 3 from second half.

Wait, but 3 is at position 7, which is second half, and 1 is at position 8, which is second half.

So, in l, they selected 6 and 4 from first half, and in r, selected 1 and 3 from second half.

Now, 6 and 4 are both in S, with one occurrence in each half.

So, selecting 6 from first half and 6 from second half would contribute 6 to both l and r, but here they selected 6 from first half for l, and 1 and 3 from second half for r.

Wait, perhaps there is a different way to pair them.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that I can select complete pairs from S, meaning one from first half and one from second half, and include them in l and r respectively.

Each such pair would contribute the number to both l and r, so their XOR would remain equal.

Also, I can select pairs from A and B.

For A, selecting both occurrences for l would contribute zero to XOR(l).

Similarly, for B, selecting both for r would contribute zero to XOR(r).

So, perhaps I can select some pairs from S, and some pairs from A and B to make up the required 2k elements.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

Each pair from S contributes 2 elements: one to l and one to r.

Each pair from A contributes 2 elements to l.

Each pair from B contributes 2 elements to r.

So, if I select x pairs from S, y pairs from A, and z pairs from B, then:

- l would have x + 2y elements.

- r would have x + 2z elements.

But I need l and r each to have 2k elements.

So, x + 2y = 2k and x + 2z = 2k.

From these equations, x + 2y = x + 2z, which implies y = z.

So, y = z.

Therefore, to satisfy both equations, y = z = t, and x = 2k - 2t.

But x needs to be non-negative, so 2k - 2t >= 0 => t <= k.

Also, t >= 0.

So, t can be from 0 to k.

Given that, I can choose t pairs from A, t pairs from B, and (k - t) pairs from S.

Wait, but x = 2k - 2t, and x is the number of pairs from S.

So, x = 2k - 2t.

But x needs to be even, since we're selecting pairs.

Wait, no, x is the number of pairs from S.

Wait, no, x is the number of pairs from S, each contributing one element to l and one to r.

Wait, perhaps I need to rephrase.

Let me denote:

- Let t be the number of pairs selected from A for l (each pair contributes two elements to l).

- Let t be the number of pairs selected from B for r (each pair contributes two elements to r).

- Let m be the number of pairs selected from S, where one element goes to l and one to r.

Then, the total elements in l would be 2t + m, and in r would be 2t + m.

We need 2t + m = 2k.

So, m = 2k - 2t.

Since m >= 0, 2k - 2t >= 0 => t <= k.

Also, m has to be less than or equal to the number of pairs available in S.

So, t can range from 0 to k, as long as m = 2k - 2t <= |S|.

Given that, I can choose t pairs from A, t pairs from B, and m = 2k - 2t pairs from S.

Then, l would consist of the t pairs from A and m elements from S (the first occurrences).

r would consist of the t pairs from B and m elements from S (the second occurrences).

This way, XOR(l) would be XOR of t pairs from A (which is zero) and XOR of m elements from S.

Similarly, XOR(r) would be XOR of t pairs from B (which is zero) and XOR of m elements from S.

Therefore, XOR(l) = XOR(r) = XOR of m elements from S.

So, this satisfies the condition.

I need to implement this approach.

Steps:

1. Identify sets A, B, and S.

- A: numbers that appear twice in the first half.

- B: numbers that appear twice in the second half.

- S: numbers that appear once in the first half and once in the second half.

2. Determine the number of pairs available in A, B, and S.

- pairs_A = floor(|A| / 2)

- pairs_B = floor(|B| / 2)

- pairs_S = |S|

3. Choose t such that 0 <= t <= k and m = 2k - 2t <= pairs_S.

Choose the maximum possible t such that m <= pairs_S.

4. Select t pairs from A and t pairs from B.

5. Select m pairs from S.

6. Set l to include:

- the 2t elements from A.

- the m elements from S (their occurrences in the first half).

Set r to include:

- the 2t elements from B.

- the m elements from S (their occurrences in the second half).

This ensures that l and r each have 2k elements, and XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Implementing this requires tracking the positions of each number in the array.

Let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

First, for each number, record its positions.

Then, categorize the numbers into A, B, and S based on the positions of their occurrences.

- If both occurrences are in the first half, it's in A.

- If both are in the second half, it's in B.

- If one is in the first half and one in the second half, it's in S.

Then, proceed as per the steps above.

Now, considering the constraints, n can be up to 5*10^4, and t up to 5000, with sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^4.

So, per test case, time complexity should be O(n).

Implementing this in code would require efficient data structures.

I can use dictionaries to map numbers to their positions.

Then, categorize A, B, S accordingly.

Then, choose t and m appropriately.

Edge cases to consider:

- All numbers are in A or B.

- All numbers are in S.

- k is maximum, i.e., floor(n/2).

- n is minimum, i.e., n=2.

- When m is zero, meaning t=k.

- When t is zero, meaning m=2k.

I need to ensure that I handle these cases correctly.

Also, need to make sure that I select the correct positions for l and r.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second sample input:

n=6, k=1

a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4]

First half: [6,4,2,1,2,3]

Second half: [1,6,3,5,5,4]

Numbers:

1: positions 4 and 8 -> S

2: positions 3 and 5 -> A

3: positions 6 and 7 -> S

4: positions 2 and 12 -> S

5: positions 9 and 10 -> B

6: positions 1 and 7 -> S

So,

A: [2]

B: [5]

S: [1,3,4,6]

pairs_A = 1 (since only one number in A)

pairs_B = 1 (only one number in B)

pairs_S = 4

Choose t such that m = 2k - 2t = 2 - 2t >=0 and m <= pairs_S.

So, t can be 0,1.

If t=1, m=0.

Meaning, select 1 pair from A, 1 pair from B, and 0 pairs from S.

But B has only one number, which has two occurrences in the second half.

So, l = [2,2] (from A) and r = [5,5] (from B).

XOR(l) = 2 XOR 2 = 0

XOR(r) = 5 XOR 5 = 0

So, XOR(l) = XOR(r) = 0.

This is a valid solution.

But in the sample output, they have l=[6,4], r=[1,3], which also works.

So, multiple solutions exist.

In this approach, I can choose t=0, m=2.

Then, select 0 pairs from A and B, and m=2 pairs from S.

Select two numbers from S, say [1,3].

Then, l = [1,3] from first half, which are positions 4 and 6: 1 and 3.

r = [1,3] from second half, which are positions 8 and 7: 1 and 3.

XOR(l) = 1 XOR 3 = 2

XOR(r) = 1 XOR 3 = 2

Which matches the sample output.

So, this approach can generate the sample output as well.

Hence, this seems correct.

I need to implement this in code.

In code, I need to:

1. Read t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and k.

b. Read the array a of size 2n.

c. Identify A, B, S.

- For each number from 1 to n, find its two positions.

- Categorize into A, B, or S.

d. Choose t and m appropriately.

- Choose t from 0 to k, such that m = 2k - 2t <= |S|.

- Choose the maximum possible t such that m <= |S|.

e. Select t pairs from A and t pairs from B.

- Since pairs_A and pairs_B might be less than t, need to adjust t to the minimum possible.

- But in the earlier step, ensure that t <= pairs_A and t <= pairs_B.

f. Select m pairs from S.

g. Construct l and r accordingly.

h. Output l and r.

Implementing this requires careful handling of the positions.

Also, need to make sure that for A and B, we have enough pairs to select.

If pairs_A < t, or pairs_B < t, need to adjust t accordingly.

Wait, in step d, I need to choose t such that t <= k and m = 2k - 2t <= |S|.

Also, t <= pairs_A and t <= pairs_B.

So, t should be the minimum of k, pairs_A, pairs_B, and floor((2k - m)/2).

Wait, better to set t = min(k, pairs_A, pairs_B)

Then, m = 2k - 2t

Then, ensure that m <= pairs_S.

If m > pairs_S, then need to decrease t.

Wait, perhaps set t = k - floor(m / 2)

But need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate t from 0 to k and find the maximum t such that m = 2k - 2t <= |S| and t <= pairs_A and t <= pairs_B.

But to optimize, perhaps choose t = min(k, pairs_A, pairs_B)

Then, m = 2k - 2t

If m > |S|, then need to decrease t.

So, set t = k - ceil(m - |S|)/2

This seems complicated.

Perhaps it's better to choose t as small as possible to maximize m, but in the earlier approach, choosing t=0 and m=2k seems fine.

But need to ensure that m <= |S|.

So, perhaps set t = max(0, k - floor(|S| / 2))

Wait, perhaps it's better to choose t such that m = 2k - 2t <= |S|

So, 2k - 2t <= |S|

=> t >= (2k - |S|)/2

Since t >=0 and t <= k, t <= pairs_A, t <= pairs_B

So, t should be in the range max(0, (2k - |S|)/2) <= t <= min(k, pairs_A, pairs_B)

And t should be an integer.

So, choose t within this range.

If no such t exists, then it's impossible, but according to the problem, it's always possible.

Hence, there will be a valid t.

Then, set m = 2k - 2t

Select t pairs from A, t pairs from B, and m pairs from S.

Then, construct l and r accordingly.

In code, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

To make it efficient, I can precompute the positions for each number and categorize them into A, B, or S.

Then, proceed as per the above steps.

I need to make sure that I select the correct positions for l and r.

Also, need to handle the cases where A or B have fewer pairs than t.

But in the earlier step, I choose t to be the minimum possible value to satisfy all constraints.

Hence, it should work.

I think this approach is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to find two subsets, l and r, each containing 2k elements from the first and second halves of the array respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of elements in l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in r.

### Approach

1. **Identify Sets A, B, and S:**
   - **A:** Numbers that appear twice in the first half.
   - **B:** Numbers that appear twice in the second half.
   - **S:** Numbers that appear once in the first half and once in the second half.

2. **Determine the Number of Pairs:**
   - Calculate the number of complete pairs available in A, B, and S.

3. **Choose t and m:**
   - Choose t, the number of pairs to select from A and B.
   - Calculate m, the number of pairs to select from S, ensuring m = 2k - 2t is feasible given the constraints.

4. **Select Pairs:**
   - Select t pairs from A and t pairs from B.
   - Select m pairs from S.

5. **Construct l and r:**
   - l includes elements from t pairs of A and m elements from S in the first half.
   - r includes elements from t pairs of B and m elements from S in the second half.

        pairs_B = len(B) // 2
        pairs_S = len(S)

                t = potential_t
                m = m
                break
        
        # Select t pairs from A and B
        l = []
        r = []
        for i in range(t):
            num = A[i * 2]
            l.append(a[pos[num][0]])
            l.append(a[pos[num][1]])
        for i in range(t):
            num = B[i * 2]
            r.append(a[pos[num][0]])
            r.append(a[pos[num][1]])

            num = S[i]
            l.append(a[pos[num][0]])
            r.append(a[pos[num][1]])
        
        # Print the result
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

# To use this function, you can call it directly.
# For example:
# func()

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read n and k, followed by the array a.

2. **Position Tracking:**
   - Track positions of each number in the array.

3. **Categorization:**
   - Classify numbers into A, B, and S based on their positions.

4. **Choosing t and m:**
   - Determine t and m such that constraints are satisfied.

5. **Constructing Subsets:**
   - Build subsets l and r by selecting appropriate elements from A, B, and S.

6. **Output the Result:**
