Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries where I compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d). The goal is to use these queries to figure out which pairs p_i and p_j will give me the maximum XOR.

First, I need to recall what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR sets a bit if it's set in either number.

Given that p is a permutation, all p_i are unique, which might help in distinguishing them.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since I can only ask about ORs of pairs and compare them, I need to find a way to infer the actual values of p_i from these comparisons.

One idea is to try to identify the maximum and minimum values in p, or perhaps sort parts of the permutation based on these OR comparisons.

Wait, but comparing ORs of pairs might not directly give me the order of individual elements. For example, if I have p_a OR p_b and p_c OR p_d, and p_a OR p_b > p_c OR p_d, what does that tell me about the individual p_i's?

Not much directly, because OR is not a one-to-one operation. Multiple pairs can have the same OR value.

Maybe I need to find a way to isolate individual p_i's.

Let me consider that in a permutation, all p_i are distinct, so perhaps I can find a way to identify each p_i uniquely based on their OR comparisons.

But that seems tricky. Maybe I should think in terms of bits, since XOR is involved, which is bit-wise.

Let's consider the binary representation of the numbers. Since p_i are from 0 to n-1, the number of bits needed is log2(n).

Suppose I try to determine the most significant bit (MSB) where the maximum XOR occurs.

The maximum XOR would be achieved when p_i and p_j differ in the most significant bit possible.

So, if I can find the highest bit position where p_i and p_j differ, that would give me the maximum XOR.

Wait, but I need to find such a pair.

Maybe I can iterate through the bit positions from the highest to the lowest and try to find p_i and p_j that differ in that bit.

But how do I do that using only OR comparisons?

This is tricky.

Let me think differently. Since I can compare ORs of pairs, maybe I can use that to find the maximum value in p or something similar.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems like it's trying to find a "best" index v1 by comparing ORs of pairs where one element is fixed and the other varies.

Let me look at the code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, the size of the permutation.

Then, it initializes g = 0 and v1 = 0.

Then, it loops from i = 1 to n-1:

It sets v2 = i

Prints the query "? v1 v1 v2 v2"

Flushes the output

Reads the response r (<, =, or >)

If r == '<', it sets v1 = v2

So, what's happening here is that it's comparing (p_v1 OR p_v1) with (p_v2 OR p_v2), which is essentially comparing p_v1 with p_v2, since p_v OR p_v == p_v.

Wait, is that true? Let's see.

For any integer x, x OR x equals x, because ORing a number with itself sets all the bits that were set in x, which is just x.

So, yes, "? v1 v1 v2 v2" is effectively comparing p_v1 with p_v2.

Therefore, this loop is finding the maximum p_i by comparing p_v1 and p_v2 directly.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that p is a permutation, so all p_i are unique.

So, this loop is essentially finding the index v1 that has the maximum p_v1.

Because it starts with v1 = 0, and for each i from 1 to n-1, it compares p_i with the current v1's p_v1, and if p_i is greater (as determined by the query), it sets v1 to i.

So, after this loop, v1 should be the index of the maximum p_i.

Okay, that makes sense.

Now, it sets prev = 0.

Then, it loops from i = 1 to n-1:

Prints the query "? v1 i v1 prev"

Flushes the output

Reads the response r

If r == '>', sets prev = i

So, this is comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev).

Recall that v1 is the index of the maximum p_i.

So, p_v1 is the largest p_i.

Now, (p_v1 OR p_i) compared with (p_v1 OR p_prev).

What does this tell us?

Well, since p_v1 is the largest, ORing it with any other p_i will set all the bits that are set in p_v1, and possibly some more from p_i.

But since p_v1 is the maximum, and p_i are all less than or equal to p_v1 (with equality only if i == v1, but p_i are unique, so p_i < p_v1 for i != v1).

Wait, but in OR operation, p_v1 OR p_i could be equal to p_v1 if p_i <= p_v1, or it could be larger if p_i has some bits set that p_v1 doesn't have.

Wait, but p_v1 is the maximum, so no p_i should have a bit set that p_v1 doesn't have, because p_v1 is the largest.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

In a permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum p_v1 might not have all bits set, depending on n.

Wait, for example, if n=4, p could be [0,1,2,3], and p_v1=3, which is 11 in binary.

Then, p_i for i=0 to 3 are 0,1,2,3.

So, p_v1 OR p_i for i=0 to 3 would be 3,3,3,3.

So, in this case, (p_v1 OR p_i) would be equal for all i.

But in the code, it's comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev), and if (p_v1 OR p_i) > (p_v1 OR p_prev), it sets prev = i.

But in the above example, all (p_v1 OR p_i) are equal to 3, so no change would happen.

Wait, but maybe in other permutations, where p_v1 isn't the maximum possible number n-1, there could be p_i with higher OR values.

Wait, no, p_v1 is the maximum p_i, so p_v1 OR p_i can't be greater than p_v1, unless p_i has some bit set that p_v1 doesn't have, but since p_v1 is the maximum, that shouldn't happen.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], p_v1=3, which is the maximum.

Then, p_v1 OR p_i for i=0 to 3: 3 OR 0=3, 3 OR 3=3, 3 OR 1=3, 3 OR 2=3.

All are 3.

So, in this case, the comparison would always be equal, and prev wouldn't change.

But in the sample input, it shows that for the query "? 1 2 0 3", which is (p1 OR p2) and (p0 OR p3), which are 3 OR 1 = 3 and 0 OR 2 = 2, so 3 > 2, which is '>', and prev is set to 2.

Wait, but in my earlier analysis, I thought that v1 is the index of the maximum p_i, which is 3 in this case, p3=2, but according to the sample, p3=2 and p1=3, so p1 is greater.

Wait, in the sample explanation, p=[0,3,1,2], so p1=3, p3=2, so p1 > p3, so v1 should be 1.

Wait, in the sample interaction, the output is:

? 0 2 3 1

<

? 1 1 2 3

=

? 1 2 0 3

>

! 3 2

! 0 1

Wait, the first query is "? 0 2 3 1", which is (p0 OR p2) < (p3 OR p1), which is (0 OR 1)=1 < (2 OR 3)=3, which is correct.

Then, "? 1 1 2 3", which is (p1 OR p1)=3 and (p2 OR p3)=1 OR 2=3, so "=".

Then, "? 1 2 0 3", which is (p1 OR p2)=3 OR 1=3 and (p0 OR p3)=0 OR 2=2, so ">".

Then, it outputs "! 3 2" and "! 0 1".

Wait, but according to the code, it should be outputting "! prev v1", which in this case, prev=2 and v1=1, but in the sample output, it's "! 3 2" and "! 0 1".

Hmm, maybe there's some confusion here.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in the code, after the first loop, v1 is set to the index with the maximum p_i.

Then, in the second loop, it's comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev), and if (p_v1 OR p_i) > (p_v1 OR p_prev), it sets prev = i.

But, as I thought earlier, since p_v1 is the maximum, (p_v1 OR p_i) should always be equal to p_v1, so comparisons should always be equal, unless there's some edge case.

But in the sample interaction, it shows that (p1 OR p2)=3 and (p0 OR p3)=2, so ">".

Wait, but according to the code, it's comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev), which in this case, v1=1, p_v1=3, p_prev=0, p0=0, p3=2.

So, (p1 OR p3)=3 OR 2=3, and (p1 OR p_prev)=3 OR 0=3, so "=".

But in the sample interaction, it's comparing (p1 OR p2) with (p0 OR p3), which is different from what the code is doing.

Wait, actually, looking back at the code:

It prints "? v1 i v1 prev"

So, that's (p_v1 OR p_i) and (p_v1 OR p_prev)

But in the sample interaction, it's "? 1 2 0 3", which is (p1 OR p2) and (p0 OR p3), which matches the code if v1=1 and prev=0, i=2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, in the code, it's:

for i in range(1, n):

print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')

So, for i from 1 to n-1, it's comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev)

In the sample, n=4, so i=1,2,3.

First i=1: compare (p1 OR 1) with (p1 OR 0)

Which is (3 OR 1)=3 and (3 OR 0)=3, so "="

Then i=2: (p1 OR 2)=3 OR 2=3, (p1 OR 0)=3, so "="

Then i=3: (p1 OR 3)=3 OR 3=3, (p1 OR 0)=3, so "="

But in the sample interaction, it only shows three queries, the third one being "? 1 2 0 3", which corresponds to i=2, comparing (p1 OR p2) with (p1 OR p_prev), where prev=0.

But in the sample, it's (p1 OR p2)=3, (p0 OR p3)=0 OR 2=2, which is ">".

Wait, that doesn't match the code.

In the code, it should be comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev), which is (p1 OR i) with (p1 OR prev).

But in the sample, it's (p1 OR p2) with (p0 OR p3).

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample or in the code.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is different from what I thought.

Wait, looking back at the code:

print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')

But in the sample interaction, it's:

? 0 2 3 1

? 1 1 2 3

? 1 2 0 3

Which doesn't match the pattern of ? v1 i v1 prev

Wait, perhaps the code is different from what I thought.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in transcribing the code.

Wait, looking back, the code is:

for i in range(1, n):

print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')

But in the sample interaction, the queries are:

? 0 2 3 1

? 1 1 2 3

? 1 2 0 3

Which don't match ? v1 i v1 prev

Wait, perhaps the code is different.

Wait, perhaps in the first loop, it's not correctly finding the maximum.

Wait, in the first loop, it sets v1 to the index with the maximum p_i.

But in the sample, the first query is ? 0 2 3 1, which is not matching ? v1 i v1 prev.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the code is different from what I thought.

Wait, perhaps the code is actually correct, and I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, perhaps the first loop is selecting v1 as the index with the maximum p_i, and then the second loop is trying to find a p_prev such that p_v1 OR p_prev is minimized or something.

But I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Perhaps the goal is to find two p_i and p_j such that their XOR is maximized.

I recall that the maximum XOR of two numbers in a set can be found by considering the binary representations and trying to maximize the differences in bits from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.

Maybe I can adapt that idea here.

First, find the position of the highest set bit in any of the p_i's.

Then, try to find p_i and p_j that differ in that bit.

If they do, their XOR will have that bit set, which contributes the maximum possible value to the XOR.

If they don't differ in that bit, move to the next lower bit and so on.

But how do I do this using only OR comparisons?

That's the challenge.

Alternatively, since p is a permutation, perhaps there's a way to sort the p_i's based on their OR values.

Wait, but OR is not a total order.

Hmm.

Let me consider that in a permutation of 0 to n-1, all p_i are unique.

So, perhaps I can find the maximum p_i, then find the p_j that differs the most from p_i in terms of XOR.

But how?

Wait, perhaps find the p_j such that p_i OR p_j is maximized.

But OR doesn't directly relate to XOR.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the bits one by one.

Let's consider the binary representation of p_i.

Suppose p_i are up to 10^4, so up to 14 bits.

I can try to determine the highest bit position where p_i and p_j differ.

For example, if the highest bit where they differ is the 13th bit, then their XOR will have the 13th bit set, which maximizes the XOR value.

So, to maximize XOR, I need p_i and p_j to differ in the most significant bit possible.

So, perhaps I can find the pair p_i and p_j that differ in the most significant bit.

To do that, I need to find p_i and p_j such that one has the bit set and the other has it unset, and this for the highest possible bit position.

But how do I find that using only OR comparisons?

One idea is to find the p_i with the most significant bit set and those without it set.

But how do I determine which p_i have a particular bit set using OR comparisons?

Wait, perhaps I can group p_i based on their OR with certain values.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that OR is associative and commutative.

So, (p_a OR p_b) is the same as (p_b OR p_a), and OR can be extended to multiple variables.

But I need to compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d).

How can I use this to extract information about individual p_i's?

Maybe I can fix some variables.

Wait, perhaps I can fix a and c, and vary b and d to learn about p_b and p_d.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that in the code provided, it first finds the index v1 with the maximum p_i by comparing p_i with p_j directly, since "? i i j j" effectively compares p_i with p_j.

Then, in the second loop, it compares (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev), and if (p_v1 OR p_i) > (p_v1 OR p_prev), it sets prev = i.

But as I thought earlier, since p_v1 is the maximum p_i, (p_v1 OR p_i) should always be equal to p_v1, so this comparison should always be equal, unless there's some edge case.

But in the sample interaction, it shows that (p1 OR p2)=3 and (p0 OR p3)=2, so (p1 OR p2) > (p0 OR p3), which is why it sets prev=2.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be comparing (p_v1 OR p_i) with (p_v1 OR p_prev), which is (p1 OR p_i) with (p1 OR p_prev).

In the sample, p1=3, p0=0, p3=2, p2=1.

So, (p1 OR p2)=3 OR 1=3, (p1 OR p_prev)=3 OR 0=3, so "=".

But in the sample interaction, it's comparing (p1 OR p2) with (p0 OR p3)=0 OR 2=2, which is ">".

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in the sample.

Wait, looking back at the code:

print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')

But in the sample interaction, it's:

? 1 2 0 3

Which would correspond to a query where a=v1=1, b=i=2, c=v1=1, d=prev=0.

Wait, but in the sample interaction, it's comparing (p1 OR p2) with (p0 OR p3), but according to the code, it should be comparing (p1 OR p2) with (p1 OR p0).

Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the sample interaction or in the code.

Alternatively, maybe the code is different from what I thought.

Wait, perhaps the code is:

print(f'? {v1} {i} {prev} {v1}')

But in the given code, it's print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}'

But in the sample interaction, it's "? 0 2 3 1", which doesn't match ? v1 i v1 prev.

Wait, maybe the code is miswritten.

Wait, perhaps the code is:

print(f'? {v1} {i} {prev} {v1}')

Which would make the query "? v1 i prev v1"

But in the sample, it's "? 0 2 3 1", which would correspond to v1=0, i=2, prev=3, which seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the initialization of prev is wrong.

Wait, in the code, prev is initialized to 0.

Then, in the loop from i=1 to n-1:

print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')

But in the sample, it's "? 0 2 3 1", which is a=0, b=2, c=0, d=3.

But according to the code, if v1=0 and prev=0 initially, then for i=1, it should be "? 0 1 0 0", but in the sample, it's "? 0 2 3 1"

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the sample or in the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is different from what's provided.

Wait, perhaps the code is:

print(f'? {v1} {i} {prev} {v1}')

Which would make it "? v1 i prev v1"

In the sample, v1=0, prev=0, i=2, so "? 0 2 0 0", but in the sample, it's "? 0 2 3 1"

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in transcribing the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct, and I need to interpret it differently.

Wait, perhaps the second loop is trying to find a p_prev that maximizes (p_v1 OR p_prev).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach is incorrect, and I need to think of a different way to solve the problem.

Let me consider that in a permutation, all p_i are unique, and I need to find p_i and p_j with maximum p_i XOR p_j.

I recall that for a set of numbers, the maximum XOR can be found using a trie or by considering bit positions.

But in this problem, I can only ask comparisons of ORs of pairs.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to extract bit information using OR comparisons.

Wait, OR reveals which bits are set in at least one of the two numbers.

XOR reveals which bits are set in exactly one of the two numbers.

So, they are different.

Maybe I can try to find the positions where p_i and p_j differ.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can find the positions where p_i and p_j have different bits by considering their OR and AND operations, but I only have OR comparisons.

This seems tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the p_i's based on their OR with certain values.

Wait, but sorting would require more comparisons than allowed.

Given that n can be up to 10^4 and t up to 10^3, and total sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum p_i and then find the p_j that has the maximum XOR with p_i.

But how do I find such p_j using only OR comparisons?

Wait, perhaps I can find p_j that differs the most from p_i in terms of bit positions.

But again, I need a way to compare bit positions using OR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the p_j that has the least number of common bits set with p_i, since XOR is maximized when bits are different.

But OR comparisons don't directly give me information about common set bits.

This is challenging.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix one element, say p_v1, and try to find p_j such that p_v1 XOR p_j is maximized.

To maximize p_v1 XOR p_j, I need p_j to differ from p_v1 in as many high-order bits as possible.

So, perhaps I can find p_j such that p_j has bits unset where p_v1 has them set, and vice versa.

But how do I find that using OR comparisons?

Wait, maybe I can consider that (p_v1 OR p_j) will have all the bits set that are set in p_v1 or p_j.

If p_j has a bit unset where p_v1 has it set, then (p_v1 OR p_j) will still have that bit set.

But for XOR, that bit would be unset.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is flawed and look for an alternative method.

Let me consider that in a permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum XOR is achieved by selecting the two numbers that are furthest apart in terms of their binary representations.

So, perhaps I can find the two numbers with the maximum Hamming distance.

But again, how do I find that using only OR comparisons?

Wait, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of bit masks.

Suppose I consider each bit position from the most significant to the least significant.

At each step, I try to determine if there exists a p_i and p_j that differ in that bit position.

If they do, then their XOR will have that bit set.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the bit positions from high to low, and try to find such a pair.

But how do I do that using only OR comparisons?

Wait, perhaps I can group the p_i's based on whether they have a particular bit set or not.

Then, compare ORs within those groups to see if there are p_i and p_j that differ in that bit.

But I'm not sure.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that for two numbers, their XOR is maximized when they differ in the highest possible bit.

So, perhaps I can find the highest bit position where there exist two numbers that differ in that bit.

Then, among such pairs, their XOR will have that bit set, which is the maximum possible.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the bit positions from the highest to the lowest, and for each bit, try to find if there exists at least one p_i with that bit set and at least one with that bit unset.

If such a pair exists, then their XOR will have that bit set.

To find such p_i and p_j, I need to identify p_i with the bit set and p_j with the bit unset, or vice versa.

But how do I do that using only OR comparisons?

Wait, perhaps I can fix a bit position and try to find p_i with that bit set and p_j with that bit unset, and compare their ORs with some other values to determine if that bit differs.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think about a different strategy.

Let me consider that in the first part of the code, it finds the maximum p_i by comparing p_i with p_j directly, which is effectively finding the maximum p_i.

Then, in the second part, it tries to find a p_j such that p_v1 OR p_j is maximized, compared to p_v1 OR p_prev.

But as I thought earlier, since p_v1 is the maximum, p_v1 OR p_j >= p_v1, and since p_j <= p_v1, p_v1 OR p_j == p_v1.

So, this comparison doesn't help in finding the p_j that maximizes p_v1 XOR p_j.

Therefore, I think the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't correctly identify the pair with the maximum XOR.

Instead, perhaps I need to find two p_i and p_j such that they differ in the most significant bit possible.

To do that, I can find the highest bit position where both p_i and p_j differ.

Given that p is a permutation, I can consider the bit positions one by one.

Start with the highest bit, and see if there are p_i with that bit set and some with that bit unset.

If so, choose one from each group.

But how do I do this using only OR comparisons?

This seems difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the p_i's based on their OR with a certain value, but again, this seems too vague.

Given the time constraints, maybe I need to accept that my current approach isn't working and consider that the provided code might be correct despite my confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler way to solve this problem within the query limit.

Wait, maybe I can consider that for a permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum XOR is achieved by selecting the maximum and minimum values, but that's not necessarily true.

For example, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, which is 3, not between 0 and 3, which is 3, which is the same.

But in general, it's not always between min and max.

So, that doesn't help.

Wait, perhaps I can find the two p_i's with the maximum difference.

But again, difference doesn't directly correlate with XOR.

This is tricky.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that I don't have a correct solution and that the provided code might be incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is False.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the correctness of the provided program for finding a pair of indices in a secret permutation that maximizes their bitwise XOR, using at most 3n queries.

   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, query the comparison between `p_v1` and `p_i` by asking `? v1 v1 i i`.
   - If `p_v1 < p_i`, set `v1` to `i`. This loop ensures that `v1` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Optimal Pair:**
   - Initialize `prev` to 0.
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, query the comparison between `(p_v1 | p_i)` and `(p_v1 | prev)`.
   - If `(p_v1 | p_i) > (p_v1 | prev)`, update `prev` to `i`. This step aims to find an index `prev` such that the OR with `p_v1` is maximized.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - Print the indices `prev` and `v1
