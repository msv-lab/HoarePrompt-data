Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he baked n buns that he wants to sell. The usual price for each bun is a coins. But to attract customers, he's running a promotion where he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the minimum of n and b), and for the first k buns sold, the price is modified to (b - i + 1) coins, where i is the ith bun sold in this promotion. The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at the usual price a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns, choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at price a coins each, so the total profit is n * a.

If he chooses k > 0, say k buns, then:

- The first bun sells for b coins.

- The second bun sells for b - 1 coins.

- ...

- The kth bun sells for b - k + 1 coins.

And the remaining (n - k) buns sell at the usual price a coins each.

So, the total profit for a given k would be:

Sum of the first k modified prices + (n - k) * a.

The sum of the first k modified prices is:

b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1).

This is an arithmetic series where the first term is b and the last term is b - k + 1, with k terms.

The sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term).

So, sum = k * (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 = k * (2b - k + 1) / 2.

Therefore, total profit for a given k is:

k * (2b - k + 1) / 2 + (n - k) * a.

Our goal is to maximize this expression over k, where k can be from 0 to min(n, b).

Wait, actually, k can be up to min(n, b), but according to the problem, k can be up to min(n, b), but looking back, it's min(n, b), but in the code, it's min(n, b - a). Is that a mistake?

Let me check the problem statement again.

"Bob chooses some integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b))."

So, k can be from 0 up to the minimum of n and b.

But in the code, it's k = min(n, b - a).

That seems different. Maybe there's a reason for that.

I need to think about what value of k maximizes the profit.

Let me consider different cases.

Case 1: b ≤ a.

In this case, the modified price for the first k buns is b, b-1, ..., b - k + 1.

But since b ≤ a, selling the first k buns at these prices and the remaining at a would be less optimal than selling all at price a.

Wait, let's see.

For example, if b = 5, a = 5, n = 4.

If k = 0, profit = 4 * 5 = 20.

If k = 1, profit = 5 + 3*5 = 5 + 15 = 20.

If k = 2, profit = 5 + 4 + 2*5 = 5 + 4 + 10 = 19.

So, in this case, k = 0 or k = 1 gives the same profit as k = 0, but k = 2 gives less.

So, when b ≤ a, it's better to choose k = 0 or k = 1, but not higher.

Wait, in the code, if b <= a, it prints a * n, meaning k = 0.

But in the example above, k = 1 also gives the same profit.

But in the first test case of the example:

4 4 5

k = 1 gives 5 + 4*3 = 5 + 12 = 17

k = 0 gives 4*4 = 16

So, k = 1 is better.

But in the case where b ≤ a, like in the third test case:

10 10 5

k = 0 gives 10*10 = 100

k = 1 gives 5 + 9*10 = 5 + 90 = 95, which is worse.

So, in this case, k = 0 is better.

So, in general, when b ≤ a, it's better to choose k = 0.

But in the code, it checks if b <= a, then print a*n.

That makes sense.

But in the first test case, b = 5 > a = 4, so it calculates the sum.

Wait, but in the first test case, k = 1 is better than k = 0.

But according to the code, if b > a, it calculates the sum.

Wait, but in the first test case, k can be up to min(n, b) = min(4,5) = 4.

So, k can be from 0 to 4.

We need to find the k that maximizes the profit.

So, in the code, when b > a, it sets k = min(n, b - a).

Wait, is that always correct?

Let me think.

In the first test case, n=4, a=4, b=5.

b - a = 1, so k = min(4,1) = 1.

Then, profit = b*k - k*(k-1)/2 + (n - k)*a = 5*1 - 1*0/2 + (4-1)*4 = 5 + 0 + 3*4 = 5 + 12 = 17, which matches the example.

If k = 2, profit = 5*2 - 2*1/2 + (4-2)*4 = 10 - 1 + 8 = 17.

Wait, same as k=1.

If k=3, 5*3 - 3*2/2 + (4-3)*4 = 15 - 3 + 4 = 16.

Worse.

So, k=1 or k=2 give the same maximum profit.

But the code chooses k = min(n, b - a) = 1, which gives profit 1 for k=1.

Wait, but in this case, k=2 also gives the same profit.

So, is choosing k = min(n, b - a) always giving the maximum profit?

Let me see another example.

Second test case: 5 5 9

k = min(5,9-5)=4

So, k=4

Profit = 9*4 - 4*3/2 + (5-4)*5 = 36 - 6 + 5 = 35

Indeed, in the example output, it's 35.

If k=5, profit = 9*5 - 5*4/2 + (5-5)*5 = 45 - 10 + 0 = 35, same as k=4.

So, k=4 or k=5 give the same profit.

So, choosing k = min(n, b - a) = 4 gives the maximum profit.

Another test case: 10 10 5

k = min(10,5-10)=min(10,-5)=0, since b - a = -5

So, k=0, profit = 10*10 = 100, which matches the example.

Another test case: 5 5 11

k = min(5,11-5)=5-5=0? Wait, 11-5=6, so min(5,6)=5

Profit = 11*5 - 5*4/2 + (5-5)*5 = 55 - 10 + 0 = 45, which matches the example.

Another test case: 1000000000 1000000000 1

k = min(1000000000,1-1000000000)=min(1000000000,-999999999)=0

So, k=0, profit = 1000000000 * 1000000000, which is correct.

Another test case: 1000 1 1000

k = min(1000,1000-1)=999

Profit = 1000*999 - 999*998/2 + (1000-999)*1

= 999000 - (999*998)/2 + 1

= 999000 - (999*499) + 1

=999000 - 498501 +1 =499499 +1 =499500

But in the example output, it's 500500. Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, let's recalculate.

k = min(1000,1000-1)=999

Profit = 1000*999 - 999*998/2 + (1000-999)*1

= 999000 - (999*998)/2 +1

=999000 - (999*499) +1

=999000 - 498501 +1 =499500 +1 =499501

But the example output is 500500. So, there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Wait, the formula in the code is:

b*k - k*(k-1)/2 + (n - k)*a

Is that correct?

Wait, let's recall the sum of the first k modified prices:

b + (b-1) + ... + (b - k + 1) = k*(2b - k + 1)/2

So, the formula in the code is:

b*k - k*(k-1)/2 + (n - k)*a

Wait, let's see:

k*(2b - k + 1)/2 = k*(2b - k +1)/2 = (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 = b*k - k*(k-1)/2

Yes, that matches.

So, the formula is correct.

But in the last test case, according to the example, the output is 500500, but according to this formula, it's 499501, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I misread the test case.

Looking back at the problem, the last test case is:

1000 1 1000

So, n=1000, a=1, b=1000

k = min(1000,1000-1)=999

Profit = 1000*999 - 999*998/2 + (1000-999)*1

= 999000 - (999*998)/2 +1

=999000 - (999*499) +1

=999000 - 498501 +1 =499500 +1 =499501

But the example output is 500500, which is different.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the maximum is not at k=999, but at a different k.

Let's try k=1000.

Profit = 1000*1000 - 1000*999/2 + (1000-1000)*1 = 1000000 - 499500 + 0 = 500500

Ah, so k=1000 gives the profit of 500500, which matches the example.

But according to the code, k = min(n, b - a) = 999, which gives 499501, which is less than 500500.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect because it doesn't choose k=1000, but according to the problem, k can be up to min(n, b), which is min(1000,1000)=1000.

So, in this case, choosing k=1000 gives a higher profit than k=999.

Therefore, the code is incorrect in determining the value of k.

It should choose k = min(n, b), not k = min(n, b - a).

In the earlier test cases, it happened to work because in those cases, choosing k = min(n, b - a) gave the maximum profit, but in this case, it doesn't.

So, the correct approach is to choose k = min(n, b), not k = min(n, b - a).

Wait, but in the first test case, choosing k=1 gave the same profit as k=2.

But according to the formula, k=1 is sufficient, but k=2 also gives the same.

But in the last test case, choosing k=1000 gives a higher profit than k=999.

So, perhaps choosing k = min(n, b) is not always correct.

Wait, no. In the first test case, k can be up to min(4,5)=4, but choosing k=1 or k=2 gives the same profit.

In the second test case, k can be up to min(5,9)=5, and choosing k=4 or k=5 gives the same profit.

In the third test case, k can be up to min(10,5)=5, but choosing k=0 is better.

In the fourth test case, k can be up to min(5,11)=5, and choosing k=5 gives the maximum profit.

In the fifth test case, k can be up to min(1000000000,1000000000)=1000000000, and choosing k=1000000000 gives the maximum profit.

In the sixth test case, k can be up to min(1000000000,1)=1, and choosing k=1 gives the same as k=0.

In the seventh test case, k can be up to min(1000,1000)=1000, and choosing k=1000 gives the maximum profit.

So, in general, to maximize the profit, we need to choose the k that maximizes the expression:

k*(2b - k +1)/2 + (n - k)*a

Now, to find the k that maximizes this, we can consider it as a quadratic function in terms of k.

Let's denote the profit function as:

P(k) = k*(2b - k +1)/2 + (n - k)*a

Simplify:

P(k) = (2b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + n*a - k*a

P(k) = (2b*k - k^2 + k + 2*n*a - 2*a*k)/2

Wait, perhaps it's better to keep it as:

P(k) = (k*(2b - k +1))/2 + (n - k)*a

This is a quadratic in terms of k: P(k) = (-1/2)*k^2 + (2b +1)/2 *k + (n - k)*a

Wait, (n - k)*a = n*a - a*k

So, P(k) = (-1/2)*k^2 + (2b +1)/2 *k + n*a - a*k

Combine like terms:

P(k) = (-1/2)*k^2 + [(2b +1)/2 - a]*k + n*a

This is a quadratic equation in k: P(k) = A*k^2 + B*k + C, where

A = -1/2

B = (2b +1)/2 - a

C = n*a

The maximum of this quadratic function occurs at k = -B/(2*A)

Plugging in the values:

k = -B/(2*A) = -[(2b +1)/2 - a] / (2*(-1/2)) = [a - (2b +1)/2] / 1 = a - (2b +1)/2

But this may not be an integer, and k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n,b).

So, perhaps it's better to consider the derivative and find the vertex of the parabola, then choose the closest integer k within the allowed range.

But since n, a, b can be up to 10^9, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Alternatively, since it's a quadratic with a negative leading coefficient (A=-1/2), it's a downward-opening parabola, so the maximum is at the vertex.

The vertex is at k = -B/(2*A) = [a - (2b +1)/2] / (-1) = (2b +1 - 2a)

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the vertex.

Let me recalculate.

Given P(k) = (-1/2)*k^2 + [(2b +1)/2 - a]*k + n*a

The vertex is at k = -B/(2*A) = -[(2b +1)/2 - a] / (2*(-1/2)) = [a - (2b +1)/2] / 1 = a - (2b +1)/2

But this seems odd because k has to be between 0 and min(n,b).

Perhaps instead of calculating the vertex, I can consider that the profit increases as long as adding another k increases the profit, and stops increasing beyond a certain point.

Alternatively, I can consider that the marginal addition of increasing k by 1 is (b - k +1) - a, and as long as this is positive, increasing k increases the profit.

So, as long as b - k +1 > a, increasing k increases the profit.

So, the condition for increasing k is:

b - k +1 > a

Which implies:

k < b - a +1

So, the optimal k is the maximum integer less than b - a +1, but not exceeding min(n, b).

Therefore, k = min(n, b - a)

Wait, but in the last test case, b - a = 1000 -1 =999, and min(n, b -a)=999, but choosing k=1000 gives a higher profit.

Wait, but according to the marginal condition, as long as b - k +1 > a, increase k.

So, for k from 1 to b - a, the marginal addition is positive.

At k = b - a +1, b - k +1 = a, so the marginal addition is zero.

So, the maximum profit is achieved at k = b - a.

But in the last test case, choosing k =1000 gives a higher profit than k=999.

Wait, b - a +1 =1000 -1 +1=1001, but b=1000, so min(n, b)=1000.

So, k=1000.

Wait, perhaps I need to set k = min(n, b, b - a +1)

In the code, it's k = min(n, b -a), but according to the marginal condition, it should be k = min(n, b - a +1)

In the last test case, b - a +1 =1000 -1 +1=1000, and min(n, b -a +1)=1000, which matches the example.

In the first test case, b - a +1=5 -4 +1=2, min(n, b -a +1)=min(4,2)=2, which matches that k=1 and k=2 give the same profit.

In the second test case, b -a +1=9 -5 +1=5, min(n, b -a +1)=5, which matches that k=4 and k=5 give the same profit.

In the third test case, b -a +1=5 -10 +1=-4 +1=-3, so k=0.

Wait, but in the third test case, choosing k=0 is optimal.

So, perhaps k = min(n, b -a +1, b)

But since b -a +1 can be negative, we take max(0, b -a +1)

So, in general, k = min(n, b, b -a +1)

In the code, it's k = min(n, b -a), but according to the marginal condition, it should be k = min(n, b -a +1)

In the last test case, b -a +1=1000 -1 +1=1000, which is correct.

In the first test case, b -a +1=2, min(n,2)=2, which is correct.

In the second test case, b -a +1=5, min(n,5)=5, which is correct.

In the third test case, b -a +1=-4 +1=-3, so k=0, which is correct.

So, the correct formula should be k = min(n, b -a +1)

But in the code, it's k = min(n, b -a)

Which is incorrect, because it should be b -a +1

In the last test case, b -a +1=1000, min(n,1000)=1000, which gives the correct k=1000.

But in the code, it's k = min(n, b -a)=999, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all his buns, considering a promotional pricing strategy.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Promotion:**
   - Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \)).
   - The first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price: the \( i \)-th bun is sold for \( b - i + 1 \) coins.
   - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \) coins each.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If \( k = 0 \), the total profit is \( n \times a \).
   - For \( k > 0 \), the profit is the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns plus the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at price \( a \).
   - The sum of the modified prices is an arithmetic series: \( k \times (2b - k + 1) / 2 \).

3. **Optimal \( k \):**
   - To maximize profit, choose \( k = \min(n, b - a + 1) \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), choosing \( k = 0 \) is optimal.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        a = int(data[index+1])
        b = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b - a + 1)
            profit = (k * (2 * b - k + 1) // 2) + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
   - Parse the number of test cases \( t \).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is optimal.
   - Otherwise, compute the optimal \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a + 1) \).
   - Calculate the total profit using the formula for the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices.

3. **Output the Results:**
   - Print the maximum profit for each test case.

This approach ensures that Bob maximizes his profit by choosing the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified promotional prices.
