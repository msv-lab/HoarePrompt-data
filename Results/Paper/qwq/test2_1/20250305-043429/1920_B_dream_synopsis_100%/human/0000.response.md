Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this game between Alice and Bob. They have an array of numbers, and they're going to make some changes to it in two steps.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements from the array. Then, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the sum will be if both play optimally.

Okay, so let's break this down. Alice goes first, and she can remove up to k elements. She wants the sum to be as large as possible, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Because removing smaller elements will leave larger elements in the array, which is good for the sum.

But wait, Bob gets to multiply up to x elements by -1 after Alice removes elements. Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he'll try to reduce the total sum as much as possible by multiplying the largest positive elements by -1, making them negative.

So, Alice needs to consider what Bob will do after she removes elements. She needs to remove elements in such a way that even after Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1, the sum is still as large as possible.

This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum, considering that Bob will minimize it given his moves.

Let me think about the array. Suppose I sort the array in descending order. That way, the largest elements are first, and the smallest are last.

If Alice removes elements from the end (the smallest ones), then Bob will multiply the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

Alternatively, if Alice removes some larger elements, maybe that could affect what Bob can do.

Wait, no. Alice wants to keep the largest elements, so she should remove the smallest ones.

But Bob will then multiply the largest remaining elements by -1.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is for Alice to remove the smallest k elements, and then Bob will multiply the largest x remaining elements by -1.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the optimal strategy.

Let me consider an example.

Take the second test case from the example:

n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: 3,1,2,4

Sorted in descending order: 4,3,2,1

If Alice removes the smallest element (1), the array becomes 4,3,2.

Bob can multiply one element by -1 to minimize the sum.

He should multiply the largest element, which is 4, by -1, making it -4.

So the sum is -4 + 3 + 2 = 1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

Wait, so in this case, Alice chooses not to remove any elements, even though she could remove one.

Why would she do that?

Because if she removes the smallest element (1), and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, the sum is 3 + 2 -4 = 1, which is less than if she doesn't remove any and Bob multiplies 4 by -1, resulting in 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

So, in this case, Alice gets a higher sum by not removing any elements.

Interesting. So, Alice has to choose how many elements to remove, considering Bob's subsequent move.

She needs to choose the number of elements to remove that maximizes the sum after Bob's move.

So, perhaps she shouldn't always remove the smallest k elements.

She needs to consider the trade-off between removing small elements and the impact of Bob multiplying large elements by -1.

Let me think about a general approach.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Alice can choose to remove any k elements, but it's probably best to remove the smallest k elements, but I need to confirm.

After removing i elements (0 <= i <= k), the remaining array is a_{i+1} to a_n.

Bob will then multiply the largest x elements among these remaining elements by -1.

So, the sum after Bob's move would be sum_{i+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum of the largest x elements among a_{i+1 to n}.

Because multiplying by -1 changes the sign, and since they were positive, subtracting 2*sum of those x largest elements gives the correct adjustment.

So, the sum would be sum_{i+1 to n} a_i - 2 * sum of top x elements in a_{i+1 to n}.

Alice wants to maximize this sum over all choices of i from 0 to k.

So, for each possible i (number of elements removed by Alice), calculate sum_{i+1 to n} - 2 * sum of top x elements in a_{i+1 to n}, and choose the maximum among these.

But to make it efficient, we need a way to compute this without iterating through all possibilities.

Let me see.

If I sort the array in descending order, a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

Then, sum_{i+1 to n} = sum of a_{i+1} to a_n.

Sum of top x elements in a_{i+1 to n} would be sum of a_{i+1} to a_{i+x}, since they are sorted in descending order.

So, the sum after Bob's move would be:

sum_{i+1 to n} - 2 * sum_{i+1 to i+x}

Let me define s_i = sum of a_{i+1 to n}

And t_i = sum of a_{i+1 to i+x} if i+x <= n, else sum of a_{i+1 to n}

So, the sum after Bob's move is s_i - 2 * t_i

Alice wants to maximize this over i from 0 to k.

So, we can compute s_i for each i, and t_i for each i, and then compute s_i - 2*t_i, and take the maximum over i=0 to k.

Now, to make this efficient, we need to compute s_i and t_i efficiently.

Given that the array is sorted in descending order, s_i is the sum from a_{i+1} to a_n, which can be computed using prefix sums.

Similarly, t_i is the sum of the first x elements from a_{i+1 to n}, if i+x <=n, else sum of a_{i+1 to n}.

So, we can precompute prefix sums.

Let me try to formalize this.

Compute prefix sums:

p[0] = 0

p[1] = a1

p[2] = a1 + a2

...

p[n] = a1 + a2 + ... + a_n

Then, s_i = p[n] - p[i]

t_i = p[i+x] - p[i] if i+x <=n, else p[n] - p[i]

So, sum after Bob's move is s_i - 2*t_i = (p[n] - p[i]) - 2*(p[i+x] - p[i]) if i+x <=n, else (p[n] - p[i]) - 2*(p[n] - p[i]) = (p[n] - p[i]) - 2*(p[n] - p[i]) = - (p[n] - p[i])

Wait, that seems correct.

So, for each i from 0 to k:

if i + x <= n:

sum = (p[n] - p[i]) - 2*(p[i+x] - p[i]) = p[n] - p[i] - 2*p[i+x] + 2*p[i] = p[n] + p[i] - 2*p[i+x]

else:

sum = p[n] - p[i] - 2*(p[n] - p[i]) = p[n] - p[i] - 2*p[n] + 2*p[i] = -p[n] + p[i]

Alice wants to maximize this sum over i from 0 to k.

So, we need to compute these sums for i from 0 to k and choose the maximum.

This seems efficient, as we can precompute the prefix sums and then compute these expressions for each i from 0 to k in O(1) per i.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Now, let's see if this aligns with the sample input and output.

Take the second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

a = [3,1,2,4]

Sort descending: [4,3,2,1]

Compute prefix sums:

p[0] = 0

p[1] = 4

p[2] = 4+3=7

p[3] = 7+2=9

p[4] = 9+1=10

So, s_i = p[4] - p[i]

t_i = p[min(4, i+1)] - p[i]

For i=0:

sum = p[4] - p[0] - 2*(p[1] - p[0]) = 10 - 0 - 2*(4 - 0) = 10 - 8 = 2

For i=1:

sum = p[4] - p[1] - 2*(p[2] - p[1]) = 10 - 4 - 2*(7 - 4) = 6 - 6 = 0

So, Alice chooses the maximum, which is 2, matching the sample output.

Good.

Another sample:

n=1, k=1, x=1

a=[1]

Sorted: [1]

p[0]=0

p[1]=1

For i=0:

sum = p[1] - p[0] - 2*(p[1] - p[0]) = 1 - 0 - 2*(1 - 0) = 1 - 2 = -1

For i=1:

sum = p[1] - p[1] - 2*(p[1] - p[1]) = 0 - 0 = 0

Maximum is 0, matching the sample output.

Another sample:

n=6, k=6, x=3

a=[1,4,3,2,5,6]

Sorted: [6,5,4,3,2,1]

p[0]=0

p[1]=6

p[2]=6+5=11

p[3]=11+4=15

p[4]=15+3=18

p[5]=18+2=20

p[6]=20+1=21

Now, k=6, so i can be from 0 to 6.

For i=0:

sum = p[6] - p[0] - 2*(p[3] - p[0]) = 21 - 0 - 2*(15 - 0) = 21 - 30 = -9

For i=1:

sum = p[6] - p[1] - 2*(p[4] - p[1]) = 21 - 6 - 2*(18 - 6) = 15 - 24 = -9

For i=2:

sum = p[6] - p[2] - 2*(p[5] - p[2]) = 21 - 11 - 2*(20 - 11) = 10 - 18 = -8

For i=3:

sum = p[6] - p[3] - 2*(p[6] - p[3]) = 21 - 15 - 2*(21 - 15) = 6 - 12 = -6

For i=4:

sum = p[6] - p[4] - 2*(p[6] - p[4]) = 21 - 18 - 2*(21 - 18) = 3 - 6 = -3

For i=5:

sum = p[6] - p[5] - 2*(p[6] - p[5]) = 21 - 20 - 2*(21 - 20) = 1 - 2 = -1

For i=6:

sum = p[6] - p[6] - 2*(p[6] - p[6]) = 0 - 0 = 0

Maximum is 0, matching the sample output.

Good.

Another sample:

n=8, k=5, x=3

a=[5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9]

Sorted: [9,9,5,5,3,3,3,2]

p[0]=0

p[1]=9

p[2]=18

p[3]=23

p[4]=28

p[5]=31

p[6]=34

p[7]=37

p[8]=39

i from 0 to 5.

For i=0:

sum = p[8] - p[0] - 2*(p[3] - p[0]) = 39 - 0 - 2*(23 - 0) = 39 - 46 = -7

For i=1:

sum = p[8] - p[1] - 2*(p[4] - p[1]) = 39 - 9 - 2*(28 - 9) = 30 - 38 = -8

For i=2:

sum = p[8] - p[2] - 2*(p[5] - p[2]) = 39 - 18 - 2*(31 - 18) = 21 - 26 = -5

For i=3:

sum = p[8] - p[3] - 2*(p[6] - p[3]) = 39 - 23 - 2*(34 - 23) = 16 - 22 = -6

For i=4:

sum = p[8] - p[4] - 2*(p[7] - p[4]) = 39 - 28 - 2*(37 - 28) = 11 - 18 = -7

For i=5:

sum = p[8] - p[5] - 2*(p[8] - p[5]) = 39 - 31 - 2*(39 - 31) = 8 - 16 = -8

Maximum is -5, matching the sample output.

Perfect.

So, this seems to be the correct approach.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

a.sort()

a.reverse()

sum1 = sum(a)

ans = []

for i in range(k + 1):

if i == 0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])

ans.append(sums)

elif i + x - 1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]

ans.append(sums)

else:

sums = sums + a[i - 1]

ans.append(sums)

print(max(ans))



So, it's trying to implement the above logic.

It sorts the array in descending order, computes the total sum sum1.

Then, it initializes ans as an empty list.

Then, it iterates i from 0 to k inclusive.

For i=0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])

Which is sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the top x elements.

This makes sense, as per the earlier derivation.

Then, it appends this sums to ans.

Then, for i from 1 to k:

if i + x -1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2 * a[i + x -1]

else:

sums = sums + a[i-1]

And append sums to ans.

Finally, it prints the maximum value in ans.

Now, let's see if this updating of sums is correct.

From the earlier derivation, for each i, sums = s_i - 2*t_i

Where s_i = sum from a[i+1] to a[n]

And t_i = sum of top x elements in a[i+1 to n]

Given that the array is sorted in descending order, t_i = sum of a[i+1] to a[i+x], if i+x <=n, else sum of a[i+1] to a[n]

So, sums = s_i - 2*t_i = (sum from a[i+1] to a[n]) - 2*(sum from a[i+1] to a[i+x])

Which is sum from a[i+1] to a[n] - 2*(sum from a[i+1] to a[i+x])

Which can be written as sum from a[i+1] to a[i+x] (sum_t) plus sum from a[i+x+1] to a[n] (sum_s)

So, sums = sum_s + sum_t - 2*sum_t = sum_s - sum_t

Which is sum from a[i+x+1] to a[n] - sum from a[i+1] to a[i+x]

But in the code, it's trying to update sums based on the previous sums.

Let's see for i=0:

sums = sum1 - 2*sum(a[:x])

Which is sum from a[0] to a[n-1] - 2*(a[0] to a[x-1])

Which matches sums = s_0 - 2*t_0

Now, for i=1:

if 1 + x -1 < n, which is x < n, then sums = sums + a[0] - 2*a[1 + x -1] = sums + a[0] - 2*a[x]

And append to ans.

Similarly, for i=2:

sums = sums + a[1] - 2*a[2 + x -1] = sums + a[1] - 2*a[x+1]

And so on.

Is this correct?

Let me see.

From i to i+1:

sums_{i+1} = s_{i+1} - 2*t_{i+1}

s_{i+1} = s_i - a[i]

t_{i+1} = t_i - a[i+1] if i+1 < n and i+1 < x, etc.

Wait, maybe I need a better way to see this.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to maintain sums as sums_i, and updating it incrementally when moving from i to i+1.

So, from sums_i to sums_{i+1}:

sums_{i+1} = s_{i+1} - 2*t_{i+1}

s_{i+1} = s_i - a[i]

t_{i+1} = t_i - a[i+1] + a[i+x+1] if applicable.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think differently.

In the code, for i from 0 to k:

if i == 0:

sums = sum1 - 2*sum(a[:x])

elif i + x -1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2*a[i+x-1]

else:

sums = sums + a[i-1]

So, from i-1 to i:

sums_i = sums_{i-1} + a[i-1] - 2*a[i+x-1] (if i + x -1 < n)

Or sums_i = sums_{i-1} + a[i-1] (if i + x -1 >= n)

Is this correct?

Let me see.

From the expression:

sums_i = s_i - 2*t_i

s_i = s_{i-1} - a[i-1]

t_i = t_{i-1} - a[i] + a[i+x] (if i+x < n)

Wait, let's derive sums_i in terms of sums_{i-1}.

sums_i = s_i - 2*t_i = s_{i-1} - a[i-1] - 2*(t_{i-1} - a[i] + a[i+x])

Assuming i+x < n.

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute sums_i directly for each i, without trying to incrementally update sums.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and k up to 2e5, but t up to 1e4 with total n across test cases up to 2e5, it's still manageable.

But in the code, it seems they are trying to update sums incrementally to save time.

But if it's not clear whether this update is correct, perhaps it's better to compute sums_i directly for each i.

Looking back at the code:

for i in range(k + 1):

if i == 0:

sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])

ans.append(sums)

elif i + x - 1 < n:

sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]

ans.append(sums)

else:

sums = sums + a[i - 1]

ans.append(sums)

print(max(ans))

I need to verify if this update is correct.

Let me consider i from 0 to k, and see how sums is updated.

For i=0:

sums = sum1 - 2*sum(a[:x])

For i=1:

if 1 + x -1 < n, which is x < n:

sums = sums + a[0] - 2*a[1 + x -1] = sums + a[0] - 2*a[x]

Else:

sums = sums + a[0]

For i=2:

if 2 + x -1 < n, which is x+1 < n:

sums = sums + a[1] - 2*a[2 + x -1] = sums + a[1] - 2*a[x+1]

Else:

sums = sums + a[1]

And so on.

Is this correctly updating sums_i?

Let's consider sums_i = s_i - 2*t_i

s_i = s_{i-1} - a[i-1]

t_i = t_{i-1} - a[i] + a[i+x]

So, sums_i = s_{i-1} - a[i-1] - 2*(t_{i-1} - a[i] + a[i+x])

Which is sums_{i-1} - a[i-1] - 2*(-a[i] + a[i+x])

Wait, sums_{i-1} = s_{i-1} - 2*t_{i-1}

So, sums_i = s_i - 2*t_i = s_{i-1} - a[i-1] - 2*(t_{i-1} - a[i] + a[i+x])

= sums_{i-1} - a[i-1] + 2*a[i] - 2*a[i+x]

But in the code, it's sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2*a[i+x-1]

Wait, that's different.

In the code, it's sums = sums + a[i-1] - 2*a[i+x-1]

Which corresponds to sums_i = sums_{i-1} + a[i-1] - 2*a[i+x-1]

But from my derivation, it should be sums_i = sums_{i-1} - a[i-1] + 2*a[i] - 2*a[i+x]

Which is different.

So, it seems the code has an error in the way it's updating sums.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
