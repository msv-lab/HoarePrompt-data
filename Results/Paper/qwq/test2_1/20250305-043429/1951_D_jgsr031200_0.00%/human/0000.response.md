Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel that's an integer between 1 and 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order, buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins, and moves on to the next stall.

My task is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k, where n is the number of coins Alice has and k is the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy. Both n and k can be as large as 10^18, which means I have to be careful with how I handle large numbers.

Looking at the example provided:

In the first test case:

n = 7, k = 3

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Explanation:

At the first stall with price 2, Alice buys 3 jewels (since 7 // 2 = 3), and is left with 1 coin. Since 1 is less than any of the other stall prices, she can't buy any more jewels. So, she buys exactly 3 jewels.

In the third test case:

n = 255, k = 8

Output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Explanation:

Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, spending 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 coins respectively, totaling 255 coins and buying exactly 8 jewels.

From these examples, it seems that one strategy is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, starting from a high price down to 1, in such a way that Alice buys the desired number of jewels.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems like there's a function func_1(n, k) that attempts to solve this problem. Let's analyze what it's doing.

In func_1:

1. If n == k, it means Alice can buy k jewels that each cost 1 coin, so it prints "YES" and the price list [1].

2. If n < k, it's impossible because Alice doesn't have enough coins to buy k jewels, each costing at least 1 coin, so it prints "NO".

3. Otherwise, it sets up two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1]. Then, it calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls.

Let me see if this makes sense.

Take the first test case: n=7, k=3.

According to this logic:

- Set prices as [7-3+1=5, 1]

So, prices = [5, 1]

- Alice buys 7//5=1 jewel from the first stall, spending 5 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Then, buys 2//1=2 jewels from the second stall, spending 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels bought: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

Seems correct for this case.

Another example: n=255, k=8.

According to this logic:

- Set prices as [255-8+1=248, 1]

- Alice buys 255//248=1 jewel, spending 248 coins, left with 7 coins.

- Then, buys 7//1=7 jewels from the second stall, spending 7 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 7 = 8, which matches k.

Good.

But in the example output, they used 8 stalls with prices [128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1], which also correctly results in buying 1 jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

So, both approaches work for this case.

But the problem allows up to 60 stalls, so using just 2 stalls is acceptable as long as it's within the limit.

Now, is this approach always correct?

Let me think of another test case.

Suppose n=10, k=4.

According to the function:

- prices = [10-4+1=7, 1]

- Alice buys 10//7=1 jewel, spends 7 coins, left with 3 coins.

- Then, buys 3//1=3 jewels, spends 3 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 3 = 4, which matches k.

Good.

Another test case: n=5, k=2.

- prices = [5-2+1=4, 1]

- Alice buys 5//4=1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Then, buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k.

Good.

What if n=4, k=1.

- prices = [4-1+1=4, 1]

- Alice buys 4//4=1 jewel, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't try to buy from the second stall since she has no coins left.

- Total jewels: 1, which matches k.

Good.

What if n=1, k=1.

- Directly matches n == k, so output "YES" with price [1].

Good.

What if n=1, k=2.

- n < k, so "NO".

Correct, because she can't buy more jewels than the coins she has if each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

Another test case: n=10, k=5.

- prices = [10-5+1=6,1]

- Alice buys 10//6=1 jewel, spends 6 coins, left with 4 coins.

- Then buys 4//1=4 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k.

Good.

Seems like this approach works for these cases.

But is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me think about n=1, k=1. It's handled correctly.

n=2, k=1.

- prices = [2-1+1=2,1]

- Alice buys 2//2=1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels: 1, which matches k.

Good.

n=3, k=2.

- prices = [3-2+1=2,1]

- Alice buys 3//2=1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Then buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches k.

Good.

n=4, k=3.

- prices = [4-3+1=2,1]

- Alice buys 4//2=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=3.

Wait, this is not matching k.

So, according to the function, it would calculate h=2 (from the two stalls), which is less than k=3, so it would print "NO".

But is this correct?

Wait, actually, in this case, is it possible to set up stalls to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's see.

If Bob sets up one stall with price 1, Alice would buy 4 jewels, which is more than k=3.

If he sets up two stalls, say [2,1]:

- Buys 2//2=1 jewel, spends 2 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Then buys 2//1=2 jewels, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

So, in this case, the function would incorrectly say "NO", but actually, it's possible.

Hmm, so there's a flaw in the function's logic.

Let me see what's happening.

The function calculates h, which is the total jewels bought from the two stalls with prices [n - k + 1, 1].

If h < k, it prints "NO", else "YES".

But in the n=4, k=3 case, h=1 (from first stall) + 2 (from second stall) = 3, which equals k, so it should say "YES".

But according to the function, it's checking if h < k, which is not the case here, so it should print "YES".

Wait, but in the function, it's checking if h < k, and if so, print "NO", else print "YES".

So, in this case, h=3 >= k=3, so it should print "YES".

But in my earlier analysis, I thought h=2, which was incorrect.

Wait, let's recalculate h in the function.

The function calculates h by:

h = 0

for i in costs:

curr = n // i

h += curr

n -= i * curr

So, for n=4, k=3:

costs = [4 - 3 + 1 = 2, 1]

First stall: i=2

curr = 4 // 2 = 2

h += 2 → h=2

n -= 2 * 2 → n=0

Second stall: i=1

curr = 0 // 1 = 0

h += 0 → h=2

n -= 1 * 0 → n=0

So, h=2 < k=3, so it would print "NO".

But actually, as I calculated earlier, Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall and 0 from the second, totaling 2 jewels, which is less than k=3.

But wait, earlier I thought she would buy 2 from the first stall and then 2 from the second, but with n=4, after buying from the first stall, she has n=0, so she can't buy from the second stall.

So, h=2 < k=3, so "NO".

But is there another way to set up the stalls to make her buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins?

Let's try setting up three stalls: [1,1,1]

- Alice buys 4//1=4 jewels from the first stall, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second and third stalls.

- Total jewels: 4, which is more than k=3.

Not good.

Or [2,1,1]

- Buys 4//2=2 jewels from first stall, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second and third stalls.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=3.

Not good.

Or [1,2,1]

- Buys 4//1=4 jewels from first stall, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second and third stalls.

- Total jewels: 4, which is more than k=3.

Not good.

Or [3,1]

- Buys 4//3=1 jewel from first stall, spends 3 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Buys 1//1=1 jewel from second stall, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 1 = 2, which is less than k=3.

Not good.

Or [2,2]

- Buys 4//2=2 jewels from first stall, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=3.

Not good.

Seems like there's no way to make Alice buy exactly 3 jewels with 4 coins using at most 60 stalls.

So, in this case, "NO" is the correct answer, and the function correctly identifies it.

Wait, but earlier I thought that [2,1] would make her buy 1 + 2 = 3 jewels, but actually, with n=4, she buys 2 from the first stall and 0 from the second, totaling 2 jewels.

So, my initial mistake was in calculating the remaining coins after the first stall.

So, the function is correct in this case.

Another test case: n=5, k=3.

- prices = [5-3+1=3,1]

- Alice buys 5//3=1 jewel, spends 3 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Then buys 2//1=2 jewels, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 2 = 3, which matches k.

So, h=1 + 2 = 3 >= k=3, so it should print "YES".

Correct.

Another test case: n=6, k=4.

- prices = [6-4+1=3,1]

- Alice buys 6//3=2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=4.

So, h=2 < 4, so it should print "NO".

But is there another way to set up stalls to make her buy exactly 4 jewels?

Let's try [2,1]:

- Buys 6//2=3 jewels from first stall, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels: 3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Or [1,1,1]:

- Buys 6//1=6 jewels from first stall, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second and third stalls.

- Total jewels: 6, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Or [3,1,1]:

- Buys 6//3=2 jewels from first stall, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second and third stalls.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Seems like it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

So, "NO" is the correct answer.

Hence, the function seems to be working correctly for these cases.

Let's think about another scenario.

n=10, k=5.

- prices = [10-5+1=6,1]

- Alice buys 10//6=1 jewel, spends 6 coins, left with 4 coins.

- Then buys 4//1=4 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels: 1 + 4 = 5, which matches k.

So, h=1 + 4 =5 >=k=5, so "YES".

Correct.

Another case: n=10, k=6.

- prices = [10-6+1=5,1]

- Alice buys 10//5=2 jewels, spends 10 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels: 2, which is less than k=6.

So, h=2 <6, "NO".

Is there another way to set up stalls to make her buy exactly 6 jewels?

Let's try [2,1]:

- Buys 10//2=5 jewels from first stall, spends 10 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels:5, which is less than 6.

Not good.

Or [1,1,1]:

- Buys 10//1=10 jewels from first stall, spends 10 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second and third stalls.

- Total jewels:10, which is more than 6.

Not good.

Seems like it's impossible to make her buy exactly 6 jewels with 10 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

So far, the function seems to be working correctly for these test cases.

Let me think about a case where n is much larger than k.

Say n=1000000000000000000, k=1.

- prices = [1000000000000000000 -1 +1=1000000000000000000,1]

- Alice buys 1000000000000000000//1000000000000000000=1 jewel, spends 1000000000000000000 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels:1, which matches k.

So, h=1 >=k=1, "YES".

Correct.

Another case: n=1000000000000000000, k=2.

- prices = [1000000000000000000 -2 +1=999999999999999999,1]

- Alice buys 1000000000000000000//999999999999999999=1 jewel, spends 999999999999999999 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Then buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:1 +1=2, which matches k.

So, h=1 +1=2 >=k=2, "YES".

Correct.

Seems like the function handles large numbers correctly.

Now, is there any case where h >=k, but actually, it's impossible to buy exactly k jewels?

I need to think about whether the function might allow h to be greater than k, which wouldn't satisfy the condition of buying exactly k jewels.

Wait, in the function, it checks if h <k, then "NO", else "YES".

But if h >k, does that mean it's possible to buy exactly k jewels?

In the earlier case where n=10, k=5, h=5, which matches k.

In n=7, k=3, h=3, matches k.

In n=255, k=8, h=8, matches k.

In n=4, k=3, h=2 <3, "NO".

In n=5, k=3, h=3, matches k.

In n=6, k=4, h=2 <4, "NO".

In n=10, k=6, h=2 <6, "NO".

In n=1, k=1, h=1, matches k.

In n=2, k=1, h=1, matches k.

In n=3, k=2, h=2, matches k.

In n=4, k=1, h=1, matches k.

Seems like in all cases where h >=k, it's possible to buy exactly k jewels using the two-stall approach.

But is there a case where h >=k, but actually, it's impossible to buy exactly k jewels?

I need to think carefully.

Wait, suppose n=5, k=4.

- prices = [5-4+1=2,1]

- Alice buys 5//2=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Then buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:2 +1=3, which is less than k=4.

Wait, h=3 <4, so "NO".

But is there another way to set up stalls to make her buy exactly 4 jewels?

Let's try [1,1,1,1,1]:

- Alice buys 5//1=5 jewels from the first stall, spends 5 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the other stalls.

- Total jewels:5, which is more than 4.

Not good.

Or [2,1,1]:

- Buys 5//2=2 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 1 coin.

- Buys 1//1=1 jewel, spends 1 coin, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:2 +1=3, which is less than 4.

Not good.

Seems like it's impossible to make her buy exactly 4 jewels with 5 coins.

Hence, "NO" is correct.

Another case: n=10, k=5.

- prices = [10-5+1=6,1]

- Alice buys 10//6=1 jewel, spends 6 coins, left with 4 coins.

- Then buys 4//1=4 jewels, spends 4 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:1 +4=5, which matches k.

So, h=5 >=k=5, "YES".

Correct.

Another case: n=10, k=4.

- prices = [10-4+1=7,1]

- Alice buys 10//7=1 jewel, spends 7 coins, left with 3 coins.

- Then buys 3//1=3 jewels, spends 3 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:1 +3=4, which matches k.

So, h=4 >=k=4, "YES".

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if n=10, k=5, and I set up stalls with prices [2,3]:

- Alice buys 10//2=5 jewels from first stall, spends 10 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Doesn't buy from the second stall.

- Total jewels:5, which matches k.

Alternatively, with [5,1], as in the function's approach.

So, the function chooses [n -k +1,1], which in this case is [6,1], leading to h=1 +4=5, which matches k.

But is there a case where h >=k, but it's impossible to buy exactly k jewels?

I'm having trouble finding such a case.

Let me consider n=10, k=7.

- prices = [10-7+1=4,1]

- Alice buys 10//4=2 jewels, spends 8 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Then buys 2//1=2 jewels, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:2 +2=4, which is less than k=7.

So, h=4 <7, "NO".

Indeed, it's impossible to make Alice buy 7 jewels with 10 coins.

Another case: n=10, k=3.

- prices = [10-3+1=8,1]

- Alice buys 10//8=1 jewel, spends 8 coins, left with 2 coins.

- Then buys 2//1=2 jewels, spends 2 coins, left with 0 coins.

- Total jewels:1 +2=3, which matches k.

So, h=3 >=k=3, "YES".

Correct.

Seems like the function is working correctly for these cases.

Now, is there a case where h >=k, but actually, it's impossible to buy exactly k jewels?

I can't think of any right now. Maybe the function is correct.

But let's consider the general case.

Suppose we set up two stalls with prices p1 = n - k +1 and p2 =1.

Then, Alice buys floor(n/p1) jewels from the first stall, spends floor(n/p1)*p1 coins, and then buys floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2) jewels from the second stall.

Total jewels bought: floor(n/p1) + floor((n - floor(n/p1)*p1)/p2)

We need this to be equal to k.

Given that p1 = n - k +1 and p2 =1, let's see what happens.

Let m = floor(n/p1)

Then, the amount spent on the first stall is m * p1

Remaining coins: n - m * p1

Jewels bought from the second stall: floor((n - m * p1)/p2) = n - m * p1

Total jewels: m + (n - m * p1)

We need m + (n - m * p1) = k

Let's plug in p1 = n - k +1:

m + n - m*(n - k +1) = k

Let's solve for m:

m + n - m*n + m*k - m = k

Simplify:

n - m*(n - k +1) = k - m

Wait, this seems messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the maximum and minimum number of jewels Alice can buy.

The minimum number of jewels she can buy is floor(n / p1), assuming p1 is the highest possible price.

The maximum number of jewels she can buy is n (if p1=1).

Given that, by setting p1 = n - k +1 and p2=1, we're trying to control the number of jewels bought.

But perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider the general approach.

Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall in sequence until she runs out of coins.

To make her buy exactly k jewels, we need to set up stalls in such a way that the total jewels bought from all stalls is exactly k.

One way to ensure this is to set up stalls with decreasing prices, so that she buys a certain number of jewels from each stall.

But the function is using only two stalls, which seems sufficient for the cases I've checked.

Is there a mathematical proof for this approach?

Let me consider that.

Given n coins and k jewels to buy, we set p1 = n - k +1 and p2=1.

Then, jewels bought from first stall: m = floor(n / p1)

Jewels bought from second stall: floor((n - m * p1) / p2)

Total jewels: m + floor(n - m * p1)

We need m + (n - m * p1) = k

Which simplifies to n - (m * p1 - m) = k

But p1 = n - k +1

Substituting:

n - (m*(n - k +1) - m) = k

Simplify inside the parentheses:

m*(n - k +1) - m = m*n - m*k + m - m = m*n - m*k

So, n - (m*n - m*k) = k

Which is n - m*n + m*k = k

Factor n:

n*(1 - m) + m*k = k

This seems complicated. Maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the residual coins after buying from the first stall.

Given p1 = n - k +1, then m = floor(n / p1)

Since p1 = n - k +1, m = floor(n / (n - k +1))

Now, n divided by (n - k +1):

If k =1, p1 = n -1 +1 = n, so m =1

If k =n, p1 = n -n +1=1, so m =n

In general, m = floor(n / (n - k +1))

Let s = n - k +1

Then, m = floor(n / s)

Then, remaining coins: n - m*s

Then, jewels bought from second stall: floor((n - m*s)/1) = n - m*s

Total jewels: m + (n - m*s) = m + n - m*s = n - m*(s -1)

But s = n - k +1

So, n - m*(n - k +1 -1) = n - m*(n - k)

Simplify:

n - m*(n - k) = n - m*n + m*k = n*(1 - m) + m*k

Set this equal to k:

n*(1 - m) + m*k = k

Then, n*(1 - m) = k - m*k

Factor k:

n*(1 - m) = k*(1 - m)

Assuming m !=1:

n = k

But m = floor(n / s), s = n - k +1

If m =1, then n - s +1 <= n < s

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should think differently.

Let me consider that with two stalls, p1 and p2, we can control the number of jewels bought.

If p1 is high, m is low, and the remaining coins are used to buy from p2.

By choosing p1 = n - k +1, we're trying to make m + (n - m*p1) = k

Let me solve for p1:

Let p1 be a variable.

Then, m = floor(n / p1)

Jewels from second stall: n - m*p1

Total jewels: m + n - m*p1 = n - m*(p1 -1)

Set this equal to k:

n - m*(p1 -1) = k

Which implies m*(p1 -1) = n - k

So, m = (n - k) / (p1 -1)

But m = floor(n / p1)

So, floor(n / p1) = (n - k)/(p1 -1)

This seems like an equation to solve for p1.

But it's tricky.

Instead, perhaps I should accept that the function seems to work for the test cases I've tried, and conclude that it's correct.

But I need to be sure.

Let me consider edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1, k=1

- prices = [1,1]

- m =1//1=1, spends 1, left with 0

- Total jewels:1, matches k

- h=1 >=
