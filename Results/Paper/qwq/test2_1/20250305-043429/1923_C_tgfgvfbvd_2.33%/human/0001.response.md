Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, which is defined based on certain conditions involving another array B. The problem gives me an array C of length N, and I have to answer Q queries about whether a subarray of C is "good" or not.

First, I need to understand what makes an array "good." According to the description, an array A is good if there exists another array B of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in A is equal to the sum of elements in B.

2. For every index i, A[i] is not equal to B[i].

3. All elements in B are positive integers.

So, for a given subarray of C, from index L to R, I need to check if there exists an array B satisfying these three conditions.

Let me try to rephrase this in simpler terms. The sum of A and B must be equal, but their elements must all be different, and B must consist of positive integers only.

I need to find out, for each query, whether such a B exists for the specified subarray.

Let me think about what this means.

First, since the sums must be equal, and A and B must be different at every position, with B being positive, there must be some relationship between the elements of A and B.

Let me consider small examples to get a better understanding.

Suppose A has only one element. Say A = [3]. Then, I need B to have one element, say B = [x], such that:

- 3 = x (sum condition)

- 3 != x (second condition)

- x > 0 (third condition)

This is impossible because if 3 = x, then 3 != x cannot hold simultaneously. So, for single-element arrays, it's impossible to find such a B. Hence, any subarray of length 1 is not good.

Wait, but the problem says that B must be an integer array, but it doesn't specify that B must consist of integers from the same set as A. So, B can have any positive integers, as long as the conditions are satisfied.

But in the single-element case, it's impossible because sum equality and element inequality can't be satisfied at the same time.

So, for subarrays of length 1, the answer should always be "NO."

Now, let's consider a subarray of length 2. Say A = [1, 2].

I need to find B = [b1, b2] such that:

- 1 + 2 = b1 + b2

- 1 != b1, 2 != b2

- b1 > 0, b2 > 0

So, 3 = b1 + b2, with b1 != 1 and b2 != 2.

Possible options:

- b1 = 2, b2 = 1. This satisfies both sum and element inequality.

- b1 = 3, b2 = 0. But b2 must be positive, so this is invalid.

- b1 = 1, b2 = 2. But b1 == 1, which violates the second condition.

- b1 = 0, b2 = 3. Again, b1 is not positive.

So, the only valid option is b1 = 2, b2 = 1.

Hence, for subarrays of length 2, if the two elements are different, there might be a way to choose B such that it satisfies the conditions.

Wait, but in this case, A = [1, 2], B = [2, 1], which works.

What if A = [2, 2]? Then, sum is 4.

Possible B:

- b1 = 1, b2 = 3

- b1 = 3, b2 = 1

- b1 = 1, b2 = 3: 1 != 2, 3 != 2, both positive.

So, it works.

Wait, but b1 = 1, b2 = 3: 1 != 2, 3 != 2, sum is 4.

So, even if A has duplicate elements, as long as B can be arranged such that no B[i] equals A[i], and sum is equal, it's possible.

So, for subarrays of length 2, it seems possible in many cases.

Now, let's consider longer subarrays.

Suppose A = [1, 2, 1]. Sum is 4.

Possible B:

- [2, 1, 1]: sum is 4, but B[1] == A[1] ==1, which violates the condition.

- [2, 2, 0]: invalid, B[3] is not positive.

- [3, 1, 0]: invalid.

- [1, 1, 2]: B[1] == A[1], invalid.

- [2, 1, 1]: already checked, invalid.

- [0, 2, 2]: invalid.

- [1, 0, 3]: invalid.

- [2, 0, 2]: invalid.

- [3, 2, -1]: invalid.

Hmm, none of these seem to work.

Wait, but according to the example output, for the subarray from index 1 to 3, which is [1,2,1], the answer is "NO". But in the example output, it's "YES" for the entire array from 1 to 5, which is [1,2,1,4,5], sum is 13.

Possible B for [1,2,1,4,5]:

Let's try B = [2,1,2,3,5]: sum is 13, and all B[i] != A[i], and all positive.

Wait, A = [1,2,1,4,5], B = [2,1,2,3,5]:

- Sum: 2+1+2+3+5 = 13, same as A.

- All B[i] != A[i]:

  - 2 !=1

  -1 !=2

  -2 !=1

  -3 !=4

  -5 !=5 → no, 5 ==5, invalid.

So, this B is invalid.

Another try: B = [2,1,2,4,4]: sum is 13, and check:

- 2 !=1

-1 !=2

-2 !=1

-4 !=4 → invalid

-4 !=5

So, B[4] =4 equals A[4]=4, invalid.

Another try: B = [2,1,2,5,3]: sum is 13.

Check:

- 2 !=1

-1 !=2

-2 !=1

-5 !=4

-3 !=5 → all different.

So, this works.

Hence, for subarrays longer than 2, it seems possible under certain conditions.

From these observations, it seems that for subarrays of length 1, it's impossible. For longer subarrays, it depends.

I need to find a general condition to determine if a subarray is good or not.

Let me think about the minimal requirements.

Given that B must have positive integers, and sum(B) = sum(A), and B[i] != A[i] for all i.

So, for each A[i], B[i] must be a positive integer not equal to A[i].

In particular, B[i] can be A[i] + k for some k !=0, but it has to be positive.

Wait, but B[i] must be positive and not equal to A[i].

So, for each A[i], B[i] can be any positive integer except A[i].

The sum of all B[i] must equal the sum of all A[i].

So, the problem reduces to checking if it's possible to adjust each A[i] to some B[i] != A[i], positive, such that the total sum remains the same.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible sums for B.

Since B[i] >0 and B[i] != A[i], the minimal B[i] is max(1, A[i]+1) if A[i] ==1, else 1.

Wait, no. B[i] can be any positive integer except A[i].

So, if A[i] ==1, B[i] can be any positive integer except 1. So, B[i] >=2.

If A[i] >1, B[i] can be 1 or any integer except A[i].

So, the minimal possible B[i] is:

- If A[i] ==1, then B[i] >=2

- If A[i] >1, then B[i] >=1, but B[i] != A[i]

So, in general, B[i] >=1, and B[i] != A[i].

Now, for the sum to remain the same, sum(B) = sum(A), but each B[i] is at least 1, and possibly higher than A[i] or lower, as long as B[i] != A[i].

Wait, but B[i] cannot be equal to A[i].

So, for each A[i], B[i] can be any positive integer except A[i].

I need to ensure that the sum doesn't change, i.e., sum(B) = sum(A).

Let me think about the minimal possible sum for B.

For each A[i], the minimal B[i] is:

- If A[i] ==1, B[i] >=2

- If A[i] >1, B[i] >=1 (as long as B[i] != A[i])

Wait, but if A[i] >1, B[i] can be 1, which is less than A[i], as long as A[i] !=1.

Wait, no, if A[i] >1, B[i] can be 1 (if A[i] !=1, which it isn't since A[i] >1), or any other positive integer except A[i].

So, the minimal B[i] is 1, as long as A[i] !=1.

Wait, but if A[i] ==1, then B[i] >=2.

Hence, the minimal B[i] is:

- If A[i] ==1, then B[i] >=2

- If A[i] >1, then B[i] >=1

So, the minimal sum for B is sum of these minimal B[i].

Let me denote minimal_B_sum as sum over i of minimal_B[i], where minimal_B[i] is defined as above.

Similarly, the maximal sum for B is unbounded, since B[i] can be arbitrarily large.

Now, for sum(B) to equal sum(A), we need sum(B) = sum(A).

But sum(B) >= minimal_B_sum.

Hence, if sum(A) >= minimal_B_sum, then it's possible to choose B[i] such that sum(B) = sum(A).

Wait, but we also have to ensure that B[i] != A[i] for all i.

Is this condition sufficient?

Let me see.

Suppose sum(A) >= minimal_B_sum.

Does that guarantee that there exists a B where sum(B) = sum(A), B[i] != A[i], and B[i] >0 for all i?

Wait, maybe not necessarily.

Let me consider a counterexample.

Suppose A = [1,1], sum(A) =2.

Minimal_B_sum =2 +2=4.

But sum(A) =2 <4, which is less than minimal_B_sum, so according to the earlier condition, it should be impossible, which aligns with the earlier thought that for sum(A) < minimal_B_sum, it's impossible.

But in this case, sum(A) =2 <4, so it's impossible, which matches the earlier understanding that for subarrays of length 1, it's impossible, and for length 2, if sum(A) is less than the minimal possible sum for B, it's impossible.

But in the example, for subarray [1,2,1], sum is 4, and according to earlier calculation, it's possible to have B=[2,1,2], sum=5, which is more than 4, but I need sum(B)=sum(A).

Wait, earlier I tried B=[2,1,2], sum=5, which is more than 4, but I need sum(B)=4.

Is there a B for [1,2,1] with sum=4, B[i]!=A[i], and B[i]>0?

Let's see:

A=[1,2,1]

Possible B:

- B=[2,1,1]: sum=4, but B[3]=1==A[3]=1, invalid.

- B=[2,1,2]: sum=5, which is more.

- B=[2,0,2]: invalid, B[2]=0.

- B=[1,1,2]: B[1]=1==A[1]=1, invalid.

- B=[3,1,0]: invalid.

- B=[1,2,1]: invalid, same as A.

- B=[2,2,0]: invalid.

- B=[3,2,-1]: invalid.

Wait, none of these work. So, it seems impossible for [1,2,1], sum=4.

But according to the example, for subarray [1,2,1], the answer is "YES", but in my analysis, it seems impossible.

Wait, maybe I missed a possible B.

Let me check again.

A=[1,2,1], sum=4.

Possible B:

- B=[2,1,1]: invalid, B[3]=1==A[3]=1

- B=[2,1,2]: sum=5, which is more.

- B=[1,1,2]: B[1]=1==A[1]=1, invalid

- B=[3,1,0]: invalid

- B=[3,2,1-1]: invalid

Wait, perhaps there is no such B for [1,2,1].

But according to the example, the output for query 3 is "YES".

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the example, for the subarray from index 3 to 4, which is [1,4], sum=5.

Possible B=[2,3], sum=5, B[i]!=A[i], and positive.

So, "YES".

For subarray from index 1 to 3, which is [1,2,1], sum=4.

Possible B=[2,1,2], sum=5, which is more.

[2,1,1], sum=4, but B[3]=1==A[3]=1, invalid.

[3,1,1], sum=5, invalid.

[2,2,1], sum=5, invalid.

[1,3,1], sum=5, invalid.

[1,2,2], B[1]=1==A[1]=1, invalid.

[2,3,1], sum=6, invalid.

Seems like no valid B exists for [1,2,1], but the example output says "YES".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe B=[2,1,1] is invalid, but is there another B?

Wait, perhaps B=[2,1,1] is the only possible sum=4, but it's invalid.

So, according to my analysis, it should be "NO", but the example output says "YES".

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider the condition.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"Each element of this array is greater than 0."

So, A and C consist of positive integers.

We need to find B consisting of positive integers, B[i] != A[i], and sum(B) = sum(A).

In the example, for subarray [1,2,1], sum=4.

But according to the example output, it's "YES", but in my analysis, it seems "NO".

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, for subarray from 1 to 5, which is [1,2,1,4,5], sum=13.

Possible B=[2,1,2,3,5], sum=13, B[i]!=A[i], positive.

Hence, "YES".

For subarray from 4 to 4, which is [4], sum=4.

Possible B=[5], sum=5, which is more.

Or B=[3], sum=3, which is less.

But sum must be equal to 4, and B[i] !=4.

So, no valid B, hence "NO".

For subarray from 3 to 4, which is [1,4], sum=5.

Possible B=[2,3], sum=5, B[i]!=A[i], positive.

Hence, "YES".

For subarray from 1 to 3, which is [1,2,1], sum=4.

As per earlier analysis, it seems no valid B exists, but the example output says "YES".

Wait, perhaps I missed a possible B.

Let me try again.

A=[1,2,1], sum=4.

Possible B:

- [2,1,1]: invalid, B[3]=1==A[3]=1

- [2,1,2]: sum=5, which is more.

- [1,1,2]: B[1]=1==A[1]=1, invalid

- [3,1,1]: sum=5, invalid

- [2,2,1]: sum=5, invalid

- [1,3,1]: sum=5, invalid

- [2,3,1]: sum=6, invalid

- [3,2,1]: sum=6, invalid

- [4,1,1]: invalid

Seems like no valid B exists for [1,2,1], sum=4, with B[i]!=A[i] and B[i]>0.

But according to the example, it's "YES".

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps there's a way to adjust the B[i] such that the sum remains the same.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the sum of adjustments is zero.

Each B[i] can be A[i] + delta_i, where delta_i !=0, and B[i] >0.

So, sum(delta_i) =0.

But also, B[i] !=A[i], which implies delta_i !=0.

And B[i] >0, so A[i] + delta_i >0.

Given that A[i] >0, and delta_i !=0, we need to ensure that A[i] + delta_i >0.

In other words, delta_i > -A[i].

So, for each i, delta_i can be any integer except 0, and delta_i > -A[i].

Moreover, sum(delta_i) =0.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set of integers delta_i, where delta_i !=0, delta_i > -A[i], and sum(delta_i) =0.

This seems similar to assigning adjustments to each A[i] such that the total adjustment is zero.

In the case of [1,2,1], let's see:

Possible delta_i:

For A[1]=1, delta_1 > -1, so delta_1 >=0, but delta_1 !=0, so delta_1 >=1.

For A[2]=2, delta_2 > -2, so delta_2 >= -1, but delta_2 !=0, so delta_2 >=1 or <=-1.

For A[3]=1, delta_3 >=1.

So, delta_1 >=1, delta_2 >=1 or <=-1, delta_3 >=1.

And delta_1 + delta_2 + delta_3 =0.

Wait, but all deltas are at least 1, which would make sum >=3, which is greater than 0.

Hence, impossible.

This aligns with my earlier conclusion that for [1,2,1], it's impossible to find such B.

But according to the example, it's "YES", so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps B[i] can be less than A[i], as long as B[i] >0 and B[i] !=A[i].

Wait, for A[i]=2, B[i] can be 1 or any other positive integer except 2.

Similarly, for A[i]=1, B[i] >=2.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, for A=[1,2,1], it seems impossible.

But according to the example, it's "YES".

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Wait, in the example, for subarray [1,2,1], which is from index 1 to 3, the output is "YES".

But according to my analysis, it should be "NO".

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me check again.

A=[1,2,1], sum=4.

Possible B:

- B=[2,1,1]: invalid, B[3]=1==A[3]=1

- B=[2,1,2]: sum=5, which is more.

- B=[2,3,1-1]: invalid

Wait, perhaps B=[2,1,1] is the only possible combination that sums to 4, but it's invalid.

Hence, it should be "NO", but the example says "YES".

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Wait, in the example, for subarray from 3 to 4, which is [1,4], sum=5, output "YES".

For subarray from 1 to 3, which is [1,2,1], sum=4, output "YES".

Wait, perhaps in the example, it's "YES" for [1,2,1], but according to my analysis, it should be "NO".

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the general condition.

I need to find if sum(A[L..R]) >= minimal_B_sum for the subarray A[L..R].

Where minimal_B_sum is sum over i from L to R of minimal_B[i], where minimal_B[i] is 2 if A[i]=1, else 1.

So, minimal_B_sum = sum over i from L to R of (2 if A[i]==1 else 1)

Then, if sum(A[L..R]) >= minimal_B_sum, and some additional conditions are met, then it's "YES", else "NO".

But in the earlier case, for A=[1,2,1], sum=4, minimal_B_sum=2+1+2=5.

Since 4 <5, it should be "NO", but the example says "YES".

Wait, perhaps I have the minimal_B_sum wrong.

Wait, perhaps there's another condition.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray of length M.

I need to ensure that sum(B) = sum(A), with B[i] !=A[i], and B[i]>0.

If M ==1, it's impossible, as we saw earlier.

If M ==2, it's possible if A[1] !=A[2], by swapping them.

If A[1] ==A[2], then it's impossible, because B[1] !=A[1], B[2] !=A[2], and sum(B) == sum(A).

Wait, if A=[1,1], sum=2, minimal_B_sum=2+2=4, which is greater than 2, so impossible.

Hence, for subarrays with duplicate elements, it might be impossible.

Wait, but in the example, [1,2,1] has duplicates, and the output is "YES".

Wait, but in [1,2,1], A[1]=1, A[2]=2, A[3]=1.

So, there are duplicates, but perhaps since M>2, it's possible.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests it's impossible for [1,2,1].

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the sum of minimal_B_sum is 5, which is greater than sum(A)=4, hence "NO".

But the example says "YES", so perhaps my understanding of minimal_B_sum is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the condition is different.

Let me look for another approach.

Suppose I fix B[i] !=A[i], and B[i]>0.

Then, I need sum(B) = sum(A).

This is equivalent to finding B[i] = A[i] + delta_i, where delta_i !=0, B[i]>0.

So, B[i] = A[i] + delta_i, with delta_i !=0, and A[i] + delta_i >0.

Hence, delta_i > -A[i], and delta_i !=0.

And sum(delta_i) =0.

So, I need to assign delta_i to each A[i], such that:

- delta_i > -A[i]

- delta_i !=0

- sum(delta_i) =0

This seems like a system of inequalities with the sum constraint.

For M variables (delta_i), with each delta_i > -A[i], delta_i !=0, and sum(delta_i)=0.

I need to check if such assignments exist.

This seems a bit complex.

Is there a simpler way to look at this?

Let me consider that for each A[i], B[i] can be any positive integer except A[i].

I need sum(B) = sum(A).

Let me consider that for each A[i], I can choose B[i] to be A[i] + delta_i, where delta_i !=0, and A[i] + delta_i >0.

Then, sum(delta_i) =0.

I need to assign delta_i to each A[i], such that:

- delta_i !=0

- delta_i > -A[i]

- sum(delta_i) =0

This seems similar to distributing deltas such that their sum is zero, with constraints on each delta.

Is there a general condition under which this is possible?

Let me consider that if the minimal possible sum for B is less than or equal to sum(A), and some other conditions are met, then it's possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that sum(A) >= minimal_B_sum, and that sum(A) - minimal_B_sum can be distributed among the elements in a way that satisfies the constraints.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that if the subarray has at least two elements, and the sum(A) is at least the minimal_B_sum, then it's possible.

Wait, but in the earlier case, for A=[1,2,1], sum(A)=4, minimal_B_sum=5, which is greater, but according to the example, it's "YES".

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in calculating minimal_B_sum.

Wait, for A=[1,2,1], minimal_B_sum =2 (for A[1]=1) +1 (for A[2]=2) +2 (for A[3]=1) =5, which is greater than sum(A)=4.

But the example says "YES", which contradicts my conclusion.

Hence, my understanding must be wrong.

Perhaps the condition is different.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a subarray of length M.

If M >=2, and sum(A) >= minimal_B_sum, then it's "YES", else "NO".

But in the earlier case, sum(A)=4 < minimal_B_sum=5, but the example says "YES", so this can't be the case.

Wait, maybe there's a way to adjust the deltas such that sum(delta_i)=0, even if sum(A) < minimal_B_sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for some elements, B[i] can be less than A[i], as long as for others, B[i] is greater, to compensate.

But in the case of [1,
