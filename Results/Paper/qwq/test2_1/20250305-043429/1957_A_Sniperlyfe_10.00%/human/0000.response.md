Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks with different lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with the condition that each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon. Also, sticks can't be broken.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all angles equal. So, for each polygon, all its sides are the same length. That means, to form a polygon, I need at least as many sticks of the same length as the number of sides of that polygon.

For example, to form a triangle, I need three sticks of the same length. For a square, I need four sticks of the same length, and so on for higher-sided polygons.

Looking at the sample input and output:

- In the first test case, there's only one stick. You can't form any polygon with just one stick, so the output is 0.

- In the second test case, there are two sticks of the same length. Two sticks can't form any polygon because the smallest polygon is a triangle, which requires three sides. So, again, output is 0.

- In the third test case, there are six sticks: two of length 2 and four of length 3. The output is 1, which suggests that we can form one square using four sticks of length 3.

- In the fourth test case, there are nine sticks: four of length 2 and five of length 4. The output is 2, which might mean forming a pentagon with five sticks of length 2 and a square with four sticks of length 4, but that doesn't add up because five plus four is nine, which matches the total sticks, but the output is 2, which might indicate forming two polygons: one with four sides and one with five sides, but I need to verify this.

Wait, in the fourth test case, if I have four 2's and five 4's, and I need to form polygons where each polygon has all sides equal, and no stick is used more than once. So, I can form one polygon with four 2's (a square) and another polygon with five 4's (a pentagon), using all nine sticks, which seems correct, and that gives us two polygons.

But, in the third test case, with two 2's and four 3's, I can only form one polygon, which is a square with the four 3's, and the two 2's are not enough to form any polygon since they need at least three sticks of the same length to form a triangle.

So, the general approach seems to be: for each unique stick length, see how many polygons I can form with that length, given that each polygon requires a certain number of sticks of that length.

But, what's the minimum number of sides a polygon can have? A triangle, which has three sides. So, for any stick length, I can form polygons with at least three sides.

Given that, for each unique stick length, I can calculate how many polygons I can form by dividing the number of available sticks by the number of sides required for that polygon.

But, to maximize the number of polygons, I need to choose the polygons in such a way that I'm using up as many sticks as possible without leaving any sticks that could form an additional polygon.

Wait, but the problem is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily using all the sticks.

So, I need to select polygons such that the total number of polygons is maximized, without reusing any stick.

One way to approach this is to consider that for each unique stick length, I can form polygons with that length, and the number of such polygons is limited by the number of sticks available divided by the number of sides required for that polygon.

But, since polygons can have different numbers of sides, I need to decide for each stick length, how many sides to use for the polygons.

Wait, but to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many small polygons as possible, since smaller polygons require fewer sticks.

But, I need to ensure that the polygons are regular, meaning all sides are equal.

So, for each unique stick length, I can form multiple polygons, each with at least three sides, using the available sticks of that length.

To maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many three-sided polygons (triangles) as possible, because they require the fewest sticks per polygon.

Wait, but in the third test case, with four 3's and two 2's, the optimal is to make one four-sided polygon (square) with the four 3's, and no polygons with the two 2's, resulting in one polygon.

But, if I were to make triangles with the 3's, I could make one triangle with three 3's, and have one 3 left, which isn't enough to form another triangle, so that would give me only one polygon anyway.

Similarly, with the two 2's, I can't form any polygon because I need at least three sticks of the same length.

So, in that case, making a square with the four 3's is better than making a triangle, in terms of the number of polygons, because both strategies give me one polygon.

But, what if I have, say, six 3's? Then, I could make two triangles, using six sticks, or I could make one hexagon, using six sticks. In terms of the number of polygons, making two triangles would be better.

Wait, but the problem is to maximize the number of polygons, so making two triangles would be better than making one hexagon.

So, in general, to maximize the number of polygons, I should aim to make as many three-sided polygons as possible, because they require the fewest sticks per polygon.

But, I need to ensure that I'm not leaving enough sticks to form another polygon.

Wait, for example, if I have seven sticks of the same length.

If I make two triangles, that uses six sticks, leaving one stick unused, which isn't enough to form another polygon.

Alternatively, I could make one triangle and one quadrilateral, using seven sticks, forming two polygons.

But, in this case, making one triangle and one quadrilateral gives me more polygons than making just two triangles.

Wait, but with seven sticks, making one triangle and one quadrilateral uses seven sticks, forming two polygons, which is better than making two triangles and leaving one stick unused.

So, in this case, making polygons with more sides can sometimes allow me to form more polygons.

Wait, no, in this case, making two triangles uses six sticks, forming two polygons, and leaving one stick unused, which is not enough to form another polygon.

Alternatively, making one triangle and one quadrilateral also uses seven sticks, forming two polygons.

So, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same: two polygons in both cases.

But, if I have eight sticks, for example:

- Making two triangles uses six sticks, leaving two sticks unused, which isn't enough for another polygon.

- Making one triangle and one quadrilateral uses seven sticks, leaving one stick unused.

- Making one quadrilateral and one quadrilateral uses eight sticks, forming two polygons.

So, in this case, making two quadrilaterals uses all eight sticks, forming two polygons, which is the same as making one triangle and one quadrilateral.

But, if I aim to maximize the number of polygons, I could make two triangles and one quadrilateral with nine sticks, forming three polygons.

Wait, but that's with nine sticks.

Let's think differently.

Maybe I should, for each stick length, calculate how many three-sided polygons (triangles) I can make, since they require the fewest sticks per polygon, and then see if there are any remaining sticks that can be used to make larger polygons.

But, perhaps there's a better way.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func_1(arr):

freq = {}

for n in arr:

freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1

return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))

It seems to be counting the frequency of each stick length, and then for each frequency, it's dividing by 4 and summing up the integer divisions.

So, it's assuming that each polygon requires 4 sticks, which would correspond to squares.

But, in the problem statement, polygons can have any number of sides, as long as all sides are equal.

So, why is it dividing by 4?

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- First test case: n=1, arr=[1]. Output: 0. Which is correct, as you can't form any polygon with one stick.

- Second test case: n=2, arr=[1,1]. Output: 0. Correct, as you can't form any polygon with two sticks.

- Third test case: n=6, arr=[2,2,3,3,3,3]. Output: 1.

- Fourth test case: n=9, arr=[4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4]. Output: 2.

In the third test case, with arr=[2,2,3,3,3,3], the code would calculate frequency: 2:2, 3:4.

Then, sum of v//4: 2//4=0, 4//4=1, total=1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, arr=[4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4], frequency: 2:5, 4:4.

sum of v//4: 5//4=1, 4//4=1, total=2, which matches the sample output.

So, the code is dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 and summing the integer divisions.

But, why 4? Because it's assuming that each polygon requires 4 sticks, which would be squares.

But, in reality, polygons can have any number of sides >=3.

In the third test case, with four 3's, it's possible to make one square (4 sides), which matches v//4=1.

Alternatively, I could make one triangle with three 3's and have one 3 left over, which isn't enough for another polygon, so total polygons=1, which is the same as making one square.

In the fourth test case, with five 2's and four 4's:

- For 2's: five sticks can make one triangle (3 sticks) and have two left over, which isn't enough for another polygon, so total polygons=1.

- For 4's: four sticks can make one square, total polygons=1.

- So, total polygons=2, which matches the sample output.

But, according to the code, it's doing v//4 for each frequency, which in this case is 5//4=1 and 4//4=1, sum=2, which matches.

But, is this always optimal?

Let's consider another example.

Suppose n=7, arr=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Frequency: 1:7.

According to the code, 7//4=1, so output=1.

But, actually, I could make two triangles (using 6 sticks) and have one stick left over, which isn't enough for another polygon, so total polygons=2.

But, the code would output 1, which is less than the actual maximum possible.

Wait, but according to the problem, polygons can have any number of sides >=3.

So, in this case, making two triangles would be better than making one quadrilateral.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick".

So, for a triangle, I need three sticks, each forming one side.

Similarly, for a quadrilateral, I need four sticks.

But, in the above example with seven sticks of length 1, I can make two triangles, using six sticks, and have one stick left over, which is acceptable.

Hence, the maximum number of polygons is 2, but the code would output 1, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

But, wait, in the sample inputs, it seems to be giving correct outputs.

In the third test case, with four 3's, making one square is correct, as making one square gives one polygon, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, with five 2's and four 4's, making one polygon with four 2's and one polygon with four 4's gives two polygons, but actually, with five 2's, I can make one triangle with three 2's and have two 2's left over, which isn't enough for another polygon, and with four 4's, I can make one square, totaling two polygons, which matches the sample output.

But, in the earlier example I thought of, with seven sticks of length 1, the code would output 1, but the correct answer is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

But, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the code is assuming that all polygons must have at least four sides.

But, according to the problem, polygons can have any number of sides >=3.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it's only considering polygons with four sides.

To make it correct, I need to consider polygons with at least three sides.

Hence, for each stick length, I should calculate how many polygons I can make with that length, using at least three sticks per polygon.

To maximize the number of polygons, I should make as many three-sided polygons as possible.

Hence, for each frequency v, the number of polygons I can make is v // 3.

But, in the third test case, with v=4 for length 3, 4//3=1, which matches making one square.

With v=2 for length 2, 2//3=0, which matches making no polygons.

Total polygons=1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, with v=5 for length 2, 5//3=1, and v=4 for length 4, 4//3=1, total polygons=2, which matches the sample output.

In the earlier example with v=7, 7//3=2, which matches making two triangles.

Hence, to correct the code, I should be dividing the frequency by 3 instead of 4.

Hence, the given code is incorrect because it's dividing by 4, which assumes that each polygon has four sides, but in reality, polygons can have any number of sides >=3, and to maximize the number of polygons, I should be dividing by 3.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of regular polygons we can form from given sticks of various lengths, adhering to the constraints that each polygon must have sides of equal length and each stick can be used in only one polygon.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Regular Polygons**: Regular polygons require all sides to be of equal length. The smallest regular polygon is a triangle with 3 sides.
2. **Frequency Counting**: Count the frequency of each unique stick length.
3. **Maximizing Polygons**: For each unique stick length, calculate how many polygons can be formed using sticks of that length. To maximize the number of polygons, prioritize forming the smallest possible polygons (triangles), as they require fewer sticks.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    # Each polygon must have at least 3 sides
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, read the number of sticks `n` and the array of stick lengths `arr`.
2. **Frequency Dictionary**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length.
3. **Calculating Polygons**: For each frequency value in the dictionary, calculate how many polygons can be formed by dividing the frequency by 3 (since the smallest polygon has 3 sides). Sum these values to get the total number of polygons.
4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of polygons for each test case.

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of polygons by forming as many small polygons (triangles) as possible, thereby using the sticks efficiently.
