Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n cities located on a number line, each with a unique coordinate a_i, and they're sorted in ascending order. The distance between any two cities is just the absolute difference of their coordinates.

For each city, there's a closest city, and this is uniquely defined. So, for any city i, there's exactly one city j that is closest to it. The problem provides an example to illustrate this.

Now, I can travel between cities in two ways:

1. Travel directly from city x to city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates in coins.

2. Travel from city x to its closest city, paying just 1 coin.

I need to handle m queries, each asking for the minimum number of coins required to travel from city x to city y.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- There are up to 10^4 test cases.

- For each test case, n can be up to 10^5, and m up to 10^5.

- The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and similarly for m.

So, efficiency is crucial here. I need an approach that can handle large inputs quickly.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Given that the cities are on a number line and sorted in ascending order, the distance between consecutive cities is fixed, and the closest city for each city is either the one immediately to the left or to the right, depending on which is closer.

Wait, but the problem says that the closest city is unique for each city, so there are no ties.

Given that, for each city i, the closest city is either i-1 or i+1, depending on which is closer.

Let me consider building some kind of graph where each city is a node, and there are edges to their closest cities with a cost of 1 coin, and direct edges to any other city with a cost equal to their distance.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building such a graph explicitly would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost paths.

Perhaps I can precompute some information for each city, like the sequence of cities I reach by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and the costs associated with those moves.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I want to go from city x to city y.

I have two options for each step:

1. Go directly to y, paying the distance between x and y.

2. Go to the closest city to x, paying 1 coin, and then continue from there.

But since I can choose to go directly to y at any point, I need to find a path that minimizes the total cost.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin), but moving directly to another city costs the distance.

So, it might be beneficial to hop to closest cities until I'm close to y, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to formalize this idea.

Let me consider that the operation of moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph where edges connect each city to its closest city.

Given that, I can model the movements as a combination of these cheap steps (1 coin) and direct jumps (cost equal to distance).

I need to find a sequence of these operations that minimizes the total cost.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also has direct edges to all other cities with costs equal to their distances.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path in this graph from x to y.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, and potentially up to n edges per node (from the direct jumps), this is not feasible to implement directly.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the operation of moving to the closest city is cheaper, so I should use it as much as possible, especially for small steps.

But moving directly to the target might be more efficient if the direct distance is small enough.

I need to balance between these two options.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal path involving a sequence of cheap steps (moving to closest cities) and possibly one direct jump.

Wait, maybe I can precompute for each city the sequence of cities I reach by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and the cumulative cost of doing so.

Then, for any two cities, I can find a path that involves moving along these sequences and possibly making a direct jump.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the example:

Cities: 0, 8, 12, 15, 20

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) -> City 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) -> City 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) -> City 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) -> City 4 (15)

Queries:

1. From city 1 (0) to city 4 (15):

- Move from 1 to 2 (1 coin)

- Move from 2 to 3 (1 coin)

- Move from 3 to 4 (1 coin)

- Total: 3 coins

2. From city 1 (0) to city 5 (20):

- Move from 1 to 2 (1 coin)

- Move from 2 to 3 (1 coin)

- Move from 3 to 4 (1 coin)

- Move from 4 to 5 (5 coins, since distance is 5)

- Total: 3 + 5 = 8 coins

Wait, but in the explanation, it says they used the same way as the first query to get from 1 to 4, and then from 4 to 5.

But actually, from 4 to 5, the distance is 5, so it's cheaper to move from 4 to 5 directly, paying 5 coins, but in the explanation, they paid 5 coins, which matches.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, but in the first query, moving directly from 1 to 4 would cost 15 coins, which is worse than the 3 coins obtained by moving step by step.

So, in that case, using the cheap steps is better.

In the second query, moving directly from 1 to 5 would cost 20 coins, which is worse than the 8 coins obtained by moving step by step to 4 and then to 5.

So, the step-by-step approach is better in these cases.

But is this always the case?

Let's consider another example.

Suppose cities are 0, 1, 3, 6.

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (1)

- City 2 (1) -> City 3 (3)

- City 3 (3) -> City 4 (6)

- City 4 (6) -> City 3 (3)

Query: From city 1 to city 4.

Option 1: Move step by step:

1 -> 2 (1 coin)

2 -> 3 (1 coin)

3 -> 4 (1 coin)

Total: 3 coins

Option 2: Move directly from 1 to 4: distance is 6, which is more expensive.

So, step by step is better.

Another query: From city 2 to city 4.

Option 1: Move step by step:

2 -> 3 (1 coin)

3 -> 4 (1 coin)

Total: 2 coins

Option 2: Move directly: distance is 5, which is worse.

So, step by step is better.

Is there a case where moving directly is better?

Suppose cities are 0, 1, 100.

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (1)

- City 2 (1) -> City 1 (0) or City 3 (100)? Wait, but closest city is unique.

Given that, if City 2 is closer to City 1 than to City 3, then City 2 -> City 1.

But in this case, moving from City 1 to City 3:

Option 1: Step by step:

1 -> 2 (1 coin)

2 -> 1 (1 coin)

Now, I'm back to City 1. Not helpful.

Wait, but according to the problem, the closest city is unique for each city.

So, in this case, if City 2 is closer to City 1 than to City 3, then City 2's closest city is City 1.

But then, to go from City 1 to City 3:

1 -> 2 (1 coin)

2 -> 1 (1 coin)

Back to City 1, which isn't helpful.

I need a different approach.

Alternatively, from City 1, I can choose to go directly to City 3, paying 100 coins.

Or, I can go to City 2, then directly to City 3, paying 1 coin + 99 coins = 100 coins, which is the same.

So, in this case, step by step isn't better.

But moving directly is equally good.

But according to the problem's example, step by step can be better.

So, perhaps moving directly is only better when the direct distance is smaller than the sum of step-by-step costs.

Wait, in the first example, moving from City 1 to City 4 directly costs 15 coins, which is more than the 3 coins from step-by-step.

Similarly, moving from City 1 to City 5 directly costs 20 coins, which is more than the 8 coins from step-by-step.

So, in those cases, step-by-step is better.

But in the second example, moving from City 2 to City 3 directly costs 2 coins, which is more than the 1 coin from step-by-step (2 -> 3).

Wait, no: moving from City 2 to City 3 directly costs 4 coins (distance is 4), which is more than the 1 coin from moving to the closest city.

So, step-by-step is better.

But perhaps there are cases where direct movement is better.

Wait, suppose cities are 0, 1, 100, 102.

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (1)

- City 2 (1) -> City 1 (0)

- City 3 (100) -> City 4 (102)

- City 4 (102) -> City 3 (100)

Now, going from City 2 (1) to City 4 (102):

Option 1: Step by step:

2 -> 1 (1 coin)

1 -> 2 (1 coin)

Can't make progress.

Wait, in this setup, City 2's closest city is City 1, and City 1's closest city is City 2.

So, I'm stuck oscillating between City 1 and City 2 without making progress to City 4.

So, in this case, I need to make a direct jump from City 2 to City 4, paying 101 coins.

Alternatively, go from City 2 to City 1 (1 coin), then from City 1 to City 3 (direct jump to City 3 costs 100 coins), then from City 3 to City 4 (1 coin), total: 1 + 100 + 1 = 102 coins, which is worse than the direct jump.

So, in this case, direct jump is better.

Hence, sometimes direct jumping is better.

So, I need a way to decide when to jump directly and when to move step by step.

I need a general approach.

Let me think about the properties of this movement.

First, for each city, I can move to its closest city for 1 coin.

So, I can think of this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1.

Additionally, there are edges between every pair of cities with weights equal to their distances.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building such a graph explicitly is impractical.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly will form a path towards some destination.

But in the earlier example, moving to the closest city could lead to oscillating between two cities, as in City 1 and City 2.

Hence, I need to find a way to avoid such cycles or deadends.

Wait, but the problem states that for every city, the closest city is unique.

Hence, there are no ties in distances.

So, moving to the closest city is deterministic.

But in the earlier example, moving from City 2 to City 1 and back doesn't help.

Hence, in such cases, I need to make a direct jump.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to move towards the target city by choosing to move to the closest city until I get closer enough, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like making a step in the direction that minimizes the distance to the next city in the sequence.

But in the earlier example, moving from City 2 to City 1 doesn't reduce the distance to City 4; in fact, it increases it.

Hence, in such cases, I should make a direct jump.

So, perhaps I should consider the following strategy:

From the starting city, repeatedly move to the closest city as long as it reduces the distance to the target city.

If moving to the closest city would increase the distance to the target, then make a direct jump to the target.

But in the earlier example, moving from City 2 to City 1 increases the distance to City 4, so I should make a direct jump from City 2 to City 4.

This seems reasonable.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define the distance to the target as the absolute difference in coordinates.

At each step, if moving to the closest city reduces this distance, do so for 1 coin.

If it doesn't reduce the distance, make a direct jump to the target, paying the distance.

This seems straightforward.

But in the first example, from City 1 to City 4:

- City 1's closest city is City 2.

- Distance from City 2 to City 4 is less than from City 1 to City 4 (15 vs 7), so move to City 2.

- From City 2, its closest city is City 3.

- Distance from City 3 to City 4 is less than from City 2 to City 4 (3 vs 7), so move to City 3.

- From City 3, its closest city is City 4.

- Distance from City 4 to City 4 is 0, which is less than from City 3 to City 4 (3), so move to City 4.

Total cost: 3 coins.

This matches the first query.

For the second query, from City 1 to City 5:

- Move from City 1 to City 2 (1 coin)

- Move from City 2 to City 3 (1 coin)

- Move from City 3 to City 4 (1 coin)

- Then, move directly from City 4 to City 5 (5 coins)

Total: 3 + 5 = 8 coins.

Again, matches the example.

Another query: from City 3 to City 4:

- City 3's closest city is City 4.

- Distance from City 4 to City 4 is 0, which is less than from City 3 to City 4 (3), so move to City 4.

Total cost: 1 coin.

Matches the third query.

From City 3 to City 2:

- City 3's closest city is City 4.

- Distance from City 4 to City 2 is 7, which is greater than from City 3 to City 2 (4), so make a direct jump from City 3 to City 2, paying 4 coins.

Matches the fourth query.

From City 5 to City 1:

- City 5's closest city is City 4.

- Distance from City 4 to City 1 is 15, which is greater than from City 5 to City 1 (20), so make a direct jump from City 5 to City 1, paying 20 coins.

Wait, but in the example, it's 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the example, it's 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple steps.

From City 5 to City 4 (1 coin)

From City 4 to City 3 (1 coin)

From City 3 to City 2 (1 coin)

From City 2 to City 1 (1 coin)

Total: 4 coins.

But the example says 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Wait, the example output is:

3

8

1

4

14

So, for the fifth query, it's 14 coins.

But according to my calculation, it should be 4 coins.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that moving directly from City 4 to City 1 costs 15 coins, which is more than moving step by step.

But according to my earlier calculation, step by step from City 5 to City 1 should be 4 coins.

But the example says 14 coins.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.

Wait, no, the example output is indeed 14 for the last query.

But according to my logic, it should be 4 coins.

Am I missing something?

Wait, maybe the problem allows only one direct jump.

Wait, no, the problem allows multiple operations.

You can perform the operations sequentially.

So, from City 5, move to City 4 (1 coin), then City 3 (1 coin), City 2 (1 coin), and City 1 (1 coin), total 4 coins.

But the example says 14 coins.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that moving to the closest city is only allowed once, and then I have to make a direct jump.

But that doesn't make sense, as the problem allows multiple operations.

Wait, perhaps there are constraints on moving to the closest city multiple times.

But the problem says you can perform the operations sequentially any number of times.

Hence, my earlier approach should work, but it contradicts the example.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that moving to the closest city can sometimes take me further away from the target.

But in the case of moving from City 5 to City 4 (closer to City 1), then City 3, City 2, City 1.

Total cost: 4 coins.

But the example says 14 coins.

So, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate the minimal cost considering both options at each step.

This seems too slow for n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the operation of moving to the closest city is equivalent to moving one step in a specific direction, and I can chain these operations.

But perhaps there is a way to model this efficiently using the properties of the number line.

Let me consider that the sequence of moving to the closest city forms a path that can be precomputed.

Wait, but in the earlier example, moving from City 5 to City 4 to City 3 to City 4 oscillates, but in the problem, it's guaranteed that the closest city is unique.

Hence, there are no cycles.

Wait, but in that case, it's a tree structure, where each city points to its closest city.

Hence, I can model this as a tree where each node has a parent (its closest city), and the root is a city that is its own closest city.

Wait, but in the problem, a city's closest city is another city, not itself.

Hence, there is no root in this tree; it's a directed tree with edges pointing from each city to its closest city.

Given that, I can think of this as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) where each node has one outgoing edge to its closest city.

Given that, I can compute the distance from any city to any other city by considering paths along these edges and direct jumps.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Perhaps I can compute for each city the sequence of cities reached by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and the cumulative cost of doing so.

Then, for any two cities, I can find the path that involves moving along these sequences and making a direct jump at some point to minimize the total cost.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider precomputing for each city the cost to reach any city in its "closest city path".

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of jumping pointers.

In competitive programming, we often use jumping pointers to handle such problems efficiently.

For example, in the Heavy-Light Decomposition or Binary Lifting in trees.

Given that, perhaps I can use a similar approach here.

Let me consider that the operation of moving to the closest city is like moving up in a tree.

Hence, I can precompute for each city, the city it reaches after moving k times to its closest city, along with the cumulative cost.

Then, for any two cities, I can lift one of them up to a common ancestor or close to the other city, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to define what "lifting" means in this context.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city, and then use some kind of dynamic programming to compute the minimal cost to reach any city from another.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an O(log n) per query solution.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a tree and use techniques like LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) to compute the minimal cost.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the starting city x and the ending city y.

I can consider moving from x to its closest city, then to its closest city, and so on, until I decide to make a direct jump to y.

At each step, I can decide to make a direct jump to y or continue moving to the closest city.

I need to choose the sequence that minimizes the total cost.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, but with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city the minimal cost to reach any other city by moving along the closest city path up to a certain point and then making a direct jump.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the target in the most efficient way possible (since it's the closest).

Hence, repeatedly moving to the closest city should guide me towards the target city in the shortest possible path in terms of the number of steps.

But in the earlier example, moving from City 1 to City 4 requires 3 steps, which is better than making a direct jump of 15 coins.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimum between:

- The direct jump cost from x to y.

- The cost of moving to the closest city from x, and then moving to y in the minimal cost.

But this seems recursive.

Let me try to formalize it.

Define dp(x, y) as the minimal cost to go from x to y.

Then, dp(x, y) = min(

|a_x - a_y|,

1 + dp(closest[x], y)

)

This recurrence relation seems appropriate.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, and recursion depth up to n, this is too slow.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by moving along the closest city path up to a certain point and then making a direct jump.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a DAG and compute the minimal cost using dynamic programming in topological order.

Given that the graph of cities pointing to their closest cities is a DAG (no cycles, since distances are unique and cities are on a number line), I can topologically sort the cities and compute the minimal cost to reach y from x by considering all possible paths along the DAG and direct jumps.

But with n up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that in the DAG, each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and direct edges to all other cities with their respective distances.

I need to find the shortest path in this DAG from x to y.

Given that it's a DAG, I can use dynamic programming to compute the shortest paths.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an O(n log n) precomputation and O(1) per query.

Is that possible?

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a tree and use techniques similar to jumping pointers.

Let me consider that each city has a parent, which is its closest city, forming a tree structure.

Then, I can compute for each city the minimal cost to reach any other city by moving up the tree and then making a direct jump.

But I need to define what "up the tree" means in this context.

Wait, in this tree, moving to the parent is moving to the closest city, paying 1 coin.

Hence, moving up the tree reduces the distance to some central point.

But in reality, since cities are on a number line, the tree structure might not be a true tree but a DAG.

Wait, but in the problem, since each city has exactly one closest city, and closest city is unique, the graph is a DAG with possible multiple components, but no cycles.

Hence, I can perform a topological sort and compute minimal costs accordingly.

But I need to think of a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to a parent in a tree, and I can precompute the minimal cost to reach any city y from any city x by moving up to a certain ancestor and then making a direct jump.

But I need to define the ancestors in this DAG.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a tree and use techniques like LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) to compute the minimal cost.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that in this DAG, each path from a city to its closest city, and so on, forms a path towards some root.

But in reality, since cities are on a number line and closest cities are uniquely defined, the DAG should be a collection of trees.

Hence, I can treat it as a forest and compute the minimal cost accordingly.

But I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost efficiently.

Let me consider that for each city, moving to its closest city reduces the distance to the target city, unless the closest city is farther from the target.

In that case, I should make a direct jump.

Hence, for each city, I can compute the minimal cost to reach the target by either moving to the closest city and adding 1 coin, or making a direct jump to the target.

Hence, dp[x] = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + dp[closest[x]])

This is a standard dynamic programming on a DAG.

Given that, I can compute dp[y] = 0, and for all other cities, compute dp[x] = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + dp[closest[x]])

But since y is different for each query, I need a way to compute dp[x] for each query efficiently.

Computing this naively for each query would be too slow for n and m up to 10^5.

Hence, I need a way to precompute some information to answer each query quickly.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to a parent in a tree, and I can precompute the minimal cost to reach y from any ancestor of x.

But I need to define what an ancestor is in this context.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a tree and use techniques similar to jumping pointers to compute the minimal cost.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that for each city, I can precompute the sequence of cities reached by repeatedly moving to the closest city, along with the cumulative cost.

Then, for any two cities, I can find their meeting point in these sequences and compute the minimal cost accordingly.

But I need to define what this meeting point is.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost by considering the path from x to y through their closest city sequences.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider that since the cities are on a number line and sorted in ascending order, I can think in terms of their positions.

Given that, the distance between two cities is simply the difference in their coordinates.

Hence, moving from x to y directly costs a_y - a_x if y > x, else a_x - a_y.

But moving to the closest city is always 1 coin.

Hence, moving from x to y via closest cities would involve moving to the closest city of x, then to its closest city, and so on, until I reach y.

But in reality, I need to decide when to make the direct jump.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimum over all possible sequences of moves.

But this is too vague for implementation.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the operation of moving to the closest city is like moving one step towards y, but at a cost of 1 coin, while moving directly to y costs the distance.

Hence, I should move to the closest city as long as it reduces the distance to y more than the direct jump would.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the cost per distance reduced.

Moving to the closest city costs 1 coin and reduces the distance by a certain amount.

Moving directly costs the remaining distance.

Hence, I should move to the closest city if the cost per distance reduced is lower than moving directly.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two cities, x and y.

If y is the closest city to x, then moving from x to y costs 1 coin.

Otherwise, I can move to the closest city of x, say z, and then from z to y.

But this might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and edges to all other cities with weights equal to their distances.

Then, the minimal cost from x to y is the shortest path in this graph.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building such a graph is impractical.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is always better than moving directly if the cost is less.

Wait, but in some cases, moving directly is better.

Hence, perhaps I need to compute for each city the minimal number of steps to reach y, considering both options.

But again, this seems too slow.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and all-pairs edges with weights equal to their distances.

Then, the minimal cost from x to y is the shortest path in this graph.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city is equivalent to moving one step towards y, but at a cost of 1 coin, while moving directly costs the distance.

Hence, I should move to the closest city as long as the cumulative cost is less than the direct jump.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost as the minimum over all k of (k * 1 + distance from k-th closest city to y).

But I need a better way to compute this.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly will eventually lead me to y, but possibly in a suboptimal way.

Hence, I need to find a way to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a potential function.

Define the potential at city x as the minimal number of moves to reach y, considering both options.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that the minimal cost from x to y is the minimum between:

- Direct jump: |a_x - a_y|

- Moving to the closest city of x, then from there to y: 1 + minimal_cost(closest[x], y)

Hence, dp[x] = min(|a_x - a_y|, 1 + dp[closest[x]])

This is a standard dynamic programming on a DAG.

Given that, I can compute dp[y] = 0, and for all other cities, compute dp[x] based on the above recurrence.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that the DAG formed by the closest city pointers is a collection of trees, since each city has exactly one outgoing edge, and there are no cycles.

Hence, I can perform a topological sort and compute dp[x] in O(n) time per test case.

But since t can be up to 10^4, and n up to 10^5, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, this should be acceptable.

Wait, but m can be up to 10^5 per test case, but since m is the number of queries, and t is up to 10^4, but sum of m over all test cases is up to 10^5, it should be manageable.

Hence, for each test case, I can precompute dp[x] for all x, and then answer each query in O(1) time.

But I need to optimize this further.

Wait, but in reality, for each query, I need dp[x][y], which would require O(n) space per y, which is not feasible.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y, for a fixed y.

But since y varies per query, this is not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute something for the entire graph that allows me to answer queries efficiently.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards y in steps of cost 1, and direct jumps cost the distance.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimum over all k of (k * 1 + distance from k-th city to y).

But I need a better way to compute this.

Let me consider that the sequence of cities reached by repeatedly moving to the closest city forms a path towards y, and I can precompute the cumulative costs along this path.

Then, for any x, I can find the minimal k such that moving k times to the closest city and then making a direct jump to y minimizes the total cost.

But I need to define what k is.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the city reached by moving k times to the closest city, and the cumulative cost of doing so.

Then, for any query from x to y, I can find the minimal k that minimizes the total cost.

But I need to define k efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can use binary lifting.

In binary lifting, I precompute for each city x, the city reached by moving 2^k times to the closest city, along with the cumulative cost.

Then, for any query from x to y, I can climb up the tree in O(log n) time to find the minimal cost.

This seems promising.

Hence, I can precompute for each city x and for k from 0 to log n, the city reached by moving 2^k times to the closest city, and the cumulative cost.

Then, for any query from x to y, I can use the binary lifting technique to find the minimal cost.

Let me formalize this.

Define closest[x][k] as the city reached by moving 2^k times to the closest city from x, and cost[x][k] as the cumulative cost of doing so.

Then, I can precompute closest[x][k] and cost[x][k] for k from 0 to log n.

Then, for any query from x to y, I can iteratively move x up the tree in the closest city tree, accumulating the cost, until I reach a point where moving further would not reduce the distance to y, and then make a direct jump.

Wait, but I need
