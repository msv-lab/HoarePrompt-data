Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n children in a class, and m pairs among them are friends with a certain friendship value. The teacher goes on k excursions, and for each excursion, she randomly chooses a pair of children equiprobably and independently. If the chosen pair are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Pairs who are not friends have a friendship value of 0 that doesn't change.

I need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions, considering that the friendship values can increase over time based on the selections.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n children, and m pairs of friends, each with a friendship value f_i. The teacher chooses k pairs randomly, and if a chosen pair is among the m friends, their f_i increases by 1 for all future excursions.

I need to calculate the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of each choice.

Let me try to rephrase the problem to make sure I understand it. For each excursion, a pair of children is chosen randomly. If they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions. Non-friend pairs have a friendship value of 0 that never changes.

So, for each excursion, the chosen pair has its friendship value at that moment added to the total sum. And we need the expected value of this total sum over k excursions.

I think it's important to model how the friendship values change over time. Each friend pair's f_i starts with its initial value and increases by 1 each time it's chosen in an excursion.

But since the choices are independent and random, I need to find the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let me consider a single friend pair (a, b) with initial friendship value f. I need to find the expected contribution of this pair to the total sum over k excursions.

In each excursion, the pair has a probability of being chosen, which is 1/C, where C is the total number of possible pairs.

Wait, how many possible pairs are there? With n children, the number of possible pairs is n choose 2, which is n*(n-1)/2.

So, probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is 1 / (n*(n-1)/2).

Let's denote p = 2 / (n*(n-1)), which is the probability of choosing a specific pair in one excursion.

Wait, no. The probability should be 2 / (n*(n-1)) if n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so 1 / (n*(n-1)/2) = 2 / (n*(n-1)).

Wait, actually, n choose 2 is n*(n-1)/2, so the probability of choosing a specific pair is 1 / (n*(n-1)/2).

But to make it simpler, let's denote C = n*(n-1)/2, so p = 1/C.

Now, for each excursion, if the pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Wait, no. The problem says that if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

But the friendship value at the time of being chosen is what matters for the sum.

Wait, no, the sum is of the friendship values at the time of being chosen.

Wait, let's read the problem again: "the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions (at the time of being chosen)."

So, for each excursion, when a pair is chosen, we look at its friendship value at that moment and add it to the sum.

And friendship values increase by 1 for all subsequent excursions if they are chosen.

So, the friendship value increases after being chosen, but the value at the time of being chosen is the current value before the increase.

Wait, but the problem says: "if a pair of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions."

So, at the time of being chosen, their value hasn't increased yet; it increases for subsequent excursions.

Therefore, the friendship value at the time of being chosen is the current value, and it increases only after that.

So, for each excursion, the chosen pair's current friendship value is added to the sum, and if they are friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

I need to compute the expected sum of these k chosen pairs' friendship values at the time of being chosen.

Now, to compute this expectation, I can think about the contribution of each friend pair to the total sum.

Let me consider one friend pair with initial friendship value f. I need to find the expected total sum over k excursions, considering that each time this pair is chosen, its current friendship value is added to the sum, and then it increases by 1 for future excursions.

This seems like a Markov chain, where the state is the current friendship value of each pair, and transitions depend on whether the pair is chosen in an excursion.

But with k up to 2e5 and m up to 1e5, and t up to 5e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

I recall that for expectation, linearity of expectation can be useful. Maybe I can compute the expected contribution of each friend pair to the total sum and sum them up.

Let's try that.

Consider one friend pair with initial friendship value f. Let's compute its expected contribution to the total sum over k excursions.

Let’s denote X_i as the friendship value of this pair at the time of being chosen in the i-th excursion, if chosen.

If the pair is not chosen in the i-th excursion, it doesn't contribute to the sum.

So, the total contribution of this pair is sum over i from 1 to k of X_i, where X_i = f + number of times this pair was chosen before the i-th excursion, because each time it's chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

Each time the pair is chosen, its friendship value at the time of being chosen is f plus the number of times it was chosen before that excursion.

Wait, more precisely, if a pair has been chosen t times before the current excursion, its friendship value at the time of being chosen is f + t.

Then, each time it's chosen, it increases its friendship value by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

So, its contribution to the total sum is sum over all times it is chosen of (f + number of times it was chosen before that excursion).

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the pair is chosen in the k excursions.

Let’s denote by N the number of times this pair is chosen in the k excursions. N follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p = 1/C, where C = n*(n-1)/2.

Then, the total contribution of this pair to the sum is sum over i from 1 to N of (f + (i-1)), because each time it's chosen, its friendship value is f plus the number of times it has been chosen before.

So, if N = n, the total contribution is sum from i=1 to n of (f + i - 1) = n*f + sum from i=1 to n (i-1) = n*f + (n*(n-1)/2).

Therefore, the total contribution is n*f + n*(n-1)/2.

But wait, N is random, so I need to take expectation over N.

So, expected contribution E[total contribution] = E[n*f + n*(n-1)/2] = f*E[n] + E[n*(n-1)/2].

Wait, but n is random here.

Let me denote N as the number of times the pair is chosen in k excursions.

Then, N ~ Binomial(k, p), where p = 1/C.

So, E[N] = k*p = k/C.

And E[N*(N-1)] = Var(N) + (E[N])^2 = k*p*(1-p) + (k*p)^2.

But actually, for binomial, Var(N) = k*p*(1-p), and E[N*(N-1)] = E[N^2] - E[N] = Var(N) + (E[N])^2 - E[N] = k*p*(1-p) + (k*p)^2 - k*p.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, I think I can compute the sum directly.

The total contribution of this pair is sum over the excursions in which it is chosen of (f + number of times it was chosen before that excursion).

Let’s think about the order in which the excursions happen. Each excursion is independent, and the pair can be chosen multiple times.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me consider the contribution of this pair in each excursion separately.

In each excursion, the pair is chosen with probability p = 1/C, and its friendship value at that time is f plus the number of times it has been chosen before.

Let’s denote by I_j the indicator variable that the pair is chosen in the j-th excursion.

Then, the total contribution of the pair is sum over j from 1 to k of I_j * (f + number of times chosen before j).

Now, number of times chosen before j is sum over i from 1 to j-1 of I_i.

So, total contribution is sum over j from 1 to k of I_j * (f + sum over i from 1 to j-1 I_i).

This seems messy. Maybe there's a smarter way to compute the expectation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the expected increase in the friendship value over time.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using the linearity of expectation directly.

Let me consider that in each excursion, the expected friendship value of the chosen pair is being added to the sum.

Since the pair is chosen randomly, the expected friendship value at the time of choice can be computed based on the probabilities of choosing each pair and their respective friendship values at that time.

But with dependencies between the excursions, this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the entire process as a sequence of k choices, where each choice affects the friendship values of the pairs chosen in future choices.

But with k up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Maybe I can think about the expected contribution of each friend pair independently and then sum them up due to linearity of expectation.

Let’s try that again.

For each friend pair, compute its expected contribution to the total sum over k excursions, then sum over all friend pairs.

For non-friend pairs, their contribution is always 0, so I don't need to consider them.

So, for each friend pair with initial friendship value f, I need to find the expected sum of its friendship value over the excursions in which it is chosen.

Let’s denote N as the number of times this pair is chosen in k excursions.

Each time it is chosen, its friendship value at that time is f plus the number of times it has been chosen before.

So, if it is chosen n times, the total contribution is f*n + sum from i=0 to n-1 of i = f*n + n*(n-1)/2.

Therefore, the total contribution is f*n + n*(n-1)/2.

Now, since N is random, I need to compute E[f*N + N*(N-1)/2] = f*E[N] + E[N*(N-1)/2].

I know that E[N] = k*p = k/C, where p = 1/C and C = n*(n-1)/2.

Now, E[N*(N-1)] = Var(N) + (E[N])^2 = k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2.

Therefore, E[N*(N-1)/2] = [k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2]/2.

So, the expected contribution of this pair is f*k*p + [k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2]/2.

Simplify this:

f*k*p + [k*p - (k*p)^2 + (k*p)^2]/2 = f*k*p + [k*p]/2 = k*p*(f + 1/2).

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, let's recast.

E[N*(N-1)] = Var(N) + (E[N])^2 = k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2.

Therefore, E[N*(N-1)/2] = [k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2]/2.

So, the expected contribution is f*E[N] + E[N*(N-1)/2] = f*k*p + [k*p*(1 - p) + (k*p)^2]/2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each time the pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for future choices, so its contribution is its initial value plus the number of times it was chosen before.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the order of selections.

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the entire sum over all k excursions.

The total sum S is the sum over j from 1 to k of F_j, where F_j is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion at the time of choice.

I need to find E[S] = E[sum over j from 1 to k of F_j] = sum over j from 1 to k of E[F_j].

Because of linearity of expectation, and the fact that each excursion is independent.

Now, E[F_j] is the expected friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion.

Since the choice is uniform over all possible pairs, E[F_j] is the average of the friendship values of all possible pairs at the time of choice.

But the friendship values can change over time, so this seems tricky.

Wait, but in reality, the friendship values only increase by 1 each time the pair is chosen, but only for pairs that are friends.

Non-friend pairs always have friendship value 0.

So, perhaps I can think about the expected increase in friendship values over time.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as the sum over all friend pairs of their initial friendship value times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus the expected sum of the increases.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a friend pair with initial friendship value f.

I need to find the expected sum over k excursions of f plus the number of times this pair has been chosen before each time it is chosen.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of geometric distributions.

Each time a pair is chosen, it increases its friendship value by 1 for future excursions.

So, the first time it's chosen, its friendship value is f, the second time it's f+1, and so on.

The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in k independent trials is k*p, where p = 1/C.

But I need to consider the order in which the pairs are chosen.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I can approximate or find a pattern with small test cases.

Let me look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

Sample Input:

4

100 0 24

2 1 10

1 2 1

3 1 2

2 1 1

5 2 4

1 2 25

3 2 24

Sample Output:

0

55

777777784

40000020

In the first test case, n=100, m=0, k=24.

Since m=0, there are no friend pairs, so all pairs have friendship value 0, and the sum is 0, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=2, m=1, k=10.

There is only one possible pair (1,2) with f=1.

Each time this pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for future choices.

So, in the first choice, it's chosen with probability 1, and its value is 1.

Then, its value increases to 2 for the next choice, and so on.

So, the sum would be 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55, which matches the output.

So, in this case, since n=2, there's only one possible pair, and it's always chosen.

In the third test case, n=3, m=1, k=2.

There are 3 possible pairs: (1,2), (1,3), (2,3).

Only one pair is friends, with f=1.

Each excursion chooses a pair uniformly at random.

So, the probability of choosing the friend pair in each excursion is 1/3.

Now, for k=2 excursions, the expected sum can be calculated considering the possible sequences of choices.

If the friend pair is chosen both times, its value is 1 in the first choice and 2 in the second choice, sum=3.

If it's chosen only once, either first or second, sum=1 + 0 or 0 + 2.

If it's not chosen at all, sum=0 + 0.

So, the expected sum is:

P(chosen both times) * 3 + P(chosen first only) * 1 + P(chosen second only) * 2 + P(not chosen at all) * 0.

P(chosen both times) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9

P(chosen first only) = (1/3) * (2/3) = 2/9

P(chosen second only) = (2/3) * (1/3) = 2/9

P(not chosen at all) = (2/3) * (2/3) = 4/9

So, expected sum = (1/9)*3 + (2/9)*1 + (2/9)*2 + (4/9)*0 = 3/9 + 2/9 + 4/9 + 0 = 9/9 = 1.

But the output is 777777784, which is 7/9 modulo 10^9+7.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when the pair is chosen in the second excursion, its value is f + number of times chosen before, which is 1 (since it was not chosen in the first excursion).

Wait, no, in the second excursion, if it's chosen and not chosen in the first, its value is f + 0 = 1.

Wait, perhaps my earlier approach is flawed.

This is getting too complicated for me to handle manually.

Let me look at the fourth test case.

n=5, m=2, k=4

Pairs: (1,2) with f=25, (3,2) with f=24

Total possible pairs: 5 choose 2 = 10

Probability of choosing any specific pair is 1/10.

The expected sum would be sum over all friend pairs of their expected contribution over k excursions.

From the sample output, it's 40000020, which is likely 4*(25 + 24)/10 = 4*49/10 = 19.6, but 19.6 mod 10^9+7 is not making sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

I need to find the expected sum of the friendship values at the time of being chosen for all k excursions.

Given that, and considering that each excursion is independent, perhaps I can compute the expected friendship value for a single excursion and multiply by k.

But this seems too simplistic, as the friendship values can increase over time.

Wait, but in reality, since each excursion is independent, and the choice is uniform over all pairs, perhaps the expected friendship value per excursion is the average of the current friendship values of all pairs.

But the friendship values can change based on previous choices, so this is not straightforward.

This seems too involved for my current understanding.

I think I need to look for a different approach or find a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the expected sum is the sum over all excursions of the expected friendship value at the time of choice.

And since each excursion is independent, this might be k times the expected friendship value in one excursion.

But again, the friendship values change over time, so this might not hold.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a Markov chain, where the state is the current friendship values of all pairs, and transitions depend on which pair is chosen.

But with m up to 1e5 and k up to 2e5, this is computationally infeasible.

I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can consider that the expected sum is the sum over all friend pairs of their expected contribution, where each friend pair's expected contribution is their initial friendship value times the expected number of times they are chosen, plus the expected sum of the increases.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me consider that for each friend pair, the expected number of times they are chosen in k excursions is k*p, where p = 1/C, C = n*(n-1)/2.

Then, their expected contribution would be f*k*p plus some term accounting for the increases.

But I need to account for the fact that each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for future choices.

This seems like a recursive dependency.

I'm stuck.

Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that the total sum S is the sum over k excursions of the friendship value at the time of choice.

I need E[S] = E[sum over j from 1 to k of F_j], where F_j is the friendship value of the pair chosen in the j-th excursion.

Now, since each excursion is independent and the choice is uniform over all pairs, perhaps E[F_j] is the same for all j, and equal to the average friendship value of all pairs.

But wait, the friendship values can change over time, so this is not accurate.

Each time a friend pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1 for future excursions.

So, the friendship values are not static; they can increase over time.

Therefore, the expected friendship value in later excursions could be higher due to increases from previous choices.

This seems too interdependent to handle directly.

Perhaps I need to find a way to decouple these dependencies.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of the number of times each friend pair is chosen and sum their contributions accordingly.

Let’s try that.

For each friend pair, let N be the number of times it is chosen in k excursions.

Then, its total contribution to the sum is sum from t=1 to N of (f + (t-1)), where t is the t-th time it is chosen.

This is equal to N*f + sum from t=1 to N (t-1) = N*f + N*(N-1)/2.

Therefore, the expected contribution is E[N*f + N*(N-1)/2] = f*E[N] + E[N*(N-1)/2].

We know that N follows a binomial distribution with parameters k and p = 1/C, where C = n*(n-1)/2.

So, E[N] = k*p = k
