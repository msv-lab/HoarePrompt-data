Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring I choose to shift.

My goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted using any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does to a substring. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the substring "10". A cyclic shift would take the last character '0' and move it to the front, making it "01". So, in one operation, I can flip a '10' to '01' at the cost of the substring's length.

Another example: take "110". A cyclic shift would make it "011". So, it's like rotating the substring by one position to the left.

I need to think about how to use these operations to arrange the entire string in sorted order.

Let me consider the first test case from the example:

Input: 10

Output: 2

Explanation: By performing a cyclic shift on the entire string "10" to get "01", which costs 2 (the length of the string).

That makes sense.

Another test case:

Input: 0000

Output: 0

Explanation: The string is already sorted, so no operations are needed.

Alright.

Third test case:

Input: 11000

Output: 9

Explanation: Perform three operations, each costing 3, to get to "00011".

Let me see:

1. Choose substring [1:3]: "100" -> "001" -> "001" (after shift)

Wait, "11000":

- Choose positions 1 to 3: "110" -> "011" -> "110" (wait, no. Cyclic shift of "110" would be "101"), but I think I need to double-check.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the cyclic shift.

Let me read the problem again.

"Cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s1 s2 … sn−1 sn into sn s1 s2 … sn−1."

So, it's rotating the substring to the left by one position.

So, for "110", a cyclic shift would be "011".

Wait, but in the example, they have:

1. Choose [1,3]: "110" -> "011"

2. Choose [2,4]: "0110" -> "0011"

3. Choose [3,5]: "00110" -> "00011"

Each operation costs 3, total cost 9.

Okay, that makes sense now.

So, in each operation, I can choose any substring and perform this cyclic shift, and the cost is the length of that substring.

I need to find the sequence of operations with the minimal total cost to make the string sorted.

Now, I need to think about a general approach to solve this.

First, I need to identify where the '1's and '0's are and see how to rearrange them with these operations.

One way to think about it is to consider the positions of '1's that are before some '0's, and see how to move them.

But this seems a bit tricky.

Let me think differently.

Since the operation allows me to perform a cyclic shift on any substring, perhaps I can model this as moving '1's to the right or '0's to the left in some way.

Wait, actually, by performing cyclic shifts, I can effectively swap adjacent characters in certain cases.

For example, in "10", shifting it once gives "01", which is a swap.

But it costs 2.

If I have "110", shifting [1,3] costs 3 and turns it into "011".

Alternatively, I could shift [2,3]: "110" -> "101" (shifting "10" to "01"), which also effectively swaps the last '1' and '0'.

But in this case, it's still cost 2.

Wait, no, shifting [2,3] in "110" would make "101", which is a cyclic shift of the substring "10" to "01", costing 2.

So, perhaps I can model this as being able to swap adjacent '0's and '1's at a certain cost.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to bubble sort, where in bubble sort, you can swap adjacent elements to sort the array, and the number of swaps needed is related to the number of inversions.

But in this case, the cost isn't per swap but per substring shift, which affects multiple characters at once.

I need to find a way to group these shifts to minimize the total cost.

Let me consider the positions where the string is not sorted, i.e., where a '1' appears before a '0'.

Each such instance needs to be corrected.

If I can find all such instances and group them in a way that minimizes the total cost, that would be ideal.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of inversions.

In a sorted array, there are no inversions (no '1' before '0').

So, the number of inversions is the number of '1's before '0's.

But in this problem, since each operation can fix multiple inversions at once (by shifting a substring), I need to find a way to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as reversing substrings, but it's not exactly the same because it's a cyclic shift.

Wait, but cyclic shift can be used to reverse a substring in multiple steps.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me look at the function provided in the program.

The program defines a function func_1(sChar):

- It converts the string to a list.

- Initializes left and right pointers.

- Initializes cost to 0.

- Then, it enters a loop where it looks for positions where s[left] == '1' and s[right] == '0'.

- When it finds such a pair, it swaps s[left] and s[right], and adds the cost which is (right - left + 1).

- Then, it moves the right pointer forward until it finds a '0', and moves the left pointer forward until it finds a '1'.

This seems similar to bubble sort, where you repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

But in this case, it's not swapping adjacent elements; it's swapping elements at positions left and right, which can be arbitrary positions.

Wait, but in the code, it's not necessarily swapping adjacent elements; it's swapping elements where left has '1' and right has '0', and the substring from left to right is cyclically shifted.

Wait, but in the code, it's actually swapping s[right] and s[left], which is similar to swapping two elements.

But according to the problem, a cyclic shift on a substring means moving the last character to the front.

So, if I have substring from left to right, say positions i to j, cyclic shift would make s[j] become s[i], and shift all other characters to the right.

But in the code, it's just swapping s[left] and s[right], which is not exactly a cyclic shift.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me look at an example.

Take "10".

According to the code:

- s = ['1', '0']

- left = 0, right = 1

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0'

- Swap s[left] and s[right]: now s = ['0', '1']

- cost += right - left + 1 = 2

- Then, move right forward until s[right] == '0', but right is already at 1, which is '0', and left is at 0, which is '0'.

- Since s[left] != '1', move left forward to 1, which is '0'.

- Now, left = 1, right = 1

- Since left <= right and right < len(s), and left < len(s), but s[right] = '0' and s[left] = '0', so no swap.

- Exit the loop.

- Total cost is 2, which matches the first test case.

Another test case: "0000"

- s = ['0','0','0','0']

- left = 0, right = 1

- s[left] = '0', s[right] = '0' → move left forward until s[left] = '1'

- left becomes 1, s[left] = '0' → move to 2, s[2] = '0' → move to 3, s[3] = '0' → no '1' found, exit loop.

- cost = 0, which matches the second test case.

Third test case: "11000"

- s = ['1','1','0','0','0']

- left = 0, right = 1

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '1' → no swap

- move right forward to 2, s[2] = '0'

- now s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0' → swap s[0] and s[2]: s = ['0','1','1','0','0']

- cost += 3 (right - left + 1 = 2 - 0 + 1 = 3)

- then, move right forward to 3, s[3] = '0'

- move left forward to 1, s[1] = '1'

- now, s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0' → swap s[1] and s[3]: s = ['0','0','1','1','0']

- cost += 3 (3 - 1 + 1 = 3)

- move right forward to 4, s[4] = '0'

- move left forward to 2, s[2] = '1'

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0' → swap s[2] and s[4]: s = ['0','0','0','1','1']

- cost += 3 (4 - 2 + 1 = 3)

- move right forward to 5, which is out of bounds, exit loop.

- total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which matches the third test case.

So, in this approach, it's swapping '1's and '0's that are out of order, and each swap costs the length of the substring from left to right.

But is this the minimal cost?

In the third test case, it cost 9, which matches the example.

But is there a way to do it with less cost?

Wait, if I choose a larger substring, does that help or hinder?

For example, in the first operation, if I choose substring from 1 to 5 ("11000") and perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "01100", costing 5.

Then, choose substring from 3 to 5 ("100") and perform a cyclic shift to "011", resulting in "00110", costing 3.

Then, choose substring from 4 to 5 ("10") and perform a cyclic shift to "01", resulting in "00011", costing 2.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 2 = 10, which is higher than the previous approach's 9.

So, in this case, the approach in the code gives a lower cost.

Another approach: choose substring from 1 to 3 ("110") and perform a cyclic shift to "011", costing 3.

Then, choose substring from 2 to 4 ("110") and perform a cyclic shift to "011", but in the current state "01100", shifting positions 2 to 4 ("110") to "011", resulting in "00110", costing 3.

Then, choose substring from 3 to 5 ("110") and perform a cyclic shift to "011", resulting in "00011", costing 3.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, same as the code's approach.

So, in this case, it's the same cost.

Is there a better way?

What if I choose a larger substring?

Choose substring from 1 to 4 ("1100") and perform a cyclic shift to "0110", costing 4.

Then, choose substring from 3 to 5 ("100") and perform a cyclic shift to "011", but in the current state "01100", shifting positions 3 to 5 ("00") to "00", which doesn't change anything.

Wait, "01100", shifting positions 3 to 5 ("100") to "011", resulting in "01110", which is not helpful.

So, perhaps choosing larger substrings doesn't always lead to a better cost.

In this case, the approach in the code seems to work fine.

Another test case: "101011"

According to the code:

- s = ['1','0','1','0','1','1']

- left = 0, right = 1

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0' → swap s[0] and s[1]: s = ['0','1','1','0','1','1']

- cost += 2 - 0 + 1 = 3

- move right forward to 2, s[2] = '1'

- move left forward to 1, s[1] = '1'

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '1' → no swap

- move right forward to 3, s[3] = '0'

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '0' → swap s[1] and s[3]: s = ['0','0','1','1','1','1']

- cost += 4 (3 - 1 + 1 = 3)

- move right forward to 4, s[4] = '1'

- move left forward to 2, s[2] = '1'

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '1' → no swap

- move right forward to 5, s[5] = '1'

- move left forward to 3, s[3] = '1'

- s[left] = '1', s[right] = '1' → no swap

- move right forward to 6, out of bounds, exit loop.

- total cost = 3 + 3 = 6, but the example output is 5.

Wait, according to the example, the output should be 5, but the code gives 6.

Hmm, so perhaps the code is not always optimal.

Wait, maybe I missed something.

Let me check the example output again.

Wait, in the problem statement, for input "101011", output is 5.

But according to the code's approach, it's giving 6.

So, perhaps there's a better way to do it with a lower cost.

Let's see.

One possible sequence:

1. Choose substring [1,4]: "1010" → "0101", costing 4.

- s becomes "010111"

2. Choose substring [2,3]: "10" → "01", costing 2.

- s becomes "001111"

Total cost: 4 + 2 = 6, same as the code's approach.

Is there a better sequence?

Another sequence:

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "101" → "110", costing 3.

- s becomes "110011"

2. Choose substring [1,2]: "11" → "11", no change.

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "011" → "110", costing 3.

- s becomes "111101"

4. Choose substring [5,6]: "01" → "10", costing 2.

- s becomes "111110"

5. Choose substring [1,6]: "111110" → "011111", costing 6.

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 14, which is worse.

Another sequence:

1. Choose substring [1,5]: "10101" → "11010", costing 5.

- s becomes "110101"

2. Choose substring [1,3]: "110" → "011", costing 3.

- s becomes "011101"

3. Choose substring [4,5]: "10" → "01", costing 2.

- s becomes "011110"

4. Choose substring [1,6]: "011110" → "001111", costing 6.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 16, worse.

Seems like the initial approach gives a better cost.

Wait, but the example says the output should be 5, but the code gives 6.

So, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can count the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

Each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' can be moved in a single operation that covers both the '1' and the '0', and possibly more.

But I need to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can group the operations to cover multiple swaps at once.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have a '1' that needs to be moved past multiple '0's.

If I choose a substring that includes the '1' and all the '0's it needs to pass, I can move the '1' past all of them in one operation.

The cost would be the length of that substring.

But is that always better than moving the '1' past the '0's one by one?

Let's say I have "1000".

Option 1: Move the '1' past each '0' individually.

- Choose [1,2]: "10" → "01", costing 2.

- Now s = "0100"

- Choose [2,3]: "10" → "01", costing 2.

- Now s = "0010"

- Choose [3,4]: "10" → "01", costing 2.

- Total cost: 6.

Option 2: Move the '1' past all '0's in one operation.

- Choose [1,4]: "1000" → "0001", costing 4.

- Total cost: 4, which is better than option 1.

So, grouping the operations can lead to a lower total cost.

In the earlier example, "101011", the code's approach gives a total cost of 6, but the example output is 5.

So, perhaps there's a better grouping.

Let's see.

In "101011", I need to move the first '1' past the first '0', and the second '1' past the third '0'.

Wait, let's identify all the '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

- The first '1' is at position 1, and there are two '0's after it (positions 2 and 4).

- The third '1' is at position 5, and there is one '0' after it (position 6).

So, in total, I need to move the first '1' past two '0's, and the third '1' past one '0'.

If I move the first '1' past both '0's in one operation, it would cost the length of the substring from position 1 to position 4, which is 4.

Then, move the third '1' past the sixth '0' by choosing substring from position 5 to 6, costing 2.

Total cost: 4 + 2 = 6, same as the code's approach.

Is there a better way?

Wait, maybe I can move both '1's in a single operation.

Let's see.

Choose substring from position 1 to 5: "10101" → "11010", costing 5.

Now, s becomes "110101".

Then, choose substring from position 4 to 6: "101" → "110", costing 3.

Now, s becomes "110110".

Then, choose substring from position 1 to 6: "110110" → "011111", costing 6.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which is worse.

Another approach:

Choose substring from position 1 to 6: "101011" → "110101", costing 6.

Then, choose substring from position 1 to 3: "110" → "011", costing 3.

Now, s becomes "011101".

Then, choose substring from position 4 to 6: "101" → "110", costing 3.

Now, s becomes "011110".

Then, choose substring from position 1 to 6: "011110" → "001111", costing 6.

Total cost: 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 = 18, worse.

Seems like the initial approach is better.

But the example output is 5, which is less than 6.

How is that possible?

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can find a sequence of operations that costs less.

Let's try:

1. Choose substring [1,3]: "101" → "110", costing 3.

- s becomes "110011"

2. Choose substring [4,6]: "011" → "110", costing 3.

- s becomes "110110"

3. Choose substring [3,5]: "011" → "110", costing 3.

- s becomes "111100"

Total cost: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is higher than 6.

Another sequence:

1. Choose substring [1,4]: "1010" → "0101", costing 4.

- s becomes "010111"

2. Choose substring [1,2]: "01" → "10", costing 2.

- s becomes "100111"

3. Choose substring [2,3]: "00" → "00", no change.

4. Choose substring [3,4]: "01" → "10", costing 2.

- s becomes "101011"

Wait, that's back to the original.

Not helpful.

Another attempt:

1. Choose substring [1,5]: "10101" → "11010", costing 5.

- s becomes "110101"

2. Choose substring [4,6]: "101" → "110", costing 3.

- s becomes "110110"

3. Choose substring [1,6]: "110110" → "011111", costing 6.

Total cost: 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, higher than 6.

Seems like the initial approach of swapping '1's and '0's individually gives a better cost.

But the example output is 5, which is less than 6.

Is there a mistake in the code's approach?

Wait, perhaps instead of swapping s[left] and s[right], I can perform a cyclic shift on the substring from left to right, which might achieve the same effect with a different cost.

But in the code, it's just swapping s[left] and s[right], which is equivalent to a cyclic shift of the substring from left to right.

Wait, no, a cyclic shift is not just swapping two elements; it's rotating the substring.

But in the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is different from performing a cyclic shift on the substring from left to right.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in its implementation.

Let me think about what a cyclic shift actually does.

Given a substring from left to right, cyclic shift means moving the last character to the front, and shifting others to the right by one position.

For example, substring "101" (positions 1 to 3):

- Cyclic shift: move the last character '1' to the front, so it becomes "110".

Similarly, "10" becomes "01".

So, in some cases, it's equivalent to swapping the first and the last characters.

But in general, it's rotating the substring.

So, perhaps I can model this operation as swapping the first and the last characters of the substring, but that might not always be accurate.

Wait, in the code, it's swapping s[left] and s[right], which is similar to performing a cyclic shift on the substring from left to right if the substring has length 2.

But for longer substrings, it's not the same.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect because it's not actually performing a cyclic shift, but just swapping two characters.

But according to the problem, the operation is a cyclic shift of a substring, not necessarily a swap.

So, perhaps the code doesn't correctly simulate the allowed operations.

Hence, the code might be incorrect.

But in the first test case, it gives the correct output.

In the third test case, it gives the correct output.

But in the fourth test case, it gives a higher cost than the example.

Hence, the code is not optimal.

So, Correctness: False.

But I need to think more carefully.

Maybe there's a different way to interpret the operations.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula to calculate the minimal cost directly.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I want to move all the '1's to the end of the string.

Each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0' can be moved in a group with other '1's, and the cost is the number of positions it moves.

But it's more complicated because the operations allow shifting substrings cyclically.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of inversions, where an inversion is a '1' that appears before a '0'.

Each inversion needs to be resolved, and each operation can resolve multiple inversions at once.

The cost of an operation is the length of the substring shifted.

I need to group the inversions in a way that minimizes the total cost.

This seems similar to the problem of sorting a permutation with block moves or rotations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as counting the number of positions where the string differs from the sorted string and find a way to fix those positions with minimal cost.

Let me try that.

The sorted string would be all '0's followed by all '1's.

Let's say in the string, the positions where it differs from the sorted string are the positions where '1's are before the supposed transition point from '0's to '1's.

So, to make the string sorted, I need to move all the '1's that are before the transition to after the transition.

Each '1' that needs to be moved can be moved in a group with other '1's, and the cost is the number of positions it covers.

But I
