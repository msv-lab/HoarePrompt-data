Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: one that takes 1x1 cell and another that takes 2x2 cells (which would be 4 cells).

The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and icons can't overlap.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked.

Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 5 x 3 = 15 cells.

There are x applications with 1x1 icons and y applications with 2x2 icons.

A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

I need to find the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons without overlapping.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to calculate how many cells are needed in total and then divide by the number of cells per screen. But it's not that straightforward because of the 2x2 icons.

Since 2x2 icons take up 4 cells, and they have to be placed in a way that they don't overlap, I need to consider their placement on the grid.

Let's consider the screen grid:

Each screen is 5 rows by 3 columns.

So, the grid looks like this:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy 4 consecutive cells in a square. Given the grid's dimensions, we need to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into one screen.

Looking at the grid, in a 5x3 grid, how many 2x2 squares can be placed?

Let's see:

- In rows, from row 1 to row 4 (since 2 rows are needed for 2x2), and in columns from column 1 to column 2 (since 2 columns are needed for 2x2).

So, number of possible 2x2 positions:

- Starting at (1,1), (1,2)

- Starting at (2,1), (2,2)

- Starting at (3,1), (3,2)

- Starting at (4,1), (4,2)

So, total 4 possible 2x2 positions per screen.

Wait, let me visualize this.

Grid:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

10 11 12

13 14 15

A 2x2 square can be placed starting at positions:

- Top-left: cells 1,2,4,5

- Top-middle: cells 2,3,5,6

- Middle-left: cells 4,5,7,8

- Middle-middle: cells 5,6,8,9

- Bottom-left: cells 7,8,10,11

- Bottom-middle: cells 8,9,10,12

- Etc.

Wait, but in a 5x3 grid, not all positions are possible because the grid isn't square.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many 2x2 icons can fit into one screen, considering their placements.

Looking at the example in the problem, it seems that up to 3 or 4 2x2 icons can be placed per screen, but I need to confirm.

Wait, in a 5x3 grid, the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can be placed without overlapping is 2.

Because each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and there are 15 cells per screen.

But let's see:

If I place one 2x2 icon starting at cell 1 (cells 1,2,4,5), then another starting at cell 7 (cells 7,8,10,11), and perhaps another starting at cell 13 (cells 13,14,15).

Wait, but cell 15 is only one cell, so it can't form a 2x2 with others.

Wait, cell 13,14,15 are in the last row, which only has 3 cells, so it's not possible to place a 2x2 starting there.

So, perhaps only two 2x2 icons per screen.

Let me check:

- First 2x2 at cells 1,2,4,5

- Second 2x2 at cells 7,8,10,11

- That would leave cells 3,6,9,12,13,14,15 unused.

So, only two 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, it shows different placements.

Looking back at the problem's example, it shows a grid with one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a mix of 2x2 and 1x1 icons.

So, the idea is to maximize the use of 2x2 icons first, since they take up more space, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

But, considering the grid's constraints, I need to find an optimal way to place them.

Perhaps, I should calculate how many 2x2 icons can be placed per screen, and then see how many screens are needed for y 2x2 icons, and then see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining space.

Wait, but it's not that simple because the placement of 2x2 icons affects where 1x1 icons can be placed.

Alternatively, I can calculate the total number of cells required: x * 1 + y * 4, and then divide by the number of cells per screen (15), but this doesn't account for the fact that 2x2 icons must be placed in specific positions.

So, perhaps a better approach is to iterate through the screens and place as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

But that might be too time-consuming for a programming problem, especially since t can be up to 10^4.

I need a formula or a mathematical way to calculate the minimum number of screens needed.

Let me think differently.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

Wait, in the earlier example, with two 2x2 icons placed, there are cells 3,6,9,12,13,14,15 left, which are 7 cells available for 1x1 icons.

So, per screen:

- If I place 2 2x2 icons, I use 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If I place 1 2x2 icon, I use 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If I place 0 2x2 icons, I can place up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps the strategy is to place as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then use the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

But, I need to minimize the number of screens used.

So, I should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.

Wait, but in reality, placing two 2x2 icons per screen leaves 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Placing one 2x2 icon leaves 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Placing zero 2x2 icons leaves 15 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen, depending on how many 2x2 icons are placed, the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Now, to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the usage of each screen, i.e., place as many icons as possible per screen.

So, I should try to place two 2x2 icons per screen whenever possible, and then handle the remaining 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons.

Let me formalize this.

Let's say I have y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons.

First, I can calculate how many screens are needed just for the 2x2 icons.

Since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, I need to account for the 1x1 icons.

Each screen that holds two 2x2 icons can hold up to 7 1x1 icons.

Each screen that holds one 2x2 icon can hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

Each screen that holds zero 2x2 icons can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, I need to distribute the 2x2 icons and 1x1 icons across the screens in a way that minimizes the total number of screens.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the total number of cells required: x * 1 + y * 4.

And the total number of cells available per screen is 15.

So, the minimum number of screens needed would be ceil((x + 4*y) / 15).

But, this doesn't take into account that 2x2 icons must be placed in specific positions, i.e., they need a 2x2 block, not just any 4 cells.

So, this might not be accurate.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I need to consider the placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.

Given that, maybe I should calculate how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons, and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons first, and then see how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

So, number of screens for 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2), since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, for each of these screens, if it holds two 2x2 icons, it uses 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If it holds one 2x2 icon, it uses 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If it holds zero 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 1x1 icons placed on the screens that have 2x2 icons.

In other words, I should place as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then see how many 1x1 icons can be placed on those screens along with the 2x2 icons.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let screens_for_2x2 = ceil(y / 2)

Then, total 2x2 icons placed on these screens: y

Total cells used by 2x2 icons: y * 4

Total cells available on these screens: screens_for_2x2 * 15

Remaining cells on these screens after placing 2x2 icons: screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4

Then, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens is min(x, screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4)

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons that need their own screens: x - (screens_for_2x2 * 15 - y * 4)

Wait, this seems a bit off.

Let me think again.

If I have screens_for_2x2 screens, each holding up to two 2x2 icons, and possibly some 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen:

- If it has two 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 7 1x1 icons.

- If it has one 2x2 icon, it can hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

- If it has no 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize the total number of screens, I should maximize the number of 1x1 icons placed on the screens that have 2x2 icons.

In other words, for each screen that has two 2x2 icons, I can place up to 7 1x1 icons.

So, the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on the screens_with_2x2 is screens_for_2x2 * 7

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons that need their own screens are x - (screens_for_2x2 * 7)

Then, the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil((x - screens_for_2x2 * 7) / 15)

So, total screens needed would be screens_for_2x2 + ceil((x - screens_for_2x2 * 7) / 15)

But, I need to make sure that y is handled correctly.

Wait, but y might not be completely used up by screens_for_2x2.

Wait, no, screens_for_2x2 is ceil(y / 2), so it can hold up to screens_for_2x2 * 2 2x2 icons.

But if y is not a multiple of 2, some screens might have only one 2x2 icon.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the calculation.

Let me consider that some screens have two 2x2 icons and some have one.

Let's calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Let screens_with_two = y // 2

Let screens_with_one = y % 2

Total screens_for_2x2 = screens_with_two + screens_with_one

Then, the total capacity for 1x1 icons on these screens is:

(screens_with_two * 7) + (screens_with_one * 11)

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons that need their own screens are x - (screens_with_two * 7 + screens_with_one * 11)

Then, the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil((x - (screens_with_two * 7 + screens_with_one * 11)) / 15)

Finally, total screens = screens_for_2x2 + ceil((x - (screens_with_two * 7 + screens_with_one * 11)) / 15)

This seems more accurate.

But, in terms of implementation, it might be a bit involved, especially since y can be up to 99 and x up to 99, and t up to 10^4, so efficiency is key.

Let me see if there's a simpler way.

Looking back at the problem's example, where x=1, y=1, the output is 1.

In this case:

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 1

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 1*11 = 11

Remaining 1x1 icons: 1 - 11 = -10, which is less than 0, so 0 remaining

Total screens: 1 + ceil((1 - 11)/15) = 1 + ceil(-10/15) = 1 + 0 = 1

Which matches the example.

Another example: x=7, y=2

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

screens_with_two = 1

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 1*7 + 0*11 = 7

Remaining 1x1 icons: 7 - 7 = 0

Total screens: 1 + ceil(0/15) = 1 + 0 = 1

Which matches the second example.

Another example: x=12, y=4

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

screens_with_two = 2

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 2*7 + 0*11 = 14

Remaining 1x1 icons: 12 - 14 = -2, which is less than 0, so 0 remaining

Total screens: 2 + ceil(-2/15) = 2 + 0 = 2

Which matches the third example.

Seems correct so far.

Let me check another example: x=0, y=3

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

screens_with_two = 1

screens_with_one = 1

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 1*7 + 1*11 = 18

Remaining 1x1 icons: 0 - 18 = -18, which is less than 0, so 0 remaining

Total screens: 2 + ceil(0/15) = 2 + 0 = 2

Which matches the fourth example.

Another example: x=1, y=0

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 0*11 = 0

Remaining 1x1 icons: 1 - 0 = 1

Total screens: 0 + ceil(1 / 15) = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the fifth example.

Another example: x=8, y=1

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 1

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 1*11 = 11

Remaining 1x1 icons: 8 - 11 = -3, which is less than 0, so 0 remaining

Total screens: 1 + ceil(-3/15) = 1 + 0 = 1

Which matches the sixth example.

Another example: x=0, y=0

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 0*11 = 0

Remaining 1x1 icons: 0 - 0 = 0

Total screens: 0 + ceil(0 / 15) = 0 + 0 = 0

Which matches the seventh example.

Another example: x=2, y=0

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 0*11 = 0

Remaining 1x1 icons: 2 - 0 = 2

Total screens: 0 + ceil(2 / 15) = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the eighth example.

Another example: x=15, y=0

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(0 / 2) = 0

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 0*11 = 0

Remaining 1x1 icons: 15 - 0 = 15

Total screens: 0 + ceil(15 / 15) = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the ninth example.

Another example: x=8, y=2

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

screens_with_two = 1

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 1*7 + 0*11 = 7

Remaining 1x1 icons: 8 - 7 = 1

Total screens: 1 + ceil(1 / 15) = 1 + 1 = 2

Which matches the tenth example.

Another example: x=0, y=9

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

screens_with_two = 4

screens_with_one = 1

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 4*7 + 1*11 = 28 + 11 = 39

Remaining 1x1 icons: 0 - 39 = -39, which is less than 0, so 0 remaining

Total screens: 5 + ceil(0 / 15) = 5 + 0 = 5

Which matches the eleventh example.

So, this approach seems to work for all the examples provided.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given Program:

import math

func_1()

def func_1():

ap = int(input())

for k in range(ap):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

if x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x == 0 and y > 0:

print(math.ceil(y / 2))

elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(x / 15))

else:

print(0)

Let's analyze this.

First, it reads the number of test cases, ap.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

If x > 0 and y > 0:

- Calculate bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

- Update x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

- Calculate bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

- Print bxsfory1 + bxsfory

Else if x == 0 and y > 0:

- Print ceil(y / 2)

Else if x > 0 and y == 0:

- Print ceil(x / 15)

Else:

- Print 0

Wait, in the update step for x, it does x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

I need to understand what this is doing.

Let's see.

bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

This is the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons.

Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

What does this mean?

bxsfory * 15 is the total cells available on bxsfory screens.

y * 4 is the total cells used by y 2x2 icons.

So, x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

Which is x - (cells available for 1x1 icons on screens_with_2x2)

Then, bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

This seems to be calculating the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Finally, total screens = bxsfory1 + bxsfory

This seems similar to the approach I thought earlier.

But let's verify with an example.

Take x=1, y=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the first example.

Another example: x=7, y=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 7 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the second example.

Another example: x=12, y=4

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Which matches the third example.

Another example: x=0, y=3

bxsfory = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

x = 0 - 2*15 + 3*4 = 0 - 30 + 12 = -18

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Which matches the fourth example.

Seems correct so far.

Another example: x=1, y=0

Here, x > 0 and y == 0, so it prints ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Which matches the fifth example.

Another example: x=8, y=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the sixth example.

Another example: x=0, y=0

Prints 0, which matches the seventh example.

Another example: x=2, y=0

Prints ceil(2 / 15) = 1, which matches the eighth example.

Another example: x=15, y=0

Prints ceil(15 / 15) = 1, which matches the ninth example.

Another example: x=8, y=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

Since x > 0, bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the tenth example.

Another example: x=0, y=9

bxsfory = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

x = 0 - 5*15 + 9*4 = 0 - 75 + 36 = -39

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 5 = 5, which matches the eleventh example.

So, all examples seem to match.

Now, let's see if this logic is correct in general.

Let me consider a case where y is such that screens_with_two and screens_with_one are both greater than zero.

Let's say x=10, y=3

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

screens_with_two = 1

screens_with_one = 1

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 1*7 + 1*11 = 18

Remaining 1x1 icons: 10 - 18 = -8, which is less than 0, so 0 remaining

Total screens: 2 + ceil(0 / 15) = 2 + 0 = 2

According to the program:

bxsfory = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

x = 10 - 2*15 + 3*4 = 10 - 30 + 12 = -8

Since x <= 0, bxsfory1 = 0

Total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Which matches.

Another case: x=20, y=2

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

screens_with_two = 1

screens_with_one = 0

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 1*7 + 0*11 = 7

Remaining 1x1 icons: 20 - 7 = 13

Additional screens needed: ceil(13 / 15) = 1

Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2

According to the program:

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 20 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 20 - 15 + 8 = 13

Since x > 0, bxsfory1 = ceil(13 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Which matches.

Another case: x=16, y=1

screens_for_2x2 = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

screens_with_two = 0

screens_with_one = 1

Capacity for 1x1 icons: 0*7 + 1*11 = 11

Remaining 1x1 icons: 16 - 11 = 5

Additional screens needed: ceil(5 / 15) = 1

Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2

According to the program:

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 16 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 16 - 15 + 4 = 5

Since x > 0, bxsfory1 = ceil(5 / 15) = 1

Total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Which matches.

Seems consistent.

Let me try a case where y is zero and x is less than 15.

x=14, y=0

screens_for_2
