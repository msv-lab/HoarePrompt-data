Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's a 5x3 grid. Each cell in the grid can hold at most one icon.

There are two types of applications:

1. Applications with 1x1 icons, which take up one cell each.

2. Applications with 2x2 icons, which take up a square of four cells.

Given the number of each type of application (x for 1x1 and y for 2x2), I need to figure out the minimum number of screens required to fit all the icons.

First, I need to understand the constraints and how the icons fit into the grid.

Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen.

Now, 1x1 icons take one cell each, and 2x2 icons take four cells each.

But it's not as simple as just dividing the total number of cells needed by 15 because the way you arrange the icons affects how many screens you use.

I need to think about how to maximize the usage of each screen to minimize the number of screens required.

Let me consider the screen grid:

A 5x3 grid looks like this:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy a block of four cells that are adjacent both horizontally and vertically.

For example, cells 1,2,4,5 or cells 2,3,5,6, etc.

But in a 5x3 grid, not all cells can accommodate a 2x2 icon because of the grid's dimensions.

Specifically, the bottom row (rows 4 and 5) and the rightmost column (columns 2 and 3) may have restrictions.

Wait, no. Since it's a 5x3 grid, the possible positions for 2x2 icons are limited.

Let me try to count how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

In a 5x3 grid:

- The top-left 2x2 block: cells 1,2,4,5

- The top-middle 2x2 block: cells 2,3,5,6

- The middle-left 2x2 block: cells 4,5,7,8

- The middle-middle 2x2 block: cells 5,6,8,9

- The bottom-left 2x2 block: cells 7,8,10,11

- The bottom-middle 2x2 block: cells 8,9,11,12

- The middle-right 2x2 block: cells 5,6,8,9 (already counted)

- Etc.

Wait, maybe I should think differently.

In a 5x3 grid, how many non-overlapping 2x2 blocks can be placed?

Given that each 2x2 block occupies four cells, and the grid has 15 cells, but due to overlapping restrictions, not all blocks can be placed independently.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps I should calculate the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into a screen without overlapping, and then see how many screens are needed based on that.

Let me try to visualize or sketch possible arrangements.

Option 1:

Place one 2x2 icon in the top-left corner: cells 1,2,4,5

Then, the remaining cells are 3,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.

Can I place another 2x2 icon in the top-middle: cells 2,3,5,6

But cells 2 and 5 are already occupied by the first icon, so no.

Option 2:

Place one 2x2 icon in the top-left: cells 1,2,4,5

Then, place another 2x2 icon in the middle-left: cells 7,8,10,11

Now, cells 7,8,10,11 are occupied.

Remaining cells: 3,6,9,12,13,14,15.

Can I place another 2x2 icon? Let's see.

Possible positions:

- cells 3,6,9,12

But looking at the grid:

Row 1: 1,2,3

Row 2: 4,5,6

Row 3: 7,8,9

Row 4: 10,11,12

Row 5: 13,14,15

So, cells 3,6,9,12 form a 2x2 block in the rightmost column.

But wait, cells 3,6,9,12 are not adjacent in a 2x2 square because they are in different rows.

Wait, 2x2 icons need to occupy a contiguous 2x2 block.

So, cells 3,4,6,7 would be a 2x2 block.

But cell 4 is already occupied by the first 2x2 icon, so no.

Alternatively, cells 9,10,12,13.

Cell 10 is occupied, so no.

Seems like only two 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen without overlapping.

Wait, let's try another arrangement.

Place one 2x2 icon in the top-left: cells 1,2,4,5

Place another 2x2 icon in the bottom-left: cells 7,8,10,11

Now, can I place a third 2x2 icon?

Looking at the remaining cells: 3,6,9,12,13,14,15.

Is there a 2x2 block available?

Cells 3,6,9,12: but these are not contiguous in a 2x2 square.

Cells 13,14,15 don't have enough space for a 2x2 icon.

So, seems like only two 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

Is there a better arrangement that allows more than two 2x2 icons per screen?

Let me try placing only one 2x2 icon per screen.

If I place one 2x2 icon, it takes up four cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if I place two 2x2 icons, they take up eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

If I place three 2x2 icons, that would require 12 cells, but in the previous arrangement, only two fit without overlapping.

Wait, maybe it's not possible to place three 2x2 icons without overlapping.

So, per screen, maximum two 2x2 icons can be placed.

Now, for the 1x1 icons, they can be placed in the remaining cells.

So, for each screen:

- If no 2x2 icons are placed, maximum 15 1x1 icons can be placed.

- If one 2x2 icon is placed, it takes four cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If two 2x2 icons are placed, they take eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

Now, the goal is to minimize the number of screens used.

To minimize screens, we should maximize the number of icons placed per screen.

So, we should prefer placing two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons per screen.

Each such screen can handle two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, totaling 11 icons.

But wait, two 2x2 icons take eight cells, and seven 1x1 icons take seven cells, totaling 15 cells, which fits perfectly into one screen.

Wait, but in reality, can we really fit two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons without overlapping?

From earlier, when placing two 2x2 icons, there are seven cells left, which can all be used for 1x1 icons.

So, yes, each screen can handle two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

Therefore, per screen:

- Up to two 2x2 icons.

- Up to seven 1x1 icons.

But in terms of total icons, it's not just the sum because the 2x2 icons count as one icon but take more cells.

Wait, no. Each 2x2 icon is one icon, taking four cells, and each 1x1 icon is one icon taking one cell.

So, per screen:

- Maximum two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, totaling nine icons (2 + 7 = 9).

But in terms of cells: 2*4 + 7*1 = 8 + 7 = 15 cells, which fits perfectly.

Wait, but in the example provided, it seems different.

Wait, in the first test case:

1 1

Output: 1

That is, one screen can handle one 1x1 icon and one 2x2 icon.

In the third test case:

12 4

Output: 2

So, two screens can handle twelve 1x1 icons and four 2x2 icons.

Let me see:

In one screen:

- Two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, for four 2x2 icons, we would need at least three screens (since two screens can hold four 2x2 icons: two per screen).

But in the third test case, with twelve 1x1 and four 2x2 icons, it's said that two screens are enough.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me recalculate.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon takes four cells.

Each 1x1 icon takes one cell.

So, for y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, the total cells needed are 4y + x.

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, naively, the number of screens required would be ceil((4y + x)/15).

But, due to the way 2x2 icons must be placed without overlapping, it's not that simple.

Because you can't just pack any number of 2x2 icons as long as their total cell count is less than or equal to 15.

You have to consider the grid layout and where the 2x2 icons can be placed.

From earlier, in one screen, you can place at most two 2x2 icons without overlapping.

So, perhaps a better approach is:

- Calculate how many screens are needed just for the 2x2 icons, considering that each screen can hold at most two 2x2 icons.

- Then, calculate the remaining cells needed for the 1x1 icons across all screens.

Wait, but we need to minimize the number of screens.

So, perhaps it's better to maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, up to two per screen, and then see how many screens are needed based on that.

But in the third test case, with y=4, which is an even number, and x=12, it says that two screens are enough.

If each screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, then:

- Two screens can hold four 2x2 icons and fourteen 1x1 icons.

But x=12, which is less than fourteen, so it fits.

Hence, two screens are sufficient.

Similarly, in the first test case:

x=1, y=1

One screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, but we only have one of each, so one screen is enough.

In the second test case:

x=7, y=2

One screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, which matches exactly, so one screen is enough.

In the fourth test case:

x=0, y=3

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons, so one screen can hold two, and the second screen can hold the remaining one, so two screens are needed.

In the fifth test case:

x=1, y=0

One screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons, so one screen is enough.

In the sixth test case:

x=8, y=1

One screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, but we only have one 2x2 icon and eight 1x1 icons.

So, place one 2x2 icon and seven 1x1 icons on the first screen, and one 1x1 icon on the second screen, but actually, since one screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, but we only have one 2x2 icon and eight 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in this arrangement, total cells used: 4*1 + 1*8 = 12 cells.

Since one screen has 15 cells, it can accommodate this.

But according to the earlier approach, it would be one screen.

But according to the provided program, it's handled differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the provided program to understand how it's calculating.

But let's first try to derive a formula.

Let me try to generalize.

Let me denote:

- Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

- Each screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons if two 2x2 icons are placed.

- Or, if only one 2x2 icon is placed, it can hold up to eleven 1x1 icons.

- Or, if no 2x2 icons are placed, it can hold up to fifteen 1x1 icons.

But to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, up to two per screen.

So, the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, for the 1x1 icons, we have x icons to place.

Each screen can hold up to:

- If two 2x2 icons are placed: seven 1x1 icons.

- If one 2x2 icon is placed: eleven 1x1 icons.

- If no 2x2 icons are placed: fifteen 1x1 icons.

But since we want to minimize screens, we should maximize the number of icons per screen.

So, for each screen that has two 2x2 icons, it can hold seven 1x1 icons.

For screens with one 2x2 icon, they can hold eleven 1x1 icons.

And screens with no 2x2 icons can hold fifteen 1x1 icons.

So, to minimize screens, we should maximize the number of screens with two 2x2 icons.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2).

Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons that need to be placed after accounting for the screens used for 2x2 icons.

But it's a bit more involved because the screens used for 2x2 icons can also hold some 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of screens as the maximum between the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the screens needed for 1x1 icons, considering the overlapping capacity.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the total cells required and the cells available per screen, but considering the constraints on how 2x2 icons can be placed.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I should look for a better approach.

Let me consider the total number of cells required: 4y + x.

And the total number of cells per screen: 15.

But simply dividing (4y + x)/15 and taking ceil might not work because of the arrangement constraints.

For example, in the third test case:

x=12, y=4

Total cells required: 4*4 + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28 cells.

28 / 15 = 1.866, ceil to 2 screens.

Which matches the sample output.

In the sixth test case:

x=8, y=1

Total cells: 4*1 + 8 = 12 cells.

12 / 15 = 0.8, ceil to 1 screen.

Which should be correct, but according to my earlier thought, it would require one screen for the 2x2 icon and seven 1x1 icons, and another for the remaining one 1x1 icon, totaling two screens, but the sample output is one screen.

Wait, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, in the sixth test case, with x=8 and y=1, total cells are 4*1 + 8*1 = 12 cells.

Since one screen has 15 cells, it can accommodate this.

But earlier I thought that one screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, but in this case, there's only one 2x2 icon and eight 1x1 icons.

So, placing one 2x2 icon takes four cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, eight 1x1 icons can easily fit into the remaining 11 cells.

Hence, one screen is sufficient.

So, perhaps the formula is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: ceil(y / 2).

- Then, calculate the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons in these screens: (number of screens) * (15 - 4 * min(2, y)).

- If the remaining cells are enough for x 1x1 icons, then the number of screens is sufficient.

- If not, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Wait, perhaps it's getting too complicated.

Let me look at the provided program to understand how it's implemented.

The program is:

import math

func_1()

def func_1():

ap = int(input())

for k in range(ap):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

if x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x == 0 and y > 0:

print(math.ceil(y / 2))

elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(x / 15))

else:

print(0)

Wait, this seems incorrect.

In the first test case:

x=1, y=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

bxsfory1 = 0 (since x <= 0)

print(0 + 1) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

In the third test case:

x=12, y=4

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 2) = 2

Which matches the sample output.

In the sixth test case:

x=8, y=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 1) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case:

x=0, y=3

bxsfory = ceil(3 / 2) = 2

x = 0 - 2*15 + 3*4 = 0 - 30 + 12 = -18

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 2) = 2

Which matches the sample output.

In the fifth test case:

x=1, y=0

It falls into the elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(1 / 15)) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

In the seventh test case:

x=0, y=0

print(0)

Which matches the sample output.

In the eighth test case:

x=2, y=0

print(math.ceil(2 / 15)) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

In the ninth test case:

x=15, y=0

print(math.ceil(15 / 15)) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

In the tenth test case:

x=8, y=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

print(1 + 1) = 2

Which matches the sample output.

In the eleventh test case:

x=0, y=9

bxsfory = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

x = 0 - 5*15 + 9*4 = 0 - 75 + 36 = -39

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 5) = 5

Which matches the sample output.

So, based on the sample inputs and outputs, the program seems to be correct.

But I'm still a bit confused about the logic behind it.

Let me try to understand the formula used in the program.

In the case where x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

This calculates the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This part is tricky.

It seems like it's calculating the remaining x after accounting for the screens used for 2x2 icons.

But why subtract bxsfory * 15 and add y * 4?

Wait, perhaps it's trying to calculate the remaining x after considering that each screen used for 2x2 icons can also hold some x.

Wait, maybe it's a mistake.

Wait, perhaps it should be x - bxsfory * 7, since each screen with two 2x2 icons can hold seven 1x1 icons.

But according to the program, it's x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

This seems off.

Maybe the author intended to calculate the remaining x after placing y 2x2 icons and seeing how many x are left after considering the screens used.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the author is calculating the total cells used by y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, and then seeing how many screens are needed based on 15 cells per screen.

Wait, 2x2 icons use four cells each, and 1x1 icons use one cell each.

So total cells needed are 4y + x.

Then, the number of screens needed would be ceil((4y + x)/15).

But in the program, it's doing something different.

It's calculating bxsfory = ceil(y / 2), which is the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

Then, it's adjusting x by subtracting bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo or mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe the author intended to calculate the remaining x after placing the 2x2 icons on the screens.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose we allocate screens for the 2x2 icons first, with each screen holding up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Each such screen can also hold some 1x1 icons.

Specifically, each screen with two 2x2 icons can hold seven 1x1 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed along with the 2x2 icons are bxsfory * 7.

Then, the remaining x after placing these would be x - bxsfory * 7.

If x - bxsfory * 7 > 0, then additional screens are needed for the remaining x 1x1 icons.

The number of additional screens needed would be ceil((x - bxsfory * 7)/15).

Then, the total number of screens would be bxsfory + ceil((x - bxsfory * 7)/15).

But in the program, it's doing x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

Which seems different.

Wait, perhaps the author is trying to calculate the total cells used by y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, and then subtracting the cells available in the screens allocated for 2x2 icons.

But it's getting too convoluted.

Maybe I should consider that the formula in the program is incorrect, but somehow it's producing the correct output for the sample inputs.

Wait, in the first test case:

x=1, y=1

bxsfory = 1

x = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 1

Which is correct.

In the third test case:

x=12, y=4

bxsfory = 2

x = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 2

Which is correct.

In the sixth test case:

x=8, y=1

bxsfory = 1

x = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 1

Which is correct.

In the fourth test case:

x=0, y=3

bxsfory = 2

x = 0 - 30 + 12 = -18

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 2

Which is correct.

In the fifth test case:

x=1, y=0

It falls into the elif clause and prints ceil(1/15)=1

Which is correct.

In the seventh test case:

x=0, y=0

prints 0

Which is correct.

In the eighth test case:

x=2, y=0

prints ceil(2/15)=1

Which is correct.

In the ninth test case:

x=15, y=0

prints ceil(15/15)=1

Which is correct.

In the tenth test case:

x=8, y=2

bxsfory = 1

x = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

bxsfory1 = ceil(1/15)=1

total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Which is correct.

In the eleventh test case:

x=0, y=9

bxsfory = 5

x = 0 - 75 + 36 = -39

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 5

Which is correct.

So, despite my confusion about the formula, the program seems to be producing the correct outputs for the given samples.

Perhaps there's a underlying logic that I'm missing.

Alternatively, maybe the program is just coincidentally giving the correct outputs for these particular test cases, but is actually flawed.

To check this, let's try some additional test cases.

Test case 1:

x=7, y=2

According to the program:

bxsfory = ceil(2/2)=1

x = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Test case 2:

x=14, y=2

bxsfory = 1

x = 14 - 15 + 8 = 7

bxsfory1 = ceil(7/15)=1

total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Is this correct?

Let's see:

Total cells needed: 4*2 + 14 = 8 + 14 = 22 cells.

Each screen has 15 cells.

22 / 15 = 1.466, so ceil to 2 screens.

Which matches the program's output.

Another test case:

x=1, y=0

Program output: 1 (which is correct).

x=0, y=1

Program output: 1 (which is correct).

x=0, y=2

Program output: 1 (correct).

x=0, y=3

Program output: 2 (correct).

x=0, y=4

Program output: 2 (correct).

x=1, y=1

Program output: 1 (correct).

x=2, y=1

bxsfory = 1

x = 2 - 15 + 4 = -9

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 1

Is this correct?

Total cells: 4*1 + 2 = 6 cells.

One screen can easily hold this.

So, yes, correct.

Another test case:

x=15, y=1

bxsfory = 1

x = 15 - 15 + 4 = 4

bxsfory1 = ceil(4/15)=1

total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Is this correct?

Total cells: 4*1 + 15 = 19 cells.

19 / 15 = 1.266, ceil to 2 screens.

Yes, correct.

Another test case:

x=14, y=3

bxsfory = ceil(3/2)=2

x = 14 - 30 + 12 = -4

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 2

Is this correct?

Total cells: 4*3 + 14 = 12 + 14 = 26 cells.

26 / 15 = 1.733, ceil to 2 screens.

Yes, correct.

Seems like the program is giving correct outputs for these test cases.

Perhaps there's a smarter way to calculate it, but the program seems to work.

Alternatively, maybe a simpler formula is to calculate the total cells needed (4y + x) and then take ceil((4y + x)/15).

But in the earlier thought, I considered that due to the arrangement constraints, it might not be that straightforward.

However, looking at the sample inputs and additional test cases, the program seems to be correct.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.
