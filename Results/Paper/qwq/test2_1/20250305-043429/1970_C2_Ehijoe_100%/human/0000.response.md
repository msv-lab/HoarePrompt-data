Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game on a tree where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to another, activating nodes as they go. The game ends when a player can't make a move, and that player loses. I need to figure out who wins each round if they both play optimally.

First, let's understand the problem properly. We have a tree with n nodes, and the game consists of t rounds. In each round, the stone starts on a specific node, and players alternate moves until no more moves are possible. The player who can't move loses. Importantly, the tree remains the same for all rounds, but the starting node changes.

Given that t=1 in this medium version, I only need to determine the winner for one starting node. The tree is represented by n-1 edges, and the starting node for the round is given.

I need to think about how to model this game and determine the winner based on the starting node. Since it's a tree, there are no cycles, and each pair of nodes is connected by exactly one path.

Let me consider the properties of the game:

1. **Activation Rule**: A node is activated when the stone is placed on it, and once activated, it can't be used again.

2. **Move Definition**: A move consists of moving the stone from the current node to an inactive neighbor.

3. **Game End**: The game ends when the current player can't make a valid move.

4. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure victory.

Given that, I need to determine who wins starting from a given node.

I recall that in game theory, particularly in impartial games like this, the concept of "Nimbers" or "grundy numbers" can be used to determine the winner. However, since this is a tree and the game is played on its structure, there might be a simpler way to determine the winner based on the tree's properties.

Let me think about the game in terms of graph theory. Each node can be seen as a position in the game, and edges represent possible moves.

I need to find out if the starting position is a winning position for the first player (Ron) or the second player (Hermione).

In game theory, a position is a winning position if the player whose turn it is can force a win. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

I need a way to classify each node as either a winning position or a losing position.

One approach is to perform a depth-first search (DFS) from each starting node and determine the game's outcome based on the subtree's properties.

Let me consider the base case: if a node is a leaf (has only one edge), and it's the starting node, then Ron can't make a move immediately, so Hermione wins.

Wait, no. If a node is a leaf and it's the starting node, Ron can't make any moves, so Ron loses immediately, and Hermione wins by default.

But in general, for a node with multiple children, Ron can choose to move to one of its unactivated neighbors.

Wait, but in this game, only the current position matters, and the history of activated nodes限制了可用的移动。

Actually, since nodes are activated once the stone is placed on them, and can't be used again, it's like moving on a decreasing tree, where previously visited nodes are removed from consideration.

But in this specific game, since only the current position matters, and the set of activated nodes determines the available moves, it's more about the structure of the tree from the current node.

I think I need to model this as an impartial game and compute the Grundy number for each node.

But that might be too time-consuming for large n (up to 2e5 nodes).

Is there a simpler way to determine the winner based on the tree's structure?

Let me consider the tree's diameter or some centrality measure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the parity of the number of moves.

Wait, in this game, the number of moves is equal to the number of nodes minus one, since each move activates a new node, and the game ends when all nodes are activated.

But no, that's not quite right. The game ends when the current player can't make a move, which happens when there are no inactive neighbors.

Wait, but in a tree, the number of moves can vary based on the path taken.

I need to think differently.

I recall that in impartial games, the mex (minimum excludant) of the Grundy values of the options determines the current position's value.

If the Grundy value of the starting position is non-zero, the first player wins; otherwise, the second player wins.

So, perhaps I can compute the Grundy value for each node.

But computing Grundy values for each node in a tree with 2e5 nodes might be inefficient.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the tree's structure. Since it's a tree, I can root it and then compute some values bottom-up.

Suppose I root the tree at the starting node.

Then, for each subtree, I can determine if it's a winning position or a losing position for the player whose turn it is.

Wait, but in this game, the active nodes are those that have been visited, so it's not just about the subtree but about the path taken.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of moves available.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the example provided.

Input:

5 1

1 2

1 3

3 4

3 5

1

Output:

Ron

So, the tree looks like this:

1 - 2

|

3 - 4

|

5

Starting at node 1.

From node 1, Ron can move to node 2 or node 3.

If Ron moves to node 2:

- Hermione can then move to node 1 (but node 1 is already active), so she can't move there.

- She can move to node 3.

- Then Ron can move to node 4 or node 5.

- Hermione can then move to the remaining node.

- Ron can't move again.

So, in this path, Hermione wins.

Wait, but the output is "Ron", so maybe there's another path where Ron can force a win.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible moves and see if Ron can force a win in at least one scenario.

This seems complex.

Let me think about the problem differently.

I recall that in impartial games played on graphs, the outcome can depend on the graph's structure, particularly its connectivity and cycles. But since this is a tree, there are no cycles.

Perhaps I can consider the tree's height or the number of leaves.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign values to nodes based on their distance from leaves.

Wait, perhaps I can perform a DFS and compute some value for each node based on its children.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I root the tree at the starting node.

Then, for each subtree, I can determine if it's a winning position or a losing position.

But I need to consider that the game is not just about the subtree but about the entire tree's state.

This seems tricky.

Let me look back at the code provided.

The code defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 seems to read input and call func_1.

func_1 takes nodes, start, and parent as arguments.

It checks if the node has only one neighbor, which is the parent, meaning it's a leaf.

In that case, it returns False.

Otherwise, it collects distances (which are the negations of recursive calls to func_1 on its children).

Then, it returns whether any of those distances is True.

Wait, but the code seems flawed.

In the example, with n=5, edges as given, and starting at node 1, func_1 is called with nodes, start=1, parent=None.

nodes[1] = [2,3]

So, it iterates over [2,3], excluding parent None.

For node 2:

nodes[2] = [1,3]

But parent is 1, so it considers node 3.

nodes[3] = [1,4,5]

Parent is 1, so considers nodes 4 and 5.

nodes[4] = [3]

Parent is 3, so it's a leaf, returns False.

Similarly, nodes[5] = [3], parent is 3, leaf, returns False.

So, distances = [not False, not False] = [True, True]

Then, any(distances) = True

So, func_1 returns True for node 3.

Then, for node 2:

nodes[2] = [1,3]

Parent is 1, so considers node 3.

func_1(nodes, 3, 2)

Which we already saw returns True.

So, distances = [not True] = [False]

any(distances) = False

So, func_1 returns False for node 2.

Then, for node 3:

nodes[3] = [1,4,5]

Parent is 1, so considers nodes 4 and 5.

Both return False, so distances = [not False, not False] = [True, True]

any(distances) = True

So, func_1 returns True for node 3.

Then, moves = any([True, False]) = True

So, prints "Ron"

Which matches the example.

But is this logic correct?

Let me try to understand what func_1 is doing.

It seems to be checking if there's any path from the starting node that leads to a winning position.

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=2, edges are 1-2, starting at node 1.

nodes[1]=[2]

nodes[2]=[1]

func_1(1, None):

nodes[1] has [2], parent None.

So, considers node 2.

distances = [not func_1(2,1)]

func_1(2,1):

nodes[2] has [1], parent is 1.

So, it's a leaf, returns False.

So, distances = [not False] = [True]

any([True]) = True

So, moves = True, Ron wins.

But in reality, starting at node 1, Ron moves to node 2, then Hermione can't move, so Ron should win.

Wait, but in this case, Ron wins, which matches the output.

Another example: n=3, edges 1-2 and 2-3, starting at node 2.

nodes[2] has [1,3]

func_1(2,None):

distances = [not func_1(1,2), not func_1(3,2)]

func_1(1,2):

nodes[1] has [2], parent 2, leaf, returns False

So, not False = True

func_1(3,2):

nodes[3] has [2], parent 2, leaf, returns False

So, not False = True

distances = [True, True]

any([True, True]) = True

So, moves = True, Ron wins.

But let's see:

Starting at node 2, Ron can move to node 1 or node 3.

If he moves to node 1, Hermione can't move (only neighbor is node 2, which is active), so Ron wins.

Similarly, if he moves to node 3, Hermione can't move (only neighbor is node 2, active), so Ron wins.

So, indeed, Ron wins.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=3, edges 1-2 and 1-3, starting at node 1.

func_1(1,None):

nodes[1] = [2,3]

distances = [not func_1(2,1), not func_1(3,1)]

func_1(2,1):

nodes[2] = [1], leaf, returns False

not False = True

func_1(3,1):

nodes[3] = [1], leaf, returns False

not False = True

distances = [True, True]

any([True, True]) = True

So, moves = True, Ron wins.

In reality, starting at node 1, Ron can move to node 2, then Hermione moves to node 3, then Ron can't move, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but according to the function, it says Ron wins.

This is inconsistent.

So, the function is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the function, it returns True, meaning Ron wins, but in reality, Ron loses if both play optimally.

So, the function is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Let me think again.

Starting at node 1:

- Ron can move to node 2 or node 3.

- If Ron moves to node 2:

- Hermione can then move to node 3.

- Ron can't move anymore.

- Hermione wins.

- If Ron moves to node 3:

- Hermione can then move to node 2.

- Ron can't move anymore.

- Hermione wins.

So, regardless of Ron's first move, Hermione wins.

But according to the function, it says Ron wins.

So, the function is incorrect.

Wait, but in the function, for node 1:

It checks nodes 2 and 3.

Both return False, so not False is True for both.

any([True, True]) = True, meaning Ron wins.

But in reality, Ron loses.

So, the function is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played on a tree, where two players, Ron and Hermione, take turns moving a stone to an inactive neighboring node until no more moves are possible. The player who cannot make a move loses.

## Approach

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - Determine if the starting node gives an advantage to Ron (first player) or Hermione (second player).
   - Use the concept of game theory where each position (node) is either a winning position or a losing position for the player who is about to move.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Implement a DFS to traverse the tree and compute the game outcome for each node.
   - Use memoization to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Outcome Calculation**:
   - For each node, check if there is at least one child node that is a losing position for the opponent. If such a child exists, the current node is a winning position; otherwise, it is a losing position.

## Solution Code

```python
def dfs(node, parent, nodes, memo):
    if node in memo:
        return memo[node]
    children = nodes[node]
    moves = [dfs(child, node, nodes, memo) for child in children if child != parent]
    # If there is at least one child where the opponent loses, current player wins
    memo[node] = any(not dfs(child, node, nodes, memo) for child in children if child != parent)
    return memo[node]

def determine_winner(n, edges, starts):
    from collections import defaultdict
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        nodes[u].append(v)
        nodes[v].append(u)
    memo = {}
    for start in starts:
        moves = dfs(start, None, nodes, memo)
        if moves:
            print('Ron')
        else:
            print('Hermione')

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    t = int(data[1])
    edges = []
    for i in range(n-1):
        u = int(data[2 + 2*i])
        v = int(data[3 + 2*i])
        edges.append((u, v))
    starts = list(map(int, data[2*n - 1: 2*n - 1 + t]))
    determine_winner(n, edges, starts)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - We use a dictionary to represent the adjacency list of the tree.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - We implement a DFS function that checks if the current node is a winning position for the player.
   - We use memoization to store the results of subproblems, avoiding redundant computations.

3. **Game Outcome**:
   - For each starting node, we use the DFS function to determine if Ron can force a win.
   - If the starting node is a winning position (i.e., there exists at least one move where Hermione is in a losing position), Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the winner for each starting position by leveraging the properties of tree structures and memoization.
