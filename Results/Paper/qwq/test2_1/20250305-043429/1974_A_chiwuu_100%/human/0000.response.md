Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each organized in a 5x3 grid, meaning each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making a total of 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take up 1x1 cells and others take up 2x2 cells. The 2x2 icons occupy a square of 4 cells, and each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible. So, I need to figure out how to arrange the x 1x1 icons and y 2x2 icons on these screens in such a way that minimizes the number of screens used.

First, I should understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each screen has 15 cells. A 1x1 icon uses one cell, and a 2x2 icon uses four cells. But since the screen is a 5x3 grid, I need to consider how these 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping and without going outside the grid boundaries.

Let me visualize the screen. It's 5 rows by 3 columns:

Row 1: Cell (1,1) | Cell (1,2) | Cell (1,3)

Row 2: Cell (2,1) | Cell (2,2) | Cell (2,3)

Row 3: Cell (3,1) | Cell (3,2) | Cell (3,3)

Row 4: Cell (4,1) | Cell (4,2) | Cell (4,3)

Row 5: Cell (5,1) | Cell (5,2) | Cell (5,3)

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four consecutive cells in a square fashion. For example, cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2) could be occupied by one 2x2 icon.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of icons (both 1x1 and 2x2) on each screen to minimize the number of screens used.

One approach could be to prioritize placing the 2x2 icons first since they occupy more space, and then fill the remaining spaces with 1x1 icons.

But I need to consider how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen. Given the screen is 5x3, let's see how many 2x2 squares can be placed without overlapping.

Looking at the grid:

- In row 1 and 2, I can place one 2x2 icon covering cells (1,1)-(2,2).

- In row 1 and 2, if I place one 2x2 icon, that leaves cells (1,3), (2,3), and the entire row 3,4,5.

- Alternatively, maybe there's a better arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screen.

Let me try to see:

If I place one 2x2 icon in the top-left corner: cells (1,1)-(2,2).

Then, I can place another 2x2 icon in cells (2,2)-(3,3), but wait, this overlaps with the first icon.

So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, place one 2x2 in cells (1,1)-(2,2), and another in cells (3,1)-(4,2).

That would occupy cells (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2).

Then, I could place a third 2x2 icon in cells (4,2)-(5,3).

But wait, cells (4,2) and (5,3) are part of the previous icon.

This seems tricky.

Maybe it's better to think in terms of how many 2x2 icons can fit into the screen without overlapping.

Let me try a different approach.

Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and the screen has 15 cells.

So, theoretically, maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is 15//4 = 3 icons, but I need to check if that's possible given the grid layout.

Looking back at the grid:

- Placing one 2x2 icon in cells (1,1)-(2,2).

- Another in cells (3,1)-(4,2).

- Another in cells (4,2)-(5,3).

Wait, but cells (4,2) are overlapping between the second and third icons.

So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively:

- Place one 2x2 in cells (1,1)-(2,2).

- Another in cells (2,2)-(3,3).

- Another in cells (3,3)-(4,3).

Wait, cells (3,3) and (4,3) can't form a 2x2 square.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I should try to find the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 squares in a 5x3 grid.

Let me try to draw it:

Screen:

Row 1: 1,1 | 1,2 | 1,3

Row 2: 2,1 | 2,2 | 2,3

Row 3: 3,1 | 3,2 | 3,3

Row 4: 4,1 | 4,2 | 4,3

Row 5: 5,1 | 5,2 | 5,3

One possible arrangement:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (2,2)-(3,3)

- 2x2 icon 3: cells (3,3)-(4,3)

Wait, but cells (3,3) and (4,3) don't form a 2x2 square.

Alternatively:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (3,1)-(4,2)

- 2x2 icon 3: cells (4,2)-(5,3)

But cells (4,2) are shared between icon 2 and 3, which isn't allowed.

It seems like only two 2x2 icons can fit without overlapping.

Let me try another arrangement:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (2,2)-(3,3)

- 2x2 icon 3: cells (4,1)-(5,2)

In this case, cells (2,2) are shared between icon 1 and 2, which isn't allowed.

So, it seems only two 2x2 icons can fit without overlapping.

Wait, maybe:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (3,1)-(4,2)

- 2x2 icon 3: cells (4,2)-(5,3)

But cells (4,2) are shared between icon 2 and 3.

Not possible.

Alternatively:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (2,2)-(3,3)

- 2x2 icon 3: cells (4,1)-(5,2)

Again, cells (2,2) are shared.

It seems like the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is two.

Let me confirm this.

Arrangement:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,1)-(2,2)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (3,1)-(4,2)

This uses cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2).

Remaining cells: (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), (5,3). That's six cells.

So, in this arrangement, two 2x2 icons and six 1x1 icons can be placed on one screen.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better arrangement that allows for more 2x2 icons.

Another arrangement:

- 2x2 icon 1: cells (1,2)-(2,3)

- 2x2 icon 2: cells (3,1)-(4,2)

- 2x2 icon 3: cells (4,2)-(5,3)

But again, cells (4,2) are shared between icon 2 and 3.

Not possible.

So, it seems that only two 2x2 icons can fit on one screen without overlapping.

Therefore, each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons in the remaining spaces.

Now, let's calculate how many screens are needed based on this.

Given y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons, and each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

First, calculate the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons.

Since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

Then, calculate the remaining cells on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons.

Each screen with two 2x2 icons uses 8 cells (2 icons * 4 cells each), leaving 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

If a screen has only one 2x2 icon, it uses 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

But to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, which is two per screen.

So, with ceil(y / 2) screens, the total number of 2x2 icons placed is y, and the total number of cells used by them is y * 4.

The total number of cells available on these screens is ceil(y / 2) * 15.

The remaining cells on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons are ceil(y / 2) * 15 - y * 4.

We can place up to this number of 1x1 icons on these screens.

If x (the number of 1x1 icons) is less than or equal to this remaining cells, then we don't need any additional screens for the 1x1 icons.

Otherwise, we need additional screens for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons is ceil((x - remaining cells) / 15).

Therefore, the total number of screens is ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - (ceil(y / 2) * 15 - y * 4)) / 15).

But we need to make sure that the remaining cells aren't negative.

Wait, let's think again.

Let's compute the number of screens needed as follows:

1. Calculate the number of screens required to place all y 2x2 icons, which is ceil(y / 2).

2. Calculate the remaining cells on these screens after placing the y 2x2 icons.

3. If x is less than or equal to the remaining cells, no additional screens are needed.

4. Otherwise, calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

This seems correct.

Now, let's see how this aligns with the provided program.

Looking at the program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b

if t % 2 == 0:

t = t // 2

else:

t = t // 2 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

So, in this code:

- t is set to b (number of 2x2 icons)

- if b is even, t = b // 2

- else, t = b // 2 + 1

- t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

- if t1 >= a, then t remains t

- else, calculate t2 = a - t1

- if t2 % 15 == 0, t += t2 // 15

- else, t += t2 // 15 + 1

- print t

Wait a minute, this seems similar to what I thought.

Let me map this to my earlier reasoning.

- t is initially set to b, then adjusted based on whether b is even or odd.

Wait, t is set to ceil(b / 2), which is the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.

Then, t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

This seems to be calculating the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons on t screens.

Then, if t1 >= a, meaning the remaining cells can accommodate all the 1x1 icons, so t remains the same.

Else, calculate t2 = a - t1, which is the number of additional 1x1 icons that need screens beyond the initial t screens.

Then, calculate the number of additional screens needed for t2 icons, which is ceil(t2 / 15).

Finally, t is incremented by this amount.

This seems correct.

But let's verify with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

1

1 1

Output:

1

According to the program:

b = 1

t = 1 // 2 = 0 + 1 = 1 (since 1 is odd)

t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 15 - 4 = 11

a = 1

since 11 >= 1, t remains 1

print 1

Which matches the expected output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

7 2

Output:

1

According to the program:

b = 2

t = 2 // 2 = 1

t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 15 - 8 = 7

a = 7

since 7 >= 7, t remains 1

print 1

Which matches.

Another test case:

Input:

1

0 3

Output:

2

According to the program:

b = 3

t = 3 // 2 = 1 + 1 = 2

t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 30 - 12 = 18

a = 0

since 18 >= 0, t remains 2

print 2

Which matches.

Another test case:

Input:

1

15 0

Output:

1

According to the program:

b = 0

t = 0 // 2 = 0

t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0

a = 15

since 0 < 15, t2 = 15 - 0 = 15

15 % 15 == 0, so t += 15 // 15 = 1

t = 0 + 1 = 1

print 1

Which matches.

Seems correct.

Let me check another one:

Input:

1

8 2

Output:

2

According to the program:

b = 2

t = 2 // 2 = 1

t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 15 - 8 = 7

a = 8

since 7 < 8, t2 = 8 - 7 = 1

1 % 15 != 0, so t += 1 // 15 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

t = 1 + 1 = 2

print 2

Which matches.

Another test case:

Input:

1

0 9

Output:

5

According to the program:

b = 9

t = 9 // 2 = 4 + 1 = 5

t1 = 5 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 75 - 36 = 39

a = 0

since 39 >= 0, t remains 5

print 5

Which matches.

Seems like the program is correctly implementing the logic I thought of.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
