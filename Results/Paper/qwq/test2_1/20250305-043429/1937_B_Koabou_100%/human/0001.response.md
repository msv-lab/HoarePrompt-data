Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down. It needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when comparing them character by character. So, for binary strings, '0' comes before '1'. That means, in the path, we should prefer '0's over '1's as much as possible.

Now, the grid is only 2 rows high but N columns wide. The grasshopper can move right or down, so from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1), and so on, until it reaches (2,N).

I need to think about how to construct the smallest possible string. Since it's lexicographical, the first character is most important, then the second, and so on.

Given that the grasshopper starts at (1,1), the first character of the string is a_{11}. Then, at each step, it can choose to go right or down. So, for example, if it goes right to (1,2), the next character is a_{12}, and if it goes down to (2,1), the next character is a_{21}.

Wait, but actually, in the problem, the grid is 2 rows by N columns, so the coordinates are (row, column), with rows starting from 1 to 2 and columns from 1 to N.

I need to consider all possible paths from (1,1) to (2,N), where each path is a sequence of moves right or down, and the string is constructed by concatenating the values in the cells along the path.

The key is to find the path that gives the smallest possible string in lex order.

I think a greedy approach might work here, where at each step, we choose the move (right or down) that leads to the smallest possible next character.

But I need to be careful because choosing right or down might lead to different possibilities for the remaining path.

Let me try to think of an example.

Suppose N=2, and the grid is:

Row 1: 0 0

Row 2: 0 0

Possible paths:

1. Right, Right, Down: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3)
   But since N=2, it's (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)

   String: 0 0 0

2. Right, Down, Right: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2)

   String: 0 0 0

3. Down, Right, Right: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2)

   String: 0 0 0

So, all paths give the same string '000', and there are multiple paths giving this string.

Another example:

N=4

Row 1: 1 1 0 1

Row 2: 1 1 0 0

Possible paths and strings:

1. Right, Right, Right, Down: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4)

   String: 1 1 0 1 0

2. Right, Right, Down, Right: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

   String: 1 1 0 0 0

3. Right, Down, Right, Right: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

   String: 1 1 0 0 0

4. Down, Right, Right, Right: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

   String: 1 1 0 0 0

So, the smallest string is '11000', and there are multiple paths giving this string.

Wait, but in the example output, for the second test case, it's '11000' with only one path. Hmm, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the second test case, N=4, a1=1101, a2=1100.

Let's list all possible paths:

1. R, R, R, D: 1 1 0 1 0

2. R, R, D, R: 1 1 0 0 0

3. R, D, R, R: 1 1 0 0 0

4. D, R, R, R: 1 1 0 0 0

So, indeed, '11000' is the smallest string, and according to the example, there's only one path that yields this string. But in my earlier count, it seems like multiple paths yield '11000'. Maybe I need to check the example again.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the path construction. Let's see the note in the second test case: there is only one path that yields '11000'. Maybe I miscounted the paths.

Wait, let's see:

Path 1: R, R, D, R: positions (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

   String: a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = 1 1 0 0 0 => '11000'

Path 2: R, D, R, R: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

   String: a11 a12 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0 => '11100'

Path 3: D, R, R, R: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4)

   String: a11 a21 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0 => '11100'

So, only path 1 gives '11000', and the others give '11100', which is lexicographically larger. So, indeed, only one path yields the smallest string.

Therefore, in this case, there's only one path that gives the smallest string.

So, in general, I need a way to find the smallest possible string and count how many paths produce it.

I need an efficient way to do this, considering that N can be up to 2e5 and T up to 1e4, with the sum of N over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, per test case, time complexity should be O(N), or at least amortized O(N) over all test cases.

Now, thinking about how to approach this.

Since the grid has only two rows, it's a lot simpler than a general grid.

The grasshopper starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N).

Each path consists of a sequence of moves right or down, but the constraints are that you can only move right or down, and you have to go from (1,1) to (2,N).

I need to model the possible paths and find the minimal string.

One way is to model the paths as sequences of positions and then construct the strings, but that's too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about dynamic programming.

Define dp[i][j] as the minimal string from (1,1) to (i,j).

But strings can be large, and comparing them would be inefficient.

Instead, maybe I can keep track of the minimal sequence step by step.

At each step, decide whether to go right or down based on which choice gives the smallest next character.

But I need to consider the entire path, not just the immediate choice.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of suffixes.

Suppose I fix the path up to some point, and then choose the best way to proceed.

But I need to minimize the entire string, considering all characters in order.

Another idea: since the grid is only two rows, I can consider the points where the path switches from row 1 to row 2.

The path can stay in row 1 for some prefix, and then switch to row 2 at some column, say k, and then continue in row 2 until column N.

So, all paths can be characterized by the column k where the switch from row 1 to row 2 occurs.

Wait, but the grasshopper can switch rows multiple times, but in this grid, because you can only move right or down, and there are only two rows, the path can switch from row 1 to row 2 only once.

Because once you move down to row 2, you can't move back to row 1.

So, actually, every path corresponds to choosing a column k between 1 and N where the switch from row 1 to row 2 happens.

Wait, no, actually, you can have multiple switches if you have more rows, but with only two rows, you can switch at most once.

Wait, no, with two rows, you can only switch once from row 1 to row 2.

Because you can't switch back to row 1 once you've moved down to row 2.

So, actually, every path can be described by the last column where you are in row 1.

Let's define k as the last column where the path is in row 1.

So, for each k from 1 to N, the path goes right to (1,k), then down to (2,k), and then right to (2,N).

Thus, the string is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

Wait, no, if you go down from (1,k) to (2,k), then right to (2,N), the string is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each k from 1 to N, the string is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

Therefore, to find the minimal string, we can consider all possible k from 1 to N, construct the string for each k, and find the minimal one.

But this would be O(N^2), which is too slow for N up to 2e5.

So, I need a smarter way to find the minimal string among all these possibilities.

I need to find the k that gives the smallest string in lex order.

Given that, I need to find a way to find the minimal string efficiently.

Let's think about how lex comparison works.

We compare the first characters, then the second, and so on, until we find a difference.

So, to have the smallest string, we want the first character to be as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

Given that, perhaps I can find the position where the paths start differing and make decisions based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide at each step which choice leads to the smallest string.

Let me try to think of an algorithm.

Initialize the path starting at (1,1), with current string being a11.

Then, at each step, decide whether to move right or down based on which choice gives the smallest next character.

But, since in some steps, moving down might not be possible or might lead to suboptimal choices later.

Wait, perhaps I can merge the two rows in a smart way.

Let me consider that the path is a sequence starting at (1,1), then either:

- Move right to (1,2), then (1,3), ..., up to some (1,k), then down to (2,k), then right to (2,N).

- Or, down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), ..., to (2,N).

So, effectively, for each k from 1 to N, the string is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the k that gives the smallest string.

To optimize this, I need to find a way to find the minimal string without considering each k separately.

Let me consider that the string for k is S_k = a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the minimal S_k among all k.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can find the point where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me think about it step by step.

Start at (1,1), with current string 'a11'.

Then, at each step, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

But, since switching is irreversible (you can't go back to row 1), I need to choose the earliest possible k where switching would lead to a smaller string.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, comparing the options of staying in row 1 or switching to row 2 at each step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize current string as empty.

Start at column 1.

At each column, decide whether to take a1j or a2j, but with the constraint that once you switch to row 2, you can't switch back.

Wait, but actually, in the path, you have to collect the cells in order, so it's not just choosing a1j or a2j independently.

Wait, no, because the path determines the sequence of cells.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and decide when to switch from row 1 to row 2.

Let me try to think of it as merging the two rows in a way that minimizes the string.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as building the string column by column, choosing from row 1 until a certain point, then switching to row 2.

Yes, that matches the earlier observation.

So, I need to find the optimal k where to switch from row 1 to row 2.

To optimize this, I need to find the k that minimizes S_k = a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

To find the minimal S_k efficiently, perhaps I can find the position where a1j > a2j, and switch at that point.

But I need to be careful because it's lex comparison, so I need to consider the entire string.

Wait, maybe I can find the earliest position j where a1j > a2j, and switch at that point.

But, if a1j == a2j, I need to look further.

Wait, similar to equal values in lex comparison.

Wait, actually, this seems similar to finding the minimal string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the constraints of the path.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two strings, row1 and row2.

I need to choose a path that goes from row1 to row2 at some point, and concatenate the parts.

To minimize the string, I should stay in row1 as long as row1 gives smaller or equal characters compared to row2.

But, I need to consider the overall string, not just the current character.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where switching to row2 leads to a smaller suffix.

Let me try to formalize an algorithm.

Initialize k = 1.

While a1k <= a2k, stay in row1, i.e., include a1k in the string and move to the next column.

Once a1k > a2k, switch to row2 at that column.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string, not just the current character.

Wait, perhaps this is a way.

Define k as the smallest index where a1k > a2k.

Then, switch at that k.

But, need to consider if a1k == a2k, whether to switch or not.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and find the first position where switching would lead to a smaller string.

Let me try with an example.

Take N=4, a1=1101, a2=1100.

So, a1: 1 1 0 1

a2: 1 1 0 0

Compare a1j and a2j for each j:

j=1: a11=1, a21=1 => equal

j=2: a12=1, a22=1 => equal

j=3: a13=0, a23=0 => equal

j=4: a14=1, a24=0 => a14 > a24

So, at j=4, a14 > a24, so switching at j=4 would be beneficial.

Wait, but in the path, switching at j=4 means taking a11 a12 a13 a14 a24.

But a14=1, a24=0, so a14 > a24.

So, to minimize the string, I should switch at j=4.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, the minimal string is '11000', which corresponds to k=3, switching at j=3.

Wait, but according to this, switching at j=4 would give a11 a12 a13 a14 a24 = 1 1 0 1 0

Which is '11010', which is larger than '11000'.

So, it's better to switch at j=3, where a13=0, a23=0, but a14=1, a24=0.

So, switching at j=3 gives a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = 1 1 0 0 0

Which is better than switching at j=4.

So, the general rule is: find the smallest k such that a1(k+1) > a2k.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, in this case, k=3, a14=1 > a23=0.

Wait, perhaps I need to compare a1(j+1) with a2j.

So, iterate j from 1 to N-1, and find the smallest j where a1(j+1) > a2j.

Then, switch at that j.

Wait, in the example, j=3, a14=1 > a23=0.

So, switch at j=3.

Then, the string is a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = 1 1 0 0 0.

Yes, that's the minimal string.

If I switch at j=2, a13=0, a22=1, but a13 < a22, so no need to switch there.

Wait, but a13=0, a22=1, but I need to consider a1(j+1) > a2j.

At j=2, a13=0, a22=1, 0 < 1, so no switch.

At j=3, a14=1 > a23=0, so switch at j=3.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, general algorithm:

- Initialize k=0.

- Iterate j from 1 to N-1:

- If a1(j+1) > a2j, set k=j and break.

- If no such j found, set k=N.

- Then, the minimal string is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N.

- And the number of paths that give this string is the number of ways to arrange the path that switches at k.

Wait, but in the first example, where N=2, a1=00, a2=00, k=1 (since a12=0 <= a21=0, so k=1), but according to the earlier analysis, k can be 1 or 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be a1(j+1) >= a2j.

In the first example, a12=0 >= a21=0, so k=1.

Then, the minimal string is a11 a12 a22 = 0 0 0.

And there are two paths that give this string.

In the second example, a1=1101, a2=1100.

Check j=1: a12=1 >= a21=1, so k=1.

Then, minimal string is a11 a12 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0.

But in the example, the minimal string is '11000', which corresponds to k=3.

Wait, so my condition is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the smallest j where a1(j+1) > a2j.

In the second example, at j=3, a14=1 > a23=0, so k=3.

Then, the minimal string is a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = 1 1 0 0 0.

Yes, that matches.

In the first example, a1=00, a2=00.

At j=1, a12=0 <= a21=0, so k=1.

String: a11 a12 a22 = 0 0 0.

But there is also k=2, giving a11 a12 a22 a23 = 0 0 0 0.

Wait, but in this case, k=1 gives '000', and k=2 gives '0000'.

But in the problem, N=2, so a2N=a22=0.

So, k=1 gives '000', k=2 gives '000'.

So, both are the same.

But in the problem's output, it's '000' with two paths.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal string length.

Wait, no, the string length is determined by the path.

Wait, in the first example, N=2, so the path has length 4 moves: right, right, down.

So, the string has length 3: a11, a12, a22.

But in the problem's output, it's '000' with two paths.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, no, in N=2, the grid is:

Row1: a11 a12

Row2: a21 a22

Paths:

1. (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2): string a11 a12 a22 = 0 0 0

2. (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2): string a11 a21 a22 = 0 0 0

So, both paths give '000', which matches the output.

So, in this case, k can be 1 or 2, both giving '000'.

But according to my earlier algorithm, k=1 gives '000', and k=2 gives '000' as well.

So, in this case, both k=1 and k=2 give the same string.

But in the second example, only k=3 gives the minimal string '11000', and other k's give larger strings.

So, I need a way to find the minimal string among all possible k's.

But iterating through all k's is O(N), which is too slow if done naively.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by finding the point where a1(j+1) > a2j, and switch at that point.

Then, the minimal string is a11 ... a1k a2k ... a2N.

And the number of paths that give this string is the number of ways to arrange the path that switches at k.

But in the first example, a1(j+1) <= a2j for all j, so k=N.

In the second example, k=3.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize it.

Define k as the minimal j where a1(j+1) > a2j.

If no such j exists, then k=N.

Then, the minimal string is a11 ...
