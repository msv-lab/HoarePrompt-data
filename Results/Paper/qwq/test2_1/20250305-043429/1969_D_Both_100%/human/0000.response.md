Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of these items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she buys less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the difference between what Bob pays her for the items he buys from her and what she spends on buying the items from the shop. So, profit = sum of b_i for items Bob buys - sum of a_i for items Alice buys.

Both Alice and Bob are acting optimally: Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what Alice's profit will be in this scenario.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. If Alice buys fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit is zero minus the cost she incurred, which is -sum of a_i for items she bought. That seems like a negative profit, which Alice would want to avoid.

If Alice buys at least k items, Bob will take k items for free that Alice bought, and pay for the remaining items. So, Alice's profit would be sum of b_i for the items Bob buys minus sum of a_i for all items Alice bought.

But Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, so he'll choose the k items to take for free in a way that minimizes the sum of b_i that he has to pay. That means he'll choose the k items with the smallest b_i values.

Alice, knowing this, needs to choose which items to buy in a way that maximizes her profit, given that Bob will choose the k items with the smallest b_i to take for free.

So, the strategy seems to be:

- Alice selects a subset of items to buy.

- Bob takes the k items with the smallest b_i from Alice's subset for free.

- Bob pays for the remaining items in Alice's subset.

- Alice's profit is sum of b_i for the remaining items minus sum of a_i for all items she bought.

I need to maximize this profit for Alice.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, if Alice buys fewer than k items, her profit is negative (since she spends money on a_i and gets nothing in return), which is worse than if she buys at least k items. So, it's better for Alice to buy at least k items.

Therefore, I can assume that Alice buys at least k items.

Now, among the items Alice buys, Bob will take the k items with the smallest b_i for free. So, Alice's profit will be sum of b_i for the items Bob buys minus sum of a_i for all items she buys.

Wait, no. Actually, Bob pays for the items he doesn't take for free. So, the items Bob buys from Alice are the ones he doesn't take for free.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i-th item."

So, if Alice buys at least k items, Bob takes k items for free, and pays for the remaining items that Alice bought.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum of b_i for the items Bob buys from her minus sum of a_i for all items she bought.

Which means: sum of b_i for items not taken for free minus sum of a_i for all items bought.

So, profit = sum(b_i for items bought) - sum(a_i for items bought) - sum(b_i for k items taken for free).

But Bob chooses the k items with the smallest b_i to take for free, to minimize Alice's profit.

So, Alice needs to choose a subset of items to buy, and Bob will select the k items with the smallest b_i from that subset to take for free.

Alice wants to maximize profit, which is sum(b_i for items bought) - sum(a_i for items bought) - sum(b_i for k smallest b_i in bought items).

Let me denote:

Let S be the set of items Alice buys.

Then, profit = sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

This can be simplified to:

profit = sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

Wait, that might not be directly helpful.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice buys a set S of items, with |S| >= k.

Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i from S for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

Which is equal to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

Hmm.

Alternatively, it's sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i + b_i - b_i if among the k smallest in S else 0).

Wait, this seems messy.

Let me consider the following approach.

Since Bob will take the k items with the smallest b_i from S for free, Alice wants to maximize the sum of b_i for the remaining items minus the sum of a_i for all items in S.

So, to maximize profit, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum of b_i for S minus sum of a_i for S minus sum of the k smallest b_i in S is maximized.

This can be rewritten as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

Alternatively, sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{k smallest b_i in S} b_i.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can look at it differently.

Suppose I sort the items based on b_i in ascending order.

Then, for any subset S of size at least k, the sum of the k smallest b_i in S is the sum of the first k items in S when sorted by b_i.

But this seems tricky.

Let me consider the following idea.

Suppose I select a subset S of size m >= k.

Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i from S for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{j in T} b_j, where T is the set of k items with smallest b_i in S.

Which is equal to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

But I need to maximize this.

This seems messy.

Maybe I can think in terms of selecting items to include in S, and consider the impact on the profit.

Let me consider the profit expression again.

profit = sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Where T is the set of k items in S with the smallest b_i.

I can rewrite this as sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Now, sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Perhaps I need to consider the items in a certain order.

Let me consider the difference (b_i - a_i).

If (b_i - a_i) is positive, it means Alice gains by including the item, after considering her cost and what Bob pays.

If (b_i - a_i) is negative, it's a net loss for Alice to include the item.

But Bob takes k items with smallest b_i for free, which affects the profit.

I need to find a way to balance these.

Let me consider that Alice wants to maximize her profit, which involves maximizing the sum of (b_i - a_i) over all items in S, minus the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

I need to find a way to select S such that this expression is maximized.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using greedy algorithms, possibly involving sorting the items in a certain way.

Let me think about sorting the items based on some criterion.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of (b_i - a_i).

Then, Alice would want to include items with higher (b_i - a_i) in her subset S.

However, Bob will take the k items with the smallest b_i from S for free, which could offset some of Alice's gains.

I need to find a way to maximize the overall profit.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the items in terms of their contribution to the profit.

Let me consider that for each item, its contribution to the profit is (b_i - a_i), but if it's among the k smallest b_i in S, then Bob takes it for free, and Alice doesn't get b_i from Bob for that item.

So, effectively, for those k items, Alice's profit is reduced by b_i.

Wait, more precisely, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{j in T} b_j, where T is the set of k items with smallest b_i in S.

Which simplifies to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I need to consider that Alice can choose to not include certain items to influence which items Bob takes for free.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose Alice buys all n items.

Then, Bob takes the k items with smallest b_i for free.

Alice's profit is sum_{i=1 to n} b_i - sum_{i=1 to n} a_i - sum of the k smallest b_i.

Which is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} (b_i - a_i) - sum of the k smallest b_i.

But maybe Alice doesn't want to buy all items, especially if some items have negative (b_i - a_i).

Wait, but if she doesn't buy an item, Bob can't take it for free, but she also doesn't get any b_i from Bob for that item.

Wait, actually, if Alice doesn't buy an item, it's not in S, so Bob can't take it for free, and Alice doesn't get any b_i from it.

But she also doesn't spend a_i on it.

So, for items where (b_i - a_i) < 0, Alice might want to exclude them to minimize her losses.

But in the presence of Bob taking k items for free, it's not straightforward.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of small examples to see a pattern.

Take the first example in the input:

2 0

2 1

1 2

n=2, k=0

Prices a: 2,1

Bonuses b:1,2

If k=0, Bob takes no items for free.

So, Alice buys both items, Bob buys both from her, pays b_i for each.

Profit = sum of b_i - sum of a_i = (1+2) - (2+1) = 3 - 3 = 0.

But according to the first output, it's 1.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the first test case.

Wait, the first test case is:

4

2 0

2 1

1 2

4 1

1 2 1 4

3 3 2 3

4 2

2 1 1 1

4 2 3 2

6 2

1 3 4 9 1 3

7 6 8 10 6 8

And the output is:

1

1

0

7

Wait, perhaps I misread the input.

Wait, the input is given in a single block, with t test cases.

But in the problem description, it's presented as:

4

2 0

2 1

1 2

...

But in the code, it's read using sys.stdin.readline.

Anyway, moving forward, perhaps I need to find a better way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any subset S of items to buy, with |S| >= k.

Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i from S for free.

Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{j in T} b_j, where T is the set of k smallest b_i in S.

Which simplifies to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider the items in decreasing order of (b_i - a_i).

Then, Alice would want to include items with higher (b_i - a_i).

But Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i for free, which could be items with small b_i but possibly large (b_i - a_i).

This is getting messy.

Perhaps I need to consider that for items where (b_i - a_i) >= 0, Alice wants to include them, and for items where (b_i - a_i) < 0, she might want to exclude them.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free complicates things.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting a subset S where the sum of (b_i - a_i) is maximized, minus the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

To maximize this, Alice wants to have the k smallest b_i in S to be as small as possible, but also have overall high (b_i - a_i).

This seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset S with |S| >= k, and then choosing which k items to exclude (the ones with smallest b_i), and maximizing sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix the set S and then select T as the k items with smallest b_i in S.

But this still seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S with |S| >= k.

Then, Bob selects T, the k items with smallest b_i in S.

Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Alice wants to maximize this, Bob wants to minimize it.

Since Bob chooses T to minimize Alice's profit, he will choose the k items with smallest b_i in S.

Therefore, for a given S, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

To maximize this, Alice needs to choose S such that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) is as large as possible, and sum_{j in T} b_j is as small as possible.

But sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S, which increases as the smallest b_i in S increase.

Therefore, Alice wants to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) and minimize sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems like a conflicting objective, but perhaps there's a way to balance it.

Let me consider that for items where (b_i - a_i) >= 0, Alice gains by including them, and for items where (b_i - a_i) < 0, she loses by including them.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free can affect this.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting S such that the k smallest b_i in S are as large as possible.

To maximize sum_{j in T} b_j, Bob wants to minimize it, so he chooses the smallest b_i.

Alice wants to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for items where b_i - a_i >= 0, Alice wants to include them, and for items where b_i - a_i < 0, she wants to exclude them.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free can make some items less attractive to include.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for items where b_i - a_i >= 0, including them is beneficial, but if they have small b_i, Bob might take them for free, reducing Alice's profit.

So, Alice might prefer to include items with high b_i and high (b_i - a_i).

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice should include items with high (b_i - a_i), and exclude items with low (b_i - a_i).

But Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i from S for free.

So, if Alice includes items with high b_i, Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i, which could still be items with high b_i if all items have high b_i.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S of size m >= k.

Bob takes the k items with smallest b_i from S for free.

Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is equal to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems difficult.

Perhaps I can consider that for any subset S of size m >= k, the sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

So, to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j, I can think of it as sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j = sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This still seems messy.

Let me consider that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j = sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S \ T} b_i.

Because sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j = sum_{i in S \ T} b_i.

So, profit = sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

This seems like sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} a_j.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

This can be written as sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} a_j.

This seems a bit better.

But still complicated.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S of size m >= k.

Bob selects T, the k items with smallest b_i in S, to take for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can consider that for any S, sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

So, to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j, I can think of selecting S such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) is maximized, minus the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

This seems like I need to select S where the sum of (b_i - a_i) is large, and the k smallest b_i in S are as small as possible.

But these objectives conflict because if I have a set S where b_i are large, but a_i are also large, sum of (b_i - a_i) could be high, but sum of the k smallest b_i could also be high.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for items where b_i - a_i >= 0, Alice wants to include them, and for items where b_i - a_i < 0, she wants to exclude them.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free complicates this.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Alice should include items where b_i - a_i >= 0, and exclude items where b_i - a_i < 0, but also consider that Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i for free.

So, perhaps Alice should include items where b_i - a_i >= 0 and b_i is as large as possible.

Wait, maybe I can sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, select the top m items with m >= k, and choose S accordingly.

But I need to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for any subset S, the k smallest b_i in S would be the k smallest b_i in the sorted list up to S.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window approach.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that Alice wants to maximize sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider that for any subset S, the sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

So, to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j, I can think of selecting S such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) is maximized, and the sum of the k smallest b_i is minimized.

These two objectives are conflicting, so I need to find a balance.

Perhaps I can consider that for items where b_i - a_i >= 0, Alice wants to include them, and for items where b_i - a_i < 0, she wants to exclude them.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free complicates this.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting S such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) for items in S is maximized, and then subtracting the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

So, I need to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems difficult, but perhaps I can iterate over possible S and compute this.

But with n up to 2e5, that's not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that for any subset S with |S| >= k, sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j = sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S \ T} b_i.

This seems a bit better.

But still not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for any subset S with |S| >= k, the profit is sum_{i in S} (-a_i + b_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S \ T} b_i.

This still seems complicated.

Let me consider that sum_{i in S \ T} b_i is the sum of b_i for the items Bob buys from Alice.

So, profit = sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems to be the same expression as before.

I need to find a way to maximize this.

Perhaps I can consider that for any item, if b_i - a_i >= 0, Alice wants to include it, and if b_i - a_i < 0, she wants to exclude it.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free complicates this.

Wait, maybe I can think about selecting a subset S where the k smallest b_i are as large as possible, while maximizing sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i).

This seems like I need to select S such that the items with smallest b_i in S are as large as possible, and the sum of (b_i - a_i) is maximized.

This sounds similar to selecting a subset with high (b_i - a_i) values and high b_i values.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider that Alice can select any subset S with |S| >= k, and Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i in S for free.

So, to maximize her profit, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum of b_i for the items Bob buys (S \ T) minus the sum of a_i for all items in S is maximized.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can model it as selecting S to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Let me consider that sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

So, I need to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) + sum_{i in S \ T} b_i.

This still seems messy.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i is what I need to maximize.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

This seems like I need to maximize this expression.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that for any subset S with |S| >= k, the profit is sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} a_j.

Wait, is that right?

Wait, profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} a_j.

This seems a bit better.

But still not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice should include items where b_i - a_i >= 0, and exclude items where b_i - a_i < 0, but also consider that Bob will take the k items with smallest b_i for free.

So, perhaps Alice should include items where b_i - a_i >= 0 and b_i is as large as possible.

Wait, maybe I can sort the items in decreasing order of (b_i - a_i).

Then, select the top m items where m >= k, and choose S accordingly.

But I need to ensure that the k smallest b_i in S are as large as possible.

This seems like I need to select S such that the k smallest b_i in S are maximized, while maximizing sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i).

This sounds similar to selecting the top m items with highest (b_i - a_i), and ensuring that the k smallest b_i in this set are as large as possible.

This might involve selecting items with higher b_i values.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for any subset S with |S| >= k, the sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j is the profit.

I need to maximize this.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can iterate over possible values and use a heap to manage the k smallest b_i in S.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue to keep track of the k smallest b_i in S.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way.

Let me think about the following approach:

- Sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

- Then, consider including items one by one, keeping track of the sum of (b_i - a_i) and the sum of the k smallest b_i.

- Use a min-heap to keep track of the k smallest b_i in the current S.

- Update the profit as I include more items.

This might work.

Let me try to formalize this.

Sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Initialize a min-heap for the k smallest b_i.

Initialize sum_of_diff = 0 (sum of (b_i - a_i) for included items)

Initialize sum_of_k_smallest = 0

Initialize profit = 0

Iterate through the sorted items:

Include the item in S:

sum_of_diff += (b_i - a_i)

Add b_i to the min-heap if size < k, or if b_i > min-heap top:

if heap size < k:

heap.push(b_i)

sum_of_k_smallest += b_i

else if b_i > heap.top():

sum_of_k_smallest += b_i - heap.top()

heap.pop()

heap.push(b_i)

if heap size == k:

current_profit = sum_of_diff - sum_of_k_smallest

if current_profit > max_profit:

max_profit = current_profit

After iterating through all items, output max_profit.

This seems like a possible approach.

Let me test this with the first example:

n=2, k=0

items:

a: 2,1

b:1,2

Sort by b_i descending: item2 (b=2), item1 (b=1)

Include item2:

sum_of_diff = (2 - 1) = 1

heap is empty, k=0, so sum_of_k_smallest = 0

profit = 1 - 0 = 1, which matches the first output.

Good.

Second test case:

n=4, k=1

a:1,2,1,4

b:3,3,2,3

Sort by b descending: item1 (b=3), item2 (b=3), item3 (b=2), item4 (b=3)

Initialize heap empty, sum_of_diff=0, sum_of_k_smallest=0, max_profit=0

Include item1:

sum_of_diff = (3 - 1) = 2

heap size < k=1, push 3

sum_of_k_smallest += 3

current_profit = 2 - 3 = -1 (not better than max_profit=0)

Include item2:

sum_of_diff += (3 - 2) = 1, total sum_of_diff=3

heap top=3, new b=3 >= top, so replace top with 3

sum_of_k_smallest += 3 - 3 = 0

current_profit = 3 - 3 = 0, which is the current max_profit

Include item3:

sum_of_diff += (2 - 1) = 1, total sum_of_diff=4

heap top=3, new b=2 < top, so don't push

heap size == k=1, sum_of_k_smallest=3

current_profit = 4 - 3 =1, which is better than max_profit=0, so max_profit=1

Include item4:

sum_of_diff += (3 - 4) = -1, total sum_of_diff=3

heap top=3, new b=3 >= top, so replace top with 3

sum_of_k_smallest += 3 - 3 =0

current_profit =3 -3=0, which is not better than max_profit=1

So, max_profit=1, which matches the second output.

Good.

Third test case:

n=4, k=2

a:2,1,1,1

b:4,2,3,2

Sort by b descending: item1 (b=4), item3 (b=3), item2 (b=2), item4 (b=2)

Initialize heap empty, sum_of_diff=0, sum_of_k_smallest=0, max_profit=0

Include item1:

sum_of_diff = (4 - 2) =2

heap size < k=2, push 4

sum_of_k_smallest +=4

current_profit=2-4=-2 (worse than 0)

Include item3:

sum_of_diff += (3 -1)=2, total=4

heap size <k, push 3

sum_of_k_smallest +=3, total=7

current_profit=4-7=-3 (worse than 0)

Include item2:

sum_of_diff += (2 -1)=1, total=5

heap size ==k=2, new b=2 < heap top=3, don't push

current_profit=5-7=-2 (worse than 0)

Include item4:

sum_of_diff += (2 -1)=1, total=6

heap top=3, new b=2 < top, don't push

current_profit=6-7=-1 (worse than 0)

So, max_profit=0, which matches the third output.

Good.

Fourth test case:

n=6, k=2

a:1,3,4,9,1,3

b:7,6,8,10,6,8

Sort by b descending: item4 (b=10), item3 (b=8), item6 (b=8), item1 (b=7), item2 (b=6), item5 (b=6)

Initialize heap empty, sum_of_diff=0, sum_of_k_smallest=0, max_profit=0

Include item4:

sum_of_diff=(10-9)=1

heap size <k, push 10

sum_of_k_smallest +=10

current_profit=1-10=-9 (worse than 0)

Include item3:

sum_of_diff += (8-4)=4, total=5

heap size <k, push 8

sum_of_k_smallest +=8, total=18

current_profit=5-18=-13 (worse than 0)

Include item6:

sum_of_diff += (8-3)=5, total=10

heap size ==k=2, new b=8 >= heap top=8, replace top with 8

sum_of_k_smallest +=8-8=0

current_profit=10-18=-8 (worse than 0)

Include item1:

sum_of_diff += (7-1)=6, total=16

heap top=8, new b=7 < top, don't push

current_profit=16-18=-2 (worse than 0)

Include item2:

sum_of_diff += (6-3)=3, total=19

heap top=8, new b=6 < top, don't push

current_profit=19-18=1 (better than 0, so max_profit=1)

Wait, but according to the output, it should be 7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the fourth test case, the output is 7.

But according to my calculation, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps my approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when including item2, b=6, a=3, sum_of_diff=19, sum_of_k_smallest=18, profit=1.

But the output is 7, so my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S with |S| >=k.

Bob takes the k items with smallest b_i in S for free.

Alice's profit is sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

I need to maximize this.

Perhaps I can consider that for any item, if b_i - a_i >=0, Alice wants to include it, and if b_i - a_i <0, she wants to exclude it.

But Bob taking k items with smallest b_i for free complicates this.

Wait, maybe I can consider that Alice should include items where b_i - a_i >=0 and b_i is as large as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the items in decreasing order of (b_i - a_i).

Then, select the top m items where m >=k, and ensure that the k smallest b_i in this subset are as large as possible.

This might work.

Let me try this approach with the fourth test case.

Sort items by (b_i - a_i) descending:

item4: 10-9=1

item3:8-4=4

item1:7-1=6

item6:8-3=5

item5:6-1=5

item2:6-3=3

So sorted order:

item1 (6), item6 (5), item5 (5), item3 (4), item2 (3), item4 (1)

Now, select m >=k=2.

Start with m=2:

Select item1 and item6.

sum_of_diff=6+5=11

sum_of_k_smallest=sum of the k=2 smallest b_i in S: min(7,8)=7

profit=11-7=4

m=3:

select item1, item6, item5.

sum_of_diff=6+5+5=16

sum_of_k_smallest=min(7,8,8)=7

profit=16-7=9

m=4:

select item1, item6, item5, item3.

sum_of_diff=6+5+5+4=20

sum_of_k_smallest=min(7,8,8,8)=7

profit=20-7=13

m=5:

sum_of_diff=20+3=23

sum_of_k_smallest=min(7,8,8,8,6)=6

profit=23-6=17

m=6:

sum_of_diff=23+1=24

sum_of_k_smallest=min(7,8,8,8,6,1)=1

profit=24-1=23

But according to the output, it's 7.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the fourth test case, output is 7.

But according to this, it should be 23.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob takes the k items with smallest b_i, not necessarily the k items with smallest b_i in S.

Wait, no, it's specified that Bob takes k items for free that Alice bought, choosing which k items to take.

So, Bob chooses the k items with smallest b_i from S to take for free.

So, in the case where S includes all items, the k smallest b_i are the k smallest among all b_i.

In the fourth test case, with S including all items, b_i are [7,6,8,10,6,8], k=2.

The two smallest b_i are 6 and 6.

So, sum_of_k_smallest=12.

sum_of_diff=6+5+5+4+3+1=24

profit=24-12=12, which is still not matching the output of 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob chooses the k items with smallest b_i, but in this case, there are two items with b_i=6.

So, sum_of_k_smallest=6+6=12.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 7.

So, perhaps I need to choose a different S.

Wait, maybe excluding some items.

Let me try m=3:

select item1 (6), item6 (5), item5 (5)

sum_of_diff=6+5+5=16

sum_of_k_smallest=min(7,8,8)=7

profit=16-7=9, which is higher than 7.

But according to the output, it's 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob chooses the k smallest b_i in S.

Wait, perhaps I need to select S such that the sum_of_diff - sum_of_k_smallest is maximized.

In this case, selecting all items gives profit=24-12=12, which is higher than 7.

But according to the output, it's 7.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose any subset S with |S| >=k, but she needs to maximize sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that profit = sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} a_j.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that profit = sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

Wait, no.

Wait, profit = sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j.

I need to maximize this.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for any S, sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_i in S.

So, to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j, I need to maximize this expression.

Perhaps I can consider that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j = sum_{i in S \ T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} a_j.

But I'm going in circles.

Let me think about the following approach.

Define c_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, profit = sum_{i in S \ T} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{j in T} b_j = sum_{i in S} c_i - sum_{j in T} b_j.

I need to maximize this.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can consider that for any S, sum_{j in T} b_j is the sum of the k smallest b_j in S.

So, to maximize sum_{i in S} c_i - sum_{j in T}
