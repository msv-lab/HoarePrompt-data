Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of these items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she buys less than k items, or he'll take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the difference between what Bob pays her for the items he buys from her and what she spends on buying the items from the shop. So, profit = sum of b_i for items Bob buys - sum of a_i for items Alice buys.

Both Alice and Bob are trying to optimize their outcomes: Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. I need to find out what Alice's profit will be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. If Alice buys fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit is zero minus the cost she incurred, which is -sum(a_i for items she bought). That's bad for Alice, so she probably won't choose to buy fewer than k items.

If Alice buys exactly k items, Bob takes them all for free, so again, her profit is -sum(a_i for the k items). Still not good.

If Alice buys more than k items, say m > k, Bob will take k items for free and pay for the remaining (m - k) items. So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for the (m - k) items Bob buys) - sum(a_i for all m items she bought).

Alice needs to choose which items to buy to maximize this profit, and Bob will choose which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

So, the problem is a minimax kind of problem: Alice wants to maximize her minimum possible profit, considering that Bob will try to minimize her profit by choosing which k items to take for free.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider that Alice chooses a subset of items to buy, and for each possible subset, calculate the profit based on Bob choosing the k items to take for free that minimize Alice's profit.

But checking all possible subsets is not feasible because n can be up to 2*10^5, which is too large.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me try to model this differently.

Let's consider that Alice buys a set of m items, where m >= k. Bob will choose the k items with the lowest b_i to take for free, because that minimizes the amount he has to pay for the remaining (m - k) items.

Wait, no. Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, which is sum(b_i for the items Bob buys) - sum(a_i for items Alice buys).

Wait, Bob chooses which k items to take for free from the m items Alice bought.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is sum(b_i for the (m - k) items Bob buys) - sum(a_i for the m items).

Bob, in trying to minimize Alice's profit, will choose the k items that maximize sum(b_i for the (m - k) items), because the higher the sum(b_i), the higher Alice's profit.

Wait, no. If Bob takes k items for free, the remaining (m - k) items are the ones Bob has to pay for.

Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, which is sum(b_i for the (m - k) items) - sum(a_i for the m items).

So, to minimize Alice's profit, Bob should choose the k items to take for free such that the sum of b_i for the remaining (m - k) items is minimized.

Therefore, Bob should choose the k items with the highest b_i to take for free, leaving the (m - k) items with the lowest b_i for payment.

Wait, if Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i for free, then the remaining (m - k) items have lower b_i, which minimizes sum(b_i for the remaining items), thus minimizing Alice's profit.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, given that Bob will choose the k items with the highest b_i to take for free, Alice needs to choose the subset of m items such that the sum of the (m - k) lowest b_i minus the sum of a_i for all m items is maximized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can reframe this.

Let me consider that for a chosen set of m items, Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free. So, Alice gets payment for the (m - k) items with the lowest b_i.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum of b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this expression over all possible subsets of m items, where m >= k.

Wait, but m can be from k up to n.

This seems complicated.

Let me see if there's a better way.

Perhaps I can sort the items based on some criterion.

Let me think about the profit per item.

Wait, for each item, if Alice buys it, she pays a_i, and if Bob buys it, he pays b_i.

But Bob can take k items for free that Alice bought.

So, effectively, Alice can choose to buy some items, and Bob can choose to take the k most beneficial items for himself.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between a_i and b_i.

Let me consider the difference b_i - a_i.

If b_i - a_i > 0, then Alice gains by selling this item to Bob, provided Bob buys it.

But Bob will only buy it if it's not among the k items he takes for free.

So, Alice wants to have as many items as possible where b_i - a_i > 0, but Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

Hmm.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice buys m items, where m >= k.

Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i for free.

Then, Alice gets payment for the (m - k) items with the lowest b_i.

So, her profit is sum of b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for all m items.

This can be rewritten as sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for the k items with highest b_i.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me try to express Alice's profit more clearly.

Alice's profit is sum of b_i for the items Bob buys minus sum of a_i for the items Alice buys.

Bob buys the (m - k) items with the lowest b_i, since he takes the k items with the highest b_i for free.

Wait, no.

Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i for free, so the remaining (m - k) items are the ones with the lowest b_i, which Bob has to pay for.

Therefore, sum of b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i.

Sum of a_i for all m items.

So, profit = sum(b_i for the (m - k) lowest b_i) - sum(a_i for all m items).

I can rearrange this.

Let me see.

sum(b_i for the (m - k) lowest b_i) = sum(b_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k highest b_i).

Therefore, profit = [sum(b_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k highest b_i)] - sum(a_i for all m items) = sum(b_i - a_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k highest b_i).

Wait, that seems messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the overall sum.

sum(b_i - a_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k highest b_i in the m items).

This can be rewritten as sum(b_i - a_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i) + sum(-a_i for the k items with highest b_i).

Wait, I'm getting tangled up.

Perhaps I need to find a way to select m items such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for the k items with highest b_i is maximized.

This seems complex.

Is there a smarter way to select the items?

Let me consider that Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob will act to minimize it by choosing the k items with highest b_i to take for free.

Maybe I can consider the items sorted by b_i.

Let's sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

So, the first k items will be the ones Bob takes for free.

Then, the remaining (m - k) items will be the ones with lower b_i, which Bob has to pay for.

Alice's profit would be sum of b_i for these (m - k) items minus sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this over m and the choice of m items.

Wait, perhaps I can fix m and choose the m items such that the sum of b_i for the (m - k) lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for all m items is maximized.

But this seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Let's say the items are sorted as item1, item2, ..., itemn, with b1 >= b2 >= ... >= bn.

If Alice chooses to buy m items, Bob will take the first k items (with highest b_i) for free, and pay for the last (m - k) items (with lowest b_i).

So, Alice's profit is sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items minus sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this over m and the choice of m items.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over m from k to n and find the maximum profit for each m.

But that would be too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for a given set of m items, the profit is sum of b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this.

Alternatively, I can think of it as sum of (b_i - a_i) for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i minus sum of a_i for the k items with highest b_i.

Wait, still complicated.

Let me try to find a different perspective.

Suppose Alice decides not to buy any items, i.e., m = 0.

But k could be 0, meaning Bob takes nothing, and Alice's profit is 0.

Wait, in the problem, k can be 0, meaning Bob always takes k items for free, so if m < k, Bob takes all m items for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for the m items).

If m >= k, Bob takes k items with highest b_i for free, and Alice gets sum(b_i for the remaining (m - k) items) - sum(a_i for all m items).

I need to maximize this over m and the choice of m items.

Let me consider that for m >= k, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i) - sum(a_i for all m items).

I can rearrange this as sum(b_i - a_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i) - sum(a_i for the k items with highest b_i).

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as sum(b_i - a_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k items with highest b_i).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, profit = sum(b_i - a_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k items with highest b_i).

Alice wants to maximize this.

I need to maximize sum(b_i - a_i for all m items) - sum(b_i for the k items with highest b_i).

This can be rewritten as sum(-a_i for all m items) + sum((b_i - b_i) for the k items with highest b_i) + sum(b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i).

Wait, this isn't helping.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for any m >= k, the k items with highest b_i are the first k items in this sorted list.

Alice's profit would be sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items minus sum of a_i for all m items.

I can compute sum(b_i for the last (m - k) items) as sum of b_i from position (k + 1) to m in the sorted list.

Sum of a_i for all m items is sum of a_i for the first m items in the sorted list.

So, profit = sum(b_i for items m - k to m) - sum(a_i for items 1 to m).

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

Wait, no.

If I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i, then the first item has the highest b_i, and so on.

So, if Alice chooses the first m items in this sorted list, Bob will take the first k items for free (since they have the highest b_i), and Alice will get payment for the last (m - k) items, which have lower b_i.

Wait, no.

If Alice chooses the first m items in the sorted list (highest b_i first), then Bob will take the first k items for free, and Alice will get sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items minus sum of a_i for all m items.

I need to maximize this expression over m and the choice of m items.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate m from k to n and compute the profit for each m, then take the maximum.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me see.

If I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i, then for each m from k to n, the sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items is sum of b_i from position (k + 1) to m.

Sum of a_i for the first m items is sum of a_i from position 1 to m.

So, I can precompute prefix sums for b_i and a_i in this sorted order.

Then, for each m from k to n, profit = sum(b_i from m - k + 1 to m) - sum(a_i from 1 to m).

Wait, no.

If positions are 1 to m, with position 1 having the highest b_i, then sum of b_i for the last (m - k) items is sum from position (k + 1) to m.

So, profit = sum(b_i from k + 1 to m) - sum(a_i from 1 to m).

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

I can precompute prefix sums for b_i and a_i.

Let me denote prefix_sum_b[m] = sum of b_i from 1 to m.

prefix_sum_a[m] = sum of a_i from 1 to m.

Then, sum(b_i from k + 1 to m) = prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k].

sum(a_i from 1 to m) = prefix_sum_a[m].

So, profit = (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) - prefix_sum_a[m].

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

So, maximize (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) - prefix_sum_b[k].

Since prefix_sum_b[k] is constant for a fixed k, I need to maximize (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) for m from k to n.

So, the maximum profit is (max(prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m] for m from k to n)) - prefix_sum_b[k].

Wait, but prefix_sum_b[k] is the sum of b_i for the first k items, which are the k items with highest b_i.

So, this seems correct.

Therefore, the approach is:

1. Sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

2. Compute prefix sums for b_i and a_i.

3. For each m from k to n, compute (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]).

4. Find the maximum value among these for m from k to n.

5. The maximum profit is this maximum value minus prefix_sum_b[k].

Wait, but prefix_sum_b[k] is the sum of b_i for the first k items.

So, the profit is (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) - (prefix_sum_b[k] - prefix_sum_b[k]).

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me re-express it.

Profit = sum(b_i from k + 1 to m) - sum(a_i from 1 to m) = (sum(b_i from 1 to m) - sum(b_i from 1 to k)) - sum(a_i from 1 to m).

So, profit = (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) - prefix_sum_a[m].

I need to maximize this over m from k to n.

This is equivalent to maximizing (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) - prefix_sum_b[k].

Since prefix_sum_b[k] is a constant, I can maximize (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) and then subtract prefix_sum_b[k].

So, maximum profit = max(prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m] for m from k to n) - prefix_sum_b[k].

Yes, that seems correct.

So, in code, I can sort the items by b_i in decreasing order, compute prefix sums for b_i and a_i, then find the maximum of (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) for m from k to n, and subtract prefix_sum_b[k].

Edge Cases:

- If k = 0, Bob takes nothing. So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for all m items) - sum(a_i for m items) = sum(b_i - a_i for m items).

To maximize this, Alice should choose items where b_i - a_i > 0.

- If k >= m, Bob takes all m items for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for m items).

Alice would choose not to buy any items, so profit is 0.

Wait, but according to the problem, if m < k, Bob takes all m items for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for m items).

Alice can choose m = 0, which gives profit 0.

So, in this case, Alice will choose m = 0 if sum(b_i - a_i for any m items) < 0.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "subset (possibly empty)", so Alice can choose to buy nothing, getting profit 0.

So, in cases where buying any m items would result in negative profit, Alice chooses m = 0, profit = 0.

Therefore, in the general case, I need to take the maximum between 0 and the maximum profit from m >= k.

Wait, no.

If m < k, Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for m items), which is negative, so she's better off choosing m = 0, profit = 0.

If m >= k, her profit is as calculated above.

So, the overall maximum profit is the maximum between 0 and (max(prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m] for m from k to n) - prefix_sum_b[k]).

But I need to ensure that this value is at least 0.

Wait, let's think again.

Actually, the maximum profit is the maximum over all possible m of:

- If m < k: 0 (since Alice can choose m = 0)

- If m >= k: (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) - prefix_sum_b[k]

Wait, no.

Wait, if m < k, Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for m items), which is negative, so she's better off with m = 0, profit = 0.

If m >= k, her profit is sum(b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i) - sum(a_i for all m items).

Which, as previously established, is (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) - prefix_sum_a[m].

So, to maximize the overall profit, I need to take the maximum between 0 and the maximum of (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m]) for m from k to n minus prefix_sum_b[k].

But actually, since prefix_sum_b[k] is a constant, I can compute max(prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) for m from k to n, and take the maximum between this and 0.

Wait, but to ensure that Alice doesn't choose to buy nothing when m >= k gives a positive profit, I need to consider that.

Wait, no, because if m >= k gives a positive profit, Alice will choose that; otherwise, she'll choose m = 0, profit = 0.

So, in code, I need to compute the maximum of (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) for m from k to n, and take the maximum between this value and 0.

But I need to make sure that if this value is negative, Alice chooses m = 0, profit = 0.

Yes, that makes sense.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, sort the items by b_i in decreasing order.

Then, compute prefix_sum_b[m] and prefix_sum_a[m] for m from 1 to n.

Then, for m from k to n, compute (prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_a[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]).

Find the maximum of these values.

Finally, take the maximum between this value and 0.

This should be the answer.

Let me verify this with the first test case.

Test Case 1:

2 0

2 1

1 2

So, n = 2, k = 0.

Items:

Item 1: a=2, b=1

Item 2: a=1, b=2

Since k = 0, Bob takes nothing.

Alice can choose to buy nothing, profit = 0.

Or buy item 1, profit = 1 - 2 = -1.

Or buy item 2, profit = 2 - 1 = 1.

Or buy both, profit = (1 + 2) - (2 + 1) = 0.

So, the maximum profit is 1.

Now, according to my approach:

Sort items by b_i descending: item 2 (b=2), item 1 (b=1).

prefix_sum_b[1] = 2, prefix_sum_a[1] = 1

prefix_sum_b[2] = 2 + 1 = 3, prefix_sum_a[2] = 1 + 2 = 3

Since k = 0, prefix_sum_b[k] = 0.

So, for m = 0, profit = 0.

For m = 1, (2 - 1 - 0) = 1

For m = 2, (3 - 3 - 0) = 0

Maximum is 1, which matches the expected output.

Good.

Test Case 2:

4 1

1 2 1 4

3 3 2 3

So, n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,1,4]

b = [3,3,2,3]

Sort by b descending: items with b=3,3,3,2.

So, sorted order: item1 (b=3,a=1), item2 (b=3,a=2), item3 (b=3,a=1), item4 (b=2,a=4)

Compute prefix_sum_b:

m=1: 3

m=2: 6

m=3: 9

m=4: 11

prefix_sum_a:

m=1:1

m=2:3

m=3:4

m=4:8

prefix_sum_b[k] = prefix_sum_b[1] = 3

For m=1: (3 - 1) - 3 = -1

m=2: (6 - 3) - 3 = 0

m=3: (9 - 4) - 3 = 2

m=4: (11 - 8) - 3 = 0

Maximum is 2.

But according to the sample output, it should be 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says Alice buys items 1,2,3 (m=3), Bob takes the item with highest b_i (which is any of the first three, since they all have b=3), so he takes one for free, and pays for the other two.

So, sum(b_i for the remaining two items) is 3 + 2 = 5, sum(a_i for all three items) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, so profit is 5 - 4 = 1.

But according to my calculation, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in my approach.

Wait, in my approach, for m=3:

sum(b_i for m - k = 2 items with lowest b_i) is sum of the two lowest b_i among the three, which are 2 and 3, sum=5.

sum(a_i for all three items) is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So, profit=5-4=1.

But according to my earlier formula, I had (prefix_sum_b[3] - prefix_sum_b[1]) - prefix_sum_a[3] = (9 - 3) - 4 = 2.

Wait, that's incorrect.

I think I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me re-examine.

sum(b_i for the (m - k) items with lowest b_i) is not simply prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k].

Because in the sorted list, prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k] would be sum of b_i from k+1 to m, which are the m - k lowest b_i.

So, for m=3, k=1, sum(b_i from 2 to 3) = 3 + 2 = 5.

sum(a_i from 1 to 3) = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

Profit=5-4=1.

But according to my earlier formula:

(prefix_sum_b[m] - prefix_sum_b[k]) - prefix_sum_a[m] = (9 - 3) - 4 = 2.

This is different from the actual profit of 1.

So, there's an error in my formula.

I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract sum(a_i for all m items) minus sum(b_i for the k items with highest b_i).

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for the (m - k)
