Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player picks one card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their chosen card on the table.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get if both Nene and I play optimally, with Nene trying to maximize her score and minimize mine secondarily.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly. There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. So, for each number, there are two cards: one in my hand and one in Nene's hand, or both in one person's hand.

Wait, no. The problem says that the deck has 2n cards, each with a number from 1 to n, and each number appears exactly twice. Then, these 2n cards are distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. So, for each number from 1 to n, its two cards are split between me and Nene in some way. It's possible that I have both cards of a particular number, or just one, or none.

But, looking back at the input description, it says: "the cards in your hand have integers a1, a2, ..., an written on them". And it's guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in this list. So, since I have n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears at most twice, it means that some numbers may appear once, others may appear twice, and some may not appear at all in my hand.

Wait, no, the problem says: "each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times". But since there are n cards in my hand, and each number appears at most twice, it's possible that some numbers appear twice, and others appear once, but the total number of cards is n.

Wait, but if each number appears at most twice in my hand, and I have n cards, then the numbers that appear twice in my hand would be some of the numbers from 1 to n, and the rest appear either once or not at all in my hand.

But the problem also says that in the deck, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and the deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. So, it's possible that for some numbers, both cards are in my hand, for others, one is in my hand and one in Nene's, and for others, both are in Nene's hand.

Wait, but the input guarantees that each number from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, which makes sense because each number has exactly two cards in the deck.

So, in the input, for each test case, after n, there are n integers representing the numbers on the cards in my hand, each between 1 and n, and each number appears at most twice in this list.

My goal is to maximize my points, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine secondarily.

I need to find out, given my hand, what's the maximum number of points I can get.

First, I need to think about how the game progresses. We take turns, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player picks a card from their hand, and if there's already a card with the same number on the table, they get a point. Then, they place their card on the table.

Since the game is played with perfect information (each player can see all the cards on the table at each moment), both players can make optimal decisions based on the current state.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options that maximize her score, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find out, given that, what's the maximum score I can achieve.

First, let's think about the possible scenarios.

Suppose I have a number that appears twice in my hand. That means both cards of that number are in my hand.

In this case, when I play the first card of that number, there's no matching card on the table yet, so I don't get a point. Then, when I play the second card of that number, there is already one on the table (the one I played earlier), so I get a point.

So, for a number that appears twice in my hand, I can get one point from it, by playing both cards in my turns.

Now, suppose I have only one card of a number. Then, the other card of that number is in Nene's hand.

In this case, when I play my card, there's no matching card on the table yet, so I don't get a point. Then, when Nene plays her card, if there's already my card on the table, she gets a point.

So, for numbers where I have only one card, I can't get any points from them, because I don't have the second card to play after Nene has played hers.

Wait, but actually, the order of playing matters. Maybe there's a way to arrange the play order to get some points from these numbers.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose I have one card of a number, and Nene has the other.

If I play my card when there's no matching card on the table, I don't get a point.

Then, when Nene plays her card later, she will get a point because my card is already on the table.

But, is there a way for me to get a point from this number?

Well, I can only get a point if I play a card that has its pair already on the table.

But, for a number where I have only one card, the pair is in Nene's hand. So, for me to get a point from this number, I need to play my card after Nene has played her card.

But, since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to prevent me from getting points.

Wait, but Nene plays after me in each pair of turns. Since I start, I take the first turn, then Nene takes the second turn, and so on.

So, if I play a card in my first turn, Nene plays in her turn, and so on.

Given that, perhaps I can plan the order of playing my cards to maximize my points.

But it seems complicated.

Let me consider the numbers where I have two cards. For each such number, I can get one point by playing both cards in my turns.

For numbers where I have only one card, I can't get a point from them, because I don't have the second card to play after Nene has played hers.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to get a point from those numbers under some circumstances.

Wait, suppose that for a number where I have only one card, Nene has the other.

If Nene plays her card before I play my card, then when I play my card, there will already be her card on the table, so I get a point.

But, Nene is trying to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, she will try to play her card in such a way that minimizes my score.

Specifically, for numbers where I have only one card, she might play her card after I play mine, to prevent me from getting a point.

Wait, but the turns are fixed: we alternate turns, starting with me.

So, the sequence of turns is determined, and we can't choose when to play which card, in terms of timing relative to each other.

Wait, no, actually, each player chooses which card to play on their turn, based on the current state of the table.

So, the sequence of turns is fixed, but the choice of which card to play on each turn is up to the player.

So, Nene, being optimal, will choose which card to play on her turn to maximize her score and minimize mine, given the current state.

Similarly, I can choose which card to play on my turn to maximize my score, given Nene's optimal play.

This seems complex to simulate for each turn.

Is there a smarter way to calculate the maximum points I can get without simulating the entire game?

Let me think about the properties of the game.

First, for numbers where I have two cards, I can always get one point from them by playing both cards in my turns.

For numbers where I have only one card, I might be able to get a point if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But, since Nene is trying to minimize my score, she will likely play her cards in a way that minimizes the points I can get from such numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs.

Let me consider that each number that appears twice in the deck can be considered a pair.

If both cards of a pair are in my hand, I can get one point from it.

If one card is in my hand and one in Nene's, then depending on the play order, I might be able to get a point.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the number of pairs that are entirely in my hand versus those that are split between me and Nene.

Let me define:

- Let s be the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand. For each such number, I can get one point by playing both cards in my turns.

- Let t be the number of numbers that appear once in my hand. For each such number, the other card is in Nene's hand.

- Let u be the number of numbers that do not appear in my hand at all. For each such number, both cards are in Nene's hand.

So, s + t + u = n.

Wait, no. The total number of unique numbers is n.

I have n cards, and each number appears at most twice in my hand.

So, the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand is s, and the number of numbers that appear once in my hand is t. Then, the number of numbers that do not appear in my hand at all is u = n - s - t.

For the s pairs that are entirely in my hand, I can get one point per pair by playing both cards in my turns.

For the t numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other, I might be able to get a point if Nene plays her card before I play mine.

But, since Nene is trying to minimize my score, she will likely play her cards in a way that minimizes the points I can get from these numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of such pairs.

Wait, no, these are not pairs, but single cards in my hand with their pairs in Nene's hand.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the game in terms of graph theory or some other combinatorial structure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as a matching problem.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a set of numbers in my hand, some appearing once, some appearing twice.

I need to choose an ordering of playing my cards such that I maximize the number of times I play a card that has its pair already on the table.

Given that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of duplicates I have in my hand.

For each number that appears twice in my hand, I can get one point.

For numbers that appear only once in my hand, I might get a point if Nene plays her card before I play mine, but Nene will try to prevent that.

Wait, perhaps the key is to note that for numbers where I have both cards, I can always get one point.

For numbers where I have only one card, I can get a point only if Nene plays her card before I play mine, but Nene will try to minimize that.

Given that, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the first test case of the example, n=4, and my cards are 1,1,2,3.

So, s=1 (number 1 appears twice), t=2 (numbers 2 and 3 appear once), u=1 (number 4 does not appear in my hand).

According to this, the maximum points I can get is s=1, which matches the first sample output.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, s=2 (numbers 8 and 5 appear twice), t=3 (numbers 7,4,1,2 appear once each, but only t=3 since n=8 and u=8-2-3=3).

Wait, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5].

So, s=2 (8 and 5 appear twice), t=4 (7,4,1,2 appear once), u=8-2-4=2.

The output is 2, which matches s=2.

Wait, but according to my earlier hypothesis, the maximum points I can get is s, the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

But in the third test case, n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6].

So, s=1 (number 4 appears twice), t=6 (numbers 7,1,5,3,2,6 appear once), u=8-1-6=1.

The output is 1, which again matches s=1.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3].

So, s=0 (no number appears twice in my hand), t=3 (numbers 1,2,3 appear once each), u=0.

The output is 0, which matches s=0.

In the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1].

So, s=1 if n=1 and a=[1], but wait, n=1, a=[1], which means that there are 2 cards with number 1 in the deck, and I have one of them, so s=0, t=1, u=0.

But according to the sample output, it's 0, but according to s=0, it matches.

Wait, but in this case, n=1, a=[1], which means that I have one card with 1, and Nene has the other card with 1.

So, s=0, t=1, u=0.

And the output is 0, which matches s=0.

So, in all the sample test cases, the output matches s, the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

Is this always the case?

From the samples, it seems so.

But I need to confirm if this is generally true.

Let me think about why this might be the case.

For numbers where I have both cards, I can always get one point by playing both in my turns.

For numbers where I have only one card, I can't get a point from them because I don't have the second card to play after Nene has played hers.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

This seems to align with the sample outputs.

But, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, what if, for some numbers where I have only one card, Nene plays her card before I play mine, allowing me to get a point when I play my card.

But, since Nene is playing optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she would likely play her cards in a way that prevents me from getting points from such numbers.

So, perhaps, in the best case, I can only rely on the points from the numbers where I have both cards.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

This seems to be consistent with the sample outputs.

Therefore, the solution is to count the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

In terms of implementation, I can count the frequency of each number in my hand and count how many numbers have a frequency of 2.

That would be the value of s, which is the maximum points I can get.

So, in code, I can read the input, for each test case, read n and the list a of n integers, count the frequency of each number, and count how many numbers have a frequency of 2.

That's straightforward.

Looking back at the provided program:

import sys

def func():

input = sys.stdin.readline

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = [0] * (n + 1)

for x in a:

cnt[x] += 1

ans = 0

for x in cnt:

ans += max(0, x - 1)

print(ans)



This code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the list a, counts the frequency of each number in a, and then for each number, adds max(0, x - 1) to the answer, where x is the frequency of that number in a.

Wait, but since each number appears at most twice in a, x can be 0, 1, or 2.

- If x=0, max(0, x-1) = 0

- If x=1, max(0, x-1) = 0

- If x=2, max(0, x-1) = 1

So, ans is equal to the number of numbers that appear twice in a, which is s.

Therefore, the code is correctly calculating s, which, according to my earlier reasoning, is equal to the maximum points I can get.

Hence, the given program is correct.
