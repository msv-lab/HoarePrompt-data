Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in a way that minimizes the total penalty. The penalty for each substring is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its values (where "+" is 1 and "-" is -1) multiplied by its length.

First, I need to understand what the sum of a substring would be. If a substring has more "+" than "-", its sum is positive; if more "-", it's negative. But since the penalty is the absolute value of the sum times the length, it's always non-negative.

My goal is to split the string into substrings such that when I calculate the penalty for each and add them up, this total is minimized.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to consider different ways to split the string and calculate the penalty for each, but that seems inefficient, especially since the string can be up to 5000 characters long and there are multiple test cases.

I need a smarter way to minimize the total penalty. Let's think about what makes a substring's penalty high or low. The penalty is low if the absolute sum is small relative to the length. Ideally, I want substrings where the sum is zero, because then the penalty is zero.

So, if I can split the string into substrings where each substring has a sum of zero, that would be ideal. But that might not always be possible. Sometimes, I might have to accept substrings with non-zero sums.

Wait a minute, in the third test case of the example, the string is "+-+-+-", which corresponds to [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]. The sum of the entire string is zero, and it's split into two substrings, each with sum zero, resulting in a total penalty of zero.

In the first test case, the string is "+", which is [1], and since it can't be split further, the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1.

In the second test case, the string is "-----", which is [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1], and it's split into individual characters, each with penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, so total penalty is 5.

In the fourth test case, "--+++++++-", which is [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1], and the minimal total penalty is 4.

I need to find a way to split the string to minimize the total penalty.

Let me consider the entire string as a single substring. The penalty would be | sum of the entire string | * length of the string.

Alternatively, if I split the string into individual characters, the total penalty would be the sum of | each character | * 1, which is simply the number of "-" characters since "+" is 1 and "-" is -1, and the absolute value makes them all positive.

Wait, no. The absolute value of "+" is 1, and of "-" is also 1, so the total penalty if split into individual characters is equal to the length of the string.

But in the second test case, splitting into individual characters gives a penalty of 5, which is the same as the example's output.

Wait, but in the third test case, splitting into two substrings gives a total penalty of 0, which is better than splitting into individual characters or other splits.

So, the minimal penalty is not always equal to the length of the string.

I need to find a way to split the string such that the sum of (absolute sum of substring * length of substring) is minimized.

I need to think of a way to group the characters in a way that balances the sum and the length.

Let me consider dynamic programming approach. Define dp[i] as the minimal total penalty for the substring ending at position i.

Then, for each position i, I can consider all possible splits before i, and choose the one that minimizes the total penalty.

But with n up to 5000, a quadratic time complexity might be too slow, but let's see.

First, I need to define the state and the transition.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let s be the input string of length n.

Define a[i] = 1 if s[i] == '+', else -1.

I need to split s into substrings b1, b2, ..., bk such that the sum of p(bj) for all j is minimized, where p(bj) = | sum of bj | * length of bj.

So, dp[i] = minimal total penalty for the substring s[0..i]

To compute dp[i], I need to consider all possible splits before position i.

For each j from 0 to i-1, dp[i] = min(dp[j] + p(s[j+1..i])), where p(s[j+1..i]) is the penalty of the substring from j+1 to i.

Also, consider the case where the substring from 0 to i is not split, i.e., j = -1, dp[i] = p(s[0..i])

This seems correct.

Now, I need to compute this for all i from 0 to n-1.

Finally, dp[n-1] will be the answer for the entire string.

But with n=5000, and t=1000, this might be too slow because it's O(n^2) per test case, which is 5000*5000=25,000,000 operations per test case, and with t=1000, that's 25,000,000,000 operations, which is way too much.

Wait, but t can be up to 1000, and n up to 5000, but looking at the problem, it says "Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.", which might imply that the total number of operations is manageable, perhaps n*t is limited in some way, but it's still seems too high.

I need to find a better way.

Let me see if there's a way to optimize this dynamic programming approach.

Is there a way to find the optimal split without considering all possible splits?

Let me consider the properties of the penalty function.

Suppose I have a substring with sum S and length L. Its penalty is |S| * L.

If S is zero, penalty is zero, which is ideal.

If S is non-zero, penalty is |S| * L.

I want to minimize the sum of such penalties.

Is there a way to group the characters such that the sums of the substrings are zero as much as possible?

In the third test case, the entire string has sum zero, and it's split into two substrings, each with sum zero.

In the second test case, the entire string has sum -5, and splitting into individual characters gives penalty 5, which matches the example.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, the string is "--+++++++-", which is [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1], sum is -1 + 7*1 -1 = 5.

The example says the minimal penalty is 4, but if I split into individual characters, penalty is 10, which is worse than 4.

So, there must be a better way to split it.

Perhaps splitting into substrings where the sum is as close to zero as possible.

But I need a systematic way to find the minimal total penalty.

Let me consider prefix sums.

Define prefix_sum[i] as the sum of a[0] to a[i].

Then, the sum of a substring from j+1 to i is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j].

And the penalty is |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j).

So, dp[i] = min over j from -1 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j))

Where j=-1 corresponds to not splitting before i, i.e., dp[-1] = 0 and the penalty is |prefix_sum[i]| * (i - (-1)) = |prefix_sum[i]| * (i+1)

But this is still O(n^2).

Is there a way to optimize this?

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a mathematical formula to compute the minimal penalty without iterating over all possible splits.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some properties of the sum and the length to find a better approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length.

Suppose I have a substring with sum S and length L.

If S is zero, penalty is zero.

If S is non-zero, penalty is |S| * L.

I want to minimize the sum of such penalties.

Perhaps I can think in terms of grouping pluses and minuses to cancel each other out as much as possible.

For example, in the third test case, "+-+-+-", I can group them in pairs: "+-" which sums to zero, so penalty is zero for each pair.

Similarly, in the first test case, "+", I have no choice but to accept penalty 1.

In the second test case, "-----", I can't group them to cancel out, so splitting into individual characters minimizes the penalty to 1 each, total 5.

In the fourth test case, "--+++++++-", I can group the first two minuses and the last minus separately, and the middle pluses together.

Wait, let's see:

"--" sums to -2, length 2, penalty 4.

"+++++++" sums to 7, length 7, penalty 7*7=49.

"-" sums to -1, length 1, penalty 1.

Total penalty is 4 + 49 + 1 = 54, which is worse than the example's output of 4.

So, that's not the optimal split.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe grouping "--+++++++" and "-", where "--+++++++" sums to -2 + 7 = 5, length 9, penalty 5*9=45, and "-" has penalty 1, total 46, still worse.

Alternatively, grouping "--++", "+++++-".

"--++" sums to -1, length 4, penalty 4.

"+++++-" sums to 5, length 6, penalty 30.

Total penalty 4 + 30 = 34, better but still not 4.

Wait, the example output is 4, but I'm getting higher values.

Maybe I'm missing a better way to split.

Wait, perhaps grouping "--+++++++" and "-", but adjusting the groups.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is achieved when the sum of each substring is as close to zero as possible, meaning that positive and negative values cancel each other out within each substring.

So, perhaps I should try to maximize the number of substrings where the sum is zero.

But in the fourth test case, it's not possible to have substrings with sum zero.

Wait, "--+++++++-" has sum 5, so I need to distribute this sum across substrings in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

Maybe I need to find a way to split the string such that the absolute sum of each substring is minimized, considering their lengths.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of substrings, k, and try to minimize the total penalty.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a minimization problem and find a way to compute it efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the penalty is |sum| * length and find a way to group elements to minimize this.

Let me consider that for a substring with sum S and length L, the penalty is |S| * L.

I can think of |S| as the absolute value of the sum of the substring.

I need to minimize the sum of |S| * L for all substrings.

I wonder if there's a way to compute this without trying all possible splits.

Let me consider that if I have a substring with sum S and length L, and I split it into two substrings with sums S1 and S2, lengths L1 and L2, then the total penalty becomes |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2, compared to |S| * L.

I need to see if splitting reduces the penalty.

Let me consider that |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2 <= |S| * L.

Whether this holds depends on the values of S1 and S2.

If S1 and S2 have opposite signs, then |S1| + |S2| could be less than |S|.

But in this problem, S1 and S2 are sums of substrings consisting of "+" and "-", so they can be positive or negative.

Wait, but the penalty is |S| * L, so it's always non-negative.

I need to find a way to split the string such that the sum of |S| * L is minimized.

Let me consider that if I have a substring with sum S and length L, and I split it into two substrings with sums S1 and S2, then the condition for the split to be beneficial is |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2 < |S| * L.

I need to find when this inequality holds.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose substring is "+-", sum is 0, length 2, penalty 0.

If I don't split it, penalty is 0.

If I split it into "+" and "-", penalties are 1 and 1, total 2.

So, splitting increases the penalty.

Hence, in this case, not splitting is better.

Another example: "++-", sum is 1, length 3, penalty 3.

If I split into "+" and "++-", penalties are 1 and 1*3=3, total 4, which is worse than 3.

Alternatively, split into "+" and "+-" and "-", penalties are 1, 0, and 1, total 2, which is better than 3.

So, in this case, splitting can be better.

Wait, but in the first split, I split into "+" and "++-", which has sum 1 and 1 respectively, lengths 1 and 2, penalties 1 and 2, total 3, which is the same as not splitting.

But if I split into "+" and "+-" and "-", penalties are 1, 0, and 1, total 2, which is better.

So, splitting into more parts can be better.

But in the first case, splitting into two parts was worse, but splitting into three parts was better.

So, I need to consider multiple possible splits.

This suggests that the dynamic programming approach is necessary, where I consider all possible splits before position i.

But with n=5000 and t=1000, this might be too slow.

I need to find a way to optimize this.

Let me see if I can find a mathematical formula or a way to compute dp[i] without iterating over all j from 0 to i-1.

Let me consider that dp[i] = min over j from -1 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j))

I need to minimize dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

Let me denote prefix_sum as p, for simplicity.

So, dp[i] = min over j from -1 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j))

This looks similar to certain dynamic programming problems where you have to minimize a cost based on differences.

I wonder if there's a way to group j's based on the value of p[j].

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a fixed p[j], the term |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j) is minimized.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a given p[i], and for each j, dp[j] + |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j)

I need to minimize this over j.

This seems like finding the j that minimizes dp[j] + |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j)

This is similar to certain optimization problems, perhaps related to convex hull optimization.

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that if p[j] is close to p[i], then |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j) is small.

But I need to minimize the sum.

Wait, perhaps I can sort j's based on p[j] and find the minimal dp[j] + |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j)

But sorting j's for each i would still be O(n^2).

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for a fixed p[i], and for each j, the term |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j) can be thought of as a cost based on the difference in prefix sums and the length.

I need to minimize dp[j] + this cost.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the string and try to build substrings in a way that their sum is as close to zero as possible.

I can try to group pluses and minuses to cancel each other out.

For example, in "+-+-+-", I can group them into two substrings, each with sum zero.

In "--+++++++-", I can try to group the minuses and pluses to minimize the sum's absolute value times the length.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that for each position i, I can keep track of the minimal dp[j] for each possible value of p[j].

In other words, for each possible sum value, keep track of the minimal dp[j] for all j where p[j] equals that sum.

Then, for each i, I can compute dp[i] by considering the minimal dp[j] + |p[i] - p[j]| * (i - j) for all j where p[j] is close to p[i].

But this still seems vague.

Wait, perhaps I can use a sliding window or some kind of windowing technique to keep track of the sums and their corresponding dp values.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the penalty is |sum| * length, which is equivalent to the absolute difference between the number of pluses and minuses multiplied by the length.

Because sum is (number of pluses - number of minuses), so |sum| is |(number of pluses - number of minuses)|.

Thus, penalty is |(number of pluses - number of minuses)| * length.

I need to minimize the sum of such penalties for all substrings in the split.

I wonder if there's a way to model this as a shortest path problem or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the minimal total penalty is achieved when the substrings are chosen such that the product of the imbalance (|sum|) and the length is minimized.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for a substring with more pluses than minuses, it's better to make it shorter, and vice versa.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a substring with sum S and length L, the penalty is |S| * L.

I need to minimize the sum of |S| * L over all substrings.

I need to find a way to split the string such that this sum is minimized.

Let me consider that if I have a substring with sum S and length L, and I split it into two substrings with sums S1 and S2, lengths L1 and L2, then the new penalty would be |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2, compared to |S| * L.

I need to see when |S1| * L1 + |S2| * L2 < |S| * L.

This inequality holds when the sum S is such that splitting it allows for smaller |S1| and |S2| relative to their lengths.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider specific examples.

Take "--++-+", n=6.

prefix_sum: -1, -2, -1, 0, -1, 0

Possible splits:

- Entire string: sum=-1, L=6, penalty=6*1=6

- Split into "--++" and "-+", sums=-1 and -1, L=4 and 2, penalties=4*1=4 and 2*1=2, total=6

- Split into "--" and "++-+", sums=-2 and 1, L=2 and 4, penalties=2*2=4 and 4*1=4, total=8

- Split into "--++-" and "+", sums=-1 and 1, L=5 and 1, penalties=5*1=5 and 1*1=1, total=6

- Split into "--" and "++" and "-", sums=-2, 2, -1, L=2,2,2, penalties=2*2=4, 2*2=4, 2*1=2, total=10

- Split into individual characters, penalties=1+1+1+1+1+1=6

So, the minimal total penalty is 6.

But according to the earlier thought, splitting into two substrings with sums -1 and -1 gives total penalty 6, same as not splitting.

In this case, it's not better than splitting into individual characters.

Wait, but in the third test case, splitting into substrings with sum zero gives penalty zero, which is better than splitting into individual characters.

So, it depends on the string.

I need a general approach.

Let me consider that the minimal total penalty is equal to the number of minuses in the string.

Because each minus contributes -1 to the sum, and each plus contributes +1.

If I split the string into substrings where each substring has an equal number of pluses and minuses, their sums would be zero, and penalties would be zero.

But if the number of pluses and minuses is unequal, I have to accept some penalty.

Wait, perhaps the minimal total penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of pluses and minuses in the string.

But in the third test case, number of pluses is 3, minuses is 3, difference is zero, and minimal penalty is zero.

In the second test case, all minuses, difference is 5, minimal penalty is 5.

In the fourth test case, pluses are 7, minuses are 3, difference is 4, minimal penalty is 4.

In the fifth test case, pluses are 14, minuses are 6, difference is 8, but the example output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the fifth test case, it's "+---++++-+++++---++-", which is:

+ - - - + + + + - + + + + - - - + + - +

Counting pluses and minuses:

pluses: 1, -, -, -, +, +, +, +, -, +, +, +, +, -, -, -, +, +, -, +

So, pluses: 12, minuses: 8.

Difference is 4.

Example output is 4.

Wait, in the fourth test case, "--+++++++-", pluses:7, minuses:3, difference:4, example output:4.

In the second test case, "-----", pluses:0, minuses:5, difference:5, example output:5.

In the first test case, "+", pluses:1, minuses:0, difference:1, example output:1.

In the third test case, "+-+-+-", pluses:3, minuses:3, difference:0, example output:0.

So, it seems that the minimal total penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of pluses and minuses.

If that's the case, then the minimal total penalty is |P - M|, where P is the number of pluses and M is the number of minuses.

This seems to match all the examples.

Let me verify this.

In the first test case, P=1, M=0, |1-0|=1, matches output 1.

Second test case, P=0, M=5, |0-5|=5, matches output 5.

Third test case, P=3, M=3, |3-3|=0, matches output 0.

Fourth test case, P=7, M=3, |7-3|=4, matches output 4.

Fifth test case, P=12, M=8, |12-8|=4, matches output 4.

So, it seems that the minimal total penalty is simply the absolute difference between the number of pluses and minuses.

If that's the case, then I don't need a dynamic programming approach; I can just count the number of pluses and minuses and compute their absolute difference.

This would be a much simpler and efficient solution.

But I need to make sure that this is always the case.

Is there any case where the minimal total penalty is not equal to |P - M|?

Let me consider a string like "++--", P=2, M=2, |2-2|=0.

If I split into "++" and "--", each with sum 2 and -2, penalties are 2*2=4 and 2*2=4, total 8.

But if I split into "+-+-", which is "+", "-", "+", "-", penalties are 1,1,1,1, total 4.

But according to my earlier assumption, |2-2|=0, but the minimal penalty is 0, which can be achieved by splitting into "++--" with sum 0 and length 4, penalty 0.

Wait, but in this case, sum is 0, length 4, penalty 0.

So, indeed, the minimal penalty is |P - M|=0.

Another example: "++-+", P=3, M=1, |3-1|=2.

If I split into "++-" and "+", sums 1 and 1, lengths 3 and 1, penalties 3*1=3 and 1*1=1, total 4.

Alternatively, split into "++", "-", "+", sums 2, -1, 1, penalties 2*2=4, 1*1=1, 1*1=1, total 6.

Split into "++++-", sum 3, length 5, penalty 15.

The minimal is 4, which matches |3-1|=2, but earlier I thought it's |P - M|.

Wait, in this case, |P - M|=2, but the minimal penalty is 4.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, "++-+", P=3, M=1.

If I split into "++-", sum=1, length=3, penalty=3, and "+", sum=1, length=1, penalty=1, total 4.

Alternatively, "++", sum=2, length=2, penalty=4, and "-+", sum=0, length=2, penalty=0, total 4.

Another split: "+", sum=1, penalty=1; "+", sum=1, penalty=1; "-+", sum=0, penalty=0, total 2.

Wait, this is better than 4.

So, the minimal penalty is 2, which is less than |P - M|=2.

Wait, but according to my earlier assumption, minimal penalty should be |P - M|=2, but in this case, it's 2.

Wait, no, in this split, "+", "+", "-+", penalties 1,1,0, total 2.

So, it matches |P - M|=2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that splitting into "++-", "+" gives total penalty 4, but splitting into "+", "+", "-+" gives total penalty 2, which is better.

So, the minimal penalty is indeed |P - M|=2.

Hence, my assumption seems correct.

Another example: "++++++", P=6, M=0, |6-0|=6.

If I split into "++++++", sum=6, length=6, penalty=36.

Or split into "+++","+++ ", sums 3 and 3, lengths 3 and 3, penalties 9 and 9, total 18.

Or split into "+","+", etc., penalties 1+1+1+1+1+1=6.

The minimal penalty is 6, which matches |6-0|=6.

Another example: "+-+", P=2, M=1, |2-1|=1.

If I split into "+-+", sum=1, length=3, penalty 3.

Or split into "+-", sum=0, length=2, penalty 0; and "+", sum=1, length=1, penalty 1, total 1.

Or split into "+","-","+", penalties 1,1,1, total 3.

So, the minimal penalty is 1, which matches |2-1|=1.

Hence, it seems that the minimal total penalty is indeed equal to |P - M|.

Wait, but in the earlier example, I had "++-+", P=3, M=1, minimal penalty 2, which is |3-1|=2.

So, it seems consistent.

Therefore, the minimal total penalty is |P - M|.

Hence, the program can simply count the number of pluses and minuses, compute their absolute difference, and output that.

This would be a much simpler and efficient solution.

Looking back at the given program:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

length = int(input())

expression = input().strip()

print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):

count = 0

for char in expression:

if char == '+':

count += 1

sub = length - count

return abs(sub - count)

This seems to be implementing exactly what I just deduced.

It counts the number of pluses (count), computes the number of minuses as sub = length - count, and returns abs(sub - count), which is |M - P|, same as |P - M|.

Hence, this should be correct.

I verified with the examples and it matches.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}\]
