Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

I need to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, given that Dominater acts optimally to destroy bridges.

First, I need to understand the setup. With n islands and all possible bridges, the graph is fully connected. Everule can reach any island from island 1 via some path.

Dominater wants to destroy up to k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. So, Dominater's goal is to isolate island 1 as much as possible by breaking connections to other islands.

I need to figure out, given n and k, what's the smallest number of islands Everule can still reach.

Let me think about small cases to get an intuition.

Take n=2, k=0.

- Islands: 1,2

- Bridges: only one between 1 and 2.

- k=0, so no bridges are destroyed.

- Everule can reach island 2 via the bridge.

- So, Everule can visit both islands: 1 and 2.

- According to the sample input, the output is 2, which matches.

Next, n=2, k=1.

- Islands: 1,2

- Bridges: one between 1 and 2.

- k=1, so Dominater can destroy that single bridge.

- Now, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- Output should be 1, again matching the sample.

Now, n=4, k=1.

- Islands: 1,2,3,4

- Bridges: 6 in total.

- Dominater can destroy 1 bridge.

- Everule starts from island 1.

- To minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, Dominater would probably want to disconnect island 1 from as many other islands as possible.

- If Dominater destroys a bridge directly connected to island 1, say bridge between 1 and 2, then Everule can still reach island 2 via other paths, like 1-3-2 or 1-4-2.

- So, destroying one bridge doesn't isolate island 1 completely.

- Hence, Everule can still reach all islands.

- According to the sample, output is 4, which matches.

Wait, but the sample output for n=4, k=1 is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Another sample: n=5, k=10.

- Wait, n=5 has 10 bridges (5*4/2=10).

- k=10, so Dominater can destroy all bridges.

- Then, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- Output is 1, matching the sample.

Another sample: n=5, k=3.

- n=5, 10 bridges.

- k=3, Dominater destroys 3 bridges.

- Need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can reach.

- According to the sample, output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Last sample: n=4, k=4.

- n=4, 6 bridges.

- k=4, Dominater destroys 4 bridges.

- Need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can reach.

- According to the sample, output is 1, meaning Everule can only stay on island 1.

From these examples, it seems that as long as the number of bridges destroyed is less than the number of islands minus 1, Everule can still reach all islands. But when the number of bridges destroyed is equal to or greater than n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Wait, let's think about it.

In graph theory terms, the graph is initially connected. To disconnect the graph into multiple components, we need to remove enough edges such that there's no path between some pairs of nodes.

In a complete graph with n nodes, the minimum number of edges to remove to disconnect the graph is n-1. This is because you can remove all edges connected to island 1, which are n-1 edges, and island 1 will be isolated.

So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 by removing all its connections to other islands, and Everule can only stay on island 1.

If k < n-1, then there are still at least one path from island 1 to every other island, so Everule can reach all n islands.

Wait, but in the sample where n=5 and k=3, 3 < 5-1=4, and the output is 5, meaning Everule can reach all islands.

Similarly, in n=4, k=1, 1 < 4-1=3, and output is 4.

But in n=4, k=4, 4 >= 4-1=3, output is 1.

This seems to align with the idea that if k >= n-1, Everule can only reach 1 island, else, all n islands.

But wait, in n=5, k=3, 3 < 5-1=4, output is 5.

In n=5, k=10, which is >=5-1=4, output is 1.

So, it seems the threshold is k >= n-1.

But in the sample where n=5, k=3, 3 < 5-1=4, output is 5.

Wait, but 3 < 4, so Everule can reach all 5 islands.

Wait, but in n=4, k=4, 4 >= 4-1=3, output is 1.

Yes, this seems consistent.

Wait, but in n=4, k=1, 1 < 3, output is 4.

n=4, k=4, 4 >=3, output is 1.

n=5, k=3, 3 <4, output is 5.

n=5, k=10, 10 >=4, output is 1.

So, the general rule seems to be:

If k >= n-1, then Everule can only reach 1 island.

Else, Everule can reach all n islands.

Wait, but in the program given, it's:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Wait, n - k <=1.

Wait, for n=5, k=3, 5-3=2 <=1? No, 2 >1, so print 1.

But according to the sample, for n=5, k=3, output should be 5.

Wait, but according to this, it would print 1, but sample output is 5.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

Wait, the program is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Wait, for n=5, k=3, n - k =5-3=2 <=1? 2 <=1 is False, so print 1.

But sample output is 5.

So, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the program.

Wait, but according to the sample, for n=5, k=3, output should be 5.

But according to the program, it would print 1.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, if k >= n-1, print 1, else print n.

But in the sample, for n=5, k=3, 3 <5-1=4, so should print 5.

But the program would print 1 because n - k =5-3=2 <=1 is False, so print 1.

Wait, 5-3=2 <=1 is False, so print 1.

But sample output is 5.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a misinterpretation.

Wait, let's look at the program again.

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

So, if n - k <=1, print n, else print 1.

In n=5, k=3, 5-3=2 <=1? 2 <=1 is False, so print 1.

But according to the problem, it should be 5.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be:

If k >= n-1, print 1, else print n.

So, in terms of n and k, it's k >= n-1.

Let's see:

k >= n-1 => print 1

else print n.

So, in terms of n and k, it's:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

But in the given program, it's:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is logically equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But n - k <=1 is the same as k >= n -1.

Because n - k <=1 => k >= n -1.

So, actually, the program is correct.

Wait, let's see:

n - k <=1

=> -k <=1 -n

=> k >= n -1

Yes, so print(n) if k >= n-1, else print(1).

Wait, no, wait:

n - k <=1

=> k >= n -1

So, if k >= n -1, print n, else print 1.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if k >= n-1, print 1, else print n.

So, the program seems to have it reversed.

Wait, perhaps I confused myself.

Wait, in the program:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which, as established, is equivalent to:

if k >= n -1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But according to the problem, when k >= n-1, Everule can only reach 1 island, which is island 1.

Hence, it should print 1 when k >= n-1, and n otherwise.

But according to the program, it's printing n when k >= n-1, and 1 otherwise.

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the samples:

n=2, k=0: output 2

n=2, k=1: output 1

n=4, k=1: output 4

n=5, k=10: output 1

n=5, k=3: output 5

n=4, k=4: output 1

Now, let's see what the program outputs:

For n=2, k=0: 2 -0 =2 <=1? 2<=1 is False, so print 1. But sample output is 2. So, incorrect.

Wait, there's a discrepancy.

Similarly, for n=2, k=1: 2-1=1 <=1 is True, so print 2. But sample output is 1.

Wait, now I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the condition.

Let's re-examine.

I thought that if k >= n-1, then Everule can only reach 1 island.

But in the sample, for n=5, k=3, which is k < n-1=4, output is 5.

For n=5, k=10, which is k >=10, output is 1.

So, the condition seems to be: if k >= n-1, print 1, else print n.

But according to the program: print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which, as I thought, is equivalent to:

if k >= n-1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But according to the problem, when k >= n-1, Everule can only reach 1 island.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, the correct program should be:

print(1 if k >= n-1 else n)

But the given program is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is effectively:

if k >= n-1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

But it should be:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample, for n=2, k=0: according to the correct logic, since k=0 <2-1=1, should print n=2. But according to the program, n - k =2 -0=2 <=1? No, so print 1, which is incorrect, as sample output is 2.

Similarly, for n=2, k=1: n - k =1 <=1, so print n=2, but sample output is 1.

Hence, the program is indeed incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way to look at it.

Maybe I miscounted the number of bridges.

Wait, for n=2, k=0: no bridges destroyed, so Everule can reach both islands, output 2.

For n=2, k=1: destroy the only bridge, so Everule can only stay on island 1, output 1.

For n=4, k=1: destroy one bridge, but Everule can still reach all islands via other paths, output 4.

For n=5, k=10: destroy all 10 bridges, so only island 1 is reachable, output 1.

For n=5, k=3: destroy 3 bridges, but Everule can still reach all islands, output 5.

For n=4, k=4: destroy 4 bridges, which is more than n-1=3, so only island 1 is reachable, output 1.

So, the pattern is: if k >= n-1, output 1, else output n.

But according to the program, it's printing n when n - k <=1, which is when k >= n-1, else print 1.

Which matches the correct logic.

Wait, but in the case of n=2, k=0: k < n-1=1, so should print n=2, but according to the program, n - k =2 -0=2 <=1? No, so print 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that in complete graph, to disconnect island 1 from all others, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1, which are n-1 bridges.

Hence, if k >= n-1, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.

Else, Everule can still reach all islands.

Hence, the correct output is:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But the program is:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

Which is the same as:

if k >= n-1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

Which is incorrect, as per the sample inputs.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the program is correct and I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, for n=4, k=1: n - k =3 <=1? No, so print 1, but sample output is 4.

Wait, inconsistency here.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit given that Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges optimally.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - There are \( n \) islands, fully connected with \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) bridges.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can visit any island via the bridges.

2. **Dominater's Action:**
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.
   - To isolate Everule on island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1.

3. **Critical Observation:**
   - Island 1 has \( n-1 \) bridges connecting it to other islands.
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), Dominater can destroy all these bridges, isolating island 1. Hence, Everule can only visit 1 island.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still reach all \( n \) islands.

4. **Condition for Isolation:**
   - Check if \( k \geq n-1 \):
     - If true, Everule can only visit 1 island.
     - If false, Everule can visit all \( n \) islands.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        index += 2

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Input Handling:**
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases \( t \).
  - Process each test case using indices to access the data.

- **Logic Implementation:**
  - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( k \).
  - Determine if \( k \) is sufficient to isolate island 1:
    - If \( k \geq n-1 \), print 1.
    - Otherwise, print \( n \).

This approach ensures that the solution is computed efficiently and correctly for each test case, adhering to the problem's constraints and requirements.
