Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down. It needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, the path can be represented by a sequence of moves. For a 2xN grid, any path from (1,1) to (2,N) will consist of exactly one down move and N-1 right moves, in some order. But actually, thinking more carefully, the grasshopper has to move down exactly once to go from row 1 to row 2, and the rest are right moves. So, the path is determined by the position where the down move occurs.

For example, in a 2x3 grid, the possible paths are:

1. Right, Right, Down: This corresponds to a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{13}, a_{23}

2. Right, Down, Right: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22}, a_{23}

3. Down, Right, Right: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22}, a_{23}

So, for each path, we collect the cells in the order they are visited and concatenate their values to form a string.

The problem is to find the lexicographically smallest such string and count how many paths produce this string.

Looking at the first test case in the example:

n=2

a1 = 00

a2 = 00

Possible paths:

1. Right, Down: a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{22} -> 000

2. Down, Right: a_{11}, a_{21}, a_{22} -> 000

Both paths give the same string "000", which is the lexicographically smallest possible, and there are 2 such paths.

In the second test case:

n=4

a1 = 1101

a2 = 1100

Possible paths:

1. Right, Right, Right, Down: 1101 + a_{24} = 11010

2. Right, Right, Down, Right: 110 + a_{23} + a_{24} = 11000

3. Right, Down, Right, Right: 11 + a_{22} + a_{23} + a_{24} = 11000

4. Down, Right, Right, Right: 1 + a_{21} + a_{22} + a_{23} + a_{24} = 11100

Among these, "11000" is lexicographically smaller than "11010" and "11100". So, the smallest string is "11000", and there are two paths that produce it. But according to the output, it's only one path. Wait, in the output, it's shown as 1. Maybe I miscounted.

Looking back, the output for the second test case is:

11000

1

So, only one path yields "11000". Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the strings.

Let's re-examine:

Path 1: Right, Right, Right, Down: a11, a12, a13, a14, a24 -> 11010

Path 2: Right, Right, Down, Right: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 -> 11000

Path 3: Right, Down, Right, Right: a11, a12, a22, a23, a24 -> 11000

Path 4: Down, Right, Right, Right: a11, a21, a22, a23, a24 -> 11100

So, "11000" is achieved by two paths, but the output says 1. Maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the path where the down move happens affects the string differently. Let me think again.

Actually, in the second test case, a1 = 1101 and a2 = 1100.

For path 2: Right, Right, Down, Right: cells a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 -> 1,1,0,0,0 -> "11000"

For path 3: Right, Down, Right, Right: cells a11, a12, a22, a23, a24 -> 1,1,0,0,0 -> "11000"

So, both paths give "11000". But the output says only one path gives "11000". Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the string is constructed by concatenating the cells in the order visited, and maybe the order is different. Let me check again.

Wait, in path 2: Right, Right, Down, Right: visits a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 -> 1,1,0,0,0 -> "11000"

Path 3: Right, Down, Right, Right: a11, a12, a22, a23, a24 -> 1,1,0,0,0 -> "11000"

So, both paths give the same string "11000". But the output says only one path. Maybe there's a mistake in the output or my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the string is determined by the cells in the path without changing their order, meaning that the order is fixed by the grid positions, not the visit order. Hmm.

Wait, no, the problem says "the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order". So, the order is the order in which the cells are visited.

In both paths above, the strings are the same "11000". So why does the output say only one path?

Looking back at the output, it's:

11000

1

But according to my analysis, there are two paths giving "11000". Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the path where the down move happens affects the string differently. Let's consider the positions more carefully.

In a 2x4 grid, the cells are:

Row 1: a11 a12 a13 a14

Row 2: a21 a22 a23 a24

Possible paths:

1. R, R, R, D: a11 -> a12 -> a13 -> a14 -> a24 -> "11010"

2. R, R, D, R: a11 -> a12 -> a13 -> a23 -> a24 -> "11000"

3. R, D, R, R: a11 -> a12 -> a22 -> a23 -> a24 -> "11000"

4. D, R, R, R: a11 -> a21 -> a22 -> a23 -> a24 -> "11100"

So, indeed, paths 2 and 3 both give "11000". But the output says only one path gives "11000". Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in the code, the way it counts the paths is different. Let's look at the code provided.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

a = []

n = int(input())

for _ in range(2):

a.append(input())

s = []

x = 0

for i in range(n - 1):

if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':

s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]

x = i

break

else:

s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]

x = n - 1

t = 1

for i in range(x):

if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:

t = x - i + 1

break

print(s, sep='')

print(t)

So, it's trying to construct the smallest string s and count the number of paths that produce it.

In the first loop, it's looking for the first index i where a[0][i+1] is '1' and a[1][i] is '0'. When it finds such an i, it sets s to be a[0] up to i+1 concatenated with a[1] from i onwards.

If no such i is found, it sets s to a[0] concatenated with a[1][n-1].

Then, it calculates t, which is the number of paths that produce this string s.

In the example where n=4, a1=1101, a2=1100:

It will iterate i from 0 to 2:

i=0: a[0][1] = '1', a[1][0] = '1' -> '1' != '0', so skip

i=1: a[0][2] = '0', a[1][1] = '1' -> '0' != '1', skip

i=2: a[0][3] = '1', a[1][2] = '0' -> '1' == '1' and '1' != '0', wait, '1' != '0', so skip

No such i is found where a[0][i+1]='1' and a[1][i]='0', so it sets s = a[0] + a[1][n-1] = '1101' + '0' = '11010'

But in the example, the smallest string is '11000', not '11010'. So maybe there's an issue here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition. The condition is if a[0][i+1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', then set s to a[0][:i+1] + a[1][i:].

In the second test case, when i=2, a[0][3] = '1', a[1][2] = '0' -> '1' == '1' and '1' != '0' -> wait, '1' != '0' is False, so it's skipped.

Hence, no such i is found, so s = a[0] + a[1][n-1] = '1101' + '0' = '11010'

But in reality, '11000' is smaller than '11010'. So the code is incorrect here.

Wait, perhaps the logic is flawed. It seems the code is trying to find the earliest point where switching to the bottom row would give a smaller value, but it's not handling it correctly.

Let me think of a better approach.

To find the lexicographically smallest string, we need to choose the path that results in the smallest possible sequence of cells.

Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, the path can be determined by the point at which it decides to move down from row 1 to row 2.

The grasshopper must move down exactly once, and the choice is at which column it does so.

So, the possible strings are:

- If it moves down at column k: a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2n

For k from 1 to n.

So, we need to consider all possible k and find the smallest string among them.

But since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, we need an efficient way to find the smallest string and count the number of paths that give that string.

A brute-force approach would be to iterate through all possible k (from 1 to n), construct the string for each k, find the minimum among them, and count how many k give that minimum string.

However, this would be O(t * n^2), which is too slow for the constraints (t up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5).

We need a smarter way.

Let's think about how to find the smallest possible string.

The string for a given k is a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2n

We need to choose k such that this string is lexicographically smallest.

To find the smallest string, we can consider merging the two rows in a way that chooses the smallest available character at each step.

This resembles the merge step in merge sort, but with a lexicographic comparison.

Wait, perhaps we can use a two-pointer approach to merge the two rows while choosing the smallest possible character at each step.

Let's define two pointers, one for each row, starting at column 1.

At each step, we choose the smallest available character from the current positions of the two pointers, and move the chosen pointer forward.

However, there's a constraint: the path must be such that we only move right or down, meaning that once we switch to row 2 at some column, we stay in row 2 for all subsequent columns.

So, the two-pointer approach might not directly apply here.

Wait, perhaps we can find the point where switching to row 2 gives a better string.

Let's consider the strings formed by staying in row 1 up to some column k, and then switching to row 2 from column k onwards.

We need to find the k that gives the smallest possible string a1[1..k] + a2[k..n]

To find the smallest such string, we can iterate k from 1 to n and keep track of the minimum string.

But again, this is O(n), which is acceptable since sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5.

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be trying to find such a k, but with a different condition.

In the given code, it iterates through i from 0 to n-2 and checks if a[0][i+1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'.

This seems arbitrary and not directly related to finding the smallest string.

Perhaps the code is trying to find the first position where switching to row 2 would give a smaller string, but it's not clear.

Let's consider a better way to implement this.

I'll try to implement the following approach:

- Initialize the smallest string as a1[1..n] (staying entirely in row 1)

- Initialize the count as 1, since this path corresponds to k=n

- Then, for each k from 1 to n-1:

- Construct the string a1[1..k] + a2[k..n]

- Compare it with the current smallest string lexicographically

- If it's smaller, update the smallest string and set count to 1

- If it's equal to the current smallest, increment the count

- Finally, output the smallest string and the count

This should work correctly and efficiently, as it's O(n) per test case.

But in the given code, it seems to be attempting something different.

Looking back at the given code:

for i in range(n - 1):

if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':

s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]

x = i

break

else:

s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]

x = n - 1

t = 1

for i in range(x):

if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:

t = x - i + 1

break

print(s, sep='')

print(t)

So, it's trying to find the first i where a[0][i+1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0', and then sets s to a[0][:i+1] + a[1][i:]

If no such i is found, it sets s to a[0] + a[1][n-1]

Then, it calculates t based on some condition.

This seems incorrect because, in the second test case, it would set s to '11010', but the correct smallest string is '11000'.

Hence, the code is flawed.

A better approach is to iterate through all possible k from 1 to n, construct the string a1[1..k] + a2[k..n], and find the smallest among them, while counting the number of times this smallest string occurs.

To optimize, we can iterate through k from 1 to n and keep track of the minimum string and the count.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, and sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
