Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform this operation any number of times: if there's a number in the array that's at least 10, I can delete it and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what this operation allows me to do. Essentially, for any number that is two digits or more, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the number. So, if I have a number like 12, I can turn it into 1 and 2. If I have 45, it becomes 4 and 5, and so on.

The goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. That means each element should be less than or equal to the next element in the array.

I need to think about how splitting these numbers affects the sorting. If I split a number, its digits are inserted in the same order they appear, so for example, 12 becomes 1 and 2, which is fine because 1 <= 2. But I need to consider how these splits affect the overall ordering of the array.

Let me look at the examples provided:

First test case:

4

12 3 45 67

Applying the operation to the first element, 12, it becomes 1 and 2. So the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted in non-decreasing order. So, the answer is YES.

Second test case:

3

12 28 5

If I split 12, it becomes 1 and 2, so [1, 2, 28, 5]. But 2 > 5, so that's not sorted.

If I split 28, it becomes 2 and 8, so [12, 2, 8, 5]. Here, 12 > 2, which is not sorted.

If I split 5, it's already a single digit, so no change.

It seems like no matter what I do, I can't get this array sorted. So, the answer is NO.

Third test case:

2

0 0

It's already sorted, so no need for any operations. Answer is YES.

From these examples, it seems that splitting numbers can help in making the array sorted, but not always.

Now, I need to find a general approach to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting numbers as needed.

Let me think about the properties of the numbers and how splitting affects the ordering.

First, note that splitting a number into its digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are in non-decreasing order. For example, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 is fine because 1 <= 2. But splitting 21 into 2 and 1 would not help because 2 > 1, which could disrupt the sorting.

Wait, but according to the problem, when you split a number, you insert its digits in the order they appear. So, splitting 21 would insert 2 and then 1, which is 2 followed by 1, which is decreasing. That could be a problem.

So, I need to be careful about which numbers I split and how their digits affect the overall ordering.

Let me consider the array as it is, and check if it's already sorted. If it is, then no operation is needed, and the answer is YES.

If not, I need to see if splitting some numbers can make it sorted.

But splitting a number can affect the ordering with its neighboring elements. So, I need to consider how the splits interact with the surrounding numbers.

One way to approach this is to iterate through the array and check if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If not, check if splitting the current element can make it satisfy the condition.

But it's not straightforward because splitting one element might require splitting another element further down the array.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I need to think recursively or use some kind of dynamic programming to keep track of the possibilities.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since splitting a number into its digits can only help if the digits are in non-decreasing order, maybe I can check if the digits of the numbers that need to be split are sorted.

Wait, no. That might not cover all cases.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have the array as it is, and I consider all possible splits of the numbers that are greater than or equal to 10. Then, I can check if any of these possible configurations result in a sorted array.

But considering all possible splits would be computationally expensive, especially since n can be up to 50, and each number can have up to 2 digits, but in general, it's manageable.

But maybe there's a smarter way to check without generating all possible splits.

Let me consider that splitting a number into its digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are in non-decreasing order.

Wait, no. Even if the digits are in non-decreasing order, splitting might not always help, because it can affect the ordering with the previous elements.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for each position, the maximum possible value before it is less than or equal to the minimum possible value after it.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look at it differently.

Let me consider that each number can be either kept as is or split into its digits, and I need to choose for each number whether to split it or not, in such a way that the resulting array is sorted.

But with n up to 50, and each number having two choices (split or not), that's 2^50 possibilities, which is way too much to compute.

So, I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array from left to right, and keep track of the maximum value seen so far, considering the possibilities of splitting.

Wait, but how?

Let me try to formalize this.

Define that for each position i, the element at that position can be the number itself if it's less than 10, or any of its digits if it's greater than or equal to 10.

Then, I need to choose, for each position, whether to keep the number as is or split it into digits, such that the resulting array is sorted.

But this seems too broad. Maybe I can find a way to check if the array can be sorted without explicitly generating all possible splits.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the first test case, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 helps make the array sorted, even though 1 <= 2.

But in the second test case, splitting 12 into 1 and 2 doesn't help because 2 < 5, but 5 is already there.

Wait, no, in the second test case, after splitting 12 into 1 and 2, the array becomes [1, 2, 28, 5], which is not sorted because 2 > 5.

So, maybe I need to ensure that after splitting, the maximum value in the split digits is less than or equal to the next element.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider the maximum possible value that can be obtained from splitting a number.

Wait, perhaps I can preprocess each number to find the maximum and minimum values that can be obtained from splitting it.

For example, for 12, the digits are 1 and 2, so min is 1, max is 2.

For 28, digits are 2 and 8, min is 2, max is 8.

For single-digit numbers, min and max are the number itself.

Then, I can iterate through the array and ensure that the max of the previous element is less than or equal to the min of the current element.

This seems promising.

Let me try this with the first test case:

[12, 3, 45, 67]

Split 12 into [1, 2], min=1, max=2

3 is a single digit, min=3, max=3

45 splits into [4,5], min=4, max=5

67 splits into [6,7], min=6, max=7

Now, check:

2 <= 4? Yes

5 <=6? Yes

So, it's possible to sort the array by splitting.

In the second test case:

[12,28,5]

Split 12 into [1,2], min=1, max=2

28 splits into [2,8], min=2, max=8

5 is a single digit, min=5, max=5

Check:

2 <=2? Yes

8 <=5? No

So, it's not possible to sort.

In the third test case:

[0,0]

Already sorted.

So, this approach seems to work.

Therefore, the strategy is:

1. For each number in the array, determine the minimum and maximum values that can be obtained from splitting it into digits.

2. Iterate through the array and ensure that the maximum value from the previous element is less than or equal to the minimum value of the current element.

3. If this condition holds for all adjacent pairs, then it's possible to sort the array; otherwise, it's not.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

Looking back at the provided program, let's see if it follows this logic.

The function `func` reads the input for multiple test cases, then for each test case, reads n and the array a.

It initializes `ans` to True.

Then, it iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking if arr[i] < arr[i-1].

If so, it splits arr[i-1] into its digits and appends arr[i] to this list.

Then, it checks if this list of digits plus arr[i] is sorted.

If not, sets `ans` to False and breaks.

Otherwise, updates arr[i-1] to be the first digit of the split.

Finally, prints 'YES' if `ans` is True, else 'NO'.

Wait, this seems a bit different from my proposed approach.

In my approach, I suggested precomputing min and max for each element based on whether it's split or not, and then checking if max of previous <= min of current for all adjacent pairs.

But in the given code, it's iterating from the end to the beginning, and when it finds arr[i] < arr[i-1], it splits arr[i-1] and checks if the digits plus arr[i] are sorted.

If they are, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit and continues; otherwise, it sets `ans` to False.

This seems like a greedy approach, trying to fix the array by splitting elements when necessary.

But is this equivalent to my min-max approach?

Let me check with the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=4

arr = [12,3,45,67]

Iterate from i=3 to i=1:

i=3: arr[3]=67, arr[2]=45

Is 67 < 45? No, so skip.

i=2: arr[2]=45, arr[1]=3

Is 45 < 3? No, so skip.

i=1: arr[1]=3, arr[0]=12

Is 3 < 12? Yes.

So, split arr[0]=12 into [1,2], and append arr[1]=3, getting [1,2,3]

Check if [1,2,3] is sorted: Yes.

So, set arr[0]=1.

Now, the array is [1,3,45,67], which is sorted.

So, `ans` remains True, and it prints 'YES'.

Seems correct.

Second test case:

n=3

arr=[12,28,5]

Iterate from i=2 to i=1:

i=2: arr[2]=5, arr[1]=28

Is 5 < 28? Yes.

Split arr[1]=28 into [2,8], append arr[2]=5, getting [2,8,5]

Is [2,8,5] sorted? No, because 8 > 5.

So, set `ans` to False and break.

Thus, prints 'NO'.

Which is correct.

Third test case:

n=2

arr=[0,0]

Iterate from i=1 to i=0:

i=1: arr[1]=0, arr[0]=0

Is 0 < 0? Yes.

Split arr[0]=0 into [0], append arr[1]=0, getting [0,0]

Which is sorted.

So, set arr[0]=0.

The array remains [0,0], which is sorted.

Thus, `ans` remains True, and it prints 'YES'.

Seems correct.

So, this approach seems to work for the given examples.

But is this approach always correct?

Let me think about potential issues.

Suppose I have:

n=3

arr=[19, 2, 10]

According to the code:

Iterate from i=2 to i=1:

i=2: arr[2]=10, arr[1]=2

Is 10 < 2? No, skip.

i=1: arr[1]=2, arr[0]=19

Is 2 < 19? Yes.

Split arr[0]=19 into [1,9], append arr[1]=2, getting [1,9,2]

Is [1,9,2] sorted? No, because 9 > 2.

So, set `ans` to False and break.

But wait, is there a way to make this array sorted?

If I split 19 into [1,9], and then split 10 into [1,0], the array becomes [1,9,1,0].

Is [1,9,1,0] sorted? No, because 9 > 1.

Alternatively, if I split 19 into [1,9], and keep 10 as is, [1,9,10], which is [1,9,10], which is sorted because 1 <=9 <=10.

So, in this case, the code would incorrectly return 'NO', but actually, it's possible to make it sorted.

So, this is a flaw in the code's logic.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, numbers are either kept as is or split into their digits, and we need to check if any such configuration is sorted.

In my example, splitting 19 into [1,9] and keeping 10 as is results in [1,9,10], which is sorted.

But according to the code, it would check [1,9,10] and see that 9 <=10, which is true, and set arr[0]=1, making the array [1,9,10], which is sorted.

But in the code, it seems that after splitting, it only considers the first digit to replace the original element.

Wait, in the code, after checking if the split digits plus the next element are sorted, if yes, it sets arr[i-1] to the first digit.

In my example, after splitting 19 into [1,9], and appending 2, it gets [1,9,2], which is not sorted, so it would set `ans` to False.

But actually, there is another way: split 19 into [1,9], and keep 10 as is, resulting in [1,9,10], which is sorted.

So, the code doesn't consider this possibility because it only considers splitting one element at a time and checking the immediate configuration.

This suggests that the code's logic is flawed because it doesn't explore all possible split configurations.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

A better approach would be to precompute for each element the minimum and maximum values after possible splits, and then check if the maximum of the previous element is less than or equal to the minimum of the current element for all adjacent pairs.

This way, we ensure that no matter how we split the elements, there exists a configuration where the array is sorted.

So, in conclusion, the given program is incorrect because it doesn't consider all possible split configurations that could lead to a sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
