Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. If it's possible to do that, I should print "YES" and then the number of parts and the parts themselves. If not, I should print "NO".

First, I need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "abba" is a palindrome, but "abc" is not.

So, the task is to split the string into substrings where none of them is a palindrome. I need to do this for multiple test cases, and the input specifies the number of test cases first, followed by the strings.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

3

sinktheyacht

lllllllll

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

NO

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

In the first test case, "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so partitioning it into a single substring works, hence "YES" and then 1 and the string itself.

In the second test case, "lllllllll" is a palindrome, and any substring of it is also a palindrome, so there's no way to partition it such that none of the parts is a palindrome, hence "NO".

In the third test case, "uwuowouwu" can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes, so "YES", 3, and the substrings.

Okay, so I need to find a way to partition the string such that no part is a palindrome. If the whole string is not a palindrome, I can just take it as a single part. If it is a palindrome, I need to see if I can split it into smaller non-palindromic parts.

But, in the second test case, since every substring of "lllllllll" is a palindrome, there's no way to partition it to satisfy the condition. So, I need to identify such cases and output "NO".

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need a way to check if a string is a palindrome. That's straightforward: compare the string with its reverse.

Now, for each test case, I need to check if the whole string is a palindrome. If it's not, I can just output "YES" and the string itself as a single part.

If the whole string is a palindrome, I need to see if I can split it into smaller parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, in the case where the string consists of all identical characters, like "lllllllll", any substring is also a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic parts. Hence, "NO".

In other cases, where the string is a palindrome but not all characters are the same, maybe I can find a way to split it.

Wait, but if the string is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, is it always possible to split it into non-palindromic parts?

Let me think about that.

Take, for example, "aba". It's a palindrome. If I split it into "a" and "ba", "a" is a palindrome, so that doesn't work. If I split it into "ab" and "a", "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome, which is not allowed. So, it's impossible to partition "aba" into non-palindromic parts.

Another example: "abba". It's a palindrome. If I split it into "ab" and "ba", both are not palindromic, so that works.

Wait, but in the first split of "aba" into "ab" and "a", "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid. In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" both are not palindromes.

So, seems like for some palindromic strings, it's possible to partition them into non-palindromic parts, and for some, it's not.

So, I need a way to determine when a palindromic string can be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.

Let me consider the general case.

If the string is a palindrome, and its length is greater than 1, and it's not composed of all identical characters, then maybe it's possible to split it into two parts, neither of which is a palindrome.

But, as in the "aba" example, splitting into "ab" and "a" has "a" as a palindrome, and splitting into "a" and "ba" has "a" as a palindrome. So, it's impossible.

Wait, but "abba" can be split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for even-length palindromic strings, it's possible to split them into two non-palindromic parts.

Wait, "abba" has even length, and can be split into "ab" and "ba". But "aba" has odd length and can't be split into non-palindromic parts.

So, maybe for palindromic strings with even lengths, it's possible to split them into two non-palindromic parts, while for odd lengths, it's not always possible.

But, wait, consider "abcbaba". It's a palindrome of length 7. If I split it into "ab", "c", "b", "a", "b", "a", all of these except "c" are not palindromes, but "c" is a palindrome. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to split it into larger parts that are not palindromes.

Wait, "abcbaba" is a palindrome. If I split it into "abc" and "baba", "abc" is not a palindrome, but "baba" is a palindrome. So, that doesn't work.

If I split it into "abcbab" and "a", "abcbab" is not a palindrome, but "a" is a palindrome. So, again, invalid.

Seems like for some palindromic strings with odd lengths, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic parts.

Similarly, for palindromic strings with even lengths, it might be possible to split them into two non-palindromic parts.

But, in the "abba" case, splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

Wait, but "abba" can also be split into "a" and "bba", but "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

So, the only valid split is "ab" and "ba".

Similarly, for "aabaa", which is a palindrome of length 5. If I split it into "aab" and "aa", "aab" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

If I split it into "a", "aba", "a", "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

If I split it into "aab" and "a", "aa", "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

Seems like it's impossible to split "aabaa" into non-palindromic parts.

Wait, but "aabaa" is a palindrome, and it's composed of 'a's and 'b's.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings that have at least one character that is different from the majority character, it's possible to split them into non-palindromic parts, but in some cases, it's still impossible.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to find a general rule.

Looking back at the problem, it seems that if the string is not a palindrome, I can just take it as a single part.

If the string is a palindrome, I need to see if I can split it into smaller parts, none of which are palindromes.

But, as seen in the examples, sometimes it's possible and sometimes it's not.

Perhaps, the key is to check if there exists at least one split where neither part is a palindrome.

For palindromic strings of length greater than 1, if I can split it into two parts, neither of which is a palindrome, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

So, for each palindromic string, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split it into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

If such a split exists, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

Let me try to formalize this.

Given a palindromic string s of length n:

- For each possible split position k (1 <= k < n), check if neither s[0:k] nor s[k:n] is a palindrome.

- If there exists at least one k where both s[0:k] and s[k:n] are not palindromes, then "YES".

- Otherwise, "NO".

This seems manageable.

Now, to optimize, since the constraints are large (sum of |s| <= 10^6), I need an efficient way to check for palindromes and find such a split.

I can precompute the palindromicity of all prefixes and suffixes.

Wait, but that might be time-consuming for large strings.

Alternatively, since I only need to find one such split, I can iterate through possible k and check for each k if both parts are not palindromes.

But this could be O(n^2) in the worst case, which is too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think differently.

If the string is a palindrome, and I want to split it into two parts that are not palindromes, I need to ensure that neither part is a palindrome.

Given that the string is a palindrome, some properties might help here.

For example, if I split the string into two parts of unequal lengths, say k and n-k, with k != n-k, then perhaps I can ensure that at least one of them is not a palindrome.

But, in the case of "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" both are not palindromes.

In "aabaa", splitting into "aab" and "aa", "aa" is a palindrome.

Splitting into "a" and "abaa", "a" is a palindrome.

Splitting into "aa" and "baa", "aa" is a palindrome.

Splitting into "aab" and "a", "a" is a palindrome.

So, no valid split exists for "aabaa".

Similarly, for "abcbaba", splitting into "abc" and "baba", "baba" is a palindrome.

Splitting into "abcbab" and "a", "a" is a palindrome.

Splitting into "abcb" and "aba", "aba" is a palindrome.

So, no valid split exists.

But for "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

So, I need to find a way to identify if there's at least one k where both s[0:k] and s[k:n] are not palindromes.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the smallest k such that s[0:k] is not a palindrome, and then check if s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the largest k such that s[k:n] is not a palindrome, and check if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal prefix that is not a palindrome and check if the corresponding suffix is also not a palindrome.

But I need to make sure that both parts are not palindromes.

Let me consider that.

Find the smallest k such that s[0:k] is not a palindrome, and then check if s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

If yes, then "YES".

Similarly, find the largest k such that s[k:n] is not a palindrome, and check if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

Wait, but this might not cover all possible splits.

Maybe I need to iterate through possible k and check for each k if both parts are not palindromes.

But, as I thought earlier, this could be too slow for large n.

Is there a way to optimize this check?

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, s[0:k] is equal to s[n-k:n] reversed.

Wait, since the whole string is a palindrome, s[0:k] == s[n-k:n][::-1].

But, since s is a palindrome, s[n-k:n] == s[k-1::-1].

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Maybe I need to think about the structure of palindromic strings.

In a palindrome, the first half mirrors the second half.

So, if I split at position k, s[0:k] and s[n-k:n] are mirror images.

If s[0:k] is a palindrome, then s[n-k:n] is also a palindrome, because it's the mirror of s[0:k].

Wait, no, not necessarily.

Wait, if s is a palindrome, and I take s[0:k], its mirror is s[n-k:n], which is equal to s[k-1::-1].

Since s is a palindrome, s[k-1::-1] == s[k:n].

Wait, I'm getting tangled up here.

Let me try with an example.

Take "abba", which is a palindrome.

- k=1: s[0:1]="a", s[3:4]="a". Both are palindromes.

- k=2: s[0:2]="ab", s[2:4]="ba". Neither is a palindrome.

- k=3: s[0:3]="abb", s[1:4]="bba". "abb" is not a palindrome, "bba" is not a palindrome.

So, for "abba", splitting at k=2 or k=3 works.

Similarly, for "aabaa":

- k=1: s[0:1]="a", s[4:5]="a". Both are palindromes.

- k=2: s[0:2]="aa", s[3:5]="aa". Both are palindromes.

- k=3: s[0:3]="aab", s[2:5]="baa". "aab" is not a palindrome, "baa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "baa" is not a palindrome. Wait, "baa" reversed is "aab", which is different from "baa", so it's not a palindrome.

Wait, but earlier I thought "baa" is a palindrome, but it's not.

Wait, "baa" reversed is "aab", which is different from "baa", so "baa" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, "aab" is not a palindrome.

So, in "aabaa", splitting at k=3 works.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, it is possible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me check again.

"aabaa" is a palindrome.

- k=1: "a" and "abaa" -> "a" is a palindrome.

- k=2: "aa" and "baa" -> "aa" is a palindrome.

- k=3: "aab" and "aa" -> "aa" is a palindrome.

- k=4: "aaba" and "a" -> "a" is a palindrome.

Wait, but in k=3, "aab" and "aa", "aa" is a palindrome.

Wait, but "baa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, no, in k=3, s[0:3]="aab", s[3:5]="aa".

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome.

So, that split is invalid.

Wait, but "baa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, no, in k=3, s[0:3]="aab", s[3:5]="aa".

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, the string is "a a b a a"

Indices: 0 1 2 3 4

- k=1: s[0:1]="a", s[4:5]="a" -> both palindromes.

- k=2: s[0:2]="aa", s[3:5]="ba" -> "aa" is a palindrome.

- k=3: s[0:3]="aab", s[2:5]="aba" -> "aba" is a palindrome.

- k=4: s[0:4]="aaba", s[1:5]="abaa" -> "aaba" is not a palindrome, "abaa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, is "aaba" a palindrome? Let's see: "aaba" reversed is "abaa", which is different, so "aaba" is not a palindrome. Similarly, "abaa" reversed is "aaba", which is different, so "abaa" is not a palindrome.

So, splitting at k=4 works.

Therefore, "aabaa" can be split into "aaba" and "a", both not palindromes.

Wait, but "a" is a palindrome. Wait, s[1:5]="abaa", which is not a palindrome, and s[0:4]="aaba", which is not a palindrome.

Wait, but s[0:4]="aaba", s[4:5]="a". So, s[0:4]="aaba", s[4:5]="a". "a" is a palindrome, which makes this split invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, s[0:4]="aaba", s[4:5]="a". "a" is a palindrome, so this split is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I thought s[0:4]="aaba" and s[1:5]="abaa", but that's not a valid split because s[0:4] + s[4:5] != s.

Wait, I think I messed up the indices.

Let me clarify.

The string is "aabaa".

- s[0:1]="a", s[1:5]="abaa"

- s[0:2]="aa", s[2:5]="baa"

- s[0:3]="aab", s[3:5]="aa"

- s[0:4]="aaba", s[4:5]="a"

In none of these splits both parts are non-palindromic.

Wait, "abaa" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

"baa" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

"aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

"aaba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

So, it seems impossible to split "aabaa" into two parts where neither is a palindrome.

Wait, but earlier I thought that splitting at k=4 works, but actually, s[0:4]="aaba" and s[4:5]="a", but "a" is a palindrome, so it's invalid.

Hence, it's impossible to split "aabaa" into two parts where neither is a palindrome.

But according to the problem's note, in the third test case, "uwuowouwu" can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, for "aabaa", maybe I need to split it into more than two parts.

But according to the problem, if I can partition it into any number of parts (>=1), as long as none of the parts is a palindrome.

But in this case, since any split into two parts includes a palindrome, and single part is a palindrome, it's impossible.

Hence, "NO".

Wait, but the problem allows partitioning into any number of parts, not just two.

But in the case of "aabaa", any split into two parts includes a palindrome, and the whole string is a palindrome, so indeed, "NO".

But in the earlier step, for "aabaa", I thought splitting into "aaba" and "a" would work, but "a" is a palindrome, which invalidates the split.

Similarly, splitting into "aab" and "aa" has "aa" as a palindrome.

So, indeed, "NO".

But for "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

For "aabaa", it's impossible.

So, I need a way to determine if a palindromic string can be split into non-palindromic parts.

Seems like it's possible only if there exists at least one split where both parts are not palindromes.

Hence, for each palindromic string, I need to check if there exists a k where neither s[0:k] nor s[k:n] is a palindrome.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the smallest k where s[0:k] is not a palindrome, and then check if s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the largest k where s[k:n] is not a palindrome, and check if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

But I need to make sure that both parts are not palindromes.

Wait, maybe I can iterate k from 1 to n-1 and check for each k if both s[0:k] and s[k:n] are not palindromes.

But this would be O(n^2) time, which is too slow for n up to 10^6.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, s[0:k] is equal to s[n-k:n][::-1].

But since s is a palindrome, s[0:k] == s[n-k:n].

So, if s[0:k] is a palindrome, then s[n-k:n] is also a palindrome.

If s[0:k] is not a palindrome, then s[n-k:n] is also not a palindrome, because s[n-k:n] == s[k-1::-1], and if s[0:k] != s[k-1::-1], then s[n-k:n] != s[0:k].

Wait, no, because s is a palindrome, s[n-k:n] == s[k-1::-1].

If s[0:k] != s[k-1::-1], then s[n-k:n] != s[0:k], meaning s[n-k:n] != s[0:k], but s[n-k:n] could still be a palindrome or not.

Wait, this is getting too confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose s is a palindrome.

If s has any substring that is not a palindrome, then perhaps I can split the string at that point.

But I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal prefix that is not a palindrome and check if the suffix is also not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the maximal suffix that is not a palindrome and check if the prefix is not a palindrome.

This might reduce the number of checks I need to perform.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, check if the whole string is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" and the string itself.

- If yes, then:

- Find the smallest k such that s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

- Check if s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

- If yes, output "YES" and the partition.

- Similarly, find the largest k such that s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

- Check if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

- If yes, output "YES" and the partition.

- If neither of these works, output "NO".

This way, I only need to find the minimal prefix that is not a palindrome and the maximal suffix that is not a palindrome, and check if the corresponding suffix or prefix is also not a palindrome.

This should be more efficient.

To find the smallest k where s[0:k] is not a palindrome, I can iterate k from 1 to n-1 and check for each k if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the largest k where s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

But this still seems O(n^2) in the worst case.

Is there a way to compute this faster?

Maybe I can precompute the palindromicity of all prefixes and suffixes.

Let me think about using Manacher's algorithm to find palindromic substrings efficiently.

Manacher's algorithm can find all palindromic substrings in O(n) time, but I need to check if specific substrings are palindromes.

Wait, perhaps I can use prefix functions or some string matching algorithm to optimize this.

Alternatively, since I only need to check if a substring is a palindrome or not, I can compute the hash of the substring and the hash of its reverse, and see if they are equal.

If I precompute the hash of all prefixes and suffixes, I can check if s[0:k] is a palindrome by comparing hash(s[0:k]) with hash(reversed(s[0:k])).

Similarly for s[k:n].

This way, I can check for palindromicity in O(1) time per k, after O(n) preprocessing.

This would make the overall check O(n), which is acceptable.

So, here's the plan:

- For each test case:

- Read the string s.

- Check if s is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" and the string itself.

- If yes, then:

- Find the smallest k (1 <= k < n) such that s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

- Check if s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

- If yes, output "YES" and the partition s[0:k] and s[k:n].

- Similarly, find the largest k (1 <= k < n) such that s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

- Check if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

- If yes, output "YES" and the partition s[0:k] and s[k:n].

- If neither of these works, output "NO".

To implement this efficiently, I'll use hash functions to check for palindromicity.

I need to be careful with hash collisions, so I'll use two different hash functions to reduce the probability of collision.

Now, let's think about the implementation details.

First, I need a way to compute the hash of a substring and the hash of its reverse.

I can precompute the prefix hash of s and the prefix hash of reversed s.

Then, for any substring s[0:k], its hash is prefix_hash[k], and its reverse hash is rev_prefix_hash[k].

Similarly, for s[k:n], its hash is suffix_hash[k], and its reverse hash is rev_suffix_hash[k].

Wait, actually, for s[k:n], its hash is suffix_hash[k], and its reverse hash is rev_suffix_hash[n-k].

I need to make sure that the hashes are computed correctly.

Let me define:

- prefix_hash[k] = hash(s[0:k])

- rev_prefix_hash[k] = hash(reversed(s[0:k]))

- suffix_hash[k] = hash(s[k:n])

- rev_suffix_hash[k] = hash(reversed(s[k:n]))

Then, to check if s[0:k] is a palindrome, I can compare prefix_hash[k] with rev_prefix_hash[k].

Similarly, to check if s[k:n] is a palindrome, compare suffix_hash[n-k] with rev_suffix_hash[n-k].

Wait, I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me define:

- suffix_hash[k] = hash(s[k:n])

- rev_suffix_hash[k] = hash(reversed(s[k:n]))

So, to check if s[k:n] is a palindrome, compare suffix_hash[k] with rev_suffix_hash[k].

Similarly, for s[0:k], compare prefix_hash[k] with rev_prefix_hash[k].

Now, to find the smallest k where s[0:k] is not a palindrome, I can iterate k from 1 to n-1 and find the smallest k where prefix_hash[k] != rev_prefix_hash[k].

Similarly, find the largest k where suffix_hash[k] != rev_suffix_hash[k].

Then, check if for these k, the other part is also not a palindrome.

This should be efficient enough.

Now, for hashing, I need to use a strong hash function to minimize the chance of collision.

I can use two different prime bases for the hash functions to reduce the probability of collision.

Let me implement this logic.

Also, I need to handle the edge cases.

- If the string has length 1, it's a palindrome, and since it's a single character, it's a palindrome, so "NO".

- If the string has length 2 and both characters are the same, it's a palindrome, and any split would have single characters, which are palindromes, so "NO".

- If the string has length 2 and characters are different, it's not a palindrome, so "YES" and the string itself.

Similarly, handle other edge cases.

Let me think about the implementation in code.

First, read t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case:

- Read the string s.

- If s is not a palindrome, output "YES" and the string itself.

- If s is a palindrome:

- Find the smallest k where s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

- Check if s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

- If yes, output "YES" and the partition s[0:k] and s[k:n].

- Find the largest k where s[k:n] is not a palindrome.

- Check if s[0:k] is not a palindrome.

- If yes, output "YES" and the partition s[0:k] and s[k:n].

- If neither works, output "NO".

To implement the hash functions efficiently, I can precompute the prefix and suffix hashes and their reversed hashes.

I need to make sure that the hash functions are computed correctly.

Let me define two different hash bases, say P1 = 31 and P2 = 37, and two different moduli, MOD1 and MOD2, to reduce collisions.

Then, compute the prefix hashes and rev_prefix hashes using these bases and moduli.

Similarly, compute suffix hashes and rev_suffix hashes.

With these hashes, I can quickly check if a substring is a palindrome by comparing its hash with the hash of its reverse.

Now, let's think about the time complexity.

Precomputing the hashes takes O(n) time per test case.

Checking for palindromicity using hashes is O(1) per substring.

So, overall, it's O(n) per test case, which should be efficient enough for the constraints.

Now, let's think about the given code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the given code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

string = input()

s = list(string)

n = len(s)

done = False

if n == 1:

print('NO')

continue

x = s[0]

if x != s[-1]:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

continue

if s.count(x) == n:

print('NO')

continue

elif s.count(x) == n - 1:

if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

continue

count = 0

count2 = 0

for j in range(n):

if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

done = True

break

if s[j] != x and count < 1:

count = j

continue

if count > 0:

if s[j] != x:

if count2 < count:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(string[:j], string[j:])

done = True

break

elif count2 == count:

if count > 1:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])

done = True

break

else:

count2 = 0

continue

elif count2 > count:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(string[:j], string[j:])

done = True

break

else:

count2 += 1

if not done:

print('NO')

This code seems to be attempting to implement the logic I described, but it's a bit convoluted and unclear.

Let's analyze it step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case:

- Reads the string s and converts it to a list.

- Gets the length n.

- Initializes a flag 'done' to False.

- If n == 1, prints "NO" and continues to the next test case.

- Sets x to the first character of s.

- If the first character x is not equal to the last character, prints "YES", 1, and the string itself. This makes sense because if the first and last characters are different, the string is not a palindrome, so we can take it as a single part.

- If all characters in s are x, prints "NO". This is correct because the string is composed of identical characters, so any substring is a palindrome.

- If exactly n-1 characters are x, it checks if n is odd and the middle character is not x. If so, prints "NO"; otherwise, prints "YES", 1, and the string itself.

- If none of the above conditions are met, it enters a loop that tries to find a way to split the string into two parts, each not a palindrome.

This loop is quite complex and hard to follow. It seems to be trying to find positions where the characters differ from x and then attempting to split the string based on those positions.

However, this approach seems error-prone and not straightforward.

Given the earlier analysis, I think a better approach would be to:

- Check if the string is not a palindrome. If so, output "YES" and the string itself.

- If the string is a palindrome, attempt to find a split position k where neither s[0:k] nor s[k:n] is a palindrome. If such a k exists, output "YES" and the partition; otherwise, output "NO".

To implement this efficiently, using hash functions to check for palindromicity is a good idea.

But since the given code doesn't use this approach and instead has a complicated loop, it's hard to verify its correctness.

Let's consider some test cases to see if the given code works correctly.

Test case 1:

Input:

1

sinktheyacht

Expected Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

Explanation: "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so it can be taken as a single part.

Given code's behavior:

- n = 12

- x = 's'

- x != s[-1] = 't', so it prints "YES", 1, and the string.

Correct.

Test case 2:

Input:

1

lllllllll

Expected Output:

NO

Explanation: All substrings are palindromes.

Given code's behavior:

- n = 9

- x = 'l'

- s.count('l') == 9, which is n, so it prints "NO".

Correct.

Test case 3:

Input:

1

uwuowouwu

Expected Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

Given code's behavior:

- n = 9

- x = 'u'

- x == s[-1] = 'u'

- s.count('u') = 5, which is not n or n-1, so enters the loop.

In the loop:

- j=0: s[0] = 'u', s[8] = 'u' -> equal, continue.

- j=1: s[1] = 'w', s[7] = 'o' -> not equal, so prints "YES", 1, and the string.

Wait, but according to the expected output, it should be split into 3 parts.

So, the given code in this case would output "YES", 1, "uwuowouwu", which is different from the expected output of "YES", 3, "uw uow ouwu".

Is this acceptable? The problem allows any partition where all parts are not palindromes, so outputting the whole string as one part is valid if the string is not a palindrome.

In this case, "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome, so outputting the whole string as one part is incorrect because it is a palindrome.

Wait, is "uwuowouwu" a palindrome?

Let's check:

"uwuowouwu" reversed is "uwuowouwu", so yes, it's a palindrome.

So, the given code would incorrectly output "YES", 1, "uwuowouwu", which is wrong because the whole string is a palindrome.

Hence, the given code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, in the loop, if s[j] != s[n-1-j], it prints "YES", 1, and the string.

But in this case, for j=1, s[1]='w' and s[7]='o', which are different, so it prints "YES", 1, "uwuowouwu".

But "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome, so this is incorrect.

So, the given code has a flaw here.

It seems that the condition in the loop is incorrect.

The loop is trying to check if the string is not a palindrome by checking if s[j] != s[n-1-j], but if the string is a palindrome, this should not happen.

Wait, in the loop, it's checking for s[j] != s[n-1-j], and if found, it concludes that the string is not a palindrome and outputs it as a single part.

But in the case where the string is a palindrome, this should not happen, but in "uwuowouwu", it finds s[1] != s[7], which are different, concluding it's not a palindrome, which is incorrect.

Wait, but "uwuowouwu" is indeed a palindrome: "u w u o w o u w u".

Wait, is "uwuowouwu" a palindrome?

Let's write it out:

Original: u w u o w o u w u

Reversed: u w u o w o u w u

Yes, it's the same forwards and backwards.

But according to the code, it would find j=1 where 'w' != 'o', and then print "YES", 1, "uwuowouwu", which is incorrect because the whole string is a palindrome.

Hence, the given code is flawed.

So, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
