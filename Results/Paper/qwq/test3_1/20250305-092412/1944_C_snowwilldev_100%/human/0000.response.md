Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to find the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break it down step by step.

First, understanding the game:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but doesn't add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`. Alice wants to maximize it, Bob wants to minimize it.

MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. So, for `[2,2,1]`, MEX is 0; for `[3,1,0,1]`, it's 2; and for `[0,3,1,2]`, it's 4.

Given that, I need to figure out what the final MEX will be if both play optimally.

Looking at the provided program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
```

Hmm, this seems straightforward, but I need to verify if it correctly captures the logic based on the game description.

Let's think about the game mechanics:

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, which means she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible.

- Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`, which means he wants to prevent Alice from having small integers in `c`.

Given that Alice can choose to add elements to `c`, and Bob can remove elements from `a`, but not add to `c`, their strategies will revolve around controlling which elements end up in `c`.

Let's consider some examples to build intuition.

**Example 1:**

Input:

```

4

0 0 1 1

```

Possible game flow:

1. Alice picks 1 and adds to `c` → `a=[0,0,1]`, `c=[1]`

2. Bob picks 0 from `a` → `a=[0,1]`, `c=[1]`

3. Alice picks 0 and adds to `c` → `a=[1]`, `c=[1,0]`

4. Bob picks 1 from `a` → `a=[]`, `c=[1,0]`

MEX of `[1,0]` is 2.

Another possible sequence:

1. Alice picks 0 → `a=[0,1,1]`, `c=[0]`

2. Bob picks 1 → `a=[0,1]`, `c=[0]`

3. Alice picks 1 and adds to `c` → `a=[0]`, `c=[0,1]`

4. Bob picks 0 → `a=[]`, `c=[0,1]`

MEX is 2 again.

Seems like 2 is the optimal MEX in this case.

**Example 2:**

Input:

```

4

0 1 2 3

```

Possible game flow:

1. Alice picks 0 → `a=[1,2,3]`, `c=[0]`

2. Bob picks 1 → `a=[2,3]`, `c=[0]`

3. Alice picks 2 and adds to `c` → `a=[3]`, `c=[0,2]`

4. Bob picks 3 → `a=[]`, `c=[0,2]`

MEX of `[0,2]` is 1.

Another sequence:

1. Alice picks 1 → `a=[0,2,3]`, `c=[1]`

2. Bob picks 0 → `a=[2,3]`, `c=[1]`

3. Alice picks 2 and adds to `c` → `a=[3]`, `c=[1,2]`

4. Bob picks 3 → `a=[]`, `c=[1,2]`

MEX is 0.

Wait, in this case, it seems like Bob can force a lower MEX by removing crucial elements.

But according to the example output, it's 1. So perhaps I'm missing something.

**Example 3:**

Input:

```

2

1 1

```

Possible game flow:

1. Alice picks 1 and adds to `c` → `a=[1]`, `c=[1]`

2. Bob picks 1 → `a=[]`, `c=[1]`

MEX of `[1]` is 0.

Seems straightforward.

Now, looking back at the provided code:

- It counts the frequency of each number in `a`.

- Then, it iterates from 0 to `N`:

- If the count of `i` is 1, it increments `t`.

- If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it returns `i`.

Wait, this seems too simplistic. It's not considering the game mechanics at all. It's just looking at the frequencies and returning the first `i` where either `cnt[i] == 0` or there are at least two numbers with `cnt[i] == 1`.

This doesn't align with the game description. The game involves turns where Alice adds to `c` and Bob deletes from `a`.

I think there's a misunderstanding here.

Let me try to think differently.

Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, I need to find the optimal play from both sides.

The MEX is determined by the elements in `c`, which are chosen by Alice.

Bob can influence which elements Alice gets by deleting elements from `a`.

So, Bob can try to remove elements that Alice might want to pick to maximize the MEX.

Wait, but Bob can only delete elements, not add to `c`.

So, Alice's goal is to select elements that allow for the highest possible MEX in `c`, considering that Bob will try to hinder her by removing elements that could help in achieving a higher MEX.

This seems complex. Maybe I need to think in terms of game theory and minimax.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let's consider that Alice can choose to add any remaining element to `c` on her turn, and Bob can remove any element on his turn.

The game alternates between Alice and Bob until `a` is empty.

The final MEX of `c` is what we need to find, assuming both play optimally.

I need to find a way to determine the MEX that Alice can achieve despite Bob's attempts to minimize it.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick elements.

Given that Alice starts and they alternate, the number of elements Alice picks is ceil(n/2), and Bob picks floor(n/2).

Wait, no. In terms of turns, if n is even, they each pick n/2 times. If n is odd, Alice picks (n+1)/2 times, Bob picks (n-1)/2 times.

But this might not directly help.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

Suppose for each number i from 0 to N, I have cnt[i].

Alice wants to have as many i's in c as possible, specifically the smallest i's, to maximize the MEX.

Bob wants to prevent that.

I need to model how Alice can get the numbers she wants, considering Bob's interference.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the availability of each number.

For each number i, if cnt[i] > 0, it's available to be picked.

Alice can pick i and add it to c, provided it's still available.

Bob can pick any available number and remove it.

I need to see, for each i from 0 upwards, whether Alice can ensure that i is in c.

If she can, then MEX is the first i not in c.

But determining for each i whether Alice can ensure its inclusion is complex.

Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me look at the provided code again.

It seems to return the smallest i where either cnt[i] == 0 or there are at least two numbers with cnt[j] == 1 for j < i.

Wait, no, it's just iterating from 0 to N, and if for any i, cnt[i] == 1, it increments t, and if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0, it returns i.

This seems arbitrary and not directly related to the game mechanics.

I think this code is incorrect.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I try to simulate the game.

But simulating each game for up to 2e5 elements per test case, with up to 2e4 test cases, would be too slow.

I need a smarter, mathematical approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include certain elements in c, and Bob can try to prevent Alice from having certain elements in c by deleting them.

Wait, but Bob can only delete elements from a, not specifically from c.

Wait, no, Bob deletes elements from a, which affects what Alice can pick later.

Wait, more carefully:

- On Alice's turn: She picks an element from a, adds it to c, and deletes it from a.

- On Bob's turn: He picks an element from a, deletes it from a.

So, Bob can remove elements that Alice might want to pick later.

Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of c, which means she wants to have as many small integers in c as possible.

Bob's goal is to minimize the MEX of c, which means he wants to prevent Alice from having small integers in c.

So, Bob can try to remove elements that Alice would want to pick to achieve a higher MEX.

This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem.

I need to find a way to determine the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve against Bob's opposition.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each number appears and who can control their inclusion in c.

Let me consider the frequency of each number.

For each number i from 0 to N:

- If cnt[i] == 0, then i is not present, so MEX is i.

- If cnt[i] == 1, Alice can pick it on her turn and add it to c.

- If cnt[i] >= 2, Alice can pick one for c, and Bob can pick the other, or vice versa.

Wait, but Bob can pick any element, not necessarily the same as Alice.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to include elements in c, and Bob can choose to exclude elements by deleting them before Alice can pick them.

So, for each i from 0 to N, Alice wants to include i in c if possible, and Bob wants to prevent that.

The MEX will be the smallest i not in c.

So, I need to find the smallest i such that Bob can prevent Alice from including i in c.

Wait, but if cnt[i] > 0, Alice can pick it and include it in c, unless Bob deletes it first.

But Bob can only delete one element per turn, and Alice can pick one element per turn.

This seems like a race between Alice and Bob to control the inclusion of each i in c.

Given that, perhaps for each i, if cnt[i] >= 1, Alice can include it in c if she picks it before Bob deletes it.

But Bob can try to delete elements that Alice wants.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the number of turns Alice gets to pick elements.

Total turns are n, with Alice picking ceil(n/2) elements.

So, if Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements, she can try to pick the smallest possible i's to maximize the MEX.

But Bob can try to deny her those elements.

Wait, perhaps the minimal MEX is the smallest i such that the number of available i's is less than the number of times Alice needs to pick to include it.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I sort the unique elements in a and see the frequency of each.

Then, for each i from 0 to N, if cnt[i] > 0, Alice can include it in c, unless Bob deletes it.

But Bob can only delete floor(n/2) elements.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of deletions Bob can make.

Bob can delete floor(n/2) elements.

Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements to include in c.

But Bob can delete elements that Alice might want.

Wait, but Bob deletes from a, not specifically from c.

Wait, more carefully:

- When Alice picks an element, she adds it to c and deletes it from a.

- When Bob picks an element, he deletes it from a.

So, Bob can delete elements that Alice hasn't picked yet.

So, Bob can try to delete elements that Alice would want to pick.

Alice, knowing this, will try to pick the elements that are most critical for maximizing the MEX.

This seems like a game where Alice wants to preserve the small i's in a to include them in c, and Bob wants to delete them to prevent Alice from including them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each i appears and how many times Bob can delete them.

For example, if cnt[i] == 1, Alice can pick it and include it in c, unless Bob deletes it first.

If cnt[i] >= 2, Alice can pick one and include it in c, and Bob can delete another.

Wait, but Bob can only delete one element per turn, and Alice picks and deletes one element per turn.

This seems too involved for manual analysis.

Maybe I need to look for a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Looking back at the provided code:

- It counts the frequency of each i.

- Then, for each i from 0 to N:

- If cnt[i] == 1, increment t.

- If t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0, return i.

This seems to be trying to find the smallest i where either cnt[i] == 0 or there are at least two elements with cnt[j] == 1 for j < i.

But I'm not sure if this aligns with the game's outcome.

Let me test it with the first example.

**Example 1:**

Input:

```

4

0 0 1 1

```

cnt[0] = 2

cnt[1] = 2

cnt[2] = 0

cnt[3] = 0

Iterate from i=0 to 4:

i=0: cnt[0]=2 !=1, so t不变.

i=1: cnt[1]=2 !=1, so t不变.

i=2: cnt[2]=0, so return 2.

Which matches the example output of 2.

**Example 2:**

Input:

```

4

0 1 2 3

```

cnt[0]=1

cnt[1]=1

cnt[2]=1

cnt[3]=1

cnt[4]=0

Iterate from i=0 to 4:

i=0: cnt[0]=1 ==1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=1 ==1, t=2 >=2, return 1.

Which matches the example output of 1.

**Example 3:**

Input:

```

2

1 1

```

cnt[0]=0

cnt[1]=2

cnt[2]=0

i=0: cnt[0]=0, return 0.

Which matches the example output of 0.

Hmm, all examples seem to match.

Is this just a coincidence, or is there a underlying logic that I'm missing?

Let me try to understand why this might work.

The code seems to return the smallest i where either cnt[i] == 0 or there are at least two numbers with cnt[j] ==1 for j < i.

Wait, more precisely:

- It counts the number of j where cnt[j] ==1 and j < i.

- If for any i, cnt[i] ==0 or the number of j < i with cnt[j]==1 is >=2, it returns i.

Wait, but in the first example:

cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0, cnt[3]=0.

t starts at 0.

i=0: cnt[0]=2 !=1, t不变.

i=1: cnt[1]=2 !=1, t不变.

i=2: cnt[2]=0, return 2.

So, it returned 2, which matches the example.

In the second example:

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1, cnt[4]=0.

i=0: cnt[0]=1 ==1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=1 ==1, t=2 >=2, return 1.

So, it returned 1, which matches the example.

In the third example:

cnt[0]=0, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0.

i=0: cnt[0]=0, return 0.

Which matches the example.

Seems consistent.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to think of a case where this logic might fail.

Suppose we have:

n=3

a=[0,0,1]

cnt[0]=2, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=0

Iterate:

i=0: cnt[0]=2 !=1, t=0

i=1: cnt[1]=1 ==1, t=1

i=2: cnt[2]=0, return 2.

Is this correct?

Possible game flow:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[0,1]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[1]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[]

MEX is 2, which matches.

Another possible flow:

1. Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,0]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[0]

3. Alice picks 0, c=[1,0], a=[]

MEX is 2 again.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[0,1,2,3,4]

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1, cnt[4]=1

Iterate:

i=0: cnt[0]=1 ==1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=1 ==1, t=2 >=2, return 1.

Is this correct?

Possible game flow:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3,4]

2. Bob picks 1, a=[2,3,4]

3. Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3,4]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[4]

5. Alice picks 4, c=[0,2,4], a=[]

MEX is 1, which matches.

Another flow:

1. Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,2,3,4]

2. Bob picks 0, a=[2,3,4]

3. Alice picks 2, c=[1,2], a=[3,4]

4. Bob picks 3, a=[4]

5. Alice picks 4, c=[1,2,4], a=[]

MEX is 0.

Wait, in this case, MEX is 0, but the code returns 1.

Hmm, contradiction.

Wait, according to the code, it returns 1, but in this game flow, MEX is 0.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seemed to work.

Maybe this is a case where the code is insufficient.

Let me see.

In this case, n=5, a=[0,1,2,3,4], cnt all 1's.

According to the code:

i=0: cnt[0]=1 ==1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=1 ==1, t=2 >=2, return 1.

But in the game, depending on the choices, MEX can be 0.

So, the code returns 1, but actually, MEX can be 0.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem, both play optimally.

So, if Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, what would be the optimal play?

In this case, Bob can force MEX to be 0.

So, the correct answer should be 0, but the code returns 1.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Let me see another test case.

n=3

a=[0,1,1]

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0

Iterate:

i=0: cnt[0]=1 ==1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=2 !=1, t=1

i=2: cnt[2]=0, return 2.

But in reality:

Possible game flow:

1. Alice picks 1, c=[1], a=[0,1]

2. Bob picks 1, a=[0]

3. Alice picks 0, c=[1,0], a=[]

MEX is 2.

Another flow:

1. Alice picks 0, c=[0], a=[1,1]

2. Bob picks 1, a=[1]

3. Alice picks 1, c=[0,1], a=[]

MEX is 2.

So, MEX is 2, but the code returns 1, which is incorrect.

Wait, no, according to the code:

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=2, cnt[2]=0

i=0: cnt[0]=1 ==1, t=1

i=1: cnt[1]=2 !=1, t=1

i=2: cnt[2]=0, return 2.

So, in this case, it returns 2, which matches the actual MEX.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, in the previous n=5 case, the code returns 1, but actual MEX can be 0.

So, the code is still incorrect in that case.

Wait, but in this n=3 case, it seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct sometimes and incorrect others.

Hence, it's incorrect.

So, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
