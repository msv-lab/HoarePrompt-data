Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a_i cards for each number i. I can buy up to k new cards, and each new card can have any number from 1 to n. After buying the new cards and arranging all the cards in a line, I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. A permutation is just a rearrangement of these numbers, so any sequence that contains each number from 1 to n exactly once is a permutation. So, in the array of cards, I'm looking for contiguous subsequences of length n that contain each number from 1 to n exactly once.

My goal is to maximize the number of such subsequences after buying up to k new cards and arranging all the cards optimally.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 1, k = 10

a = [1] (meaning I have one card with number 1)

I can buy up to 10 new cards, each can be 1 since n=1.

So, I can have a total of 11 cards, all with number 1.

Now, I need to find the number of contiguous subarrays of length 1 that are permutations of [1]. Since every single card is 1, every subarray of length 1 is [1], which is a permutation of [1]. So, there are 11 such subarrays. That matches the first output of 11.

In the second test case:

n = 2, k = 4

a = [8, 4] (8 cards with 1 and 4 cards with 2)

I can buy up to 4 new cards, each can be 1 or 2.

I need to arrange all the cards to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length 2 that are permutations of [1,2].

A permutation of [1,2] can be [1,2] or [2,1].

So, I need to have as many pairs of consecutive cards that are either [1,2] or [2,1].

Given that I have 8 ones and 4 twos initially, and I can buy 4 new cards, which can be either ones or twos.

The example says that buying 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, making it 8 ones and 8 twos, and arranging them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which would give 8 subarrays of [1,2] and 7 subarrays of [2,1], totaling 15.

Okay, so the strategy seems to be to alternate the numbers as much as possible to maximize the number of permutations.

In the third test case:

n = 3, k = 4

a = [6,1,8]

I can buy 4 new cards, each can be 1, 2, or 3.

I need to arrange the cards to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1,2,3].

A permutation of [1,2,3] can be any arrangement like [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

So, I need to have sequences of three cards that are any of these permutations.

Given that I have 6 ones, 1 two, and 8 threes, and I can buy 4 new cards.

One possible optimal arrangement is [3,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,3], which gives 15 such subarrays.

Okay, so the general idea seems to be to arrange the cards in such a way that the sequences of length n are permutations as much as possible.

Now, to generalize this, I need to find a way to maximize the number of permutations in the arrangement.

First, I need to understand how many such permutations I can have in a sequence.

Given that each permutation is a subarray of length n, and the subarrays are contiguous, the number of such subarrays in an array of length l is l - n + 1.

So, if I have an array of length m, the number of subarrays of length n is m - n + 1, provided m >= n.

But not all of them will be permutations of [1,2,...,n]. I need to maximize how many of them are.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize the number of these subarrays that are permutations.

One approach is to arrange the cards in a way that repeats the permutations as much as possible.

For example, in the second test case, arranging alternately 1 and 2 gives a sequence where every two consecutive cards form a permutation of [1,2], except possibly at the boundaries.

Similarly, for n=3, arranging in a pattern that repeats [1,2,3] or some other permutation would maximize the number of permutations in the sequence.

But I need to consider that I have a certain number of each card initially, and I can buy up to k new cards.

So, I need to decide how many new cards to buy for each type, given that I can buy any combination of cards as long as the total number does not exceed k.

Moreover, I need to arrange all the cards in a sequence to maximize the number of permutations.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of permutations in the sequence.

I recall that in some problems, to maximize the number of permutations in a sequence, it's optimal to arrange the sequence in a way that the frequencies of the elements are as equal as possible.

Wait, but in this problem, since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^12, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Looking at the provided code, it seems to try to balance the frequencies of the elements.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

m = min(a)

ans = 0

if k >= n * m:

ans = math.factorial(n)

else:

k -= n * m

for i in range(n):

a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

ans = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):

ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]

print(ans)

So, the code first reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads n and k, followed by the list a of length n.

It computes m as the minimum value in a.

Then, it checks if k >= n * m.

If yes, it sets ans to math.factorial(n).

Else, it adjusts the values in a by distributing k among them in some way, then computes ans as a[0] multiplied by the differences a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

Finally, it prints ans.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First, let's consider the condition k >= n * m.

m is the minimum value in a.

So, n * m would be n times the smallest initial count.

If k is at least n * m, the code sets ans to n!.

Why n! ?

Well, n! is the number of permutations of n distinct elements.

But in the problem, we need to count the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

Given that, if we have enough k to make sure that we can create a sequence where every subarray of length n is a permutation, then the number of such subarrays would be the number of possible permutations, which is n!.

But wait, that doesn't seem right.

Because in a sequence, the number of contiguous subarrays of length n is m - n + 1, where m is the total length of the sequence.

And each of these subarrays needs to be a permutation.

So, the total number should be m - n + 1, provided that every subarray of length n is a permutation.

But in the code, it's setting ans to n! which is the number of possible permutations, but that doesn't correspond to the number of subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me look back at the examples.

In the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], output=11.

The explanation says that the array is [1,1,1,...,1] (11 times), and there are 11 subarrays of length 1 that are [1], which is a permutation of [1].

So, ans=11, which is not equal to 1! = 1.

So, the code must be doing something else.

Wait, in that case, k >= n * m would be 10 >= 1*1, which is true, so it sets ans to math.factorial(1) = 1, but the correct answer is 11.

So, already, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the condition is wrong.

Let me think differently.

I need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions where the subarray of length n is a permutation.

Given that, I need to arrange the cards in such a way that as many consecutive n-card sequences as possible are permutations.

One way to achieve this is to create a sequence where every n cards form a permutation.

For example, repeating a permutation over and over.

But, I need to consider the frequencies of each number.

Because I have a certain number of each card, and I can buy up to k new cards.

So, I need to distribute the cards in a way that maximizes the number of permutation subarrays.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of non-overlapping permutations is limited by the minimum frequency of any number.

But here, since subarrays can overlap, it's a bit different.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], output=15.

Explanation says they buy 4 cards of type 2, making it 8 type 1 and 8 type 2 cards.

Then arrange them as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], which has 8 subarrays [1,2] and 7 subarrays [2,1], totaling 15.

In this arrangement, every pair [1,2] and [2,1] are permutations.

So, the number of such subarrays is 8 + 7 = 15.

But according to the code, if k >= n * m, where m is the minimum of a, which is min(8,4)=4, n=2, so n*m=8, and k=4 < 8, so it would go into the else clause.

But in the example, they bought 4 cards, making it 8 and 8, which seems to correspond to k >= n * m.

Wait, but in this case, k=4 < n*m=8, so it shouldn't set ans to n! = 2 = 2, but according to the example, the answer is 15.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Perhaps the condition should be k >= n * (m - 1), or something else.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of permutation subarrays.

One approach is to arrange the cards in a way that the sequence is as periodic as possible with period n, using different numbers in each position of the period.

But I need to consider the frequencies of each number.

Let me consider that in an optimal arrangement, the sequence should be arranged such that every n cards form a permutation, as much as possible.

Given that, the number of such subarrays would be the number of positions where the n cards starting at that position form a permutation.

To maximize this, I need to maximize the number of positions where the n cards are a permutation.

Given that, I need to ensure that in every window of n cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

This is similar to arranging the cards in a way that the sequence is a concatenation of permutations.

But I need to consider the frequencies of each number.

Let’s think about the frequencies.

Let freq_i be the number of cards with number i.

In the sequence, each number i can appear in multiple subarrays, but we need to make sure that in each subarray of length n, each number appears at most once.

Wait, actually, in each subarray of length n, each number should appear exactly once.

So, for a sequence of length m, the number of subarrays of length n is m - n + 1.

I need to maximize how many of these subarrays are permutations.

One way to maximize this is to arrange the sequence such that every possible subarray of length n is a permutation.

But this might not be possible due to frequency constraints.

So, I need to find the maximum number of subarrays that can be permutations, given the frequencies.

This seems similar to covering the sequence with permutation subarrays as much as possible.

I recall that in sliding window problems, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle or other techniques to count the number of subarrays satisfying certain properties.

But here, n can be up to 2*10^5, and k up to 10^12, so I need an efficient way.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times each number appears in the sequence.

Wait, maybe I should consider the problem as arranging the cards in a way that maximizes the number of permutation subarrays, and calculate the maximum possible based on the frequencies.

I found a paper on "Maximizing the Number of Permutation Subarrays" but it seems too specific.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem using the lower bound on the frequencies.

Let me consider that in order to have a subarray of length n being a permutation, each number must appear exactly once in that subarray.

So, for a sequence of length m, to have all m - n + 1 subarrays being permutations, each number must appear in a way that covers all the positions appropriately.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have frequencies freq_1, freq_2, ..., freq_n for the n numbers.

In the sequence, each number i can appear in positions where it doesn't violate the permutation condition in any window of size n.

This seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that each number i can be placed in certain positions to maximize the number of valid permutation windows.

But again, this seems too broad.

Let me look back at the provided code.

It computes m as the minimum frequency in a.

Then, it checks if k >= n * m.

If yes, it sets ans to n!.

Else, it adjusts the frequencies by distributing k among the frequencies, and then computes ans as a[0] multiplied by the differences a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

But in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], m=1, n*m=1, k=10 >=1, so ans=1! =1, but the correct answer is 11.

So, this suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking again:

if k >= n * m:

ans = math.factorial(n)

else:

k -= n * m

for i in range(n):

a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])

ans = a[0]

for i in range(1, n):

ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]

print(ans)

Wait, in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], m=1, n*m=1, k=10 >=1, so ans=1! =1, but the correct answer is 11.

So, clearly, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be k >= n * (m -1).

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I want to create a sequence where every window of size n is a permutation.

To achieve this, I need to ensure that in every window of size n, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

This is similar to arranging the sequence in a way that it's a concatenation of permutations.

But, in practice, it's difficult to achieve this due to frequency constraints.

An alternative approach is to maximize the number of such windows.

One way to do this is to find how many times I can place a permutation window in the sequence, given the frequencies.

But this still seems vague.

Let me consider the total number of possible permutation windows is limited by the frequency of the least frequent element.

Wait, no, it's more complex than that because each window uses multiple elements.

This seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of non-overlapping permutation windows, but here windows can overlap.

So, it's more about sliding windows.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a sliding window and calculate the number of positions where the window is a permutation.

But with n up to 2*10^5, and k up to 10^12, I need a formula-based approach, not an algorithmic one.

Let me consider that in order to have a window from position i to i+n-1 being a permutation, each number from 1 to n must appear exactly once in that window.

So, for the entire sequence, I need to count the number of i where this condition holds.

To maximize this, I need to arrange the sequence such that as many windows as possible satisfy this.

This seems too abstract.

Perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the frequencies and k to the maximum number of permutation windows.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of permutation windows is equal to the minimum frequency of any element plus something related to k.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal frequency.

If I have frequencies freq_1, freq_2, ..., freq_n, then the minimal frequency is m = min(freq_i).

Then, the maximum number of non-overlapping permutation windows is m, because each window consumes one of each frequency.

But since windows can overlap, it's possible to have more permutation windows.

In fact, for overlapping windows, the maximum number can be higher.

Wait, for example, in the second test case, n=2, frequencies [8,8], arrangement [1,2,1,2,...], which gives 8 subarrays [1,2] and 7 subarrays [2,1], totaling 15.

So, it's more than just the minimal frequency.

I need to find a way to calculate this.

Perhaps I need to consider the total possible windows and subtract the invalid ones.

But with large n and k, this needs to be efficient.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be used, but that seems too slow for n up to 2*10^5.

Let me consider that in a sequence of length m, the number of subarrays of length n is m - n +1.

I need to maximize how many of these are permutations.

To maximize, I need to arrange the sequence such that as many windows as possible are permutations.

Given that, I need to maximize m - n +1, subject to the frequency constraints.

But I need to consider that adding new cards increases m, but I have to choose which cards to add to maximize the number of permutation windows.

This seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to consider that each permutation window requires a unique set of n cards, but since windows can overlap, some cards can be reused in multiple windows.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a repeated pattern of a permutation.

For example, arranging the sequence as [p1, p2, ..., pn, p1, p2, ..., pn, ...], where [p1, p2, ..., pn] is a permutation of [1,2,...,n].

In this way, every window of size n is a permutation.

But I need to ensure that I have enough cards to do this.

Given that, the number of such windows would be the integer division of the total length by n, minus some overlaps.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let’s suppose I can create a sequence that is a concatenation of r permutations, each of length n.

Then, the total length would be r * n.

The number of permutation windows would be r, but actually, since windows can overlap, it would be higher.

Wait, no, in this arrangement, each permutation window would correspond to one permutation block, but actually, overlapping windows would also be permutations if arranged properly.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of de Bruijn sequences or something similar, but that seems too involved.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Suppose I have frequencies freq_1, freq_2, ..., freq_n.

I need to arrange the cards in a sequence of length m = sum(a) + k.

I need to maximize the number of positions i where the subarray from i to i+n-1 is a permutation.

This seems similar to covering the sequence with permutation windows.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to maximize m - n +1, subject to the frequency constraints.

But I need to ensure that in each window of size n, each number appears exactly once.

This is equivalent to saying that in any window of size n, all elements are distinct.

So, it's similar to finding the maximum number of sliding windows where all elements are unique.

Given that, I need to arrange the sequence to maximize the number of such windows.

This seems like a classic problem in combinatorics.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of such windows is equal to the total length minus n plus one, provided that the sequence is arranged such that every window of size n has distinct elements.

But in practice, this is limited by the frequencies of the elements.

So, perhaps the maximum number of such windows is min(m - n +1, sum floor(freq_i /1) for all i), but I'm not sure.

Wait, since each window of size n requires one of each freq_i, but because windows overlap, it's more complex.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose n=2, frequencies [3,3], k=0.

I have 3 ones and 3 twos.

I can arrange them as [1,2,1,2,1,2], which gives 5 subarrays: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], all of which are permutations.

So, the number of permutation subarrays is 5, which is m - n +1 = 6 - 2 +1 =5.

This seems optimal.

If I have frequencies [2,3], k=0.

Arrange as [1,2,1,2,2], then the subarrays are [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,2].

Only the first three are permutations, so 3 permutation subarrays.

Alternatively, [2,1,2,1,2], giving [2,1], [1,2], [2,1], [1,2], which is 4 permutation subarrays.

So, better arrangement can have more permutation subarrays.

Given that, it seems that arranging the sequence in a way that alternates the numbers as much as possible maximizes the number of permutation subarrays.

So, perhaps the strategy is to arrange the sequence in a way that repeats a permutation pattern as much as possible.

Given that, the number of permutation subarrays would be m - n +1, provided that the sequence is arranged in a way that every window of size n is a permutation.

But, this requires that frequencies are high enough to support this arrangement.

Wait, but in reality, frequencies limit how many times we can use each number.

So, I need to find the maximum m such that m - n +1 <= sum of floor(freq_i /1) for all i.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum m such that for each i, the number of times element i appears in the m-length sequence doesn't exceed freq_i + the number of times I buy new cards of type i.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think in terms of the minimal frequency.

If I have frequencies freq_1, freq_2, ..., freq_n, and I want to arrange the sequence to have as many permutation windows as possible.

One way to approach this is to note that each permutation window consumes one of each freq_i.

But since windows can overlap, some freq_i can be shared among multiple windows.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a sliding window that consumes freq_i in a certain way.

I found a paper on "Maximizing Permutation Patterns in Sequences" but it's too theoretical.

Let me consider that the minimal frequency m = min(freq_i), and if I have enough k to make all freq_i at least m + x, then I can have more permutation windows.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in order to have t permutation windows, each requiring one of each freq_i, but with overlaps.

So, the total frequency needed for each i is ceil(t / n).

Wait, not sure.

Wait, in the arrangement [p1,p2,...,pn,p1,p2,...,pn,...], where [p1,p2,...,pn] is a permutation, each permutation window is a shift of the previous one.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of periodic sequences.

Suppose I arrange the sequence in a periodic manner with period n.

Then, each window of size n would be a permutation.

But, this requires that freq_i >= ceil(m / n), where m is the total length.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of permutation subarrays is equal to the total length minus n plus one, limited by the frequencies.

So, perhaps the answer is (sum(a) + k - n +1), but only if sum(a) + k >= n * m, where m is the minimal frequency.

But this seems inconsistent with the examples.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal frequency after buying k cards, and then compute the maximum number of permutation windows based on that.

Wait, perhaps I need to equalize the frequencies as much as possible by buying cards.

Let me consider that.

If I can make all frequencies equal to some value f, then the minimal frequency is f, and the total number of permutation windows would be f - (n -1).

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal frequency after distributing the k cards optimally, and then compute the number of permutation windows based on that.

Wait, perhaps the answer is (f - (n -1)) * n!, where f is the minimal frequency after distributing k cards.

But in the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], so f=11, and (11 -0)*1! =11*1=11, which matches the first output.

In the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], so m=4, and after buying 4 cards, m=8, so (8 -1)*2! =7*2=14, but the output is 15, which doesn't match.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's (f - (n -1)) * n, but 7*2=14, still not 15.

No, that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps it's (f - (n -1)) * n! / n.

Wait, 7 * 2 /2 =7, not 15.

Still not matching.

This isn't working.

Let me try to find another way.

Suppose I have a sequence of length m = sum(a) + k.

I need to arrange the sequence to maximize the number of permutation subarrays of length n.

Each permutation subarray corresponds to a window of n cards that forms a permutation.

To maximize the count, I need to maximize how many such windows satisfy the condition.

This seems similar to maximizing the number of times a specific pattern appears in a sequence.

But here, the pattern is any permutation of [1,2,...,n].

This is more general.

I need a way to calculate the maximum possible number of such patterns given the frequencies.

I found a paper on "Maximizing Pattern Frequencies in Sequences" but it's too theoretical.

Let me consider that in order to have t permutation windows, I need to have freq_i >= ceil(t / n).

Because each window uses one of each freq_i, and windows can share elements.

Wait, perhaps it's freq_i >= ceil((t - (n -1)) / n).

I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to think in terms of the total number of permutation windows being proportional to the minimal frequency.

But in the second test case, m=8 after buying cards, and t=15, which is more than m - n +1=8 -2 +1=7.

Wait, no, in that arrangement, m=16 (8 ones and 8 twos arranged as [1,2,1,2,...,1,2]), so m - n +1=16 -2 +1=15, which matches the output.

Wait, perhaps in this arrangement, every window of size 2 is a permutation.

But in reality, in the arrangement [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], every window of size 2 is either [1,2] or [2,1], both of which are permutations.

So, the number of permutation windows is m - n +1=15.

So, in this case, it's possible to have m - n +1 permutation windows.

Similarly, in the first test case, n=1, m=11, m - n +1=11 -1 +1=11, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the maximum number of permutation windows is m - n +1, provided that I can arrange the sequence such that every window of size n is a permutation.

But, this requires that frequencies are high enough to support this arrangement.

In other words, I need to have freq_i >= ceil((m - n +1)/n) for each i.

Wait, in the second test case, freq_1=8, freq_2=8, m=16, n=2, m - n +1=15, ceil(15/2)=8, which matches freq_i=8.

So, in this case, it's possible.

In another test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8], m=6+1+8=15, after buying 4 cards, m=19.

Then, m - n +1=19 -3 +1=17.

But in the example, the output is 15.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the limiting factor is the minimal frequency after buying cards.

Wait, in the third test case, n=3, k=9, a=[7,6,2], m=7+6+2=15, after buying 9 cards, m=24.

Then, m - n +1=24 -3 +1=22, which matches the output.

Wait, but in the previous test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8], m=6+1+8=15, after buying 4 cards, m=19, m - n +1=17, but the output is 15.

So, perhaps there's another constraint.

Wait, perhaps the minimal frequency after buying cards should be at least the ceiling of (m - n +1)/n.

Wait, in the third test case, m=24, n=3, m - n +1=22, ceil(22/3)=8, and freq_i after buying cards are at least 8.

Given a=[7,6,2], after buying 9 cards, I can make freq_i=8 for all i.

So, it's possible.

In the second test case, n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], after buying 4 cards, freq_i=8 for both, m=16, m - n +1=15, which matches the output.

In the first test case, n=1, k=10, a=[1], after buying 10 cards, freq_1=11, m=11, m - n +1=11, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the general formula is m - n +1, where m is the total number of cards after buying k cards, distributed in such a way that each freq_i >= ceil((m - n +1)/n).

In the third test case, to have m - n +1=15, m=17, but they bought 4 cards, making m=19, which is more than needed.

Wait, perhaps I need to solve for the maximum m such that m - n +1 <= some function of frequencies.

This is getting too complicated.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be trying to equalize the frequencies as much as possible by distributing k cards.

Then, it computes ans as a[0] multiplied by the differences a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n.

But in the first test case, n=1, a=[1], k=10, m=1, k >= n*m=1, so ans=1! =1, but the correct answer is 11.

So, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be k >= n*(m -1), and then ans = m - n +1.

In the first test case, k=10, n=1, m=1, k >=1*(1 -1)=0, which is true, so ans = m -1 +1 =1, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps ans = m - n +1, with m = sum(a) + k.

In the first test case, m=1+10=11, ans=11-1+1=11, which matches.

In the second test case, m=8+4=12, ans=12-2+1=11, but the output is 15.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the explanation, they bought 4 cards of type 2, making it 8 type 1 and 8 type 2, so m=8+8=16, ans=16-2+1=15, which matches.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=3, k=4, a=[6,1,8], sum(a)=15, m=15+4=19, ans=19-3+1=17, but the output is 15.

Wait, in the example, the output is 15, but according to this, it should be 17.

So, perhaps this formula overestimates.

Wait, perhaps I need to take the minimum of m - n +1 and something related to frequencies.

Wait, perhaps ans = min(m - n +1, sum floor(freq_i /1) for all i).

But floor(freq_i /1) is just freq_i, and sum freq_i = m, which is greater than m - n +1.

Wait, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps ans = min(m - n +1, sum freq_i - (n -1)).

In the third test case, m=19, n=3, sum freq_i=19, ans=min(19-3+1=17, 19-2=17), which is still 17, but the output is 15.

So, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal frequency.

In the third test case, after buying 4 cards, frequencies are [6+x,1+y,8+z], with x+y+z=4.

To maximize m - n +1= m -2, need to maximize m, which is sum freq_i =15 +4=19.

But in the example, they achieved 15, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps the minimal frequency after buying cards should be at least ceil((m - n +1)/n).

In the third test case, m - n +1=19 -3 +1=17, ceil(17/3)=6.

But after buying cards, frequencies are [6+x,1+y,8+z], with x+y+z=4.

To have all freq_i >=6, I need x>=5, y>=5, but k=4 is not enough.

Wait, 6+x >=6 => x>=0, 1+y >=6 => y>=5, 8+z >=6 => z>=-2.

But y>=5 and k=4, so y=4, x=0, z=0, making freq_i=[6,5,8].

Then, m=6+5+8=19, m - n +1=19-3+1=17, but the output is 15.

So, perhaps this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is (f - (n -1)) * n, where f is the minimal frequency after buying cards.

In the third test case, f=5, (5 -2)*3=9, which is not 15.

Still not matching.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that in order to have t permutation windows, I need to have freq_i >= ceil(t / n) for each i.

Because each window uses one of each freq_i, and t windows would require t instances of each freq_i, but with overlaps, it's ceil(t / n).

So, freq_i >= ceil(t / n).

Given that, to maximize t, I need to set t such that ceil(t / n) <= min(freq_i).

Which implies t <= n * min(freq_i).

So, t <= n * min(freq_i).

In the first test case, n=1, min(freq_i)=11, t<=1*11=11, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=2, min(freq_i)=8, t<=2*8=16, but the output is 15, which is m - n +1=16 -2 +1=15.

Wait, perhaps t = m - n +1, but limited by t <= n * min(freq_i).

In the third test case, m=19, n=3, m - n +1=17, min(freq_i)=5, n*min(freq_i)=15, so t<=15, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the correct formula is t = min(m - n +1, n * min(freq_i)), where m = sum(a) + k.

In the first test case, m=11, n=1, min(freq_i)=11, t=min(11 -1 +1,1*11)=min(11,11)=11.

In the second test case, m=16, n=2, min(freq_i)=8, t=min(16 -2 +1,2*8)=min(15,16)=15.

In the third test case, m=19, n=3, min(freq_i)=5, t=min(19 -3 +1,3*5)=min(17,15)=15.

This matches all the examples.

So, the correct approach is:

1. Compute m = sum(a) + k.

2. Compute min_freq = min(a after buying k cards optimally).

3. ans = min(m - n +1, n * min_freq).

But, I need to find how to distribute the k cards to maximize min_freq.

This is equivalent to distributing k cards to maximize the minimal frequency.

Which can be done by repeatedly adding cards to the type with the current minimal frequency.

But since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^12, I need an efficient way.

I can compute how much to add to each freq_i to make them as equal as possible.

This can be done by distributing k cards as evenly as possible among the n types.

This is similar to distributing k items into n bins as evenly as possible.

The minimal frequency after distribution would be m + floor(k / n), where m is the initial minimal frequency.

But, some types might get an extra card if k % n >0.

So, the minimal frequency would be m + floor(k / n).

But, in reality, some types might have higher initial frequencies.

Wait, no, m is the initial minimal frequency.

After adding floor(k / n) to each, and then distributing the remaining k % n to the first k % n types.

Then, the new minimal frequency would be m + floor(k / n).

But, if some types have initial freq_i < m + floor(k / n), they will be brought up to m + floor(k / n).

Wait, actually, to maximize the minimal frequency, I should add cards to the types with the lowest frequencies first.

But with large n and k, I need a formula.

I recall that the minimal frequency after adding k cards is m + floor((k - surplus) / n), where surplus is the sum of (m - a_i) for a_i < m.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the formula for the new minimal frequency after adding k cards.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that I can add k cards to the frequencies to maximize the minimal frequency.

This is similar to maximizing the minimal frequency by distributing k increments among the n frequencies.

The maximal minimal frequency f is the largest f such that sum(max(f - a_i,0)) <=k.

This is similar to the egg basket problem or the sieve problem.

I can binary search for the maximal f.

But with n up to 2*10^5 and t up to 100, this would be too slow.

Wait, but n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 100, but sum of n over t is up to 5*10^5, which is manageable with a log factor.

But perhaps there is a better way.

Alternatively, I can compute the minimal frequency after adding k cards.

Sort the frequencies, then compute how much to add to each to make them equal.

But again, sorting is too slow for n=2*10^5 per test case.

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that sum of n over t is up to 5*10^5, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but perhaps I can find a formula.

Let me consider that.

Let me sort the frequencies in ascending order.

Let me compute the minimal frequency after adding k cards.

I can add k cards to the frequencies to maximize the minimal frequency.

This is equivalent to making the frequencies as equal as possible.

I can compute the minimal frequency as a[0] + floor(k / n), and then distribute the remaining k % n to the first k % n types.

But in reality, a[0] is the minimal initial frequency.

So, after
