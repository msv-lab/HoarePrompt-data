Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. There are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. I need to figure out the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which indicates how many test cases there are. For each test case, there's a line with three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the price per yogurt if bought individually, and b is the price for buying two yogurts together.

The output should be the minimum cost for each test case, each in a separate line.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

4

2 5 9

3 5 9

3 5 11

4 5 11

Output:

9

14

15

20

So, for the first test case, n=2, a=5, b=9. Buying two yogurts using the promotion costs 9 burles, which is less than buying them individually for 10 burles (5 each). So, the minimum cost is 9.

In the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9. If Maxim buys one promotion (two yogurts for 9) and one individual yogurt for 5, the total is 14 burles. Alternatively, buying all three individually would cost 15 burles (5 each). So, 14 is cheaper.

Third test case, n=3, a=5, b=11. Buying one promotion (two yogurts for 11) and one individual yogurt (5) totals 16 burles. But the output is 15. Hmm, that doesn't match my calculation. Wait, maybe there's another way. Maybe buying all three individually would cost 15 burles (5*3=15). Comparing that to buying one promotion and one individual: 11+5=16, which is higher than 15. So, in this case, it's better to buy all three individually for 15 burles. But the output shows 15, which aligns with this.

Wait, but the note says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5." Hmm, but according to the prices given, buying two for 11 and one for 5 totals 16, which is higher than buying all three individually for 15. So, indeed, buying all individually is cheaper. So, the output is correct.

Fourth test case, n=4, a=5, b=11. If Maxim buys two promotions, that's 11*2=22 burles. Alternatively, buying all four individually would be 5*4=20 burles. So, buying individually is cheaper, hence the output is 20.

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to compare the cost of buying as many promotions as possible with buying individual yogurts, and choose the cheaper option.

But wait, in the second test case, n=3, a=5, b=9, the output is 14, which is buying one promotion and one individual yogurt, even though buying all three individually would cost 15, which is higher. So, it's not always about buying as many promotions as possible, but rather finding the combination that minimizes the cost.

I need to generalize this.

Let me think about the cost per yogurt in the promotion. If b is less than 2*a, then the promotion is cheaper per yogurt. In that case, it's better to buy as many promotions as possible, and then buy any remaining yogurt individually.

For example, in the first test case, b=9 < 2*5=10, so buying the promotion is better. For n=2, buying the promotion costs 9, which is less than buying two individually for 10.

In the second test case, b=9 < 2*5=10, so again, buying the promotion is better. For n=3, buy one promotion (2 yogurts for 9) and one individual yogurt (5), total 14.

In the third test case, b=11 > 2*5=10, so buying individually is better per yogurt. Therefore, buy all three individually for 15, which is less than buying one promotion (11) and one individual (5), totaling 16.

In the fourth test case, b=11 > 2*5=10, so buying individually is better. For n=4, buying all individually costs 20, which is less than buying two promotions for 22.

So, the strategy seems to be:

- If b < 2*a, then buy as many promotions as possible, and buy any remaining yogurt individually.

- If b >= 2*a, then buy all yogurts individually.

But wait, in the third test case, even though b=11 > 2*5=10, buying one promotion and one individual yogurt would cost 16, which is higher than buying all three individually for 15. So, in this case, it's better to buy all individually.

But, if b >= 2*a, buying individually is always better or equal in cost compared to buying promotions.

Therefore, the general strategy is:

- If b < 2*a, then buy floor(n/2) promotions and n%2 individual yogurts.

- Else, buy all n yogurts individually.

Let me verify this with the examples.

First test case: n=2, a=5, b=9.

Since b=9 < 2*a=10, buy 1 promotion: 9 burles.

Second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9.

Since b=9 < 10, buy 1 promotion (2 yogurts for 9) and 1 individual yogurt (5), total 14.

Third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11.

Since b=11 >= 10, buy all 3 individually: 15 burles.

Fourth test case: n=4, a=5, b=11.

Since b=11 >= 10, buy all 4 individually: 20 burles.

Seems consistent.

But wait, in the note, it says: "In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5." Wait, but according to the strategy above, since b >= 2*a, we buy all individually for 15, which is cheaper than buying one promotion and one individual for 16.

But, is there a scenario where buying some promotions and some individually is cheaper than buying all individually, but the condition b >= 2*a holds? In this specific case, no, because b=11 >= 10, so buying all individually is cheaper.

So, the strategy seems solid.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n % 2:

if 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b + a)

elif 2 * a < b:

print(a * n)

else:

print(n // 2 * b)

Let's analyze this.

It seems the function iterates through each test case, reads n, a, b, and then calculates the minimum cost based on certain conditions.

Looking at the conditions:

- If n is odd (n % 2 != 0):

- If 2*a < b, then print a*n.

- Else, print (n // 2)*b + a.

- Else (n is even):

- If 2*a < b, then print a*n.

- Else, print (n // 2)*b.

Wait, this seems different from the strategy I thought earlier.

According to my earlier strategy:

- If b < 2*a, buy as many promotions as possible and buy remaining individually.

- Else, buy all individually.

But in the code:

- For odd n:

- If 2*a < b, buy all individually (a*n).

- Else, buy floor(n/2) promotions and one individual ( (n//2)*b + a ).

- For even n:

- If 2*a < b, buy all individually (a*n).

- Else, buy n/2 promotions.

Wait, this seems inconsistent with the earlier strategy.

Wait, in the case where b < 2*a, it's better to buy as many promotions as possible and remaining individually.

But in the code, for odd n and 2*a < b, it's buying all individually.

Is that correct?

Wait, in the third test case: n=3, a=5, b=11.

Here, 2*a=10 < b=11, so according to the code, since n is odd and 2*a < b, it should print a*n = 15.

Which matches the output.

In the second test case: n=3, a=5, b=9.

2*a=10 > b=9, so print (n//2)*b + a = 1*9 + 5 = 14.

Which matches the output.

In the first test case: n=2, even.

2*a=10 > b=9, so print (n//2)*b = 1*9 = 9.

Which matches.

Fourth test case: n=4, even.

2*a=10 < b=11, so print a*n = 20.

Which matches.

So, the code seems to be implementing the correct logic, based on the examples.

Wait, but according to my earlier strategy, for b < 2*a, buy as many promotions as possible and remaining individually.

But in the code, for odd n and 2*a < b, it buys all individually.

Is that correct?

Let me think.

If b < 2*a, it's cheaper to buy promotions.

But if n is odd, and 2*a < b, it's better to buy all individually.

Is that always true?

Let's take an example where n=3, a=5, b=11.

As in the third test case.

Buying all individually: 3*5=15.

Buying one promotion and one individual: 11+5=16.

So, buying all individually is cheaper.

Another example: n=5, a=5, b=9.

If I buy two promotions (2*9=18) and one individual (5), total 23.

Buying all individually: 5*5=25.

So, buying promotions and individually is cheaper.

But according to the code, since n is odd and 2*a=10 > b=9, it would print (n//2)*b + a = 2*9 + 5 = 23.

Which is correct, as it's cheaper than buying all individually for 25.

But according to my earlier strategy, for b < 2*a, buy as many promotions as possible and remaining individually.

In this case, b=9 < 10, so buy two promotions (18) and one individual (5), total 23.

Which matches the code.

Wait, but in the code, for n odd and 2*a < b, it buys all individually.

In this case, 2*a=10 > b=9, so it buys floor(n/2)*b + a = 2*9 + 5 = 23.

Which is correct.

Another case: n=3, a=3, b=7.

Here, 2*a=6 < b=7.

According to the code, since n is odd and 2*a < b, buy all individually: 3*3=9.

Alternatively, buying one promotion (7) and one individual (3), total 10.

So, buying all individually is cheaper (9 vs 10).

Hence, the code is correct in this case.

So, the code seems to implement the correct logic.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
