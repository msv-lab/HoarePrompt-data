Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, which is position n. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to move up in the queue to be among the first m people. To do that, he can bribe people in front of him to swap places, and there are costs associated with that.

First, I need to understand the setup. There are n people in the queue, starting from person 1 to person n. Kirill stands at position n+1. He can perform swaps with any person j who is ahead of him (j < i), and when he does that, he has to pay a_j coins to the person at position j. Additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

My goal is to help Kirill minimize the total cost of moving to one of the first m positions.

Let me think about this step by step.

First, I need to model the queue and the possible moves Kirill can make.

Let's consider the queue positions from 1 to n+1 (since Kirill is at n+1).

But in the code provided, it seems like the positions are considered from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at position na_frente, which is n.

Wait, in the code, na_frente is n-1 because Python uses 0-based indexing.

Hmm, I need to make sure I understand the indexing.

In the problem, positions are 1 to n, with Kirill at position n+1.

But in the code, it seems like positions are 0 to n, with Kirill at position na_frente, which is n.

Okay, so na_frente = n-1 in 0-based indexing.

Wait, no. In Python, lists are 0-based, so if there are n people, positions are 0 to n-1, and Kirill is at position n.

But in the code, na_frente is assigned to n-1, which would be the last person in the queue.

Wait, but in the problem, Kirill is at position n+1, which would be index n in 0-based indexing.

So, na_frente = n-1 seems incorrect.

Wait, in the code, na_frente is set to n-1, and then it's decremented in the loop.

Wait, maybe it's a mistake.

I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me read the problem again.

"The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i=1, to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later and stood at the end of the line after the n-th person."

So, positions are 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

In Python, lists are 0-based, so positions correspond to indices as follows:

- Position 1: index 0

- Position 2: index 1

- ...

- Position n: index n-1

- Position n+1: index n

Okay, so Kirill starts at index n.

Now, he wants to move to one of the first m positions, meaning positions 1 to m (indices 0 to m-1).

He can perform swaps with any person j ahead of him (j < i), paying a_j coins to the person at position j, and paying b_k coins to each person k between j and i.

He can perform this action any number of times.

He wants to minimize the total cost.

I need to find the minimal cost for him to reach one of the first m positions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to model the cost of moving from position i to position j, where j < i.

The cost to swap with j is a_j, plus b_k for each k between j and i.

Wait, more precisely, when he swaps with j, he moves to position j, and people between j and i move back one position.

And he has to pay a_j to the person at position j, and for each k between j and i, he has to pay b_k.

Wait, I need to understand the operation clearly.

When Kirill chooses to swap with person at position j (j < i), he pays a_j to that person, and for each person k where j < k < i, he pays b_k.

So, the total cost for this operation is a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

After this operation, Kirill is now at position j, and the person who was at j moves to position i.

Then, he can repeat this operation again if needed.

He can perform this operation any number of times, and he wants to end up at one of the first m positions with minimal total cost.

This seems like a graph where positions are nodes, and there are directed edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum(b_k for k from j+1 to i-1).

He starts at position n+1 (index n) and wants to reach any of the positions 1 to m (indices 0 to m-1).

I need to find the minimal cost path from position n to any of the positions 0 to m-1.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard graph approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me see if there's a dynamic programming approach.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimal cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[i] can be computed as the minimum over all j where j < i of dp[j] + a_j + sum(b_k for k from j+1 to i-1).

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need to find a way to compute this more efficiently.

Maybe I can find a way to compute dp[i] in O(1) or O(log n) time.

Let me see.

First, observe that sum(b_k for k from j+1 to i-1) is the sum of b_k from j+1 to i-1.

This looks like a prefix sum.

Let me define prefix_b[i] as the sum of b_k from 0 to i-1.

Then, sum(b_k from j+1 to i-1) = prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

So, the cost to move from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

Therefore, dp[i] = min over j < i of dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

This can be rearranged as dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) + prefix_b[i].

So, dp[i] = min_over_j (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) + prefix_b[i].

Let me denote min_val[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j).

Then, dp[i] = min_val[i] + prefix_b[i].

Now, if I can compute min_val[i] efficiently, then I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

Moreover, min_val[i] depends on min_val[j] for j < i.

Wait, but dp[j] depends on min_val[j], which in turn depends on min_val[k] for k < j.

This seems a bit circular.

Wait, perhaps I can compute min_val[i] incrementally as I compute dp[j] for j from 0 to n.

Let me try to see.

If I iterate i from 0 to n, computing dp[i] and min_val[i] accordingly.

Wait, but Kirill starts at position n, so I need to compute dp[i] for i from n down to 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as Kirill moving from position n to position 0, and compute the minimal cost to reach position i.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of positions from 0 to n, with Kirill starting at n.

He can move to any j < i by paying a_j + sum(b_k for k from j+1 to i-1).

I need to find the minimal cost to reach any position less than m.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with n up to 2e5, I need something more efficient.

Let me see if there's a way to optimize the dp.

Looking back at the expression:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) + prefix_b[i]

So, for each i, dp[i] is equal to the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) over j < i, plus prefix_b[i].

This looks like a standard minimization where we keep track of the minimum of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) up to i-1, and then add prefix_b[i] to it.

So, if I keep track of the minimum value of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) for j from 0 to i-1, then dp[i] = min_value + prefix_b[i].

And then, for each new i, I can update the min_value if (dp[i] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_i) is smaller.

Wait, but I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize min_value = infinity

For i from 0 to n:

    dp[i] = min_value + prefix_b[i]

    if i < m:

        # Kirill can stop here

        dp[i] = min(dp[i], some value?)

    min_value = min(min_value, dp[i] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_i)

Wait, but when i reaches n, Kirill is at position n.

He wants to reach any position less than m.

So, he can perform operations to move to positions j < i, paying a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i-1).

I need to make sure that I'm modeling this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Kirill can choose to stop at any position less than m, and I need to find the minimal cost to reach any such position.

So, dp[i] would be the minimal cost to reach position i.

Then, for each position i, Kirill can choose to stop if i < m.

So, the final answer would be the minimum dp[i] for i from 0 to m-1.

To compute dp[i], we need to consider all possible j < i, and dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + sum(b_k from j+1 to i-1)).

But this is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the sum(b_k from j+1 to i-1).

If I precompute the prefix sums of b, say prefix_b[i] = sum(b_k for k from 0 to i-1), then sum(b_k from j+1 to i-1) = prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j+1]).

Rearranging, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) + prefix_b[i].

So, for each i, dp[i] = min_value + prefix_b[i], where min_value is the minimum of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j) for j < i.

This suggests that I can keep a running minimum of (dp[j] - prefix_b[j+1] + a_j), and for each new i, compute dp[i] = min_value + prefix_b[i], and then update min_value if necessary.

Yes, this seems efficient, as it's O(n).

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize min_value = infinity

Compute prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[i] = prefix_b[i-1] + b[i-1] for i >= 1

Then, for i from 0 to n:

    dp[i] = min_value + prefix_b[i]

    if i < m:

        # Kirill can stop here

        # But I need to consider that he can stop at any position < m

        # So, the final answer is the minimum dp[i] for i from 0 to m-1

    # Update min_value

    if i < n:

        candidate = dp[i] - prefix_b[i+1] + a_i

        if candidate < min_value:

            min_value = candidate

Wait, but I need to make sure that I don't try to access prefix_b[n+1], which doesn't exist.

So, perhaps I need to handle the indices carefully.

Also, in the code provided, it seems like they are iterating from na_frente down to 0.

In the code, na_frente is set to n-1, which seems incorrect because Kirill is at position n+1, which is index n in 0-based.

Wait, I need to look at the code again.

Looking at the code:

na_frente = n - 1

pos_final = m - 1

Then, the loop is for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

So, v goes from n-1 down to 0.

In each iteration, if v <= pos_final, which is m-1, then it updates the best value.

Otherwise, it adds to the total either a_v or b_v, whichever is smaller.

This seems different from what I thought.

I need to understand what the code is doing.

It seems like the code is iterating from the back of the queue towards the front.

For each position v, if v is among the first m positions (0 to m-1), it considers the current total plus a_v as a candidate for the best value.

Otherwise, it adds to the total the minimum of a_v or b_v.

Then, it keeps track of the minimum among these.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to simulate Kirill moving forward in the queue step by step.

But I'm not sure.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me consider the first test case:

Input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

According to the code:

na_frente = n -1 = 3

pos_final = m -1 =1

total =0

best = infinity

Loop v from 3 down to 0:

v=3:

v > pos_final (1), so:

if a[3]=9 < b[3]=5:

total += a[3]=9

else:

total += b[3]=5

In this case, 9 > 5, so total +=5, total=5

v=2:

v > pos_final (1), so:

if a[2]=6 < b[2]=8:

total +=6

else:

total +=8

Here, 6 < 8, so total +=6, total=11

v=1:

v <= pos_final (1), so:

if best > total + a[1]=11 +3=14:

best=14

Then, if a[1]=3 < b[1]=3:

total +=3, so total=14

else:

total +=3, same

So total=14

v=0:

v <= pos_final (1), so:

if best > total + a[0]=14 +7=21:

best=min(14,21)=14

Then, if a[0]=7 < b[0]=4:

total +=7, total=21

else:

total +=4, total=21

So best remains 14

Output:14

Which matches the sample output.

Let's see another test case:

2 1

2 3

1 1

n=2, m=1

a=[2,3]

b=[1,1]

na_frente=1

pos_final=0

total=0

best=infinity

v=1:

v > pos_final (0)? 1 > 0, so:

if a[1]=3 < b[1]=1:

total +=3

else:

total +=1, total=1

v=0:

v <= pos_final (0), so:

if best > total + a[0]=1 +2=3:

best=3

Then, if a[0]=2 < b[0]=1:

total +=2, total=3

else:

total +=1, total=3

So best=3

Output:3

Which matches the sample output.

Seems correct for this case.

Let me think about the logic.

The code seems to be iterating from the back to the front, and for positions beyond m-1, it adds the minimum of a_v or b_v to the total cost.

When it reaches positions <= m-1, it considers the total cost plus a_v as a candidate for the best cost, and then decides whether to add a_v or b_v to the total cost.

Wait, but in the first test case, when v=1, it sets best=14, and then total becomes 14.

Then, when v=0, it compares best with total + a[0]=14+7=21, which is worse than 14, so best remains 14.

So, it outputs 14.

This seems correct.

But I need to understand why this works.

Maybe it's using some kind of greedy approach, where it tries to minimize the cost by choosing the cheaper option at each step, but also considering the cost to reach the final positions.

I need to see if this approach always gives the correct minimal cost.

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=3, m=2

a=[1,100,100]

b=[10,10,10]

According to the code:

na_frente=2

pos_final=1

total=0

best=infinity

v=2:

v=2 >1, so if a[2]=100 < b[2]=10, total +=100, else +=10. Here, 100 >10, so total=10

v=1:

v=1 <=1, so if best > total + a[1]=10+100=110, set best=110

Then, if a[1]=100 < b[1]=10, total +=100, else +=10. Here, 100 >10, so total +=10, total=20

v=0:

v=0 <=1, so if best > total + a[0]=20+1=21, set best=21

Then, if a[0]=1 < b[0]=10, total +=1, else +=10. Here, 1 <10, so total +=1, total=21

So, best=min(110,21)=21

Output:21

But is this the minimal cost?

Let's see:

Kirill starts at position 3.

Option 1: Swap with position 1, paying a_1=100 + sum(b_k from 2 to 2)=10, total=110

Then, Kirill is at position 1, which is within the first m=2 positions.

Option 2: Swap with position 2, paying a_2=100 + sum(b_k from 3 to 3)=10, total=110

Then, Kirill is at position 2, which is within m=2.

Option 3: Swap with position 1, paying a_1=100 + sum(b_k from 2 to 3)=10+10=20, total=120

Then, Kirill is at position 1.

But this is worse than Option 1.

Option 4: Swap with position 2 first, paying a_2=100 + sum(b_k from 3 to 3)=10, total=110

Then, swap with position 1, paying a_1=100 + sum(b_k from 2 to 2)=10, total=110+110=220

Worse.

Option 5: Don't swap, just pay to pass through.

From position 3 to position 2: pay b_2=10, total=10

Then, from position 2 to position 1: pay a_1=100 + sum(b_k from 2 to 2)=10, total=10+110=120

But this is worse than 110.

Wait, but according to the code, it's giving 21, which seems better than 110.

Is there a way to achieve 21?

Let me see:

Kirill starts at position 3.

Option: Swap with position 1, paying a_1=100 + sum(b_k from 2 to 3)=10+10=20, total=120

Or swap with position 2, paying a_2=100 + sum(b_k from 3 to 3)=10, total=110

Or pay b_2=10 to pass through position 2, moving to position 2.

Then, from position 2, pay a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 1)=10, total=10+1=11

Total cost:10 (to move from 3 to 2) +11 (to move from 2 to 1)=21

Yes, this matches the code's output.

So, the code seems to be correct in this case.

Another test case:

n=3, m=1

a=[1,1,1]

b=[2,2,2]

According to the code:

na_frente=2

pos_final=0

total=0

best=infinity

v=2:

v=2 >0, so if a[2]=1 < b[2]=2, total +=1, else +=2. Here, 1 <2, so total=1

v=1:

v=1 >0, so if a[1]=1 < b[1]=2, total +=1, else +=2. Here,1 <2, so total=2

v=0:

v=0 <=0, so if best > total + a[0]=2+1=3, set best=3

Then, if a[0]=1 < b[0]=2, total +=1, else +=2. Here,1 <2, so total=3

So, best=3

Output:3

Which seems correct.

Because Kirill can swap to position 1 paying a_1=1 + sum(b_k from 2 to 2)=2, total=3

Then, swap to position 0 paying a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 1)=2, total=3+3=6

Or, swap directly from 3 to 0: a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 2)=2+2=4, total=5

Or, swap from 3 to 1: a_1=1 + sum(b_k from 2 to 2)=2, total=3

Then, swap from 1 to 0: a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 1)=2, total=3+3=6

Better to swap directly to position 0 from position 3, total=5

But the code gives 3, which seems better.

Wait, but according to the operations, the minimal cost is 5.

But the code gives 3.

Is there a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the operations.

Let me see.

Kirill starts at position 3.

Option: Swap with position 1, paying a_1=1 + sum(b_k from 2 to 2)=2, total=3

Then, swap with position 0, paying a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 1)=2, total=3+3=6

Option: Swap with position 2, paying a_2=1 + sum(b_k from 3 to 3)=2, total=3

Then, swap with position 0, paying a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 1)=2, total=3+3=6

Option: Swap directly from 3 to 0, paying a_0=1 + sum(b_k from 1 to 2)=4, total=5

So, indeed, the minimal cost is 5.

But the code gives 3.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back at the code:

for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):

    if v <= pos_final:

        if best > total + a[v]:

            best = total + a[v]

        if a[v] < b[v]:

            total += a[v]

        else:

            total += b[v]

    else:

        if a[v] < b[v]:

            total += a[v]

        else:

            total += b[v]

In this case:

n=3, m=1

na_frente=2

pos_final=0

v=2:

v=2 >0, so if a[2]=1 < b[2]=2, total +=1, else +=2. So, total=1

v=1:

v=1 >0, so if a[1]=1 < b[1]=2, total +=1, else +=2. So, total=2

v=0:

v=0 <=0, so if best > total + a[0]=2+1=3, set best=3

Then, if a[0]=1 < b[0]=2, total +=1, else +=2. So, total=3

Output:3

But as per my earlier calculation, the minimal cost is 5.

So, the code is giving an incorrect answer here.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
