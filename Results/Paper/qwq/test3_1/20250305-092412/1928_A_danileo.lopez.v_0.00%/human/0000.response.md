Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces, possibly rotating them. The question is whether he can form a different rectangle from the original one.

First, I need to understand what it means to cut the rectangle. Since the cut must be parallel to one of the sides, that means either parallel to the length or the width. So, if I have a rectangle of size a by b, and I cut it parallel to the width, I'd be splitting the length a into two parts, say c and a - c, both being positive integers since the sides are integers. Similarly, cutting parallel to the length would split b into d and b - d.

After cutting, I have two smaller rectangles. Let's say I cut parallel to the width, so I have two rectangles of sizes c by b and (a - c) by b. Now, I can rotate these pieces any way I want and try to arrange them into a new rectangle.

The problem states that two rectangles are considered the same if they can be obtained from each other by a 90-degree rotation. So, for example, a 2x3 rectangle is the same as a 3x2 rectangle.

My task is to determine if, from the original rectangle, I can perform a cut and rearrangement to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering the above definition of sameness.

Let me look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case, the rectangle is 1x1. It's impossible to cut this into two smaller rectangles because any cut would result in at least one piece having a side of zero, which doesn't make sense for a rectangle. So, in this case, it's impossible to form another rectangle.

In the second test case, 2x1, it says that cutting it results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original. So, no new rectangle can be formed.

In the third test case, 2x6, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

In the fourth test case, 3x2, it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

In the fifth test case, 2x2, cutting it into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

In the sixth test case, 2x4, it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original.

In the seventh test case, 6x3, it seems like cutting it into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only form a 3x6 or 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

From these examples, it seems like the key is whether at least one of the dimensions is even. If either a or b is even, then it's possible to cut the rectangle in such a way that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a different rectangle.

Let me think about why this is the case.

If a is even, say a = 2k, then I can cut the rectangle into two pieces of size k by b each. Then, I can arrange these two pieces side by side to form a rectangle of size k by 2b. Since k = a/2, this new rectangle would be (a/2) by 2b, which is different from the original a by b, provided that (a/2) != b and 2b != a.

Similarly, if b is even, say b = 2m, I can cut the rectangle into two pieces of size a by m each. Then, arranging them would give me a rectangle of size 2a by m, which again should be different from the original a by b, provided that 2a != b and m != a.

Wait, but in the example where a=2 and b=1, even though a is even, it's not possible to form a new rectangle because the only possible new rectangle is 1x2, which is the same as the original 2x1.

Hmm, so there must be some additional condition.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have a rectangle of size a by b. If I cut it into two smaller rectangles, say of sizes c by b and (a - c) by b, then I can rotate these pieces and arrange them in some way to form a new rectangle.

The area of the original rectangle is a*b, and the area of the new rectangle should also be a*b since we're using all the pieces. So, the new rectangle must have dimensions x and y such that x*y = a*b, and x != a or y != b, considering the sameness by rotation.

Wait, but since 3x2 is considered the same as 2x3, I need to check if the new rectangle has dimensions that are not equal to a and b in some order.

So, to rephrase, I need to check if it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a rectangle with dimensions x and y, where x*y = a*b, and (x, y) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

Now, let's consider that when I cut the rectangle, I have two smaller rectangles, and I can rotate them. So, each smaller rectangle has some dimension p by q, and after rotation, it can be q by p.

Then, to form a new rectangle, I need to arrange these two smaller rectangles side by side or one on top of the other.

So, the possible ways to arrange them are:

1. Place them side by side horizontally, so the new width is q1 + q2, and the height is p.

2. Place them side by side vertically, so the new height is p1 + p2, and the width is q.

3. Place one on top of the other, with possible rotations.

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that after cutting, I have two rectangles, and I can rotate them. So, for each piece, I can choose its orientation.

Then, to form a new rectangle, I need to combine these two pieces in such a way that their sides match up properly.

Perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the area.

The area of the original rectangle is a*b. The area of the new rectangle must also be a*b.

So, the possible dimensions of the new rectangle are all pairs (x, y) such that x*y = a*b, and x <= y.

But, since rotations are considered the same, I only need to consider pairs where x <= y.

Now, the question is, for a given a and b, can I find a pair (x, y) with x <= y, x*y = a*b, and (x, y) != (a, b) and (x, y) != (b, a).

Wait, but in some cases, (a, b) and (b, a) might be the same pair if a == b.

So, to generalize, I need to find if there exists a pair (x, y) with x <= y, x*y = a*b, and (x, y) not equal to (min(a, b), max(a, b)).

But checking all possible divisors of a*b would be inefficient, especially since a and b can be up to 10^9, and t can be up to 10^4.

There must be a smarter way to approach this problem.

Let me think about the cutting process more carefully.

Suppose I cut the rectangle parallel to the side of length a, dividing it into two parts of lengths c and a - c, both multiplied by b.

So, the two smaller rectangles are c by b and (a - c) by b.

Similarly, if I cut parallel to the side of length b, I get a by d and a by (b - d).

Now, I can rotate these pieces, which means that for each piece, I can choose to have its dimensions as is or swapped.

Then, to form a new rectangle, I need to arrange these two pieces together.

Let's consider the case where I cut parallel to a, so I have two pieces: c by b and (a - c) by b.

If I arrange them side by side horizontally, I can have:

- Option 1: c by b and (a - c) by b placed horizontally next to each other, giving a new rectangle of (c + (a - c)) by b, which is a by b, same as the original.

- Option 2: c by b and (a - c) by b placed vertically one on top of the other, giving a new rectangle of max(c, a - c) by 2b.

Wait, no. If I place them vertically, I need to consider the orientations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of combining the areas.

Suppose I have two rectangles, with areas area1 and area2, where area1 + area2 = a*b.

I can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: a and b are both odd.

In this case, a*b is odd.

If I cut the rectangle parallel to a, into c by b and (a - c) by b, then c and a - c cannot both be even because a is odd.

Similarly, if I cut parallel to b, into a by d and a by (b - d), then d and b - d cannot both be even because b is odd.

In either case, at least one of the smaller rectangles will have at least one odd side.

When trying to arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle, the total area is a*b, which is odd.

But since both dimensions of the new rectangle must be integers, and their product is odd, both dimensions must be odd.

But the only possible new rectangle would have dimensions that are factors of a*b, both odd.

However, since a and b are both odd, the only possible rectangles are those whose dimensions are odd factors of a*b.

But in this case, any such rectangle would be equivalent to the original one or another rectangle with odd sides.

But the problem is to determine if I can form a different rectangle, not necessarily a new one.

Wait, perhaps in this case, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.

Looking back at the examples, in the case where a=1 and b=1, it's impossible to form another rectangle.

In the case where a=2 and b=1, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.

In the case where a=2 and b=6, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the case where both a and b are odd, it seems impossible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider a=3 and b=3.

If I cut it into two pieces, say 1x3 and 2x3.

Then, I can rotate the 1x3 to be 3x1, and the 2x3 remains 2x3.

Now, I can arrange them side by side horizontally: 3x1 and 3x2, arranged horizontally would give a rectangle of 3x(1+2)=3x3, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, arranging them vertically: max(3,3)=3 by 1+3=4, which would be a 3x4 rectangle.

But 3x4 is different from 3x3, so in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the initial thought that when both a and b are odd, it's impossible, but in this case, a=3 and b=3, and it seems possible to form a 3x4 rectangle.

Wait, but 3x4 has an area of 12, while the original rectangle has an area of 9. That can't be right.

Wait, no, the area must be the same. Wait, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, no, the area must be the same, which is a*b=9.

Wait, but 3x4 has area 12, which is different from 9.

So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

I think the mistake is that I can't arrange a 3x1 and a 3x2 to form a 3x4 rectangle because the areas don't match.

Wait, 3x1 has area 3, and 3x2 has area 6, total area 9.

If I arrange them side by side horizontally, I get a rectangle of width 1+2=3 and height 3, which is 3x3, same as the original.

If I arrange them vertically, I get a rectangle of width 3 and height 1+2=3, which is again 3x3.

So, in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it was possible to form a 3x4 rectangle, but that doesn't make sense because the areas don't match.

Maybe I misread the example.

Wait, in the fourth test case, 3x2, it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original.

Wait, but 3x1 and 3x1, both having area 3 each, total area 6, which is less than the original area of 6. Wait, 3x2 has area 6, and two 3x1 have area 3 each, total area 6.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives a 3x2 rectangle, same as the original.

Arranging them vertically gives a 3x2 rectangle again.

Wait, but the example says that from 3x2, it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and from these, the 1x6 rectangle can be formed.

Wait, how is that possible? Two 3x1 rectangles have area 3 each.

To form a 1x6 rectangle, which has area 6, I need to arrange them in some way.

If I rotate one of them to 1x3 and the other to 1x3, then placing them side by side horizontally gives a 1x(3+3)=1x6 rectangle.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this case, from two 3x1 rectangles, by rotating them to 1x3, I can place them side by side to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, 2x2, cutting into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

Wait, but 1x2 and 1x2, both rotated to 2x1, placing them side by side horizontally gives a 2x2 rectangle, same as the original.

Alternatively, placing them side by side vertically gives a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the case where a and b are both odd, like 3x3, as I thought earlier, it seems impossible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but let's confirm.

In the seventh test case, 6x3, it says that cutting it into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only form a 3x6 or 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but 6x3 has a area of 18.

Cutting into two 3x3 rectangles, each with area 9.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3.

Arranging them vertically gives a 6x3 rectangle, again the same.

So, in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but what if I rotate one of them?

If I rotate one 3x3 to become 3x3, and the other remains 3x3, arranging them side by side horizontally still gives 3x6, which is the same as 6x3.

So, in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Therefore, it seems that when both a and b are odd, it's impossible to form a different rectangle.

When at least one of them is even, it's possible.

Looking back at the examples:

- 1x1: both odd, cannot form a different rectangle.

- 2x1: one even, but in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, if at least one is even, it's possible, but in this case, it's not possible.

Hmm, so maybe there's an exception.

Wait, in the second test case, 2x1, it's possible to cut into two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, in this case, even though one dimension is even, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

This contradicts my earlier thought.

So, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Maybe the condition is that both a and b need to be greater than 1, and at least one of them is even.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, 2x2, which is possible, and both are even.

In the third test case, 2x6, which is possible, with both even.

In the fourth test case, 3x2, which is possible, with one even.

In the sixth test case, 2x4, which is possible, with both even.

In the seventh test case, 6x3, which is not possible, but one is even and one is odd, but according to the output, it's "No", meaning it's not possible.

Wait, but according to the output, it's "No", meaning it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's said that it can be cut into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only form the same rectangle as the original.

Wait, but 6x3 can be cut in another way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible cuts.

For 6x3, if I cut it into two 3x3 rectangles, then I can only form the same rectangle.

But if I cut it differently, say cut the 6x3 into two 2x3 rectangles, then I can arrange them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3.

Wait, but 6x3 has area 18, and two 2x3 rectangles have area 6 each, total area 12, which is less than 18. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, 2x3 has area 6, two of them have area 12, which is less than 18. So, that can't form a rectangle of area 18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, two 2x3 rectangles have total area 12, which is less than the original area of 18. So, I must have made a mistake in thinking that.

Alternatively, maybe I can cut the 6x3 into two rectangles in another way.

For example, cut the 6x3 into a 4x3 and a 2x3 rectangle.

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally gives a 4x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x4, which might be considered different from the original 6x3.

But according to the problem, 6x4 is different from 6x3.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

So, 6x4 and 4x6 are considered the same, but 6x3 and 3x6 are also considered the same.

But 6x4 is different from 6x3.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, the output is "No", meaning it's not possible to form a different rectangle from the 6x3.

But according to my previous thought, if I cut it into a 4x3 and a 2x3, and arrange them side by side horizontally to form a 4x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3.

But perhaps there's a mistake in this approach.

Wait, if I cut the 6x3 into a 4x3 and a 2x3, and arrange them side by side horizontally, I get a rectangle of width 4 + 2 = 6 and height 3, which is the same as the original 6x3.

Alternatively, arranging them vertically, I get a rectangle of width 3 and height 4 + 3 = 7, which is 3x7, which is different from the original 6x3.

But is 3x7 considered different from 6x3?

Well, 3x7 and 6x3 are different rectangles since 3*7=21 and 6*3=18, so their areas are different.

Wait, that can't be right because the total area should be the same.

Wait, two pieces with areas 12 and 6 should be arranged to form a rectangle of area 18.

If I arrange a 4x3 (area 12) and a 2x3 (area 6) side by side horizontally, I get a 6x3 rectangle (area 18), same as the original.

If I arrange them vertically, I get a 3x7 rectangle (area 21), which is incorrect because the areas don't match.

So, there must be an error in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I can't arrange them in a way that changes the total area.

So, maybe it's not possible to form a different rectangle from the 6x3.

But according to the earlier thought, if at least one dimension is even, it should be possible, but in this case, it seems not.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a rectangle a x b, if at least one of a or b is even, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

But in the second test case, 2x1, which has one even dimension, but it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's "No", meaning it's not possible.

Similarly, in the seventh test case, 6x3, which has one even dimension, but it's "No", meaning not possible.

Wait, but in other cases like 2x6, 3x2, 2x4, it's "Yes", meaning possible.

So, perhaps the condition is that both a and b are greater than 1, and at least one of them is even.

But in the fifth test case, 2x2, which is "Yes", meaning possible.

Wait, but 2x2 has both dimensions even, and it's possible.

In the second test case, 2x1, which has one even dimension, but it's "No".

So, perhaps the condition is that both a and b are greater than 1, and at least one of them is even.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, 2x2, both are greater than 1 and even, and it's "Yes".

In the fourth test case, 3x2, both are greater than 1, and one is even, it's "Yes".

In the third test case, 2x6, both are greater than 1, and both are even, it's "Yes".

In the sixth test case, 2x4, both are greater than 1, both are even, it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, 6x3, both are greater than 1, one is even, but it's "No".

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the seventh test case, 6x3, it's "No".

But according to the earlier thought, it should be "Yes".

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, in the seventh test case, 6x3, if I cut it into two 3x3 rectangles, and arrange them side by side horizontally, I get a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3.

If I arrange them vertically, I get a 6x3 rectangle, again the same.

Alternatively, if I cut it differently, say cut it into two 2x3 rectangles, then arrange them side by side horizontally to get a 2x9 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3.

Wait, but 2x9 has area 18, same as 6x3.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a different rectangle.

But according to the sample output, it's "No".

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in some cases, even if you can cut into pieces that can form a different rectangle, it's not considered different if it's the same up to rotation.

Wait, but 2x9 and 9x2 are considered the same.

Similarly, 6x3 and 3x6 are considered the same.

So, in the seventh test case, 6x3, if I can form a 2x9 rectangle, which is the same as 9x2, and that's different from 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", meaning it's not possible.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the condition is that if both a and b are greater than 1, and at least one of them is even, then it's possible, except for some specific cases like 2x1 and 6x3.

But this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that both a and b are greater than 1, and at least one of them is even, and neither a nor b is 1.

But in the second test case, 2x1, which has one even dimension, but it's "No".

Similarly, in the seventh test case, 6x3, which has one even dimension, but it's "No".

Wait, but in the third test case, 2x6, which has one even dimension, it's "Yes".

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If GCD(a, b) > 1, then perhaps it's possible.

But in the second test case, 2x1, GCD is 1, and it's "No".

In the fifth test case, 2x2, GCD is 2, and it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, 6x3, GCD is 3, and it's "No".

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the ratio of a to b.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me think about the area again.

The area is a*b.

After cutting into two smaller rectangles, their areas sum to a*b.

Then, rearranging them to form a new rectangle, also with area a*b.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions x and y such that x*y = a*b.

Now, the question is whether there exists a pair (x, y) with x*y = a*b, and (x, y) != (a, b) and (x, y) != (b, a).

But considering that rotations are considered the same, so (x, y) is considered the same as (y, x).

So, the condition is that there exists a pair (x, y) with x*y = a*b, x <= y, and (x, y) != (min(a, b), max(a, b)).

Now, to check if such a pair exists, I need to check if a*b has more than one pair of factors.

But for any a*b, if a*b is not a prime number, it has multiple factor pairs.

But a*b can be up to 10^18, which is too large to factorize for each test case.

So, this approach is not feasible.

Perhaps there's a simpler condition based on a and b.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If a and b are both powers of the same number, maybe.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a and b share a common factor.

But in the fifth test case, 2x2, which shares a common factor, and it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, 6x3, which shares a common factor, and it's "No".

Wait, no, 6 and 3 share a common factor of 3, but according to the sample output, it's "No".

Wait, but in the seventh test case, it's "No", but according to my earlier thought, it should be "Yes".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a and b are both greater than 1, and at least one of them is even, and a is not equal to b.

But in the fifth test case, 2x2, a equals b, and it's "Yes".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe the condition is that a and b are both greater than 1, and at least one of them is even, and a != b.

But in the fifth test case, a = b = 2, and it's "Yes".

So, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe it's that a*b is even.

In the second test case, a=2 and b=1, a*b=2, which is even, but it's "No".

In the third test case, a=2 and b=6, a*b=12, which is even, and it's "Yes".

In the fourth test case, a=3 and b=2, a*b=6, even, "Yes".

In the fifth test case, a=2 and b=2, a*b=4, even, "Yes".

In the sixth test case, a=2 and b=4, a*b=8, even, "Yes".

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, a*b=18, even, but it's "No".

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

So, a*b being even isn't sufficient.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, a*b=18 is even, but it's "No".

So, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, maybe it's that a*b is even, and a and b are not both odd.

But in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, which are not both odd, a*b even, but it's "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a or b is divisible by 4.

Wait, in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, neither is divisible by 4, and it's "No".

In the third test case, a=2 and b=6, a is 2 (not divisible by 4), b is 6 (not divisible by 4), but it's "Yes".

Wait, no, 6 is divisible by 2 but not by 4.

So, that doesn't seem to be the condition.

Wait, maybe it's that a or b is even, and a or b is greater than 2.

But in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, a is even and greater than 2, but it's "No".

Wait, a=2 is equal to 2, not greater than 2.

Wait, 2 is equal to 2.

So, perhaps a or b is even and greater than 2.

In the second test case, a=2 and b=1, a is even and equal to 2, but it's "No".

In the fifth test case, a=2 and b=2, a is even and equal to 2, but it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, a is even and greater than 2, but it's "No".

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting confused here.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the number of ways to factor a*b must be more than one unique pair (considering rotations).

The number of unique pairs (x, y) with x <= y and x*y = a*b is equal to the number of divisors of a*b divided by 2, rounded up.

But calculating this for each test case is not efficient.

Perhaps there's a mathematical condition based on a and b that can determine if there exists another pair (x, y) != (a, b) and (b, a) such that x*y = a*b.

Wait, mathematically, if a*b has more than two divisors, then there exists another pair.

But a*b always has more than two divisors if it's not prime.

But a*b is the product of two integers greater than 1, so it's at least 4, which has three divisors: 1, 2, 4.

So, a*b always has more than two divisors, except when a*b is prime, but since a and b are at least 1, and at least one is greater than 1, a*b is at least 2, but a*b can be prime only if one of a or b is 1 and the other is prime.

But in such cases, like a=1 and b=prime, then a*b is prime, but in the problem, a and b are at least 1, and in the sample input, 1x1 is "No", and 2x1 is "No".

So, perhaps the condition is that a*b is not prime, but in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, a*b=2, which is prime, and it's "No".

In the fifth test case, a=2 and b=2, a*b=4, which is not prime, and it's "Yes".

So, perhaps it's that a*b is not prime, but in the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, a*b=18, which is not prime, but it's "No".

Wait, that doesn't hold.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a rectangle of size a x b.

I cut it into two smaller rectangles.

Let's say I cut it parallel to a, so I have two rectangles of c x b and (a - c) x b.

Similarly, cutting parallel to b gives two rectangles of a x d and a x (b - d).

Then, I can rotate these pieces, meaning I can have c x b become b x c, and (a - c) x b become b x (a - c), and similarly for the other case.

Now, to form a new rectangle, I need to arrange these two pieces together to form a rectangle of some size x x y, where x*y = a*b.

The way to arrange two rectangles to form a new rectangle is by placing them side by side or one on top of the other.

So, if I have two rectangles of sizes p x q and r x s, I need to arrange them in such a way that their sides match properly.

But this seems too general.

Perhaps I need to consider that both pieces have one side in common after rotation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possible dimensions of the new rectangle based on the cuts.

Let's consider cutting parallel to a, into c x b and (a - c) x b.

After rotation, these can be b x c and b x (a - c).

Now, arranging them side by side horizontally would give a rectangle of width c + (a - c) = a and height b, which is the same as the original.

Arranging them vertically would give a rectangle of width b and height c + (a - c) = a, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, if I rotate one of them, say b x c and (a - c) x b, arranging them side by side horizontally would give a rectangle of width c + b and height whatever, but it's not clear.

This seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider the least common multiple or something related to the dimensions.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether a and b share a common factor greater than 1.

But in the fifth test case, a=2 and b=2, which share a common factor of 2, and it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, which share a common factor of 3, and according to the sample output, it's "No".

Wait, but in the seventh test case, it's "No", but according to the earlier thought, it should be "Yes".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the ratio of a to b.

If a and b are not relatively prime, then perhaps it's possible.

But in the seventh test case, GCD(6,3)=3, which is greater than 1, and it's "No".

This is getting too confusing.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Looking at this, it seems that when at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for the case when a=2 and b=1, and when a=6 and b=3, it's "No".

So, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, and neither a nor b is 1.

But in the fifth test case, a=2 and b=2, which fits this condition, and it's "Yes".

In the fourth test case, a=3 and b=2, which fits this condition, and it's "Yes".

In the third test case, a=2 and b=6, which fits this condition, and it's "Yes".

In the sixth test case, a=2 and b=4, which fits this condition, and it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, which fits this condition, but it's "No".

So, this doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's that a and b are both even, or one is even and greater than 2.

But in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, which has one even dimension, but it's "No".

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, which has one even dimension, but it's "No".

This is really confusing.

Perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is incorrect and look for an alternative way to think about the problem.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the cutting and rearrangement must allow for a change in the aspect ratio.

So, if I can cut and rearrange to form a rectangle with different dimensions up to rotation, then it's possible.

But I need a mathematical condition to determine this efficiently.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps it's related to whether the rectangle can be tiled in more than one way.

But that seems too broad.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on whether a or b is divisible by 4.

Wait, in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, a is divisible by 2 but not by 4, and it's "No".

In the third test case, a=2 and b=6, a is 2 (not divisible by 4), b is 6 (not divisible by 4), and it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, a is 6 (not divisible by 4), b is 3 (not divisible by 4), and it's "No".

So, that doesn't seem to be the condition.

Wait, maybe it's that a or b is divisible by 4, or both are even.

But in the third test case, neither a nor b is divisible by 4, but it's "Yes".

In the seventh test case, a=6 is divisible by 2 but not by 4, b=3 is odd, and it's "No".

This is getting too tangled.

Perhaps I need to accept that my approach is incorrect and consider that the condition is simply that at least one of a or b is even, except for the case when one of them is 1.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: both odd, "No"

- 2x1: one even, but "No"

- 2x6: one even, "Yes"

- 3x2: one even, "Yes"

- 2x2: both even, "Yes"

- 2x4: both even, "Yes"

- 6x3: one even, "No"

So, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, and a*b is not a multiple of the square of the GCD of a and b.

Wait, that seems too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's that a and b are not co-prime, but in the seventh test case, GCD(6,3)=3, which is greater than 1, and it's "No".

This is really confusing.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should just implement the condition that if at least one of a or b is even, then output "Yes", except for the cases where a=1 or b=1, in which case output "No".

But in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, which would be "No", as per the sample.

In the seventh test case, a=6 and b=3, which would be "Yes", but according to the sample, it's "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's that a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is greater than 1.

But in the seventh test case, a=6 (even) and b=3 (odd and greater than 1), and it's "No".

So, that doesn't work.

I'm stuck.

Perhaps I need to look for a different pattern.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the cutting must allow for rearrangement into a rectangle with different dimensions.

So, perhaps the condition is that a and b share a common factor greater than 1, but in the seventh test case, they do share a common factor of 3, and it's "No".

Wait, but according to the sample, it's "No", meaning it's not possible.

So, perhaps it's that a and b share a common factor greater than 1, and a and b are both greater than that factor.

But I'm not sure.

This is really tricky.

Given the time I've spent on this, I think I'll go with the initial thought that if at least one of a or b is even, then it's "Yes", else "No".

This seems to match most of the sample inputs, except for the second and seventh test cases, but perhaps there's an exception for a=1.

But in the second test case, a=2 and b=1, which has one even, but it's "No", which contradicts this approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's that both a and b are even, or one is even and the other is greater than 1.

But in the seventh test case, a=6 (even) and b=3 (odd and greater than 1), and it's "No".

This is really confusing.

I think I need to accept that my approach is flawed and look for an alternative method.

Perhaps the condition is based on whether a and b are both perfect squares.

But in the fifth test case, a=2 and b=2, which are not perfect squares, and it's "Yes".

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the parity of a and b.

If both a and b are odd, it's "No"; otherwise, it's "Yes", except for some cases.

But in the seventh test case, a=6 (even) and b=3 (odd), and it's "No".

So, that doesn't hold.

Given this confusion, perhaps the initial program is correct, and I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Looking back at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

This program checks if at least one of a or b is even, and if so, prints "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

Sample Input:

7

1 1 -> Both odd -> No

2 1 -> a even -> Yes
