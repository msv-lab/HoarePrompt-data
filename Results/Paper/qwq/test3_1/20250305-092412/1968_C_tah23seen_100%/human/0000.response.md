Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements from a_1 to a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}.

And I need to find any such array a that meets these conditions.

First, I need to understand what x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} means. The modulo operation gives the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}. So, x_i is the remainder of a_i divided by a_{i-1}.

I need to find values for a_1 to a_n such that this condition holds for each i from 2 to n.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to choose a_1 arbitrarily within the range, and then determine the other a_i based on the x_i values.

But that might not be straightforward. Maybe there's a better way to relate a_i and a_{i-1} given x_i.

Let's consider the relationship a_i â‰¡ x_i (mod a_{i-1}). This means that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer greater than or equal to zero.

My goal is to choose k such that a_i stays within the range [1, 10^9].

But since a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9 and x_i up to 500, a_i could easily exceed 10^9 if k is too large.

To keep a_i within bounds, I need to choose k appropriately.

Perhaps I can choose the smallest possible k that keeps a_i within the range.

Wait, but a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, and x_i up to 500, so if a_{i-1} is large, even k=0 might keep a_i within bounds.

But I need to ensure that a_i is at least x_i, since a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, and a_i >= x_i.

Also, a_i should be less than or equal to 10^9.

So, for each i from 2 to n, given a_{i-1} and x_i, I need to find a_i such that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is chosen such that a_i <= 10^9 and a_i >= x_i.

I think the smallest possible a_i is x_i (when k=0), and the largest possible a_i is the largest multiple of a_{i-1} that, when added to x_i, doesn't exceed 10^9.

But maybe choosing a_i as small as possible is better to minimize the values.

But I need to make sure that for subsequent elements, the a_i values still satisfy the conditions.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look at the example provided:

Input:

5

4

2 4 1

Output:

3 5 4 9

Let's verify this:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Check x_2 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which matches.

x_3 = 4 mod 5 = 4, which matches.

x_4 = 9 mod 4 = 1, which matches.

So, in this case, a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Another example:

Input:

3

1 1

Output:

2 5 11

Check:

a = [2,5,11]

x_2 = 5 mod 2 = 1, matches.

x_3 = 11 mod 5 = 1, matches.

So, in this case, a_1=2, a_2=5, a_3=11.

Looking at these examples, it seems like a_i is being chosen such that a_i is greater than x_i, and a_i is congruent to x_i modulo a_{i-1}.

Wait, in the first example, a_3=4, which is greater than x_3=4. But in the second example, a_3=11, which is greater than x_3=1.

Wait, but in the first example, a_3=4 and x_3=4, so 4 mod 5 =4, which is valid.

So, sometimes a_i can be equal to x_i, and sometimes greater.

But I need a general approach.

Maybe I can start from the end and work backwards.

Let's consider the last element.

For i=n, x_n = a_n mod a_{n-1}.

So, a_n = k * a_{n-1} + x_n for some integer k >=0.

I can choose k to be 0, which gives a_n = x_n, but a_n needs to be at least x_n.

Wait, but x_n = a_n mod a_{n-1}, so a_n could be x_n, a_{n-1} + x_n, 2*a_{n-1} + x_n, etc.

To minimize a_n, I can set a_n = x_n.

But then, x_n = x_n mod a_{n-1}.

This implies that x_n < a_{n-1}, because if x_n >= a_{n-1}, then x_n mod a_{n-1} would be x_n - a_{n-1}, which is not equal to x_n.

Wait, no.

Actually, x_n = a_n mod a_{n-1}.

If a_n = x_n, then x_n mod a_{n-1} should equal x_n, which happens only if x_n < a_{n-1}.

So, for a_n = x_n to be valid, x_n < a_{n-1} must hold.

If x_n >= a_{n-1}, then a_n cannot be x_n, because x_n mod a_{n-1} would be x_n - a_{n-1}, which is not equal to x_n.

Wait, no.

Actually, if a_n = x_n and x_n >= a_{n-1}, then x_n mod a_{n-1} = x_n - a_{n-1} * floor(x_n / a_{n-1}).

But in this case, since a_n = x_n, and x_n >= a_{n-1}, then x_n mod a_{n-1} = x_n - a_{n-1} * floor(x_n / a_{n-1}).

But we need this to be equal to x_n, which only happens if floor(x_n / a_{n-1}) = 0, meaning x_n < a_{n-1}, which contradicts x_n >= a_{n-1}.

So, if x_n >= a_{n-1}, then a_n cannot be x_n.

Instead, a_n must be a_{n-1} + x_n, or 2*a_{n-1} + x_n, etc.

So, in general, a_n = k * a_{n-1} + x_n for some integer k >=0, chosen such that a_n <= 10^9.

But I need to choose a_{n-1} first, which depends on a_{n-2}, and so on.

This seems recursive.

Maybe I should start from the beginning, setting a_1 to some value, and then determine a_2 based on x_2 and a_1, and so on.

But that might not work because a_2 depends on a_1, a_3 depends on a_2, and so forth.

Alternatively, maybe I can set a_1 to a certain value and then see what a_2 should be, and so on, adjusting as I go.

But that might be too time-consuming, especially since n can be up to 500 and t up to 10^4.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider setting a_1 to a large value, say 10^9, and then determine the other a_i accordingly.

Wait, but a_1 is the base for the modulo operations for a_2 onwards.

If a_1 is large, then a_2 can be up to a_1 -1, since a_2 mod a_1 = x_2, which implies 0 <= x_2 < a_1.

Similarly, a_3 mod a_2 = x_3, so a_3 can be up to a_2 -1, and so on.

But I need to ensure that a_i are within 1 to 10^9.

Wait, but in the given program, it sets a_1 to 10^9, and then for each previous a_i, it sets a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i.

Wait, that seems problematic.

Let's look at the provided program:

def func_1(arr, n):

ans = [10 ** 9] * n

i = n - 2

while i >= 0:

ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]

i -= 1

return ans

So, it sets a_1 to 10^9, and then for each a_i from n-1 down to 1, it sets a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i.

Wait, is this correct?

Let's see.

Given that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}.

But in this approach, it's setting a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i.

I'm not sure if this makes sense.

Let me check with the first example.

In the first example, n=4, x=[2,4,1]

So, ans = [1000000000, ans[1], ans[2], ans[3]]

Then, i=2 (ans[3]=1000000000), set ans[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999

Then i=1, ans[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995

Then i=0, ans[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993

So, a = [999999993,999999995,999999999,1000000000]

But in the sample output, it's [3,5,4,9]. Which is different.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple possible a arrays that satisfy the conditions.

But I need to check if the approach in the given program is correct.

Wait, but in the given program, it sets a_n to 10^9, and then for each previous a_i, it sets a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i.

But is this guaranteed to satisfy a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i?

Let's check with the first example.

Given a = [999999993,999999995,999999999,1000000000]

Check x_2 = a_2 mod a_1 = 999999995 mod 999999993 = 2, which matches x_2=2.

x_3 = a_3 mod a_2 = 999999999 mod 999999995 = 4, which matches x_3=4.

x_4 = a_4 mod a_3 = 1000000000 mod 999999999 = 1, which matches x_4=1.

So, in this case, it works.

Another sample input:

3

1 1

According to the program:

n=3, x=[1,1]

ans = [1000000000, ans[1], ans[2]]

i=1, ans[1] = 1000000000 -1 =999999999

i=0, ans[0] =999999999 -1 =999999998

So, a=[999999998,999999999,1000000000]

Check:

x_2=999999999 mod 999999998 =1, matches x_2=1

x_3=1000000000 mod 999999999=1, matches x_3=1

So, it works for this case too.

But is this approach always correct?

Let me try to see why this works.

Given that a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i

Then, a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i

So, a_{i+1} mod a_i = x_i

Wait, but a_{i+1} mod a_i = x_i only if a_{i+1} >= a_i, and a_{i+1} - floor(a_{i+1}/a_i)*a_i = x_i

But in this approach, a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i, so a_{i+1} mod a_i = (a_i + x_i) mod a_i = x_i, which matches.

So, as long as a_{i+1} >= a_i, this holds.

But in this approach, a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i, which is greater than a_i, since x_i >=1.

Therefore, a_{i+1} mod a_i = x_i.

So, this seems to work.

But I need to ensure that a_i >=1 for all i.

Given that a_n =10^9, and a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i, and x_i >=1, and a_{i+1} >=1, then a_i >=0.

Wait, but a_i needs to be at least 1.

In the approach, a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i.

If a_{i+1} - x_i <1, then a_i would be less than 1, which is invalid.

So, I need to ensure that a_{i+1} - x_i >=1, i.e., a_{i+1} >= x_i +1.

But in this approach, a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i, so a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i >= x_i +1, since a_i >=1.

Wait, but in this specific approach, a_{i+1} = a_i + x_i, and a_i >=1, so a_{i+1} >=1 +x_i.

Therefore, a_{i+1} -x_i = a_i >=1, which is fine.

So, as long as a_n >=x_{n} +1, which in this case a_n=10^9 and x_n <=500, so 10^9 >=500 +1, which is true, it holds.

Therefore, this approach seems correct.

Another way to think about it is that by setting a_i = a_{i+1} -x_i, and starting from a_n=10^9, which is large enough, and working backwards, we ensure that each a_i is positive and satisfies a_{i+1} mod a_i =x_i.

Because a_{i+1} = a_i +x_i, so a_{i+1} mod a_i =x_i.

Hence, this approach seems valid.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Yes}} \]
