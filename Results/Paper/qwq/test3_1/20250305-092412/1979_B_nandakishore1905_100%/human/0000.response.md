Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two distinct non-negative integers, x and y. I need to consider two infinite sequences, a and b, where a_n = n XOR x and b_n = n XOR y. I need to find the length of the longest common subsegment between these two sequences.

First, I need to understand what a subsegment is. A subsegment is a consecutive sequence of elements from the original sequence. So, unlike a substring, the elements have to be consecutive in the sequence.

Given that both sequences are infinite, I can't generate the entire sequences. I need a smarter way to find the longest common subsegment.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. It's commutative and associative, which might be useful here.

So, a_n = n XOR x and b_n = n XOR y.

I need to find a sequence where a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, and so on, for m consecutive elements.

Let me try to express a_i and b_j in terms of n.

Let's say a_i = i XOR x and b_j = j XOR y.

If a_i = b_j, then i XOR x = j XOR y.

Rearranging, i XOR j = x XOR y.

Let's denote d = x XOR y, which is a constant since x and y are given and distinct.

So, i XOR j = d.

Now, for the next elements in the sequences:

a_{i+1} = (i+1) XOR x

b_{j+1} = (j+1) XOR y

We need a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, which means (i+1) XOR x = (j+1) XOR y.

Again, rearranging, (i+1) XOR (j+1) = x XOR y = d.

But (i+1) XOR (j+1) = i XOR j XOR 1 XOR 1 = i XOR j, because 1 XOR 1 is 0.

So, i XOR j = d, which we already have from the first equality.

This suggests that if a_i = b_j, then a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, and this pattern continues for all subsequent elements.

Wait, that can't be right because otherwise, the sequences would be identical from that point onward, but they're not, since x and y are distinct.

Let me check this with an example.

Take x = 0 and y = 1.

Then, a_n = n XOR 0 = n

b_n = n XOR 1 = n + 1 (if n is even), or n - 1 (if n is odd).

Wait, no, n XOR 1 flips the least significant bit.

So, for n = 0: a_1 = 1, b_1 = 0

n = 1: a_2 = 3, b_2 = 1

n = 2: a_3 = 2, b_3 = 3

n = 3: a_4 = 0, b_4 = 2

n = 4: a_5 = 5, b_5 = 4

n = 5: a_6 = 4, b_6 = 5

n = 6: a_7 = 7, b_7 = 6

n = 7: a_8 = 6, b_8 = 7

Looking for common subsegments:

Looking at a: [1,3,2,0,5,4,7,6,...]

b: [0,1,3,2,4,5,6,7,...]

Possible subsegments:

- [1] appears in both

- [3,2] appears in both

- [0] appears in both

- [5,4] appears in both

- [7,6] appears in both

- [6,7] appears in both

But longer subsegments don't seem to appear. According to the sample input, for x=0 and y=1, the answer is 1, meaning no common subsegment longer than 1 exists.

Wait, but [3,2] is a common subsegment of length 2. But according to the sample, the answer is 1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the sequences are 1-indexed. Let's list them properly.

For x=0:

a_1 = 1 XOR 0 = 1

a_2 = 2 XOR 0 = 2

a_3 = 3 XOR 0 = 3

a_4 = 4 XOR 0 = 4

a_5 = 5 XOR 0 = 5

a_6 = 6 XOR 0 = 6

a_7 = 7 XOR 0 = 7

a_8 = 8 XOR 0 = 8

Wait, earlier I thought a_n = n XOR x, but n starts from 1.

For x=0:

a: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...]

For y=1:

b: [0 XOR 1 = 1, 1 XOR 1 = 0, 2 XOR 1 = 3, 3 XOR 1 = 2, 4 XOR 1 = 5, 5 XOR 1 = 4, 6 XOR 1 = 7, 7 XOR 1 = 6, ...]

So b: [1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,...]

Now, looking for common subsegments:

- [1] appears at a_1 and b_1

- [3,2] appears at a_3,a_4 and b_3,b_4

- [5,4] at a_5,a_6 and b_5,b_6

- [7,6] at a_7,a_8 and b_7,b_8

But no longer subsegments like [1,2,3,4], etc.

So, in this case, the longest common subsegment is of length 2, but the sample output is 1. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, sample input says:

Input:

4

0 1

12 4

57 37

316560849 14570961

Output:

1

8

4

33554432

So for x=0, y=1, output is 1, not 2. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the subsegments have to be continuous in both sequences, but not necessarily starting at the same index.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"find the maximum integer m such that a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, ..., a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1} for some i, j >=1."

So, for x=0, y=1, m=2 would require that for some i and j, a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}.

Looking at a: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...]

b: [1,0,3,2,5,4,7,6,...]

For i=1, j=1: a_1=1=b_1, a_2=2 != b_2=0

For i=1, j=3: a_1=1 != b_3=3

For i=3, j=3: a_3=3=b_3=3, a_4=4=b_4=2 -> not equal

For i=3, j=4: a_3=3 != b_4=2

For i=5, j=5: a_5=5=b_5=5, a_6=6=b_6=4 -> not equal

For i=7, j=7: a_7=7=b_7=7, a_8=8 != b_8=6

So, there are no m=2 subsegments that match. Only m=1 subsegments where a_i = b_j for some i and j.

Hence, the answer is 1, which matches the sample output.

Okay, now I see. So, in this case, m=1 is the answer.

Let me consider another sample input: x=12, y=4.

Compute a_n = n XOR 12, b_n = n XOR 4.

Let's list some elements:

a: [1 XOR 12 = 13, 2 XOR 12 = 14, 3 XOR 12 = 15, 4 XOR 12 = 8, 5 XOR 12 = 9, 6 XOR 12 = 10, 7 XOR 12 = 11, 8 XOR 12 = 4, 9 XOR 12 = 5, 10 XOR 12 = 6, 11 XOR 12 = 7, 12 XOR 12 = 0, 13 XOR 12 = 1, 14 XOR 12 = 2, 15 XOR 12 = 3, ...]

b: [1 XOR 4 = 5, 2 XOR 4 = 6, 3 XOR 4 = 7, 4 XOR 4 = 0, 5 XOR 4 = 1, 6 XOR 4 = 2, 7 XOR 4 = 3, 8 XOR 4 = 12, 9 XOR 4 = 13, 10 XOR 4 = 14, 11 XOR 4 = 15, 12 XOR 4 = 8, 13 XOR 4 = 9, 14 XOR 4 = 10, 15 XOR 4 = 11, ...]

So a: [13,14,15,8,9,10,11,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3,...]

b: [5,6,7,0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15,8,9,10,11,...]

Looking for common subsegments:

- [0,1,2,3] appears in both a and b.

- [5,6,7,0] in a and b, but not aligned in the same order.

- [13,14,15,8] in a and b, but not aligned.

- [8,9,10,11] in a and b.

But the longest common subsegment is [0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15], which has length 8, matching the sample output.

Wait, is [0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15] a subsegment in both a and b?

In a: [13,14,15,8,9,10,11,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15,...]

In b: [5,6,7,0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15,8,9,10,11,...]

So, in a, [0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15] appears starting at a_{12}.

In b, it appears starting at b_{4}.

So, m=8 is possible.

Is there a longer one? Let's see.

Looking at a: [13,14,15,8,9,10,11,4,5,6,7,0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15,...]

b: [5,6,7,0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15,8,9,10,11,...]

If I try m=9: [0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15,8]

In a, after 15 is 8, which matches in b, but in b, after 15 is 8, so it matches.

So m=9 also works. But according to the sample output, it's 8. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there is a repetition or overlap. Let's check further.

Wait, in a, after [0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15], next is 8.

In b, after [0,1,2,3,12,13,14,15], next is 8.

So, m=9 should also work, but sample output is 8. Maybe I need to confirm.

Wait, perhaps the sequences repeat every certain period, but I need to find the maximum m where such a subsegment exists.

Given that x and y are distinct, and sequences are infinite, I need a general approach.

Let me think differently.

I need to find the maximum m such that there exist i and j where a_i to a_{i+m-1} is equal to b_j to b_{j+m-1}.

Given a_n = n XOR x and b_n = n XOR y.

Let d = x XOR y.

Then, a_i = i XOR x

b_j = j XOR y

We need a_i = b_j => i XOR x = j XOR y => i XOR j = d

Similarly, a_{i+1} = (i+1) XOR x

b_{j+1} = (j+1) XOR y

We need a_{i+1} = b_{j+1} => (i+1) XOR x = (j+1) XOR y => (i+1) XOR (j+1) = d

But (i+1) XOR (j+1) = i XOR j, since (i+1) XOR (j+1) = i XOR j XOR 1 XOR 1 = i XOR j

So, i XOR j = d is sufficient for a_{i+k} = b_{j+k} for any k.

Wait, that suggests that if i XOR j = d, then a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, and so on, indefinitely.

But that can't be right because the sequences are different due to x != y.

Wait, perhaps there is a cycle or a repeating pattern based on the XOR properties.

Let me consider the difference between x and y.

Let d = x XOR y.

Then, d is the difference that shifts the sequence.

I need to find how long the sequences align when shifted by d.

But since XOR is involved, it's not a simple shift.

Let me consider the binary representations.

Suppose x and y differ in k bits.

Then, d has k bits set to 1.

I need to find the length m where the sequences a and b match for m consecutive elements for some i and j such that i XOR j = d.

This seems tricky.

Let me look for a pattern in the binary representations.

Consider that XOR is a bitwise operation, and it can be thought of as adding without carry in binary.

So, perhaps analyzing the binary representations can help.

Let me consider the binary representations of x and y.

Suppose x and y differ in their binary representations.

The key is to find how long the sequences a and b can match when shifted by d = x XOR y.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of trailing zeros in d or something similar.

Let me consider the example where x=0 and y=1.

d = 0 XOR 1 = 1

In binary, 1 is '1', which has no trailing zeros.

According to the sample, the answer is m=1.

In another example, x=12 and y=4.

12 in binary is 1100, 4 is 0100.

d = 1100 XOR 0100 = 1000, which is 8 in decimal.

8 in binary is 1000, which has 3 trailing zeros.

2^3 = 8, which matches the sample output of m=8.

Similarly, for x=57 and y=37.

57 is 111001, 37 is 100101.

d = 111001 XOR 100101 = 011100, which is 28 in decimal.

28 in binary is 11100, which has 2 trailing zeros.

2^2 = 4, matching the sample output.

Another sample: x=316560849 and y=14570961.

316560849 XOR 14570961 = ?

Let me calculate that.

But it's time-consuming to calculate that manually.

But according to the sample output, m=33554432, which is 2^25.

So, perhaps the answer is related to the highest power of 2 that divides d.

Wait, 33554432 is 2^25.

Let me check if d = x XOR y has 25 trailing zeros.

But x=316560849 and y=14570961.

I need to find d = x XOR y.

But I don't have their binary representations here.

Assuming that d has 25 trailing zeros, then 2^25 = 33554432, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the answer is the highest power of 2 that divides d, where d = x XOR y.

Wait, but in the first sample, x=0, y=1, d=1, which is 2^0=1, matching m=1.

In the second sample, d=8, which is 2^3, matching m=8.

In the third sample, d=28, which is 4 (2^2), matching m=4.

In the fourth sample, d has 25 trailing zeros, m=2^25.

So, the answer seems to be m = 2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d = x XOR y.

Wait, but d=28 is 11100 in binary, which has 2 trailing zeros, and m=4=2^2.

d=8 is 1000, which has 3 trailing zeros, m=8=2^3.

d=1 has no trailing zeros, m=1=2^0.

So, the pattern is m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in d).

But in the second sample, d=8 has 3 trailing zeros, m=8=2^3.

In the third sample, d=28 has 2 trailing zeros, m=4=2^2.

In the fourth sample, d has 25 trailing zeros, m=2^25.

So, it seems that m is equal to the highest power of 2 that divides d.

Wait, d=28 is 2^2 * 7, so highest power of 2 dividing d is 4, matching m=4.

d=8 is 2^3, m=8=2^3.

d=1 is 2^0, m=1=2^0.

So, the answer is m = the highest power of 2 that divides d = x XOR y.

But in the fourth sample, d has 25 trailing zeros, so m=2^25.

So, in general, m = 2^k, where k is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of d.

Wait, but d could have higher powers of 2 than just the trailing zeros.

For example, d=28 has 2^2, but trailing zeros are 2, so m=4.

Whereas d=8 has 2^3, trailing zeros are 3, m=8.

So, yes, m=2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d.

But I need to confirm this.

Let me consider d=28, which is 11100 in binary.

Number of trailing zeros is 2, so m=4.

But 28 divided by 4 is 7, which is odd.

Similarly, d=8 is 1000, trailing zeros=3, m=8.

d=1 is 1, trailing zeros=0, m=1.

So, the general formula seems to be m=2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d.

To find the number of trailing zeros in d, I can find the largest power of 2 that divides d.

In programming terms, I can find the greatest power of 2 that is a factor of d.

So, in code, I can find the largest power of 2, p, such that p divides d.

Then, m=p.

But how do I find that?

One way is to find the binary representation of d and count the number of trailing zeros.

In Python, I can convert d to binary using bin(d), then count the trailing zeros.

But for efficiency, especially since t can be up to 10^4 and d can be up to 2*10^9, I need an efficient way.

An efficient way is to use bit manipulation.

I can find the largest power of 2 that divides d by finding the rightmost set bit.

In other words, find the smallest k such that d & (d-1) removes the rightmost set bit.

Wait, actually, to find the number of trailing zeros in d, I can use the formula:

trailing_zeros = d & -d

This gives the rightmost set bit, which is 2^k where k is the number of trailing zeros.

Wait, in two's complement, -d is ~d + 1.

So, d & -d gives the rightmost 1-bit.

Wait, but I need the number of trailing zeros.

Wait, if d is 28, which is 11100 in binary, trailing zeros are 2.

d & -d would be 28 & -28.

-28 in two's complement is ...11100, inverted is ...00011, plus 1 is ...0100.

So, 28 & -28 = 11100 & 0100 = 100, which is 4.

So, d & -d gives 4, which is 2^2, matching m=4.

Similarly, d=8 is 1000, -8 is ...11111000, so d & -d = 1000 & 1000 = 1000, which is 8, matching m=8.

d=1 is 1, -1 is ...11111, so d & -d = 1 & 1 = 1, matching m=1.

So, in general, m = d & -d.

But in the first sample, d=1, m=1.

Second sample, d=8, m=8.

Third sample, d=28, m=4.

Fourth sample, d=unknown, but d & -d would be 2^25, matching m=2^25.

So, the answer is m = d & -d.

Wait, but in the second sample, d=8, m=8, which is d itself.

But in the third sample, d=28, m=4, which is d & -d = 4.

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, m should be 4, which is d & -d.

But in the second sample, d=8, m=8, which is d & -d=8.

So, m = d & -d.

But in the first sample, d=1, m=1, which is d & -d=1.

So, m = d & -d.

But in the second sample, d=8, m=8, which is d & -d=8.

Wait, but in the second sample, output is 8, which is m=8.

But according to the earlier analysis, m should be 2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d.

In d=8, which is 1000, trailing zeros are 3, so m=2^3=8.

In d=28, which is 11100, trailing zeros are 2, so m=2^2=4.

In d=1, trailing zeros are 0, m=2^0=1.

So, m = 2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d.

But 2^k is equal to d & -d.

Because d & -d gives the rightmost set bit, which is 2^k if d has k trailing zeros.

Wait, but in d=28, which is 11100, d & -d = 4, which is 100, which is 2^2.

Yes, it matches.

So, m = d & -d.

Hence, the solution is to compute d = x XOR y, then m = d & -d.

But looking back at the problem, the answer is not m = d & -d, but rather m = 2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d.

Wait, m = d & -d is equal to 2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros in d.

So, m = d & -d is correct.

Hence, the code should compute d = x XOR y, then m = d & -d, then output m.

But in the sample input, for x=0, y=1, d=1, m=1.

x=12, y=4, d=8, m=8.

x=57, y=37, d=28, m=4.

x=316560849, y=14570961, d=unknown, but according to sample output, m=33554432, which is 2^25.

So, assuming d has 25 trailing zeros, d & -d would be 2^25.

Hence, m = d & -d is the correct approach.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, in d=28, which is 11100 in binary, d & -d = 4, which is 100.

Similarly, d=8 is 1000, d & -d =8.

d=1 is 1, d & -d=1.

So, m = d & -d.

Hence, the code should be:

for each test case:

read x and y

d = x XOR y

m = d & -d

print m

But wait, in the first sample, m=1, which is correct.

Second sample, m=8, correct.

Third sample, m=4, correct.

Fourth sample, m=33554432, which is 2^25, correct.

Hence, this seems to be the correct solution.

But I need to make sure that m is indeed d & -d.

Alternatively, I can count the number of trailing zeros in d and compute m = 2^k, where k is the number of trailing zeros.

But d & -d gives the same result efficiently.

Hence, the code provided seems to be implementing this.

Wait, let's look at the provided code.

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

k = abs(n - m)

if k & k - 1 == 0:

print(k)

elif k % 2 != 0:

print(1)

else:

l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')

p = len(l)

q = 2 ** (p - 1)

f = k - q

while f & f - 1 != 0:

l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')

p = len(l)

q = 2 ** (p - 1)

f = f - q

print(f)

Wait, this seems more complicated than necessary.

First, it reads t, then for each test case, reads x and y, computes k = abs(x - y).

Wait, x and y are non-negative integers, and distinct.

But in the problem statement, x and y are distinct non-negative integers.

So, k = abs(x - y) is the same as d = x XOR y only if one of x or y is zero.

In general, k = abs(x - y) is not equal to d = x XOR y.

For example, x=1, y=0, k=1, d=1.

x=2, y=1, k=1, d=3.

Wait, 2 XOR 1 = 3.

So, k=1, d=3.

Hence, k != d.

So, the provided code is computing k = abs(x - y), which is not the same as d = x XOR y.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the code, it computes k = abs(x - y), then checks if k is a power of two.

If k is a power of two, it prints k.

Else, if k is odd, it prints 1.

Else, it computes something related to the binary representation of k.

But this doesn't align with the correct approach of computing d = x XOR y, then m = d & -d.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the longest common subsegment between two infinite sequences defined by \( a_n = n \oplus x \) and \( b_n = n \oplus y \), where \( \oplus \) denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the sequences**:
   - The sequences \( a \) and \( b \) are infinite, making it impractical to generate and compare them directly.
   - We need to find a way to compare segments of these sequences efficiently.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - We observe that for some indices \( i \) and \( j \), the sequences \( a \) and \( b \) might align for a certain number of consecutive elements.
   - The alignment is determined by the difference \( d = x \oplus y \).

3. **Finding the alignment**:
   - We need to find the maximum length \( m \) such that \( a_i = b_j, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, \ldots, a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1} \) for some \( i \) and \( j \).
   - This reduces to finding the largest power of 2 that divides \( d = x \oplus y \).

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - Compute \( d = x \oplus y \).
   - The required length \( m \) is the largest power of 2 that divides \( d \), which can be obtained using \( m = d \& -d \).

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        d = x ^ y
        m = d & -d
        print(m)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the integers \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Compute XOR**:
   - Calculate \( d = x \oplus y \).

3. **Find the Largest Power of 2**:
   - Compute \( m = d \& -d \), which isolates the rightmost set bit in \( d \). This value is the largest power of 2 that divides \( d \).

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the value of \( m \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required length of the longest common subsegment by leveraging bitwise operations, making it both optimal and straightforward.
