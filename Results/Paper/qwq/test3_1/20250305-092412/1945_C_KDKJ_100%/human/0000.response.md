Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference: they want to live on either the left side (0) or the right side (1). This preference is given in a sequence a1 to an, where each aj is either 0 or 1.

The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. If the road is built between house i and i+1, then houses 1 to i are on the left side, and houses i+1 to n are on the right side.

The goal is to choose the position for the road such that:

1. At least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side.

2. The road is as close as possible to the middle of the village.

3. If there are multiple positions that satisfy the above conditions, choose the one with the smallest i.

First, I need to make sure I understand the satisfaction condition correctly. For the left side, which includes houses 1 to i, at least ceil(i/2) residents should want to live on the left side (i.e., have aj = 0). Similarly, for the right side, which includes houses i+1 to n, at least ceil((n-i)/2) residents should want to live on the right side (i.e., have aj = 1).

Ceil function means that for any integer x, ceil(x/2) is (x//2) if x is even, and (x//2)+1 if x is odd.

So, for the left side with i houses, the number of residents who want to live on the left (aj = 0) should be at least ceil(i/2).

Similarly, for the right side with (n-i) houses, the number of residents who want to live on the right (aj = 1) should be at least ceil((n-i)/2).

I need to find the position i where the road should be built to satisfy these conditions, and among all such positions, choose the one where |n/2 - i| is minimized. If there are multiple such positions with the same |n/2 - i|, choose the smallest i.

The input consists of multiple test cases, and for each test case, I need to output the position i after which the road should be built. If the road should be built before the first house, output 0.

Constraints:

- Number of test cases t ≤ 2*10^4

- For each test case, 3 ≤ n ≤ 3*10^5

- Total sum of n over all test cases ≤ 3*10^5

Input format:

- First line: t

- For each test case:

- First line: n

- Second line: string a of length n consisting of 0s and 1s

Output format:

- For each test case, output a single number i (0 ≤ i ≤ n-1), the position after which the road should be built.

Given that the answer always exists, I don't need to worry about cases where no such i exists.

Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to preprocess the counts of 0s and 1s up to each position to make it efficient to calculate the number of satisfied residents on each side.

I can create prefix sums for the number of 0s and 1s.

Let's define:

- left_zeros[i]: number of 0s in houses 1 to i

- left_ones[i]: number of 1s in houses 1 to i

- right_zeros[i]: number of 0s in houses i+1 to n

- right_ones[i]: number of 1s in houses i+1 to n

But since the total number of 0s and 1s is known, I can compute right_zeros and right_ones from the total minus left_zeros and left_ones.

Wait, actually, since the road can be built before the first house or after the last house, I need to consider i from 0 to n.

So, for i from 0 to n:

- Left side: houses 1 to i

- Right side: houses i+1 to n

For i = 0:

- Left side: 0 houses

- Right side: n houses

For i = n:

- Left side: n houses

- Right side: 0 houses

I need to iterate through all possible i from 0 to n and check the conditions.

But with n up to 3*10^5 and t up to 2*10^4, and total sum of n over all test cases up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) per test case.

Let's think about how to compute the number of satisfied residents on each side efficiently.

For the left side (houses 1 to i):

- Number of residents who want to live on the left: left_zeros[i]

- Total residents on left: i

- Condition: left_zeros[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

Similarly, for the right side (houses i+1 to n):

- Number of residents who want to live on the right: right_ones[i]

- Total residents on right: n - i

- Condition: right_ones[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

I can precompute prefix sums for the number of 0s and 1s.

Let's define:

- prefix_zeros[j]: number of 0s in houses 1 to j

- prefix_ones[j]: number of 1s in houses 1 to j

Then:

- left_zeros[i] = prefix_zeros[i]

- left_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i]

- right_zeros[i] = total_zeros - prefix_zeros[i]

- right_ones[i] = total_ones - prefix_ones[i]

Where total_zeros and total_ones are the total number of 0s and 1s in the entire sequence.

But actually, since the road divides the village into two parts, and I need to check the conditions for each part, I need to make sure that for each i, the left side has at least ceil(i / 2) zeros, and the right side has at least ceil((n - i) / 2) ones.

I need to find all i where both conditions are satisfied, and among those i, choose the one with the smallest |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

First, I need to iterate through all possible i from 0 to n and check the conditions.

But since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 2*10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5, it should be manageable.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient and doesn't exceed time limits.

Let's think about how to compute ceil(i / 2).

Ceil(i / 2) is equal to (i + 1) // 2 in integer division.

Similarly, ceil((n - i) / 2) is (n - i + 1) // 2.

So, for each i from 0 to n:

- Check if prefix_zeros[i] >= (i + 1) // 2

- Check if (total_ones - prefix_ones[i]) >= ((n - i) + 1) // 2

If both conditions are satisfied, then i is a candidate.

Among all candidate i, choose the one with the smallest |n / 2 - i|.

If there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

I need to handle the case where n is even or odd.

Wait, n/2 could be a float, but in Python, n/2 is a float, and i is integer, so |n/2 - i| is a float.

But in the problem, it's better to use integer operations to avoid floating point precision issues.

So, to minimize |n / 2 - i|, it's equivalent to minimizing |2i - n| since n and i are integers.

Because |2i - n| = |i - n/2| * 2, and since n and i are integers, minimizing |2i - n| will give the same result as minimizing |i - n/2|.

So, I can compute |2i - n| and choose the i with the smallest |2i - n|, and if there are ties, choose the smallest i.

This way, I avoid floating points.

So, in code, I can compute diff = abs(2 * i - n) for each candidate i, and keep track of the smallest diff, and among those with the smallest diff, choose the smallest i.

Now, let's think about how to implement this efficiently.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the string a of length n

- Compute prefix_zeros and prefix_ones

- Compute total_ones and total_zeros

- Iterate through i from 0 to n:

- Check if prefix_zeros[i] >= (i + 1) // 2

- Check if (total_ones - prefix_ones[i]) >= ((n - i) + 1) // 2

- If both conditions are satisfied, compute diff = abs(2 * i - n)

- Keep track of the smallest diff and the corresponding i

- If multiple i have the same diff, choose the smallest i

- Output the chosen i

I need to make sure that the prefix sums are computed efficiently.

In Python, list comprehensions and loops are efficient enough for n up to 3*10^5, especially since the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 3*10^5.

I need to make sure that I don't use nested loops that could lead to O(n^2) time complexity.

In this approach, for each test case, I have O(n) time complexity, which should be acceptable given the constraints.

Let's think about edge cases.

Edge Cases:

1. n = 3

- i can be 0,1,2,3

- For i=0: left side empty, right side has 3 houses

- For i=1: left side has 1 house, right side has 2 houses

- For i=2: left side has 2 houses, right side has 1 house

- For i=3: left side has 3 houses, right side empty

2. All aj = 0

- For left side: need at least ceil(i / 2) zeros

- For right side: need at least ceil((n - i)/2) ones, but since all aj = 0, right_ones[i] = 0, so need ceil((n - i)/2) <= 0, which implies n - i = 0, i.e., i = n

- So, only i = n satisfies the condition

3. All aj = 1

- For left side: need at least ceil(i / 2) zeros, which is 0 if i = 0, else at least 1 zero, but since all are ones, only i = 0 satisfies

- For right side: need at least ceil((n - i)/2) ones, which is ceil(n / 2) ones, which is satisfied since all are ones

- So, i = 0 is the only candidate

4. n is even or odd

- Need to handle both cases correctly when computing |2i - n|

5. Multiple i with the same |2i - n|

- Choose the smallest i

6. The answer always exists

- As per the problem statement, there is always at least one i that satisfies the conditions

Let's look at the sample input and output to verify.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

Let's take the first test case:

n = 3

a = 101

Possible i:

i = 0:

- Left: empty, so 0 zeros needed, satisfied

- Right: houses 1,2,3 with a = 1,0,1

- Number of ones on right: 2

- ceil(3/2) = 2

- So, satisfied

- diff = abs(0 - 1.5) = 1.5

i = 1:

- Left: house 1 with a = 1, zeros = 0

- ceil(1/2) = 1

- 0 < 1, not satisfied

- So, invalid

i = 2:

- Left: houses 1,2 with a = 1,0, zeros = 1

- ceil(2/2) = 1

- 1 >= 1, satisfied

- Right: house 3 with a = 1, ones = 1

- ceil(1/2) = 1

- 1 >= 1, satisfied

- diff = abs(4 - 3) = 1

i = 3:

- Left: houses 1,2,3 with a = 1,0,1, zeros = 1

- ceil(3/2) = 2

- 1 < 2, not satisfied

- So, invalid

So, valid i are 0 and 2, with diffs 1.5 and 1 respectively. So, choose i=2.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n = 6

a = 010111

Compute prefix_zeros and prefix_ones:

a = [0,1,0,1,1,1]

prefix_zeros:

[0,1,1,2,2,2,2]

prefix_ones:

[0,0,1,1,2,3,4]

total_zeros = 3

total_ones = 4

Possible i:

i = 0:

- Left: empty, satisfied

- Right: n=6, i=0, right_ones = 4

- ceil(6/2) = 3

- 4 >= 3, satisfied

- diff = abs(0 - 3) = 3

i = 1:

- Left: houses 1 with a=0, zeros=1

- ceil(1/2)=1

- 1 >=1, satisfied

- Right: houses 2-6 with a=1,0,1,1,1, ones=4-0=4

- ceil(5/2)=3

- 4 >=3, satisfied

- diff = abs(2 - 3) =1

i = 2:

- Left: houses 1-2 with a=0,1, zeros=1

- ceil(2/2)=1

- 1>=1, satisfied

- Right: houses 3-6 with a=0,1,1,1, ones=3

- ceil(4/2)=2

- 3>=2, satisfied

- diff = abs(4 - 3)=1

i = 3:

- Left: houses 1-3 with a=0,1,0, zeros=2

- ceil(3/2)=2

- 2>=2, satisfied

- Right: houses 4-6 with a=1,1,1, ones=3

- ceil(3/2)=2

- 3>=2, satisfied

- diff = abs(6 - 3)=3

i = 4:

- Left: houses 1-4 with a=0,1,0,1, zeros=2

- ceil(4/2)=2

- 2>=2, satisfied

- Right: houses 5-6 with a=1,1, ones=2

- ceil(2/2)=1

- 2>=1, satisfied

- diff = abs(8 - 3)=5

i = 5:

- Left: houses 1-5 with a=0,1,0,1,1, zeros=2

- ceil(5/2)=3

- 2<3, not satisfied

- So, invalid

i = 6:

- Left: houses 1-6 with a=0,1,0,1,1,1, zeros=2

- ceil(6/2)=3

- 2<3, not satisfied

- So, invalid

Valid i: 0,1,2,3,4

diffs:

i=0: |0-3|=3

i=1: |2-3|=1

i=2: |4-3|=1

i=3: |6-3|=3

i=4: |8-3|=5

So, the smallest diff is 1, achieved by i=1 and i=2.

Among i=1 and i=2, choose the smaller i, which is i=1.

But the sample output is 3 for this test case, which contradicts my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Looking back, for n=6, a=010111, the output is 3.

But according to my calculation, i=1 and i=2 have diff=1, and i=1 is smaller, so why is the output 3?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating diffs.

Let me recalculate diffs:

n=6, so n/2 = 3.

diff = |i - 3|

So, for i=0: |0 - 3|=3

i=1: |1 - 3|=2

i=2: |2 - 3|=1

i=3: |3 - 3|=0

i=4: |4 - 3|=1

i=5: |5 - 3|=2

i=6: |6 - 3|=3

Wait, earlier I mistakenly used |2i - n|, but actually, to minimize |i - n/2|, it's better to compute |i - floor(n/2)|.

Wait, in the problem, it's |i - n/2|, which in this case is |i - 3|.

So, for i=2: |2 - 3|=1

i=3: |3 - 3|=0

i=4: |4 - 3|=1

So, the smallest diff is 0, achieved by i=3.

So, the output should be i=3.

Wait, but earlier I thought diff=|2i - n|, but actually, to minimize |i - n/2|, it's better to use |i - floor(n/2)|.

In this case, floor(n/2)=3, so i=3 is the closest.

But according to the sample output, for n=6, a=010111, the output is 3.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, i=3 is a valid candidate, and it has the smallest |i - n/2|=0.

So, the output should be i=3.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, in the general case, to minimize |i - n/2|, I should compute |i - floor(n/2)|, and choose the i with the smallest such value among the valid candidates.

If n is even, floor(n/2) = n/2.

If n is odd, floor(n/2) = (n-1)/2.

But in code, it's easier to compute diff = abs(i - n//2).

And if there are multiple i with the same diff, choose the smallest i.

So, in the code, I can iterate through all i from 0 to n, check the conditions, and among the valid i, choose the one with the smallest abs(i - n//2), and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

There are two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 reads the number of test cases and calls func_1 for each test case.

func_1 reads n and the string a.

It initializes S as [[0,0]].

Then, for each character in a, it updates S by adding [x+1, y] if s=='0', else [x, y+1], where [x,y] is the last element in S.

Then, it iterates through i from 0 to n, and for each i:

left = S[i][0] (number of zeros in left side)

lsum = i (total houses on left side)

right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1] (number of ones on right side)

rsum = n - i (total houses on right side)

If left*2 < lsum or right*2 < rsum, continue.

Else, if abs(n/2 - i) < abs(n/2 - ans), set ans = i.

Finally, print ans.

First, I need to understand what S represents.

S is a list where S[j] represents the cumulative count of zeros and ones up to house j.

S[0] = [0,0]

S[1] = [number of zeros in house 1, number of ones in house 1]

S[2] = [number of zeros in houses 1 and 2, number of ones in houses 1 and 2]

and so on.

So, S[i] gives the count of zeros and ones in the first i houses.

Therefore, for a given i:

left_zeros = S[i][0]

left_total = i

right_ones = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]

right_total = n - i

The conditions are:

left_zeros >= ceil(i / 2)

right_ones >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

In the code, it checks:

if left*2 < lsum or right*2 < rsum:

continue

else:

if abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):

ans = i

Wait, left*2 < lsum is equivalent to left < ceil(lsum / 2), since ceil(lsum / 2) = (lsum + 1) // 2, and left >= ceil(lsum / 2) is required.

But in code, it's left*2 < lsum, which is equivalent to left < lsum / 2.

Since left and lsum are integers, left < lsum / 2 is equivalent to left <= floor((lsum - 1)/2), which is not exactly the negation of left >= ceil(lsum / 2).

Wait, ceil(lsum / 2) = (lsum + 1) // 2

So, left >= ceil(lsum / 2) is left >= (lsum + 1) // 2

The negation is left < (lsum + 1) // 2

But left*2 < lsum is equivalent to left < lsum / 2

But (lsum + 1) // 2 could be greater than floor(lsum / 2), depending on whether lsum is even or odd.

Wait, for lsum even:

ceil(lsum / 2) = floor(lsum / 2)

For lsum odd:

ceil(lsum / 2) = floor(lsum / 2) + 1

So, left >= ceil(lsum / 2) is left >= floor(lsum / 2) + 1 if lsum is odd, else left >= floor(lsum / 2)

The negation is left < floor(lsum / 2) + 1 if lsum is odd, else left < floor(lsum / 2)

But in code, left*2 < lsum is left < lsum / 2

If lsum is even, floor(lsum / 2) = ceil(lsum / 2) - 1

If lsum is odd, floor(lsum / 2) = ceil(lsum / 2) - 1

So, left < lsum / 2 is equivalent to left <= floor(lsum / 2)

But we need left >= ceil(lsum / 2), so the condition in the code is checking if left < ceil(lsum / 2), which is the negation of left >= ceil(lsum / 2)

Similarly for right.

So, the code is skipping the cases where left < ceil(lsum / 2) or right < ceil(rsum / 2), which is correct.

Then, among the remaining i, it chooses the one with the smallest abs(n / 2 - i).

But in the code, it's keeping track of ans, and updating ans only if abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)

This implies that it's trying to minimize abs(n / 2 - i), and among those, choosing the smallest i.

Wait, but in the sample input where n=6, a=010111, the output is 3, which matches my earlier calculation.

So, the code seems to be implementing the correct logic.

But I need to verify if this is indeed correct.

Wait, in the code, ans is initialized to -1, and it's updated only if abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)

But what if ans is -1 initially? In that case, the first valid i will be assigned to ans.

And for floating point comparison, it's fine in Python.

But to make sure, perhaps it's better to initialize ans to some large value, but in this case, since n <= 3*10^5, and i <= n, initializing ans to -1 and comparing abs(n / 2 - i) is fine.

Also, in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so we don't need to worry about no valid i.

So, the code seems correct.

But let's see if there are any potential issues.

Potential issues:

1. Floating point precision: In Python, floating point arithmetic is precise enough for this purpose, since n <= 3*10^5, and i are integers.

2. Edge cases: Need to handle i=0 and i=n correctly.

- For i=0: left side is empty, which is acceptable if the right side satisfies the condition.

- For i=n: right side is empty, which is acceptable if the left side satisfies the condition.

3. The condition checks left*2 < lsum or right*2 < rsum to skip invalid i.

- This is equivalent to left < ceil(lsum / 2) or right < ceil(rsum / 2), which are the conditions to be avoided.

4. Choosing the smallest i among those with the smallest abs(n / 2 - i):

- The code updates ans only if abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans), which ensures that it picks the i closest to n / 2.

- If multiple i have the same abs(n / 2 - i), the smaller i is chosen because the loop iterates from i=0 to i=n, and ans is updated only when the condition is met.

5. Efficiency:

- The loop runs in O(n) time per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Therefore, the provided program seems to be correct and efficient enough to solve the problem.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}} \]
