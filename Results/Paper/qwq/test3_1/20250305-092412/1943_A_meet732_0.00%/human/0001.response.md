Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the game mechanics:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but does not add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`.

- MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

- Both play optimally.

So, the goal is to find out what the MEX will be when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. From the examples:

- MEX of [2,2,1] is 0.

- MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2.

- MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4.

So, MEX is essentially the smallest missing non-negative integer in the array.

Given that, Alice wants to maximize this value, meaning she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible, in order. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize it, meaning he wants to disrupt Alice's efforts.

Let's think about how the game progresses.

Each turn:

- Alice picks an element to add to `c` and removes it from `a`.

- Bob picks an element to remove from `a`.

So, in total, for each turn, two elements are removed from `a` (one by Alice and one by Bob), except for the last turn where only Alice picks if `n` is odd.

Wait, no. Let's think about the total number of turns.

Since both players take turns, and Alice starts, the number of turns will be `n` turns in total, alternating between Alice and Bob.

Wait, no. Each turn consists of both Alice and Bob playing, right? Or is it that Alice plays first, then Bob, and so on until `a` is empty?

Looking back at the problem:

- "Players take turns, with Alice starting first."

- "On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a, appends that element to c, and then deletes it from a."

- "On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a, and then deletes it from a."

- "The game ends when the array a is empty."

So, it's alternate turns, Alice starting first.

So, if `n` is the size of `a`, the total number of turns is `n`, with Alice playing on odd turns (1st, 3rd, etc.), and Bob on even turns (2nd, 4th, etc.).

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- The game proceeds with Alice playing first, then Bob, then Alice, and so on, until `a` is empty.

- Each player plays once per turn, alternating, Alice starting.

- So, if `n` is odd, Alice makes the last move.

- If `n` is even, Bob makes the last move.

Now, what matters is what ends up in `c`.

- Only Alice adds elements to `c`; Bob just removes elements from `a`.

So, the final `c` will have elements chosen by Alice over her turns.

Our task is to find the MEX of `c` when both play optimally.

Given that, Alice wants to maximize the MEX, meaning she wants `c` to contain as many small non-negative integers as possible.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from having those small integers in `c`.

Given that, let's think about how they can play.

First, note that Bob can remove any element from `a` on his turn, not just those that Alice might want.

Alice's goal is to collect as many of the smaller integers as possible, in order to make the MEX as high as possible.

Bob's goal is to prevent that by removing elements that Alice might need.

Let's consider some small examples to get a feel for the problem.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

Let's look at the first test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

We need to find the MEX of `c` after the game, with both playing optimally.

According to the explanation, a possible game leads to c = [1, 0], which has MEX 2.

But we need to confirm if this is indeed the optimal outcome.

Let's simulate the game:

Turn 1: Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0, 0, 1], c = [1]

Turn 2: Bob chooses 0, a becomes [0, 1], c = [1]

Turn 3: Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1], c = [1, 0]

Turn 4: Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [1, 0]

MEX of [1, 0] is 2.

But is this the best Alice can do?

Is there a way for Alice to get MEX 3? That would require c to contain 0, 1, and 2. But 2 is not in a at all. So, no, MEX 3 is impossible.

Is MEX 1 possible? That would require c to contain 0, but not necessarily 1.

Is there a way for Bob to prevent Alice from getting 0 into c?

No, because Alice can choose 0 on her first turn if she wants.

Wait, but in this case, a has two 0s and two 1s.

Let's consider another ordering:

Turn 1: Alice chooses 0, a becomes [0, 1, 1], c = [0]

Turn 2: Bob chooses 1, a becomes [0, 1], c = [0]

Turn 3: Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0], c = [0, 1]

Turn 4: Bob chooses 0, a becomes empty, c = [0, 1]

Again, MEX is 2.

Alternatively:

Turn 1: Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0, 0, 1], c = [1]

Turn 2: Bob chooses 0, a becomes [0, 1], c = [1]

Turn 3: Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1], c = [1, 0]

Turn 4: Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [1, 0]

Again, MEX is 2.

Seems like MEX 2 is the best Alice can do, and Bob can't prevent it.

Hence, the output is 2.

Second test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

We need to find the MEX of c.

Let's simulate:

Turn 1: Alice chooses 0, a becomes [1, 2, 3], c = [0]

Turn 2: Bob chooses 1, a becomes [2, 3], c = [0]

Turn 3: Alice chooses 2, a becomes [3], c = [0, 2]

Turn 4: Bob chooses 3, a becomes empty, c = [0, 2]

MEX of [0, 2] is 1.

Is this the optimal outcome?

Could Alice do better?

If Alice chooses differently:

Turn 1: Alice chooses 1, a becomes [0, 2, 3], c = [1]

Turn 2: Bob chooses 0, a becomes [2, 3], c = [1]

Turn 3: Alice chooses 2, a becomes [3], c = [1, 2]

Turn 4: Bob chooses 3, a becomes empty, c = [1, 2]

MEX is 0.

Wait, but [1,2] has MEX 0 because 0 is missing.

Wait, no:

MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer.

So, if 0 is missing, MEX is 0.

If 0 is present but 1 is missing, MEX is 1.

In [1,2], 0 is missing, so MEX is 0.

But in the previous simulation, c = [0,2], which has MEX 1.

So, choosing 0 first is better for Alice than choosing 1 first.

Hence, the best Alice can do is MEX 1.

Bob can prevent Alice from getting MEX higher than 1.

Hence, output is 1.

Third test case:

n = 2

a = [1,1]

Turn 1: Alice chooses 1, a becomes [1], c = [1]

Turn 2: Bob chooses 1, a becomes empty, c = [1]

MEX of [1] is 0.

Hence, output is 0.

Seems straightforward.

Now, to generalize this.

I need to find a way to compute the MEX of c when both play optimally.

Let me think about what determines the MEX.

MEX is the smallest missing non-negative integer in c.

Alice wants to include as many small integers as possible in c.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each small integer, Alice needs to ensure it's in c, and Bob needs to prevent it.

Let's consider the integers in order: 0, 1, 2, ..., up to some point.

For each integer i, starting from 0, Alice needs to have at least one way to include i in c, and Bob needs to not be able to prevent it completely.

But Bob can remove elements from a, including those that Alice might need.

So, I need to think about the availability of each integer and how many times they appear.

Let me consider the frequency of each integer in a.

Let's say I have a count array cnt[i] representing how many times i appears in a, for i from 0 to n.

Since a contains elements between 0 and n-1, but cnt is defined up to n.

Wait, in the code, cntl is defined from 0 to n+1.

But in the problem, a contains elements a_i where 0 â‰¤ a_i < n.

So, a contains elements from 0 to n-1.

But in the code, cntl is of size n+1, so indices from 0 to n.

Probably to handle MEX up to n.

Now, to determine the MEX, I need to see which smallest i is not in c.

So, I need to see which i, starting from 0, is missing in c.

Alice wants to include as many i's as possible, in order.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, for each i, starting from 0, Alice needs to have a way to include i in c, and Bob needs to not be able to prevent it.

Given that, I need to find the smallest i that Alice cannot guarantee to include in c, even with optimal play.

So, for each i, I need to check if Alice can include i in c, despite Bob's efforts.

If Alice can include i, then MEX is higher.

If not, then MEX is i.

So, I need to find the smallest i where Alice cannot include i in c.

Now, how do I determine that?

Let's think in terms of the number of times i appears in a.

If cnt[i] is the count of i in a.

Alice needs to pick at least one i to include in c.

But Bob can try to prevent that by deleting i's.

Each time Alice picks an i, she adds it to c and removes it from a.

Each time Bob picks an i, he removes it from a.

So, for Alice to include at least one i in c, she needs to pick it before Bob deletes all instances of i.

Given that, for each i, the number of times Bob can delete i is cnt[i].

But Alice needs at least one i to remain for her to pick it.

Wait, no.

Alice needs to pick one i and add it to c before Bob deletes all i's.

So, for Alice to be able to include i in c, she needs to pick it before Bob deletes all instances of i.

Given that, for each i, the number of times Bob can delete i is cnt[i].

But Alice has to pick one i, and Bob can delete up to cnt[i] times.

Wait, but they are picking one element per turn, alternating.

So, the sequence of picks matters.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times each i appears and how many turns Alice gets to pick them.

Let's consider that the total number of turns is n, with Alice picking on ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob on floor(n/2) turns.

But that might not directly help.

Perhaps I need to think about the frequency of each i.

For i=0, if cnt[0] >= 1, Alice can pick it, unless Bob deletes it first.

Wait, but Alice goes first, so if cnt[0] >=1, Alice can pick it on her first turn.

Wait, but Bob can pick it on his turn.

Wait, no, Bob picks after Alice.

So, if cnt[0] >=1, Alice can pick it on her first turn.

If cnt[0] >=2, Alice can pick one, and Bob can delete another, but Alice still has one left.

Wait, no.

Let's think carefully.

Suppose cnt[0] = k.

Alice can pick one 0 and add it to c, but Bob can pick up to floor((k-1)/2) zeros, deleting them.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick i before Bob deletes all remaining i's.

Alternatively, think in terms of the number of times i appears and how many turns Alice gets to pick it.

Wait, maybe think in terms of the game where Alice needs to pick at least one i, and Bob tries to prevent it.

For each i, the number of times it appears is cnt[i].

Alice needs at least one i in c.

Bob tries to delete all i's.

Alice gets to pick first.

So, for each i, the number of times Alice can pick i is ceil(cnt[i]/2), because for every two turns, Alice gets one pick.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

Total picks for i:

- Alice can pick floor(cnt[i]/2) or ceil(cnt[i]/2), depending on who picks last.

Wait, more carefully:

For a given i, with cnt[i] occurrences.

The number of times Alice can pick i is ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Because Alice picks first, so for cnt[i] items, Alice picks ceil(cnt[i]/2), and Bob picks floor(cnt[i]/2).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each i, Alice can pick ceil(cnt[i]/2) times.

Similarly, Bob can pick floor(cnt[i]/2) times.

But in this game, Alice wants to have at least one i in c.

Bob wants to delete all i's that Alice picks.

Wait, no.

Bob can delete i's, but only from a, not directly from c.

Wait, no, Bob just deletes from a.

Alice picks from a and adds to c.

So, for Alice to include i in c, she needs to pick it at least once before all i's are deleted.

Given that, for each i, the number of times Alice can pick i is ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Similarly, Bob can pick floor(cnt[i]/2) times.

But Alice needs at least one pick of i to include it in c.

So, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, then Alice can include i in c.

Unless Bob can prevent it.

Wait, but Bob is trying to prevent Alice from including i.

So, for Alice to include i, she needs to pick it at least once before Bob deletes the remaining instances.

Wait, perhaps it's that Alice can include i in c if cnt[i] >= ceil(cnt[i]/2), which is always true if cnt[i] >=1, except when cnt[i] ==0.

Wait, no.

Wait, if cnt[i] ==0, obviously Alice can't include i.

If cnt[i] >=1, then Alice can pick it at least ceil(1/2)=1 time.

So, she can include it.

Wait, but Bob can delete it.

Wait, no.

Let's think differently.

Suppose cnt[i] =1.

Alice picks it, adds to c.

Bob can't delete it because it's already in c.

Wait, no.

Bob deletes from a, not from c.

So, if Alice picks it and adds to c, it's removed from a.

Bob can delete other elements.

Wait, no.

When Alice picks an element, she picks it from a, adds it to c, and deletes it from a.

Then, Bob picks an element from a and deletes it.

So, in each turn, one element is added to c by Alice, and one is deleted by Bob.

But only Alice adds to c; Bob only deletes from a.

So, for i to be in c at the end, Alice needs to have picked it at some point.

Bob can try to delete elements that Alice might want to pick later.

So, for Alice to include i in c, she needs to pick it before Bob deletes all remaining i's.

So, if cnt[i] >=1, Alice can pick it on her turn, adding it to c, before Bob can delete it.

Because Bob picks after Alice.

Hence, if cnt[i] >=1, Alice can always pick it and include it in c.

Wait, but in the second test case, with a=[0,1,2,3], the output is 1.

But according to this, cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

So, Alice can pick 0,1,2,3, but in reality, Bob can prevent some of them.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3].

cnt[0]=1, cnt[1]=1, cnt[2]=1, cnt[3]=1.

Alice picks one, say 0, c=[0], a=[1,2,3].

Bob picks one, say 1, a=[2,3].

Alice picks 2, c=[0,2], a=[3].

Bob picks 3, a=[].

c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, Alice picks 1 first: c=[1], a=[0,2,3].

Bob picks 0: a=[2,3].

Alice picks 2: c=[1,2], a=[3].

Bob picks 3: a=[].

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, in this case, depending on Alice's choices, MEX can be 0 or 1.

But according to the earlier logic, since cnt[i]>=1 for i=0,1,2,3, Alice should be able to include any one of them.

But in reality, Bob can influence the outcome by deleting elements.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the key is to consider the number of times each i appears and how many times Alice can pick them before Bob deletes them.

Given that, for each i, Alice can pick ceil(cnt[i]/2) times.

Similarly, Bob can pick floor(cnt[i]/2) times.

But Alice needs at least one pick for each i she wants in c.

So, for each i, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include it.

But in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for all i, so ceil(1/2)=1, which is >=1, but in reality, the MEX is 1, meaning that c does not contain 0 or 1 is missing in some scenarios.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the second test case, output is 1, meaning that c contains 0 but not 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, MEX is 1 means that 0 is present in c, but 1 is not.

But in one scenario, c=[0,2], which has MEX 1.

In another scenario, c=[1,2], which has MEX 0.

So, the optimal for Alice is to have c=[0,2], giving MEX 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, perhaps Alice can include 0 and one other number, but not 1.

Wait, but cnt[1]=1, and ceil(1/2)=1, so Alice should be able to include it.

But Bob can delete it.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete elements that Alice might want.

So, for Alice to include i in c, she needs to pick it before Bob deletes all remaining i's.

So, for i with cnt[i]=1, Alice can pick it on her turn, adding it to c.

Bob can't delete it after that because it's already in c.

But Bob can delete other elements.

Wait, no.

Bob deletes from a, not from c.

So, once Alice picks it and adds it to c, it's removed from a.

Bob can delete other elements from a.

So, for i with cnt[i]=1, Alice can always pick it and include it in c.

Because Bob can't delete it after Alice has picked it.

Hence, for all i with cnt[i]>=1, Alice can include it in c.

Wait, but in the second test case, with a=[0,1,2,3], cnt[i]=1 for all i, but the MEX is 1, meaning that c contains 0 and 2, but not 1.

Wait, but according to this, Alice should be able to include 1 as well.

So, perhaps there's more to it.

Maybe Alice can include multiple elements, but Bob can influence which ones she includes.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that Alice has to choose which elements to include, and Bob can delete others to influence the final c.

So, perhaps the MEX is determined by which elements Alice chooses to include, considering Bob's deletions.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of elements Alice can include.

Given that Alice gets to pick ceil(n/2) elements, and Bob picks floor(n/2) elements.

But it's not just about the number of elements, but which specific elements she picks.

Wait, perhaps it's about the frequency of each i and how many times Alice can pick them.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the code provided and understand its logic.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]

for i in a:

cntl[i] += 1

if cntl[0] == 0:

print(0)

else:

c = min(2, cntl[0])

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if cntl[j] < 2:

c -= 1

if not c or j == n:

print(j)

break

So, the code is:

- Read the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- Count the frequency of each element in a using cntl.

- If cntl[0] == 0, print 0.

- Else, set c to min(2, cntl[0]).

- Then, for j from 1 to n:

- If cntl[j] < 2, decrement c.

- If c == 0 or j == n, print j and break.

So, what's the logic here?

It seems to be checking how many times 0 appears and then checking how many other elements have cntl[j] < 2.

But I need to verify if this logic correctly determines the MEX.

Let's test it with the first test case:

n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

cntl = [2, 2, 0, 0]

cntl[0] = 2, which is >=2, so c = min(2,2) = 2

Then, for j from 1 to 4:

j=1: cntl[1]=2 >=2, so c unchanged (still 2)

j=2: cntl[2]=0 <2, c -=1 -> c=1

j=3: cntl[3]=0 <2, c -=1 -> c=0

At j=3, c=0, so print j=3.

Wait, but the expected output is 2.

So, this doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, no, cntl[2]=0, cntl[3]=0, so c is decremented to 0 at j=3.

But the correct output is 2.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I misread the code.

Looking back:

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if cntl[j] < 2:

c -= 1

if not c or j == n:

print(j)

break

In the first test case:

n=4, cntl=[2,2,0,0]

j=1: cntl[1]=2 >=2, c unchanged (c=2)

j=2: cntl[2]=0 <2, c=1

j=3: cntl[3]=0 <2, c=0

At j=3, c=0, so print 3.

But the correct output is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, a=[0,0,1,1]

But in the explanation, c=[1,0], MEX=2.

But according to the code, it would print 3, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong.

So, Correctness: False

Wait, but perhaps I need to see the other test cases.

Second test case:

n=4, a=[0,1,2,3]

cntl=[1,1,1,1]

cntl[0]=1

c = min(2,1) =1

j=1: cntl[1]=1 <2, c=0

At j=1, c=0, print 1.

Which matches the expected output.

Third test case:

n=2, a=[1,1]

cntl=[0,2]

cntl[0]=0, so print 0.

Which matches the expected output.

So, in the first test case, it's incorrect, but in the second and third, it's correct.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

But perhaps there's a pattern here.

In the first test case, it's incorrect because it prints 3 instead of 2.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to do something else.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to count the number of elements that appear at least twice.

Wait, no.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include floor((cnt[i]+1)/2) instances of i in c.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me look up some game theory concepts.

This seems similar to a game where players are choosing elements, and one wants to maximize certain properties, while the other wants to minimize them.

Perhaps it's similar to choosing sets or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of available moves for Alice and Bob.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick each i.

Given that Alice picks first, and they alternate picks, for cnt[i] elements, Alice can pick ceil(cnt[i]/2) of them.

Similarly, Bob can pick floor(cnt[i]/2).

But Alice needs at least one to include i in c.

Hence, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include i.

But in reality, Bob can delete other elements to influence which ones Alice picks.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of picks Alice has.

Total number of picks Alice has is ceil(n/2).

She needs to include as many small i's as possible in c.

So, she should prioritize including the smallest i's first.

Bob, to minimize, would try to force Alice to include larger i's.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of available i's that Alice can include.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is determined by the smallest i that Alice cannot include in c, even with optimal play.

So, to find the smallest i where Alice cannot include it in c.

Given that, I need to find the smallest i where Alice cannot include it in c, despite her efforts.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over i from 0 to n, and check if Alice can include it.

If she can, then MEX is higher; if not, MEX is i.

To check if Alice can include i in c, given the frequencies.

Given that, for each i, Alice can include ceil(cnt[i]/2).

So, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include it.

Hence, i is included in c if cnt[i] >=1.

Hence, MEX is the smallest i where cnt[i]==0.

But in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for all i from 0 to 3, so MEX should be 4.

But the expected output is 1.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Hence, my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can delete elements that Alice wants.

Wait, perhaps Bob can delete elements that Alice hasn't picked yet.

So, if cnt[i]=1, Alice can pick it, but Bob can delete other elements.

Wait, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that for each i, the number of times it appears is cnt[i].

Alice can include floor((cnt[i]+1)/2) instances of i in c.

Because Alice picks first, so she gets ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Wait, no, in terms of integer division.

Wait, for cnt[i] elements, Alice picks ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Similarly, Bob picks floor(cnt[i]/2).

Hence, for Alice to include i in c, she needs ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, which is true when cnt[i] >=1.

Hence, Alice can include all i where cnt[i] >=1.

Hence, c will contain all i where cnt[i] >=1.

Hence, MEX should be the smallest i where cnt[i]==0.

But in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for i=0,1,2,3, so MEX should be 4.

But the expected output is 1.

Hence, my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], cnt=[1,1,1,1].

But the expected output is 1, meaning that c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, c should contain all i where cnt[i]>=1, which is i=0,1,2,3.

But in reality, c can only contain ceil(n/2) elements.

Wait, n=4, ceil(4/2)=2.

Hence, Alice can include only 2 elements in c.

Hence, she can choose any two elements.

To maximize MEX, she would choose 0 and 2, giving c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, she could choose 1 and 3, c=[1,3], MEX=0.

Hence, the best she can do is MEX=1.

Hence, the MEX is determined by the highest possible MEX Alice can achieve by choosing ceil(n/2) smallest possible elements.

Wait, perhaps.

So, in general, Alice can choose ceil(n/2) elements.

To maximize MEX, she should choose the smallest possible ceil(n/2) elements.

Bob, to minimize MEX, will try to force Alice to choose higher elements.

Hence, the MEX is determined by the smallest integer not among the ceil(n/2) smallest available elements.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

Given that Alice can choose ceil(n/2) elements, she should choose the smallest ceil(n/2) available elements to maximize MEX.

Bob will try to prevent her from doing so.

Hence, the MEX would be the smallest integer not among the ceil(n/2) smallest available elements.

Wait, perhaps it's the smallest integer i where the number of available elements less than i is less than ceil(n/2).

Wait, maybe I need to sort the unique elements and see.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the unique elements and select the ceil(n/2) smallest ones.

Then, MEX is the smallest integer not in this selected set.

Wait, but in the second test case, unique elements are [0,1,2,3], ceil(4/2)=2.

So, Alice can choose the two smallest: 0 and 1, which would give c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the expected output is 1.

Hence, this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the frequency of each element.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many times each element appears and how many times Alice can pick them.

Given that, for each element, Alice can pick ceil(cnt[i]/2).

Hence, the total number of elements Alice can pick is sum over i of ceil(cnt[i]/2).

But she can only pick ceil(n/2) elements in total.

Hence, perhaps I need to find the smallest i such that the sum of ceil(cnt[j]/2) for j < i is less than ceil(n/2).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that Alice can choose ceil(n/2) elements from a, and Bob deletes floor(n/2) elements.

Alice wants to choose the smallest possible elements to maximize MEX.

Bob wants to force Alice to choose higher elements to minimize MEX.

Hence, Bob will delete elements that Alice wants to have.

So, for each element, Alice needs to ensure that she can pick it before Bob deletes it.

Given that, for an element i with cnt[i] occurrences, Alice can pick ceil(cnt[i]/2) of them.

Hence, if ceil(cnt[i]/2) >=1, Alice can include i in c.

Hence, c will contain all i where cnt[i] >=1.

Hence, MEX is the smallest i where cnt[i]==0.

But in the second test case, cnt[i]=1 for i=0,1,2,3, so MEX should be 4.

But the expected output is 1.

Hence, this is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can only choose ceil(n/2) elements in total.

Hence, she needs to choose the smallest possible ceil(n/2) elements available.

Hence, the MEX is the smallest integer not among the ceil(n/2) smallest available elements.

Wait, in the second test case, available elements are [0,1,2,3].

Ceil(4/2)=2.

So, the smallest 2 elements are 0 and 1.

Hence, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the expected output is 1.

Hence, this is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice needs to choose elements with sufficient frequency to include them in c.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the code.

In the code:

if cntl[0] == 0:

print(0)

else:

c = min(2, cntl[0])

for j in range(1, n + 1):

if cntl[j] < 2:

c -= 1

if not c or j == n:

print(j)

break

So, it seems to be checking:

- If cntl[0]==0, MEX is 0.

- Else, set c to min(2, cntl[0]).

- Then, for j from 1 to n:

- If cntl[j] < 2, decrement c.

- If c==0 or j==n, print j.

Wait, perhaps the logic is that Alice needs to have at least two 0's to include 0 in c, and for other j, she needs at least one.

But in the first test case, cntl[0]=2, so c=2.

Then, for j=1, cntl[1]=2 >=2, so c unchanged.

j=2, cntl[2]=0 <2, c=1.

j=3, cntl[3]=0 <2, c=0.

Hence, print 3.

But expected output is 2.

Hence, incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the condition.

Perhaps Alice needs to have cntl[j] >=1 for j>=1, and cntl[0] >=1.

Wait, but in the third test case, cntl[0]=0, so print 0.

Which is correct.

In the second test case, cntl[0]=1, so c=min(2,1)=1.

Then, j=1, cntl[1]=1 <2, c=0.

Hence, print 1.

Which matches expected output.

In the first test case, cntl[0]=2, c=2.

j=1, cntl[1]=2 >=2, no change.

j=2, cntl[2]=0 <2, c=1.

j=3, cntl[3]=0 <2, c=0.

Hence, print 3.

But expected output is 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be cntl[j] >=1 for j>=1.

Wait, perhaps the logic should be:

- If cntl[0]==0, MEX=0.

- Else, c = cntl[0].

- For j from 1 to n:

- If cntl[j]==0, c -=1.

- If c <=0, print j.

Wait, in the first test case, cntl[0]=2, c=2.

j=1, cntl[1]=2 !=0, no change.

j=2, cntl[2]=0, c=1.

j=3, cntl[3]=0, c=0.

Hence, print 3.

But expected output is 2.

Wait, perhaps it should be j from 0 to n-1.

Wait, no, j starts from 1.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the MEX is the smallest j where the number of times Alice can pick j is 0.

Given that Alice can pick ceil(cnt[j]/2), so if ceil(cnt[j]/2)==0, which is when cnt[j]==0.

Hence, MEX is the smallest j where cnt[j]==0.

But in the second test case, cnt[j]==1 for j=0,1,2,3, so MEX should be 4.

But expected output is 1.

Hence, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can only pick ceil(cnt[j]/2), but she needs to pick enough to have at least one in c.

Wait, but ceil(cnt[j]/2) >=1 when cnt[j] >=1.

Hence, Alice can include all j where cnt[j]>=1.

Hence, MEX should be the smallest j where cnt[j]==0.

But in the second test case, cnt[j]==1 for j=0,1,2,3, so MEX should be 4.

But expected output is 1.

Hence, my understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, a=[0,1,2,3], cnt=[1,1,1,1].

Alice can choose ceil(4/2)=2 elements.

To maximize MEX, she should choose the smallest possible elements.

Hence, she chooses 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the expected output is 1.

Hence, perhaps the MEX is not what I thought.

Wait, in the explanation, it says that in the second test case, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

But according to my logic, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is determined by the final c, which depends on Alice's choices.

But Bob can influence which elements Alice picks by deleting elements.

Wait, perhaps Bob can delete elements that Alice wants.

Wait, perhaps Bob can delete elements that Alice would pick next.

Hence, Bob can force Alice to pick higher elements.

Hence, in the second test case, Alice can pick 0 and then 2, giving c=[0,2], MEX=1.

But if Alice picks 0 and 1, c=[0,1], MEX=2.

Hence, the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve is 1.

Hence, perhaps the MEX is the minimal over all possible games.

Wait, no, the problem says "Find game's final score if both players play optimally."

Hence, Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

Hence, it's the MEX when both play optimally.

Hence, in the second test case, the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve is 1.

Hence, the output is 1.

Hence, perhaps the logic should be:

- Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements.

- To maximize MEX, she picks the smallest possible ceil(n/2) unique elements available.

- Bob, to minimize MEX, forces Alice to pick higher elements.

Hence, the MEX is the smallest integer not among the ceil(n/2) smallest unique elements available.

Wait, but in the second test case, unique elements are [0,1,2,3], ceil(n/2)=2.

Hence, Alice can pick the two smallest: 0 and 1, giving MEX=2.

But the expected output is 1.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider the frequency of elements.

Wait, in the first test case, a=[0,0,1,1], unique elements are [0,1], ceil(n/2)=2.

Hence, Alice can pick two elements: 0 and 1, giving c=[0,1], MEX=2.

But the expected output is 2.

Wait, but in the explanation, c=[1,0], MEX=2.

Hence, same as above.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], unique elements [0,1,2,3], ceil(n/2)=2.

Alice can pick any two: if she picks 0 and 1, MEX=2.

If she picks 0 and 2, MEX=1.

If she picks 0 and 3, MEX=1.

If she picks 1 and 2, MEX=0.

If she picks 1 and 3, MEX=0.

If she picks 2 and 3, MEX=0.

Hence, the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve is 1 (when she picks 0 and 2).

Hence, the output is 1.

Hence, perhaps the MEX is the minimal over the possible choices that Alice can make, assuming Bob forces the minimal MEX.

Wait, but Bob doesn't choose which elements Alice picks; he just deletes elements from a.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of availability.

Wait, perhaps I need to sort the unique elements and see how many are available.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is the smallest integer that is not among the ceil(n/2) smallest unique elements in a.

Hence, in the second test case, unique elements are [0,1,2,3], ceil(n/2)=2.

The two smallest are 0 and 1, MEX
