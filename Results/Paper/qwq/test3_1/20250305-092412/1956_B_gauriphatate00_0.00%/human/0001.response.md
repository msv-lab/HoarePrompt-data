Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck with 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and then checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets one point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points:

- The game is played with complete information; both players can see all the cards on the table at any time.

- Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's break it down.

Understanding the Game Mechanics:

1. **Card Distribution:**

- There are 2n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing twice.

- These are divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

2. **Turn Sequence:**

- We take turns, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns.

- On each turn, a player selects one card from their hand, checks if its number is already on the table, and if so, scores a point.

- The selected card is then placed on the table.

3. **Objective:**

- Determine the maximum number of points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize my score.

Analyzing the Problem:

To solve this, I need to model the game and find a strategy that maximizes my score against Nene's optimal play.

Key Observations:

- Since both players can see the table, they can make informed decisions about which cards to play when.

- The scoring depends on whether the number being played is already present on the table.

- Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of multiple options, minimize my score.

- I need to play optimally to maximize my score against her strategy.

Let's think about how the game progresses.

Each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the deck. So, for each number, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene.

Wait, not necessarily. Because the distribution is arbitrary as long as each gets n cards. So, for each number, the two cards could be:

- Both with me.

- Both with Nene.

- One with me and one with Nene.

But according to the problem, each integer appears exactly twice in the deck, and the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. So, for each integer, the two cards could be split in three ways:

1. I have both cards.

2. Nene has both cards.

3. I have one, and Nene has the other.

But the problem states that in the input, I'm given the cards in my hand, and it's guaranteed that each integer appears at most twice in my hand, which makes sense.

Wait, more precisely, it's guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most twice. Wait, no: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

Wait, no: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

Actually, since I have n cards, and each integer appears at most twice in my hand, but it's possible that some integers appear only once or twice in my hand.

Wait, no: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

Actually, since there are 2n cards in total, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice, and I have n cards, it's possible that for some integers, both cards are with me, for others, one is with me and one with Nene, and for others, both are with Nene.

But in my hand, for each integer, I can have either one or two cards (but not zero, because if I have zero, Nene has both, but I don't know about that).

Wait, no: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

Wait, but I have n cards, and there are n integers, each appearing exactly twice in the deck. So, in my hand, for each integer, I can have either one or two cards.

Wait, no: since there are 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice, and I have n cards, it's possible that for some integers, I have both cards, for others, only one, and for others, none.

Wait, but if I have n cards, and there are n integers, each appearing twice, then it's possible that I have both cards of some integers, one card of others, and none of others, but given that I have n cards, the distribution must add up to n cards.

Wait, but the problem says: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

Wait, no: "It is guaranteed that each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an at most 2 times."

Wait, but a1 to an are my n cards, and each integer from 1 to n can appear at most twice in my hand, but since I have n cards, and there are n integers, it's possible that some integers appear twice in my hand, and others appear once, but the total number of cards is n.

Wait, no: if each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, and I have n cards, then the distribution must be such that some integers appear twice, and others appear once, but the total number of cards is n.

Wait, actually, no: if each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, and I have n cards, then it's possible that some integers appear twice, but only up to a certain number, such that the total number of cards is n.

But actually, since there are n integers and each appears exactly twice in the deck, and I have n cards, the distribution in my hand can vary.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of frequencies.

Let me define, for each integer x from 1 to n:

- Let fx be the number of cards with x in my hand.

- Then, Nene has 2 - fx cards with x.

Given that the sum of fx over all x is n, since I have n cards.

Now, the game proceeds with me and Nene taking turns, starting with me, each playing one card per turn, for a total of 2n turns.

On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at its number x, checks if there is already a card with number x on the table, and if so, scores a point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her score, and in case of ties, minimize my score.

I need to play optimally to maximize my score against her strategy.

So, I need to model this game and find the optimal strategy.

This seems like a game theory problem, specifically a zero-sum game where both players are trying to maximize their own scores, with one player trying to minimize the other's score as a secondary objective.

I need to find the optimal play for both players.

This sounds complex, but perhaps there's a smarter way to approach it.

Let me think about the properties of the game.

First, the game is fully observable; both players know the entire state at any point.

Second, the game has perfect information; no hidden elements.

Third, the game is turn-based, with alternating moves.

Fourth, the game ends after a fixed number of moves (2n turns).

This suggests that the game can be modeled as a deterministic game tree, where each node represents a game state, and edges represent moves.

However, building the full game tree is infeasible due to the potentially large number of nodes (exponential in n).

Therefore, I need a smarter approach, perhaps based on some mathematical insights.

Let me consider the following:

- For each integer x, there are two cards: one with me and one with Nene, or both with me, or both with Nene.

- The scoring happens when a player plays a card with a number that's already on the table.

- So, the order in which cards are played affects the scoring.

I need to find a way to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let me consider the concept of "pairs."

For each integer x, if both cards are with me, then I can play them in two of my turns, and the second one will score a point.

If both cards are with Nene, then she can play them in two of her turns, and the second one will score a point.

If one card is with me and one with Nene, then whoever plays their card second will score a point.

Wait, more precisely:

- Suppose I have one card of x, and Nene has the other.

- If I play my card first, then when Nene plays hers, she scores a point.

- If Nene plays her card first, then when I play mine, I score a point.

So, in this case, the order matters in terms of who scores the point.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and, in case of ties, minimize mine, she will choose the order that maximizes her score, and if there are multiple options, chooses the one that minimizes my score.

I need to find a strategy that maximizes my score against her optimal play.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to categorize the integers based on the distribution of their cards:

1. **Type A:** Both cards with me.

- In this case, if I play both cards in my turns, the second one will score a point.

- However, Nene can influence when I play them.

2. **Type B:** Both cards with Nene.

- In this case, Nene can play both cards in her turns, and the second one will score a point for her.

- This doesn't directly affect my score.

3. **Type C:** One card with me, one with Nene.

- The order in which we play these cards determines who scores the point.

Now, perhaps I can think in terms of these categories.

Let me define:

- Let pa be the number of Type A integers (both cards with me).

- Let pb be the number of Type B integers (both cards with Nene).

- Let pc be the number of Type C integers (one card with me, one with Nene).

Note that pa + pb + pc = n, since there are n distinct integers.

Also, the total number of cards is:

- Me: pa * 2 + pc * 1 = n

- Nene: pb * 2 + pc * 1 = n

Because I have n cards, and Nene has n cards.

Wait, let's verify:

- Total cards with me: 2 * pa + 1 * pc = n

- Total cards with Nene: 2 * pb + 1 * pc = n

- Also, pa + pb + pc = n

Is this consistent?

Yes, because:

2*pa + pc = n

2*pb + pc = n

pa + pb + pc = n

These equations are consistent.

Now, perhaps I can think about how many points I can get from each type.

From Type A:

- For each Type A integer, I have two cards.

- If I play both cards, the second one will score a point, provided that Nene doesn't play any other card in between that would make the first card of this type score for her.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph or use some matching algorithm, but that might not be straightforward.

Let me consider the total possible points in the game.

In total, there are n pairs of cards, each pair corresponding to one integer from 1 to n.

Each pair can contribute one point to the player who plays the second card of that pair.

So, there are n possible points in total.

Nene aims to maximize her score, and in case of ties, minimize my score.

I need to maximize my score against her optimal play.

This sounds like a minimax problem.

In game theory, minimax is a decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.

In this context, I need to maximize my score, assuming that Nene is trying to minimize it.

But perhaps there's a smarter way to calculate this without simulating the entire game.

Let me consider the number of "pairs" I have.

A "pair" is when I have both cards of a particular integer.

For each such pair, I can potentially score one point by playing the second card after the first one is on the table.

However, Nene can interfere with this by playing cards in between.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think again.

For Type A integers (both cards with me):

- If I play both cards in consecutive turns, the second one will score a point, provided that no other card of the same number has been played in between.

But since it's the same number, and I'm playing both cards, I need to ensure that the first one is played before the second one.

Wait, but in Type A, both cards are with me, so I control the order in which they are played.

For Type C integers (one card with me, one with Nene):

- The order in which we play these cards determines who scores the point.

- If I play my card first, Nene can play her card later to score a point.

- If Nene plays her card first, then I can play my card later to score a point.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will choose the order that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

So, for Type C integers, it seems that Nene can decide whether she scores a point or I do.

Wait, but it's not that simple because the turns are alternating.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Suppose n=1.

Then, there are two cards, both with number 1.

If both are with me, then:

- I play one card in my first turn, placing 1 on the table.

- Nene has no cards, so she passes or something? Wait, no, she has no cards.

Wait, no, if n=1, I have one card, and Nene has one card.

Wait, no: n is the number of distinct integers, and there are 2n cards.

Wait, in the example given in the problem, for n=4, I have 4 cards, and Nene has 4 cards.

Wait, in the sample input, first test case:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

And the output is:

1

2

1

0

0

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)."

Then, for each test case:

- First line: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5)

- Second line: n integers a1,a2,…,an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n)

And it's guaranteed that each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times.

Also, sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

So, in the sample input:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

So, t=5 test cases.

First test case: n=4, a=[1,1,2,3]

Second test case: n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

Third test case: n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6]

Fourth test case: n=3, a=[1,2,3]

Fifth test case: n=1, a=[1]

Now, looking at the first test case:

n=4, a=[1,1,2,3]

So, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Nene has the remaining cards: [2,3,4,4]

So, integers:

1: both cards with me

2: one with me, one with Nene

3: one with me, one with Nene

4: both with Nene

So, pa=1 (integer 1)

pb=1 (integer 4)

pc=2 (integers 2 and 3)

Now, according to the sample output, the answer is 1.

In the explanation, it describes a possible game flow where I get 1 point.

I need to see if I can get more than that, but apparently not.

So, perhaps in general, the number of points I can get is equal to the number of Type A integers (pa), but limited by something.

Wait, in this case, pa=1, and the answer is 1, which matches pa.

But in the second test case:

n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5]

So, my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, frequencies:

1:1

2:1

4:1

5:2

7:1

8:2

So, pa=2 (integers 5 and 8)

pb: need to find how many integers have both cards with Nene.

Total integers are from 1 to 8.

I have:

1:1 → Nene has 1

2:1 → Nene has 2

3:0 → Nene has 2

4:1 → Nene has 4

5:2 → Nene has 0

6:0 → Nene has 2

7:1 → Nene has 7

8:2 → Nene has 0

Wait, no: Nene has n=8 cards.

I have a total of 8 cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, total cards I have:

7:1

4:1

1:1

2:1

8:2

5:2

So, sum is 1+1+1+1+2+2=8, which matches.

Nene has the remaining cards:

3:2

6:2

And for numbers where I have one, she has one: 1,2,4,7.

Wait, but according to above:

For number 1: I have 1, Nene has 1.

Number 2: I have 1, Nene has 1.

Number 3: I have 0, Nene has 2.

Number 4: I have 1, Nene has 1.

Number 5: I have 2, Nene has 0.

Number 6: I have 0, Nene has 2.

Number 7: I have 1, Nene has 1.

Number 8: I have 2, Nene has 0.

So, pa=2 (5 and 8)

pb=2 (3 and 6)

pc=4 (1,2,4,7)

In the sample output, the answer is 2, which matches pa=2.

Wait, but in the first test case, answer is 1, which matches pa=1.

In the second test case, answer is 2, which matches pa=2.

In the third test case, n=8, a=[7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6]

So, frequencies:

1:1

2:1

3:1

4:2

5:1

6:1

7:1

So, pa=1 (integer 4)

pb: need to find integers where both cards are with Nene.

Total integers from 1 to 8.

I have:

1:1 → Nene has 1

2:1 → Nene has 1

3:1 → Nene has 1

4:2 → Nene has 0

5:1 → Nene has 1

6:1 → Nene has 1

7:1 → Nene has 1

8:0 → Nene has 2

So, pb=1 (integer 8)

pc=6 (1,2,3,5,6,7)

In the sample output, the answer is 1, which matches pa=1.

Wait, but in the second test case, pa=2 and answer is 2.

In the third test case, pa=1 and answer is 1.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a=[1,2,3]

So, I have one of each: 1,2,3.

Nene has the other ones: 1,2,3.

So, pa=0

pb=0

pc=3

Answer is 0.

In the fifth test case, n=1, a=[1]

So, I have one card: 1.

Nene has one card: 1.

pa=0

pb=0

pc=1

Answer is 0.

So, in all these cases, the answer seems to be equal to pa, the number of Type A integers.

Wait, but in the second test case, pa=2 and answer is 2.

In the third test case, pa=1 and answer is 1.

In the first test case, pa=1 and answer is 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, pa=0 and answer is 0.

So, perhaps the answer is equal to pa, the number of Type A integers.

But is that always the case?

Wait, let's think.

In Type A, I have both cards of an integer.

If I play both cards, the second one will score a point, provided that no other card of the same integer has been played in between.

But since it's the same integer, and I'm playing both cards, as long as I play the first card before the second one, the second one will score a point.

However, Nene can try to interfere by playing other cards in between.

Wait, but since it's my turns, and I can choose the order of playing my cards, I can play the first card of the Type A integer in one turn, and the second one later, ensuring that I score the point.

But Nene can try to play cards in between that might affect the scoring.

Wait, but since it's my turns, and I can choose which card to play when, perhaps I can manage to play the second card of the Type A integer at a time when no other card of the same integer is on the table.

Wait, but in Type A, both cards are with me, so no other card of the same integer is on the table until I play the first one.

Let me try to think step by step.

Suppose I have two cards of integer x (Type A).

I play the first card of x in one of my turns. At that point, there is no card of x on the table, so I don't score a point.

Then, later, when it's my turn again, I play the second card of x. At this point, there is already a card of x on the table (the one I played earlier), so I score a point.

Nene cannot interfere with this because she doesn't have any cards of x.

Therefore, for each Type A integer, I can score one point.

Similarly, for Type B integers, Nene can score one point per Type B integer.

For Type C integers, it's more complicated because the order in which we play the cards determines who scores the point.

Given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine, she will try to arrange her plays to maximize her points and minimize mine.

In Type C integers, since one card is with me and one with Nene, the player who plays their card second will score a point.

So, for each Type C integer, the player who plays second scores a point.

Given that Nene plays optimally, she will try to arrange her plays to maximize her points from Type C integers and minimize my points.

Wait, but in Type C, for each such integer, only one point can be scored, by the player who plays second.

So, for each Type C integer, either I score a point or Nene scores a point, depending on who plays their card second.

Nene wants to maximize her points, so she will try to play her Type C cards second as much as possible.

But I also want to maximize my points, so I need to play my Type C cards second as much as possible.

Wait, but Nene goes after me in turns, so the timing of turns matters.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider that the total number of points that can be scored is equal to the number of Type A and Type B integers (since for each Type A, I can score one point, and for each Type B, Nene can score one point), plus the number of Type C integers where the player who plays second scores a point.

But Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Wait, perhaps the answer is simply equal to the number of Type A integers.

In all the sample test cases, this seems to hold.

In the first test case, pa=1, answer=1.

Second test case, pa=2, answer=2.

Third test case, pa=1, answer=1.

Fourth and fifth test cases, pa=0, answer=0.

So, maybe the answer is indeed equal to pa.

But is this always true?

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=2.

My cards: [1,1]

Nene's cards: [2,2]

Here, pa=1 (integer 1), pb=1 (integer 2), pc=0.

According to the proposed answer, I should get pa=1 point.

Let's see how the game plays out.

Turn 1: I play one of the 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays one of her 2's. Table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play the other 1. Table: [1,2,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 4: Nene plays her other 2. Table: [1,2,1,2] → she scores 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

This matches pa=1.

Another scenario: n=2.

My cards: [1,2]

Nene's cards: [1,2]

Here, pa=0, pb=0, pc=2.

According to the proposed answer, I should get 0 points.

Let's see:

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 1. Table: [1,1] → she scores 1 point.

Turn 3: I play 2. Table: [1,1,2]

Turn 4: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,1,2,2] → she scores another point.

Total: I get 0 points, Nene gets 2 points.

This matches pa=0.

Another scenario: n=3.

My cards: [1,1,2]

Nene's cards: [2,3,3]

Here, pa=1 (integer 1), pb=1 (integer 3), pc=1 (integer 2).

According to the proposed answer, I should get pa=1 point.

Let's see:

Turn 1: I play one of the 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play the other 1. Table: [1,2,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 4: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,2,1,3]

Turn 5: I play 2. Table: [1,2,1,3,2] → I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,3] → she scores 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 1 point.

Wait, but according to the proposed answer, it should be pa=1, but in this case, I got 1 point.

But perhaps Nene could have played differently to prevent me from scoring the second point.

Alternative play:

Turn 1: I play one of the 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,3]

Turn 3: I play the other 1. Table: [1,3,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 4: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,3,1,2]

Turn 5: I play 2. Table: [1,3,1,2,2] → I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,3,1,2,2,3] → she scores 1 point.

Again, I get 1 point.

Another alternative:

Turn 1: I play 2. Table: [2]

Turn 2: Nene plays 2. Table: [2,2] → she scores 1 point.

Turn 3: I play one of the 1's. Table: [2,2,1]

Turn 4: Nene plays 3. Table: [2,2,1,3]

Turn 5: I play the other 1. Table: [2,2,1,3,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene plays 3. Table: [2,2,1,3,1,3] → she scores 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 2 points.

Still, I get 1 point, which matches pa=1.

So, in this case, it seems that I can get pa points, and Nene gets the rest.

Is this always the case?

Let me consider another example.

n=3.

My cards: [1,2,3]

Nene's cards: [1,2,3]

Here, pa=0, pb=0, pc=3.

According to the proposed answer, I should get 0 points.

Let's see:

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 1. Table: [1,1] → she scores 1 point.

Turn 3: I play 2. Table: [1,1,2]

Turn 4: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,1,2,2] → she scores another point.

Turn 5: I play 3. Table: [1,1,2,2,3]

Turn 6: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,1,2,2,3,3] → she scores another point.

Total: I get 0 points, Nene gets 3 points.

This matches pa=0.

Another scenario:

n=4.

My cards: [1,1,2,3]

Nene's cards: [2,3,4,4]

pa=1 (integer 1), pb=1 (integer 4), pc=2 (integers 2 and 3)

According to the proposed answer, I should get pa=1 point.

Let's see:

Turn 1: I play one of the 1's. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,2]

Turn 3: I play the other 1. Table: [1,2,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 4: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,2,1,3]

Turn 5: I play 2. Table: [1,2,1,3,2] → I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4]

Turn 7: I play 3. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3] → I score 1 point.

Turn 8: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,2,1,3,2,4,3,4] → she scores 1 point.

Total: I get 2 points, Nene gets 1 point.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, in this case, I should get only 1 point.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simulating the game.

Let me check again.

In the sample explanation for the first test case:

- You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table.

- Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table.

- You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table.

- Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table.

- You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table.

- Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table.

- You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table.

- Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table.

Total: You get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

In this scenario, I get only 1 point.

In my earlier simulation, I got 2 points, but that was because I played my cards in a different order.

But Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

So, in this case, Nene chooses to play her card in a way that minimizes my score.

In the sample explanation, Nene plays her 4 first, which allows me to score only one point from my second 1.

Then, she plays her 2 and 3 to score points.

So, perhaps the answer is indeed pa=1.

But why is that?

Is it because for each Type A integer, I can score one point, and for Type C integers, Nene can arrange her plays to prevent me from scoring points?

In the previous simulation where I got 2 points, perhaps Nene could have played differently to prevent that.

Alternative play:

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play 1. Table: [1,4,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 4: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,4,1,2]

Turn 5: I play 2. Table: [1,4,1,2,2] → I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,4,1,2,2,4] → she scores 1 point.

Turn 7: I play 3. Table: [1,4,1,2,2,4,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,4,1,2,2,4,3,3] → she scores 1 point.

Total: I get 2 points, Nene gets 2 points.

But in the sample explanation, I only get 1 point.

So, perhaps Nene can play in a way to prevent me from scoring two points.

Alternative play:

Turn 1: I play 1. Table: [1]

Turn 2: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,4]

Turn 3: I play 2. Table: [1,4,2]

Turn 4: Nene plays 4. Table: [1,4,2,4] → she scores 1 point.

Turn 5: I play 1. Table: [1,4,2,4,1] → I score 1 point.

Turn 6: Nene plays 2. Table: [1,4,2,4,1,2] → she scores 1 point.

Turn 7: I play 3. Table: [1,4,2,4,1,2,3]

Turn 8: Nene plays 3. Table: [1,4,2,4,1,2,3,3] → she scores 1 point.

Total: I get 1 point, Nene gets 3 points.

This matches the sample explanation.

So, in this case, by playing differently, Nene can limit my score to 1 point.

Therefore, the maximum I can get is pa=1.

Hence, perhaps the answer is indeed pa, the number of Type A integers.

Because for each Type A integer, I can score one point by playing the second card after the first one, and Nene can't interfere with that.

For Type C integers, Nene can arrange her plays to prevent me from scoring points.

Therefore, the maximum points I can get is equal to pa.

Hence, the solution is to count the number of Type A integers, which is the number of integers that appear twice in my hand.

In the code provided, this is implemented as:

def func_1(n, a):

from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(a)

pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))

return min(pairs, n // 2)

Wait, why is there a min(pairs, n // 2)?

In the earlier analysis, I didn't see any reason to take the minimum with n//2.

In the sample test cases, it seems that just taking pairs works.

In the first test case, pairs=1, n=4, n//2=2, min(1,2)=1, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, pairs=2, n=8, n//2=4, min(2,4)=2, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, pairs=1, n=8, n//2=4, min(1,4)=1, which matches the sample output.

In the fourth test case, pairs=0, n=3, n//2=1, min(0,1)=0, which matches the sample output.

In the fifth test case, pairs=0, n=1, n//2=0, min(0,0)=0, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that min(pairs, n//2) works in these cases.

But why n//2?

Is there a reason to cap the number of points I can get to n//2?

In the first test case, n=4, n//2=2, and pairs=1, which is less than 2, so it's fine.

In the second test case, n=8, n//2=4, pairs=2, which is less than 4.

In the third test case, n=8, n//2=4, pairs=1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, pairs=0.

So, in all sample test cases, pairs <= n//2, and the answer is pairs.

But is it possible that pairs > n//2?

Wait, let's see.

Given that I have n cards, and there are n integers, each appearing twice in the deck.

The maximum number of Type A integers is floor(n/2), because each Type A integer consumes two of my cards.

Wait, no, actually, no.

Wait, if I have n cards, and each Type A integer contributes two cards to my hand, then the number of Type A integers is at most floor(n/2), because each Type A integer takes two cards.

Wait, no, suppose n=4, I can have two Type A integers (both cards with me), which would take 4 cards.

Similarly, for n=5, I can have two Type A integers (4 cards) and one Type C integer (1 card).

Wait, so the maximum number of Type A integers is floor(n/2), because each Type A integer requires two cards.

Therefore, pairs <= floor(n/2).

Hence, min(pairs, floor(n/2)) is actually equal to pairs.

So, why is the min function there?

Perhaps to handle cases where pairs > floor(n/2), but according to the above, that's not possible.

Wait, let's check.

Given that I have n cards, and each Type A integer requires two cards, the maximum number of Type A integers is floor(n/2).

If n is even, floor(n/2)=n/2.

If n is odd, floor(n/2)=(n-1)/2.

But in the code, it's min(pairs, n//2), where n//2 is floor(n/2).

But since pairs cannot exceed floor(n/2), because each Type A integer requires two cards, and I have n cards, the maximum number of Type A integers is floor(n/2).

Therefore, pairs <= floor(n/2), so min(pairs, floor(n/2)) = pairs.

Hence, the min function is redundant.

In the sample test cases, it doesn't make a difference.

But perhaps there are test cases where pairs > floor(n/2), but that shouldn't be possible.

Wait, let's consider n=3.

Maximum Type A integers: floor(3/2)=1.

So, I can have one Type A integer (two cards) and one Type C integer (one card), totaling three cards.

If I try to have two Type A integers, that would require four cards, but I only have three cards, which is not possible.

Hence, pairs cannot exceed floor(n/2).

Therefore, min(pairs, floor(n/2)) = pairs.

So, the min function is unnecessary.

Perhaps it's there to ensure that the answer doesn't exceed floor(n/2), but given the constraints, it's not needed because pairs cannot exceed floor(n/2).

Hence, the function can be simplified to:

def func_1(n, a):

from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(a)

pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)

return pairs

But according to the earlier analysis, this should be correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
