Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this card game between me and Nene. We have a deck of 2n cards, and each card has an integer from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice. So, there are two cards for each integer.

In the beginning, the deck is distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. Each turn, the player whose turn it is selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and then checks if there's already a card with number x on the table. If there is, the player gets one point. Then, the selected card is placed on the table.

Important points to note:

1. The game is played with complete information; both players can see all the cards on the table at any time.

2. Nene is very smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to find out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. Let's consider a simple example to grasp what's happening.

Example 1 from the problem:

n = 4

My cards: 1, 1, 2, 3

Nene's cards: 2, 3, 4, 4

In the explanation, it shows a possible sequence of moves:

1. I play 1 (no point since 1 isn't on the table yet)

2. Nene plays 4 (no point)

3. I play 1 (point, since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4 (point)

5. I play 2 (no point)

6. Nene plays 2 (point)

7. I play 3 (no point)

8. Nene plays 3 (point)

Final scores: Me - 1, Nene - 3

It's claimed that I can't get more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally.

I need to generalize this to any n and any distribution of cards.

Let me think about what determines the points scored.

A point is scored if, when a player plays a card with number x, there's already a card with x on the table.

So, for a pair of identical numbers, the second time it's played, the player gets a point.

But, since both players can choose which card to play when, the sequence matters.

Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

I need to find a strategy that maximizes my points considering Nene's counter-strategy.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Let's define:

- For each number x from 1 to n, count how many times it appears in my hand.

- Since each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, if I have k x's, then Nene has (2 - k) x's.

Given that k can be 0, 1, or 2.

Wait, in the problem, it says each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand, so k can be 0, 1, or 2.

But in the input, it's guaranteed that each integer appears at most twice in my hand.

Wait, no, it says "each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times."

Wait, n cards, each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in my hand.

Wait, but n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each appearing at most twice.

Wait, but n cards, integers from 1 to n, each integer can appear up to twice in my hand.

Wait, but in total, each integer appears exactly twice in the entire deck.

So, in my hand, for each integer, it can appear 0, 1, or 2 times.

But the problem says "each integer from 1 through n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times."

Wait, but a1 to an are the n cards in my hand.

So, for each integer from 1 to n, it appears in my hand at most twice.

But since there are only n cards in my hand, and integers from 1 to n, with each integer appearing at most twice, it implies that some integers might appear once or twice, but not all can appear twice because that would require 2n cards, but I only have n cards.

Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, n cards, integers from 1 to n, each integer appears at most twice in the entire deck.

Wait, but in my hand, since I have n cards, and integers range from 1 to n, with each integer appearing exactly twice in the entire deck, it means that in my hand, each integer appears either 0, 1, or 2 times.

But the total number of cards is 2n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.

So, in my hand, which has n cards, each integer can appear 0, 1, or 2 times.

Similarly, Nene's hand will have the remaining cards.

I need to find out, given my hand, what is the maximum number of points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

Scenario 1: I have two cards with the same number.

For example, I have two 1's.

Then, Nene has the other two numbers that I don't have.

When I play one 1, if Nene plays a different number, then when I play the second 1, I get a point.

But Nene might play her cards in a way to interfere with me getting that point.

I need to consider how Nene plays in response to my moves.

Scenario 2: I have only one card of each number.

For example, I have 1, 2, 3, 4.

Then Nene has the other 1, 2, 3, 4.

In this case, whichever card I play, Nene can play a different number, so I never get a point.

Unless, perhaps, Nene chooses to play the same number as I did earlier, but that seems unlikely since she wants to maximize her points.

Wait, no, Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, in this scenario, it seems I can't get any points.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose I have 1, 2, 3, 4.

Nene has 1, 2, 3, 4.

I play 1.

Nene can choose to play 1, in which case, when I play my second 1, I get a point.

But in this case, since I have only one 1, that doesn't apply.

Wait, I have only one 1.

Wait, in this scenario, I have only one of each number.

So, when I play 1, Nene can play 2.

Then I play 3, Nene plays 4.

No points for me.

Alternatively, Nene could play 1 after I play 1, but that would give her a point.

But Nene wants to maximize her points, so she might do that.

Wait, but if she plays 1 after I play 1, then when I play my next card, say 2, Nene can play 3, and so on.

It's not clear.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the concept of "pairs."

For a number x, if I have two cards with x, then if I play both, I get one point for the second one, provided that Nene doesn't play x in between.

Similarly, if Nene has two cards with x, she can get a point for the second one.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

I need to maximize my points against her optimal play.

Let me think in terms of graph theory or something.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of matching.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of "conflicting" pairs.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of pairs that I have in my hand.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Define:

- For each number x, define kx as the number of times x appears in my hand.

- Then, Nene has (2 - kx) cards of x.

My goal is to maximize the number of times I play a card where the number is already on the table.

Similarly, Nene wants to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems like a zero-sum game.

I need to find the optimal strategy for both players.

This seems complex.

Let me look for patterns or simplifications.

Looking back at the first sample input:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

In this case, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

In the sequence provided in the explanation:

1. I play 1 (no point)

2. Nene plays 4 (no point)

3. I play 1 (point, since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4 (point)

5. I play 2 (no point)

6. Nene plays 2 (point)

7. I play 3 (no point)

8. Nene plays 3 (point)

Total points: Me -1, Nene -3

Is there a way for me to get more than one point?

Suppose I play 2 first:

1. I play 2 (no point)

2. Nene plays 4 (no point)

3. I play 1 (no point)

4. Nene plays 4 (point)

5. I play 1 (point)

6. Nene plays 3 (no point)

7. I play 3 (point)

8. Nene plays whatever.

Wait, in this sequence, I get two points.

But according to the problem, it's not possible to get more than one point if Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps Nene would play differently in response to my different moves.

Wait, in this sequence, maybe Nene would play differently.

Let me think again.

If I play 2 first:

1. I play 2.

2. Nene can play 3.

3. I play 1.

4. Nene plays 4.

5. I play 1 (point).

6. Nene plays 4 (point).

7. I play 3 (point).

8. Nene plays nothing.

Wait, but Nene has four cards: 2,3,4,4.

Wait, in this sequence, Nene only has one 2 and one 3.

Wait, no, in the first test case, Nene has two 4's and one 2 and one 3.

Wait, in the first test case, Nene has 2,3,4,4.

So, if I play 2 first:

1. I play 2.

2. Nene can play 4.

3. I play 1.

4. Nene plays 4.

5. I play 1 (point).

6. Nene plays 3 (point).

7. I have no more cards.

8. Nene plays nothing.

Total points: Me -1, Nene -2.

Wait, but in the original sequence, Nene ends up with 3 points.

So, perhaps by playing 2 first, I can get one point, and Nene gets 2.

But the original sequence shows Nene getting 3 points.

So, perhaps I can influence the number of points Nene gets by choosing different strategies.

But my goal is to maximize my points, assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a general approach.

I need to find a way to count the maximum number of points I can get.

Let me consider the number of pairs I have in my hand.

A pair is when I have two cards with the same number.

In the first test case, I have one pair: two 1's.

In that case, I can get one point by playing the second 1 after the first one is on the table.

Nene can interfere with this by playing a different card, but in the end, I can still get one point.

In the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

Nene's cards: the remaining cards.

In this case, I have two 4's.

So, I can potentially get one point from the second 4.

But Nene can play optimally to prevent me from getting that point.

Wait, but according to the sample output, the answer is 1, which matches the number of pairs I have.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have one pair and the answer is 1.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards:7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, which has two pairs: two 8's and two 5's, and the answer is 2.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 2 for the second test case.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that in the second test case, if both play optimally, I get 2 points and Nene gets 6.

But according to my earlier thought, the number of pairs in my hand corresponds to the number of points I can get.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have one pair and get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs and get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair and get one point.

In the fourth test case, I have no pairs and get zero points.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards:1,1, and Nene has nothing, but wait, n=1, 2n=2 cards, so Nene has no cards.

Wait, no, n=1, my cards:1,1, so Nene has nothing.

But in the sample input, it's:

1

1

So, n=1, a1=1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says n is at least 1, and a1 to an are the cards in my hand.

So, for n=1, I have one card with 1.

Then Nene has one card with 1.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's:

5

4

1 1 2 3

8

7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

8

7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6

3

1 2 3

1

1

And the output is:

1

2

1

0

0

Wait, for the last test case, n=1, a1=1, which means I have one card with 1, and Nene has one card with 1.

In this case, I can't get any points because I only have one 1.

So, the answer is 0, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, n=3, a1,a2,a3=1,2,3, so I have one each of 1,2,3, and Nene has one each of 1,2,3.

In this case, I can't get any points, so the answer is 0.

In the third test case, n=8, a1 to a8=7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6, which has one pair of 4's.

So, the answer is 1.

In the second test case, n=8, a1 to a8=7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, which has two pairs: two 8's and two 5's, so the answer is 2.

In the first test case, n=4, a1 to a4=1,1,2,3, which has one pair of 1's, and the answer is 1.

So, it seems that the number of pairs in my hand corresponds to the number of points I can get.

Wait, but in the explanation of the first test case, even though I have one pair, I can only get one point.

So, it seems that the number of pairs in my hand equals the number of points I can get.

Is this always true?

Wait, in the first test case, I have one pair and get one point.

In the second test case, I have two pairs and get two points.

In the third test case, I have one pair and get one point.

In the fourth test case, I have no pairs and get zero points.

In the fifth test case, I have one pair and get zero points.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=1, a1=1, which means I have one 1, and Nene has one 1.

I don't have a pair in my hand, so I can't get any points.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, the output is 0, which matches the number of pairs in my hand, which is zero.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have one pair and get one point.

Similarly, in the second test case, two pairs, two points.

In the third test case, one pair, one point.

In the fourth test case, no pairs, zero points.

In the fifth test case, no pairs, zero points.

So, it seems that the number of pairs in my hand directly corresponds to the number of points I can get.

Is this always the case?

Wait, but in the first test case, if I have one pair, and I can get one point, assuming Nene plays optimally.

But in the sequence I thought earlier, where I play 2 first, I can still get one point.

So, perhaps the number of pairs in my hand determines the maximum number of points I can get, assuming Nene plays optimally.

So, perhaps the answer is simply the number of pairs in my hand.

But I need to confirm if this is always true.

Let me think of a counterexample.

Suppose n=2.

My hand: 1,1.

Nene's hand: 2,2.

In this case, I have one pair of 1's.

If I play 1 first, Nene can play 2.

Then, I play 1 and get one point.

Nene plays 2 and gets one point.

Total points: Me -1, Nene -1.

Alternatively, if I play 1, Nene plays 2, I play 1 (point), Nene plays 2 (point).

Same as above.

So, I get one point, which matches the number of pairs in my hand.

Another example:

n=3.

My hand: 1,2,3.

Nene's hand:1,2,3.

In this case, I have no pairs.

No matter what I play, Nene can play a different number, so I can't get any points.

So, zero pairs, zero points.

Another example:

n=3.

My hand:1,1,2.

Nene's hand:2,3,3.

I have one pair of 1's.

Nene has one pair of 3's.

If I play 1 first, Nene can play 2.

Then, I play 1 and get one point.

Nene plays 3.

Then, I play 2.

Nene plays 3 and gets one point.

Total points: Me -1, Nene -1.

Alternatively, if I play 2 first, Nene can play 3.

Then, I play 1.

Nene plays 3 and gets one point.

Then, I play 1 and get one point.

Total points: Me -1, Nene -2.

So, in both strategies, I get one point, which matches the number of pairs in my hand.

Another example:

n=4.

My hand:1,1,2,2.

Nene's hand:3,3,4,4.

I have two pairs: two 1's and two 2's.

Nene has two pairs: two 3's and two 4's.

If I play 1 first, Nene can play 3.

I play 1 and get one point.

Nene plays 3 and gets one point.

I play 2.

Nene plays 4.

I play 2 and get one point.

Nene plays 4 and gets one point.

Total points: Me -2, Nene -2.

Alternatively, Nene might play differently, but I still get two points.

So, it seems that the number of pairs in my hand determines the number of points I can get.

Another example:

n=5.

My hand:1,1,2,3,4.

Nene's hand:2,3,4,5,5.

I have one pair of 1's.

Nene has one pair of 5's.

If I play 1 first, Nene can play 2.

I play 1 and get one point.

Nene plays 3.

I play 2.

Nene plays 4.

I play 3.

Nene plays 5.

I play 4.

Nene plays 5 and gets one point.

Total points: Me -1, Nene -1.

Alternatively, if I play 2 first, Nene can play 5.

I play 1.

Nene plays 5 and gets one point.

I play 1 and get one point.

Nene plays 3.

I play 3.

Nene plays 4.

I play 4.

Total points: Me -1, Nene -2.

Again, I get one point, which matches the number of pairs in my hand.

So, it seems consistent.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=1, a1=1.

I have one card with 1, Nene has one card with 1.

I don't have a pair, so I can't get any points.

Which matches the sample output of 0.

Hence, the number of pairs in my hand seems to determine the number of points I can get.

Therefore, the solution is to count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, I have one card with 1, which appears twice in the entire deck, but I only have one of them, so I don't have a pair in my hand.

Wait, no, in the fifth test case, n=1, a1=1, which means I have one card with 1, and Nene has one card with 1.

In this case, I don't have a pair in my hand.

Hence, the number of pairs in my hand is zero, and I can't get any points.

So, the answer is zero.

Hence, the general solution is to count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a1,a2,…,an at most 2 times."

Wait, no, n cards, each integer from 1 to n, each integer appears at most twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, n=1, a1=1, which is one card with 1.

So, in general, for n cards, with integers from 1 to n, each integer appears at most twice in my hand.

Hence, the number of pairs in my hand is the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

And this seems to correspond to the number of points I can get.

Hence, the solution is to count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Wait, but in the second test case, n=8, a1 to a8=7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, the frequencies are:

7:1

4:1

1:1

2:1

8:2

5:2

So, two pairs: two 8's and two 5's.

Hence, I can get two points.

Which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=8, a1 to a8=7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

Frequencies:

7:1

1:1

4:2

5:1

3:1

2:1

6:1

So, one pair: two 4's.

Hence, one point.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, it seems that counting the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand gives the correct number of points I can get.

Therefore, the solution is to count the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Hence, the program provided seems to implement this correctly.

In the program:

def func_1(n, a):

from collections import Counter

counter = Counter(a)

pairs = sum((1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2))

return min(pairs, n // 2)

def func_2():

import sys

input = sys.stdin.read

data = input().split()

idx = 0

t = int(data[idx])

idx += 1

results = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[idx])

idx += 1

a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))

idx += n

results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:

print(result)

In func_1, it counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in my hand.

Then, it takes the minimum of that count and n//2.

Wait, why n//2?

In the examples I considered earlier, I didn't see any relevance of n//2.

In the first test case, n=4, pairs=1, n//2=2, min(1,2)=1, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, n=8, pairs=2, n//2=4, min(2,4)=2, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, n=8, pairs=1, n//2=4, min(1,4)=1, which matches.

In the fourth test case, n=3, pairs=0, n//2=1, min(0,1)=0, which matches.

In the fifth test case, n=1, pairs=0, n//2=0, min(0,0)=0, which matches.

So, why is there a min(pairs, n//2)?

Is it possible to have more pairs than n//2?

Wait, n cards, each integer from 1 to n, each appearing at most twice in my hand.

The maximum number of pairs I can have is n//2.

For example, if n=4, maximum pairs=2.

If n=5, maximum pairs=2.

But in the first test case, n=4, pairs=1, which is less than n//2=2.

In the second test case, n=8, pairs=2, which is less than n//2=4.

So, in general, the number of pairs can be up to n//2.

But in the examples, pairs are less than or equal to n//2.

Is it possible to have pairs greater than n//2?

Wait, no, because n cards, each integer appears at most twice in my hand.

Hence, the maximum number of pairs is n//2.

For example, if n=4, maximum pairs=2.

If n=5, maximum pairs=2.

Hence, min(pairs, n//2) is equal to pairs.

Hence, perhaps the min is redundant.

But in the program, it's there.

Is there a scenario where min(pairs, n//2) is necessary?

Wait, suppose n=4, and my hand has two pairs: say, two 1's and two 2's.

Then, pairs=2, n//2=2, min(2,2)=2.

Another scenario: n=5, pairs=2, n//2=2, min(2,2)=2.

Another scenario: n=3, pairs=1, n//2=1, min(1,1)=1.

Another scenario: n=2, pairs=1, n//2=1, min(1,1)=1.

Another scenario: n=1, pairs=0, n//2=0, min(0,0)=0.

So, in all these cases, min(pairs, n//2) equals pairs.

Is there a case where pairs > n//2?

Wait, no, because with n cards and each integer appearing at most twice in my hand, the maximum number of pairs is n//2.

Hence, min(pairs, n//2) is redundant, and pairs alone is sufficient.

But perhaps the programmer added it just to be safe.

But in all the possible cases, pairs <= n//2, so min(pairs, n//2) = pairs.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points we can achieve in a card game against Nene, given optimal play from both sides.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The deck is divided between us and Nene, each receiving `n` cards.
   - We take turns playing one card at a time, and points are scored if a card played matches a card already on the table.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize points, we need to play pairs of cards strategically.
   - The number of pairs we hold in our hand directly correlates to the points we can score, assuming optimal play.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Each pair of identical cards in our hand can potentially give us one point if we play the second card after it has already been placed on the table.
   - Nene will play optimally to maximize her points and minimize ours, but the number of pairs we hold determines our potential points.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Count the frequency of each integer in our hand.
   - Count how many integers appear exactly twice in our hand, as these form pairs.
   - The count of such pairs is the maximum points we can achieve.

## Solution Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, a):
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

## Explanation

- **Counting Pairs**:
  - We use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in our hand.
  - We then count how many integers appear exactly twice, as each such integer forms a pair that can be used to score a point.

- **Optimal Points Calculation**:
  - The number of pairs in our hand directly corresponds to the maximum points we can achieve.
  - We take the minimum of the number of pairs and `n//2` to ensure we do not overcount, though in practice, the number of pairs cannot exceed `n//2`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution efficiently processes multiple test cases within the time constraints by reading all input at once and processing it in a loop.
  - The use of list comprehensions and generator expressions ensures that the code is both concise and performant.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of points we can achieve in a card game against Nene, given optimal play from both sides.

   - We have a deck of `2n` cards with integers from 1 to n, each appearing exactly twice.
   - The deck is divided between us and Nene, each receiving `n` cards.
   - We take turns playing one card at a time, and points are scored if a card played matches a card already on the table.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize points, we need to play pairs of cards strategically.
   - The number of pairs we hold in our hand directly correlates to the points we can score, assuming optimal play.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Each pair of identical cards in our hand can potentially give us one point if we play the second card after it has already been placed on the table.
   - Nene will play optimally to maximize her points and minimize ours, but the number of pairs we hold determines our potential points.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Count the frequency of each integer in our hand.
   - Count how many integers appear exactly twice in our hand, as these form pairs.
   - The count of such pairs is the maximum points we can achieve.

## Solution Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, a):
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)
    return min(pairs, n // 2)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        results.append(func_1(n, a))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

## Explanation

- **Counting Pairs**:
  - We use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in our hand.
  - We then count how many integers appear exactly twice, as each such integer forms a pair that can be used to score a point.

- **Optimal Points Calculation**:
  - The number of pairs in our hand directly corresponds to the maximum points we can achieve.
  - We take the minimum of the number of pairs and `n//2` to ensure we do not overcount, though in practice, the number of pairs cannot exceed `n//2`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution efficiently processes multiple test cases within the time constraints by reading all input at once and processing it in a loop.
  - The use of list comprehensions and generator expressions ensures that the code is both concise and performant.
