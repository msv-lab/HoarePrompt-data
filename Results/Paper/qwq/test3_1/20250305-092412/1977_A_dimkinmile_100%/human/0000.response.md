Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has some cubes, and he wants to build a tower by adding or removing one cube at a time in each move. He can either put one cube on top or remove one cube from the top. After a certain number of moves, n, I need to figure out if it's possible for the tower to have exactly m cubes.

First, I need to understand the operations. Each move is either adding one cube or removing one cube from the top. That means the tower's height can increase or decrease by one with each move.

I need to find out if, after n moves, starting from zero cubes, I can end up with exactly m cubes in the tower.

Let me think about this step by step.

Initially, the tower has zero cubes. Let's consider the possible sequences of moves.

Suppose n = 3 and m = 3. That means Nikita makes three moves, and he wants to have three cubes in the tower.

If he adds a cube in each move, he'll have three cubes: +1, +1, +1. So, yes, that's possible.

What if n = 2 and m = 4? He makes two moves but wants to have four cubes.

If he adds a cube in the first move and adds again in the second move, he'll have two cubes: +1, +1.

Alternatively, if he adds and then removes, he'll have one cube: +1, -1.

Or removes and adds: -1 (can't remove from zero, but maybe it's allowed to have negative tower height? Wait, but the problem says "the tower doesn't have any cubes" initially, and "removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower", so perhaps he can't remove if there are no cubes.

Hmm, that might be a point to clarify.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "In one move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower."

And it also says: "the tower doesn't have any cubes initially."

So, if he tries to remove a cube when there are none, is that allowed? The problem doesn't specify what happens in that case.

But perhaps we can assume that he can't remove a cube if there are none, meaning that a remove operation is only possible if there is at least one cube.

So, in the sequence of moves, he can't have a remove operation before an add operation if there are no cubes.

This seems a bit tricky to handle directly.

Is there a smarter way to approach this problem?

Let me consider the net effect of the moves.

Each add operation increases the tower's height by one, and each remove operation decreases it by one.

So, if he makes a certain number of add operations, say a, and remove operations, say r, then the final height h will be:

h = a - r

But also, the total number of moves is n = a + r

We need h = m

So, we have:

m = a - r

n = a + r

We can solve these equations for a and r.

Adding the two equations:

n + m = 2a => a = (n + m)/2

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

n - m = 2r => r = (n - m)/2

So, a = (n + m)/2

r = (n - m)/2

Now, since a and r have to be non-negative integers (because you can't have negative operations), we need:

(n + m)/2 >= 0

(n - m)/2 >= 0

And both (n + m)/2 and (n - m)/2 should be integers.

But, since n and m are both integers, (n + m)/2 and (n - m)/2 will be integers only if n + m is even and n - m is even.

Wait, actually, (n + m) and (n - m) being even is equivalent to n and m both being even or both being odd.

Because:

If n and m are both even, then n + m and n - m are both even.

If n and m are both odd, then n + m is even and n - m is even.

If one is even and the other is odd, then n + m and n - m are both odd, so (n - m)/2 would not be an integer.

So, for a and r to be integers, n and m need to be both even or both odd.

Wait, but that's not quite right.

Let me think again.

For (n + m)/2 to be an integer, n + m must be even.

Similarly, for (n - m)/2 to be an integer, n - m must be even.

So, both n + m and n - m must be even.

Now, n + m and n - m are both even only if n and m are both even or both odd.

Because:

If n is even and m is even:

n + m is even, n - m is even.

If n is odd and m is odd:

n + m is even, n - m is even.

If n is even and m is odd:

n + m is odd, n - m is odd.

If n is odd and m is even:

n + m is odd, n - m is odd.

So, the condition is that n and m are both even or both odd.

But, we also need to ensure that a and r are non-negative.

So, a = (n + m)/2 >= 0

r = (n - m)/2 >= 0

Since n and m are both at least 1 according to the constraints, and n can be greater than or equal to m, I think this covers it.

Wait, but m can be zero, but according to the constraints, m is at least 1.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= n, m <= 100.

So, m is at least 1.

And n is at least 1.

So, we need to check if n and m are both even or both odd, and that (n - m)/2 >= 0.

Wait, but in the equations:

a = (n + m)/2

r = (n - m)/2

We need both a and r to be non-negative integers.

So, (n + m)/2 >= 0, which is always true since n and m are positive.

And (n - m)/2 >= 0, which implies n >= m.

So, in addition to n and m being both even or both odd, we need n >= m.

Wait, but in the sample input, n can be less than m.

Wait, no, in the sample input, in the first case, n=3, m=3; second n=2, m=4; third n=5, m=3.

So, n can be less than m.

But according to the equations, a = (n + m)/2, r = (n - m)/2.

Wait, if n < m, then r = (n - m)/2 < 0, which is not allowed.

So, n must be greater than or equal to m.

Wait, but in the sample input, the third case is n=5, m=3.

So, n=5, m=3.

Then, a = (5 + 3)/2 = 4, r = (5 - 3)/2 = 1.

Which is fine, a=4, r=1.

So, n >= m is a necessary condition.

But in the second sample input, n=2, m=4.

Then, a = (2 + 4)/2 = 3, r = (2 - 4)/2 = -1.

Which is not allowed, so "No".

So, the condition is:

- n >= m

- (n - m) is even (so that (n - m)/2 is an integer)

Wait, but in the first point, n >= m ensures that r >= 0.

And the second point ensures that r is an integer.

And a = (n + m)/2 should also be an integer.

But since n and m are both integers, and (n - m)/2 is an integer (from the second condition), and (n + m)/2 being an integer is equivalent to n and m being both even or both odd.

Wait, but actually, (n + m)/2 being an integer is equivalent to (n - m)/2 being an integer.

Because:

(n + m)/2 - (n - m)/2 = m/1 = m, which is an integer.

So, if one of them is an integer, the other is also an integer.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, (n + m)/2 and (n - m)/2 are both integers only if n and m are both even or both odd.

So, to sum up, the condition is:

- n >= m

- n and m are both even or both odd

That should be the condition to output "Yes", otherwise "No".

Let me verify this with the sample inputs.

First sample input:

n=3, m=3

Both odd, n >= m -> "Yes"

Second sample input:

n=2, m=4

Both even, but n < m -> "No" (wait, n=2 < m=4, so n < m)

Wait, but n=2, m=4 are both even, but n < m.

According to my condition, n >= m and both even or both odd.

So, n < m, so "No"

Which matches the sample output.

Third sample input:

n=5, m=3

Both odd, n >= m -> "Yes"

Seems correct.

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=4, m=2

Both even, n >= m -> "Yes"

n=4, m=2

a = (4 + 2)/2 = 3, r = (4 - 2)/2 = 1

Which is valid.

Another example:

n=3, m=2

n=3 odd, m=2 even -> different parity, so "No"

n=4, m=3

n=4 even, m=3 odd -> different parity, "No"

n=1, m=1

Both odd, n >= m -> "Yes"

n=1, m=1

a=(1+1)/2=1, r=(1-1)/2=0 -> valid

n=0, m=0

But n >=1 according to constraints, so not needed.

Another point to consider: can r be zero?

Yes, r can be zero, meaning no removal operations.

Similarly, a can be zero, but according to the constraints, m >=1, so a cannot be zero if m >=1.

Wait, a = (n + m)/2 >=1 if m >=1 and n >= m.

So, a is at least 1.

Ok, that seems fine.

So, in code, for each test case, read n and m, check if n >= m and n and m are both even or both odd.

If yes, print "Yes"; else, "No"

Now, looking at the given program:

kreker = int(input())

for i in range(kreker):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:

print('Yes')

else:

print('No')

So, it defines a function func_1() that reads n and m, and checks if (n - m) is even and n - m >= 0.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should also check if n and m are both even or both odd.

But in the code, it only checks if (n - m) is even and n >= m.

Is that sufficient?

Wait, (n - m) being even is equivalent to n and m being both even or both odd.

Because:

If n and m are both even, n - m is even.

If n and m are both odd, n - m is even.

If one is even and one is odd, n - m is odd.

So, checking (n - m) % 2 == 0 is equivalent to checking if n and m are both even or both odd.

And n - m >= 0 is equivalent to n >= m.

So, yes, this condition covers both requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after performing `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing one cube from the tower.

## Approach

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - We start with zero cubes.
   - Each move can either add one cube or remove one cube, provided there is at least one cube to remove.
   - We need to check if after `n` moves, the tower has exactly `m` cubes.

2. **Insight**:
   - Let `a` be the number of add operations and `r` be the number of remove operations.
   - We have two equations:
     - `a + r = n` (total moves)
     - `a - r = m` (net addition results in `m` cubes)
   - Solving these equations:
     - `a = (n + m) / 2`
     - `r = (n - m) / 2`
   - For `a` and `r` to be valid (non-negative integers), `(n + m)` and `(n - m)` must be even, and `n >= m`.

3. **Condition**:
   - `n >= m`
   - `(n - m)` is even

## Solution Code

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases, `kreker`.
  - For each test case, read pairs of `n` and `m`.

- **Logic**:
  - Check if `(n - m)` is even and `n >= m`.
  - If both conditions are satisfied, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

This approach efficiently determines the possibility of achieving exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves by leveraging simple arithmetic conditions, ensuring optimal performance for the given constraints.
