Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, and I need to determine for various subarrays whether they meet this "good" criteria based on the conditions provided.

First, let's understand what makes an array "good." There are three conditions that need to be satisfied:

1. The sum of the elements in array `a` should be equal to the sum of the elements in another integer array `b` of the same length.

2. For every index `i`, `a_i` should not be equal to `b_i`.

3. Every element in `b` should be greater than zero.

Given that, I need to process multiple queries, each asking whether a particular subarray of the given array `c` is "good" based on these conditions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since we're dealing with subarrays and queries, efficiency is key because the constraints are quite large: `n` and `q` can be up to 3*10^5, and the sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases doesn't exceed that. So, any solution that's O(n*q) will be too slow; I need something smarter, probably O(n log n) or better.

Let's consider the conditions for a subarray to be "good."

Condition 1: The sum of `a` should equal the sum of `b`. Since `b` is an array of positive integers and `b_i != a_i` for all `i`, we need to find such a `b`.

Condition 3 implies that `b_i >= 1` for all `i`.

Given that `b_i != a_i`, and `b_i >= 1`, let's think about what `b_i` can be.

For each `a_i`, since `b_i` must be different and at least 1, the smallest `b_i` can be is `max(1, a_i - 1)` if `a_i > 1`, or `2` if `a_i == 1`.

Wait, no. If `a_i == 1`, then `b_i` cannot be 1 (since `b_i != a_i`), so it must be at least 2.

Similarly, if `a_i > 1`, then `b_i` can be either `a_i - 1` or `a_i + 1` or any other value except `a_i`, but since we want to minimize the sum of `b` to see the lower bound, perhaps considering `b_i = a_i - 1` if `a_i > 1`, else `b_i = 2` when `a_i == 1`.

Wait, but `b_i` must be at least 1. So, for `a_i > 1`, `b_i = a_i - 1` is fine as long as it's at least 1. If `a_i == 1`, then `b_i` must be at least 2.

So, for each `a_i`, the minimal possible `b_i` is:

- If `a_i > 1`: `b_i = a_i - 1`

- If `a_i == 1`: `b_i = 2`

This way, `b_i != a_i` and `b_i >= 1`.

Then, for the subarray from `l` to `r`, the minimal possible sum of `b` would be the sum of these minimal `b_i` for each `i` in `[l, r]`.

If the sum of `a` in `[l, r]` is equal to this minimal sum of `b` in `[l, r]`, then it's possible to choose such a `b` that satisfies all conditions.

Wait, but the sum of `a` must equal the sum of `b`. So, if the sum of `a` is equal to the minimal sum of `b`, and this minimal sum is achievable by setting `b_i = a_i - 1` for `a_i > 1` and `b_i = 2` for `a_i == 1`, then it's possible.

But, I need to ensure that for all `i`, `b_i != a_i`. In this minimal `b`, that's satisfied because:

- For `a_i > 1`, `b_i = a_i - 1 != a_i`

- For `a_i == 1`, `b_i = 2 != a_i`

And `b_i >= 1` in all cases.

Therefore, if the sum of `a` in `[l, r]` is equal to the sum of these minimal `b_i` in `[l, r]`, then it's "good."

But wait, there might be cases where even if the sums are equal, it's not possible due to some constraints.

Wait, no. If I can set `b_i` to `a_i - 1` for `a_i > 1` and `2` for `a_i == 1`, and the sum matches, then it's valid.

But, is there any case where the sum matches but there exists an `i` where `b_i` cannot be set appropriately?

I don't think so, because this minimal `b` satisfies all the conditions.

Therefore, for each query `[l, r]`, I need to check if the sum of `a` in `[l, r]` is equal to the sum of minimal `b_i` in `[l, r]`.

Additionally, there's a condition that `x == y`, which seems to map to `l == r`, meaning the subarray consists of a single element.

In such a case, for a single element, the sum of `a` is `a_i`, and the minimal sum of `b` is:

- If `a_i > 1`: `a_i - 1`

- If `a_i == 1`: `2`

So, for a single element:

- If `a_i > 1`, check if `a_i == a_i - 1`, which is never true.

- If `a_i == 1`, check if `1 == 2`, which is false.

Therefore, for single-element subarrays, it's always "NO", except maybe in cases where `a_i == 2` and `b_i == 1`, but according to the conditions, `b_i != a_i`, so `b_i` cannot be `1` if `a_i == 1`, but in this case, `a_i == 1` is already handled as `b_i >= 2`.

Wait, no, if `a_i == 1`, `b_i` must be at least `2`, so sum of `b` is at least `2`, while sum of `a` is `1`, which is less than `2`, so it's not equal, hence "NO".

If `a_i > 1`, sum of `a` is `a_i`, sum of minimal `b` is `a_i - 1`, which is less than `a_i`, so not equal, hence "NO".

Wait, but according to the sample input and output, there are cases where the answer is "YES".

Looking back at the sample input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

So, for the entire array `1 2 1 4 5`, the sum is `13`. The minimal sum of `b` would be:

- For `1`: `2`

- For `2`: `1`

- For `1`: `2`

- For `4`: `3`

- For `5`: `4`

Sum of `b`: `2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12`, which is less than `13`, so sum of `a` is `13`, sum of `b` is `12`, which are not equal, but the output is "YES". So, something's wrong with my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the sum of `a` can be equal to the sum of `b` if I choose `b_i` appropriately, not necessarily choosing the minimal `b_i`.

Wait, but the condition is that sum of `a` equals sum of `b`, and `b_i != a_i`, and `b_i > 0`.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to choose `b_i`, not just the minimal one.

In the earlier example, sum of `a` is `13`, sum of minimal `b` is `12`. But maybe there's a way to choose `b_i` such that sum of `b` is `13`.

For instance:

- `a`: [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]

- Possible `b`: [2, 1, 2, 3, 5] sum is `13`, which matches sum of `a`.

Here, for `a_i = 1`, `b_i = 2`; for `a_i = 2`, `b_i = 1`; for `a_i = 1`, `b_i = 2`; for `a_i = 4`, `b_i = 3`; for `a_i = 5`, `b_i = 5` (but wait, `b_i` cannot be equal to `a_i`, so `b_i` cannot be `5` if `a_i = 5`).

Ah, so in this case, for `a_i = 5`, I cannot set `b_i = 5`, I need to set `b_i` to something else, like `4` or `6`, etc.

So, let's adjust `b` to [2,1,2,3,4], sum is `12`, which is less than `13`.

Alternatively, [2,1,2,4,4], sum is `13`, which matches sum of `a`.

Wait, but in this case, for `a_i = 5`, `b_i = 4` which is less than `5`, and for `a_i = 4`, `b_i = 4`, which violates `b_i != a_i`.

Wait, no, for `a_i = 4`, `b_i` cannot be `4`, so this is invalid.

So, adjust `b` to [2,1,2,5,4], sum is `14`, which is greater than `13`.

Not matching.

Alternatively, [2,1,2,3,5], sum is `13`, which matches, but `b_i = 5` when `a_i = 5`, which is invalid.

So, need to avoid that.

Wait, perhaps [2,1,2,4,4], sum is `13`, which matches, and all `b_i != a_i`.

Wait, in `a`: [1,2,1,4,5], `b`: [2,1,2,4,4]

Here:

- `a[1]=1 != b[1]=2`

- `a[2]=2 != b[2]=1`

- `a[3]=1 != b[3]=2`

- `a[4]=4 != b[4]=4` → invalid

Wait, no, `b[4]=4` is equal to `a[4]=4`, which violates condition 2.

So, this is invalid.

Another attempt: [2,1,2,3,5], sum is `13`, which matches, but `b[5]=5 == a[5]=5`, invalid.

Alternatively: [2,1,2,4,4], sum is `13`, which matches, and `b[4]=4 != a[4]=4` → invalid.

Wait, no, it's equal, so invalid.

Another attempt: [2,1,2,5,3], sum is `13`, which matches, and all `b_i != a_i`.

Wait, `a`: [1,2,1,4,5], `b`: [2,1,2,5,3]

- `1 != 2`

- `2 != 1`

- `1 != 2`

- `4 != 5`

- `5 != 3`

All conditions satisfied.

So, it's possible.

Therefore, even if the sum of minimal `b` is less than sum of `a`, it's still possible to choose higher `b_i` to match the sum.

So, perhaps the condition is not just that sum of `a` equals sum of minimal `b`, but something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the sum of `a` is at least the sum of minimal `b`, and that the sum of `a` is not equal to the sum of `a` itself, because if sum of `a` equals sum of `b`, and `b_i != a_i` for all `i`, it's possible only if certain conditions are met.

This seems more complicated than I initially thought.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that for the array to be "good", the sum of `a` should be equal to the sum of `b`, where `b_i != a_i` and `b_i > 0`.

This implies that for each `i`, `b_i` can be any positive integer except `a_i`.

So, for each `i`, the possible values for `b_i` are `{1,2,3,...} \ {a_i}`.

Now, the problem reduces to finding if there exists a sequence `b` where `b_i != a_i`, `b_i > 0`, and sum of `b` equals sum of `a`.

This seems similar to finding if there's a solution to the equation where each `b_i` is `a_i` plus or minus some value, but not equal to `a_i`, and all `b_i` are positive.

This sounds like a system of equations with constraints.

But that might be too slow for the given constraints.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can look at the difference between `b_i` and `a_i`.

Let `d_i = b_i - a_i`. Then, `d_i != 0` for all `i`, and `b_i = a_i + d_i`.

Given that `b_i > 0`, and `b_i != a_i`, we have:

- `a_i + d_i > 0`

- `d_i != 0`

So, `d_i` can be any non-zero integer such that `a_i + d_i > 0`.

Therefore, `d_i >= 1 - a_i` if `a_i >= 1`, but since `a_i >= 1`, `1 - a_i <= 0`, but `d_i` cannot be zero.

So, `d_i >= 1` or `d_i <= -1`.

But since `b_i > 0`, `d_i > -a_i`.

Given that, for each `i`, `d_i` can be any integer except zero, and `b_i = a_i + d_i > 0`.

The sum of `d_i` over `[l, r]` must be zero, because sum of `b` equals sum of `a`.

Therefore, sum of `d_i` from `l` to `r` must be zero.

Additionally, for each `i`, `d_i != 0` and `a_i + d_i > 0`.

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a set of `d_i` for `i` in `[l, r]` such that:

- `d_i != 0`

- `a_i + d_i > 0`

- sum of `d_i` from `l` to `r` is zero.

This seems tricky, but perhaps there's a way to determine this efficiently.

Let me consider that the sum of `d_i` is zero, and each `d_i` is non-zero.

This implies that the positive and negative `d_i` balance each other out.

But I also have the constraint that `a_i + d_i > 0`.

Given that, perhaps I can find the minimal and maximal possible sums of `d_i` and see if zero lies within that range.

But this might be too involved.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I calculate the minimal possible sum of `b_i` for `[l, r]`, which is sum of `a_i - 1` for `a_i > 1`, and `2` for `a_i == 1`.

Similarly, the maximal possible sum of `b_i` is unbounded because `b_i` can be arbitrarily large as long as `b_i != a_i` and `b_i > 0`.

But in our case, we need the sum of `b_i` to equal the sum of `a_i`.

So, if the sum of minimal `b_i` is less than or equal to the sum of `a_i`, and the sum of maximal `b_i` is greater than or equal to the sum of `a_i`, then it's possible to choose `b_i` such that their sum equals the sum of `a_i`.

Wait, but the sum of maximal `b_i` is unbounded, so that's not a useful check.

But, in reality, since we can choose `b_i` to be any value except `a_i` as long as `b_i > 0`, and we need their sum to equal the sum of `a_i`, perhaps the only condition is that the sum of minimal `b_i` is less than or equal to the sum of `a_i`.

Wait, but in the earlier example, sum of minimal `b_i` is `12`, sum of `a_i` is `13`, and it's possible to choose `b_i` such that sum is `13`.

So, perhaps if the sum of minimal `b_i` is less than or equal to the sum of `a_i`, and the sum of `a_i` is greater than the sum of `(a_i - 1)` for `a_i > 1` and `2` for `a_i == 1`, then it's possible.

Wait, but in the single element case, like `a_i = 1`, sum of minimal `b_i` is `2`, which is greater than `1`, so it's "NO".

Similarly, for `a_i = 2`, sum of minimal `b_i` is `1`, which is less than `2`, and perhaps it's possible to choose `b_i = 1` (since `a_i = 2`, `b_i = 1 != 2` and `1 > 0`), and sum matches.

Wait, but in this case, sum of `a` is `2`, sum of minimal `b` is `1`, which is less than `2`, and we can choose `b_i = 1`, which is valid.

So, in this case, sum of `b` is `1`, which is less than sum of `a`, but we need them to be equal.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the sum of `a` is greater than or equal to the sum of minimal `b_i`, and that the sum of `a` is at least the sum of minimal `b_i`.

But in the sample input, for the entire array, sum of `a` is `13`, sum of minimal `b` is `12`, and it's "YES".

For subarray `c[4..4]`, which is `4`, sum of `a` is `4`, sum of minimal `b` is `3`, but it's "NO".

Wait, according to my earlier logic, if sum of `a` is greater than or equal to sum of minimal `b`, it should be "YES", but in the sample output, it's "NO".

Wait, perhaps there's another condition I'm missing.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

- Query 1: [1,2,1,4,5] sum=13, minimal b sum=12, output "YES"

- Query 2: [4] sum=4, minimal b sum=3, output "NO"

- Query 3: [1,4] sum=5, minimal b sum=2+3=5, output "YES"

- Query 4: [1,2,1] sum=4, minimal b sum=2+1+2=5, output "NO"

Wait, in query 3, sum of `a` is `5`, sum of minimal `b` is `2 + 3 = 5`, which matches, and output is "YES".

In query 4, sum of `a` is `4`, sum of minimal `b` is `2 + 1 + 2 = 5`, which is greater than `4`, and output is "NO".

Wait, this suggests that when sum of minimal `b` is less than or equal to sum of `a`, it's "YES", unless sum of minimal `b` is greater than sum of `a`, then it's "NO".

But in query 3, sum of minimal `b` equals sum of `a`, and it's "YES".

In query 4, sum of minimal `b` is greater than sum of `a`, and it's "NO".

In query 1, sum of minimal `b` is less than sum of `a`, and it's "YES".

In query 2, sum of minimal `b` is less than sum of `a` (3 < 4), and it's "NO". Wait, hold on.

Wait, for query 2: subarray [4], sum of `a` is `4`, sum of minimal `b` is `3` (since `a_i = 4`, minimal `b_i = 3`), which is less than `4`, but output is "NO". This contradicts my earlier assumption.

So, perhaps there's another condition.

Wait, maybe the condition is that the sum of `a` is equal to the sum of minimal `b`, and the subarray length is greater than 1.

In query 3, subarray [1,4], length 2, sum of `a` = 5, sum of minimal `b` = 5, output "YES"

In query 4, subarray [1,2,1], length 3, sum of `a` = 4, sum of minimal `b` = 5, output "NO"

In query 1, subarray [1,2,1,4,5], length 5, sum of `a` = 13, sum of minimal `b` = 12, output "YES"

In query 2, subarray [4], length 1, sum of `a` = 4, sum of minimal `b` = 3, output "NO"

So, perhaps for subarrays of length greater than 1, if sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b`, then "YES", else "NO"

In query 3: 5 >= 5 → "YES"

Query 4: 4 < 5 → "NO"

Query 1: 13 >= 12 → "YES"

Query 2: 4 > 3 → "NO"

This seems consistent with the sample output.

Therefore, perhaps the condition is:

- If the length of the subarray is greater than 1, and sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b`, then "YES"

- Else, "NO"

But need to verify this.

In query 2, length is 1, sum of `a` = 4, sum of minimal `b` = 3, which is "NO"

In query 3, length >1, sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b` → "YES"

In query 4, length >1, sum of `a` < sum of minimal `b` → "NO"

In query 1, length >1, sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b` → "YES"

Seems consistent.

But wait, in query 1, sum of `a` = 13, sum of minimal `b` = 12, which satisfies sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b`, so "YES"

In query 2, length =1, sum of `a` =4, sum of minimal `b` =3, which is sum of `a` > sum of minimal `b`, but output is "NO"

So, perhaps for single-element subarrays, it's always "NO", regardless of the sums.

And for multi-element subarrays, if sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b`, then "YES", else "NO"

This aligns with the sample output.

So, the condition can be:

- If the subarray length is 1, output "NO"

- Else, if sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b`, output "YES"

- Else, output "NO"

This seems to fit the sample input and output.

Therefore, I can implement this logic.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to compute prefix sums of `a` and prefix sums of minimal `b`.

Then, for each query, compute sum of `a` from `l` to `r`, and sum of minimal `b` from `l` to `r`, and apply the above conditions.

Given that, I can precompute two arrays:

- `a_prefix`: prefix sums of `a`

- `bmin_prefix`: prefix sums of minimal `b`

Then, for each query, compute:

- sum_a = a_prefix[r] - a_prefix[l-1]

- sum_bmin = bmin_prefix[r] - bmin_prefix[l-1]

- If (r - l + 1) > 1 and sum_a >= sum_bmin, output "YES"

- Else, output "NO"

This should be efficient enough, as it's O(n + q), which is acceptable given the constraints.

Now, I need to implement this logic.

Looking back at the given program, let's see if it matches this logic.

In the given program:

- It reads `t` test cases.

- For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, then reads array `a`.

- Then, it computes array `b`, where `b[i] = b[i-1] + x`, where `x = 1` if `a[i] > 1` else `2`.

- Then, it computes prefix sums of `a` using `accumulate`.

- Then, for each query, it reads `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x-1] < b[y] - b[x-1]` or `x == y`, else 'YES'.

So, it's computing prefix sums of `a` and prefix sums of `b`, where `b[i]` is accumulated sums of minimal `b_i`.

Then, for each query, it checks if sum of `a` from `x` to `y` is less than sum of minimal `b` from `x` to `y`, or if `x == y`, then 'NO', else 'YES'.

This aligns with the logic I derived: for single-element subarrays (`x == y`), output 'NO', and for multi-element subarrays, if sum of `a` >= sum of minimal `b`, then 'YES', else 'NO'.

Therefore, the given program seems correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given subarray is "good" based on specific conditions. An array is considered "good" if there exists another array \( b \) such that the sum of elements in \( a \) equals the sum of elements in \( b \), with each element in \( b \) being different from the corresponding element in \( a \) and positive.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Minimal \( b \)**:
   - For each element \( a_i \):
     - If \( a_i > 1 \), the minimal \( b_i \) is \( a_i - 1 \).
     - If \( a_i == 1 \), the minimal \( b_i \) is \( 2 \).
   
2. **Prefix Sums**:
   - Compute prefix sums for the array \( a \) and the minimal \( b \) values.
   
3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, calculate the sum of \( a \) and the sum of minimal \( b \) for the given range.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1, it is never "good".
   - If the sum of \( a \) is greater than or equal to the sum of minimal \( b \) and the subarray length is greater than 1, output "YES". Otherwise, output "NO".

### Solution Code

```python
from itertools import accumulate

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        sum_a = a[y] - a[x - 1]
        sum_bmin = b[y] - b[x - 1]
        if sum_a < sum_bmin or x == y:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read \( n \) (length of array \( c \)) and \( q \) (number of queries).
   - Read the array \( c \).

2. **Computing Minimal \( b \) Sums**:
   - Calculate the prefix sums for the array \( c \).
   - Calculate prefix sums for the minimal \( b \) values.

3. **Processing Each Query**:
   - For each query, extract the range \( [x, y] \).
   - Compute the sum of \( a \) and minimal \( b \) for the range.
   - Determine if the subarray is "good" based on the sum comparison and the length of the subarray.

This approach ensures efficient processing of multiple queries and large input sizes by leveraging prefix sums and minimal computations.
