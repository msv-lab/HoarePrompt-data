Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework stays in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible.

Let's consider the launch times:

- For the first installation: launches at a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, etc.

- For the second installation: launches at b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, etc.

Each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, so for each launch time x, the visibility is from x to x + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible simultaneously.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the visibility periods of all fireworks and find the time when the most visibility intervals overlap.

But with large values of a, b, and m (up to 10^18), it's impractical to iterate through all possible times. I need a smarter way.

Let's consider the possible number of fireworks visible from each installation at any given time.

For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of launch times ka such that t - m <= ka <= t.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's the number of launch times lb such that t - m <= lb <= t.

Since a and b may not be the same, and m can be large, I need to find t that maximizes the sum of these two counts.

But this seems tricky. Maybe there's a better way to think about it.

Another approach is to consider that for each installation, the number of fireworks visible at time t is ceil((t - ka + m)/a) for the first installation and ceil((t - lb + m)/b) for the second, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of how many fireworks from each installation are active at time t.

For the first installation, the number of active fireworks at time t is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly, for the second installation, it's floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

So, the total number of fireworks at time t is the sum of these two.

I need to maximize this sum over all possible t.

But again, with large a, b, and m, I need an efficient way to find the maximum without iterating through all t.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the number of visible fireworks can change.

The number of visible fireworks can change only at integer multiples of a or b, or at t = k*a or t = l*b, or at t = k*a - m or t = l*b - m.

Wait, more precisely, the number of visible fireworks from the first installation changes at multiples of a and at t = ka - m for some k.

Similarly for the second installation.

So, potential critical points are at t = ka and t = lb for k, l being integers, and also t = ka - m and t = lb - m.

But again, with large a, b, and m, iterating through all such t is not feasible.

I need a mathematical way to find the maximum without enumerating all possibilities.

Let me consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, denoted as LCM(a, b).

Within each interval of length LCM(a, b), the launch patterns repeat in a way.

But considering that m can be up to 10^18, and a and b can be up to 10^18, this might not help directly.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum number of fireworks visible at time t within one LCM period, but with large numbers, this seems impractical.

Perhaps I need to consider the density of launches and how m affects the overlap.

Let me consider a simpler case first.

Suppose a = b, meaning both installations launch fireworks at the same interval.

Then, the number of fireworks visible from each installation at time t is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Since a = b, this simplifies, but I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the general case.

Let me denote for the first installation, the number of launches up to time t is floor(t / a)

Similarly, up to time t - m -1 is floor((t - m -1)/a)

So, the number of active fireworks from the first installation at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for the second installation.

So, the total number at time t is:

N(t) = [floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)] + [floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)]

I need to maximize N(t) over t >= 0.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x) is equal to k, where k is the number of multiples of x in the interval [t - m, t]

So, I need to find t such that the sum of the number of multiples of a and b in [t - m, t] is maximized.

I need to find t where the overlap of these multiples is maximized.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t, and I want to compute N(t).

I can compute floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

I need to maximize this sum.

I need to find t such that both floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) and floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b) are as large as possible.

Let me consider what floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x) represents.

It represents the number of multiples of x in the interval [t - m, t]

So, floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x) is equal to the number of k such that t - m <= k*x <= t

Similarly for both installations.

So, N(t) is the total number of multiples of a and b in [t - m, t]

I need to maximize the sum of these.

Given that a and b may not be coprime, there might be overlaps where a multiple is counted for both installations.

But since we're counting the total number, overlaps would be counted twice, which is correct.

But with large m, a, and b, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for large m, the number of multiples in [t - m, t] would be roughly m / a for the first installation and m / b for the second.

But since m can be up to 10^18, and a and b can be up to 10^18, I need to handle large numbers.

Wait, but m can be larger than a or b, or smaller.

Let me consider different cases.

Case 1: m < a and m < b

In this case, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) can be at most floor(m / a) + 1

Similarly for b.

So, N(t) <= floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1

But in reality, it might be less because of the positioning of t.

Case 2: m >= a and m >= b

Here, the number of multiples in [t - m, t] can be larger.

I need a general formula.

Let me try to find a general expression for N(t)

N(t) = floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

I need to maximize this over t.

Let me consider that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) is equal to floor((t - (t - m -1)) / a) + something.

Wait, no.

Actually, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t]

Which is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

This can be simplified based on the properties of floor functions.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for a given t, the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize the sum of these two.

I need to find t where both of these are maximized.

Given that a and b are independent, perhaps the maximum occurs when both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m -1)/b) are maximized individually.

But they might not be maximized at the same t.

Wait, perhaps I need to find t where both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m -1)/b) are as large as possible simultaneously.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) is maximized when t is such that t is just below a multiple of a, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that the number of multiples of a in [t - m, t] is equal to floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

This is equal to the number of integers k such that t - m <= k*a <= t

Similarly for b.

So, N(t) is the total number of such k for both a and b.

I need to maximize N(t)

Given that a and b can be different, and m can be large, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for large m, the maximum N(t) is roughly m / a + m / b, but this is not precise.

I need to consider the integer parts.

Wait, perhaps the maximum is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + something.

But I need to consider that there might be overlaps where multiples of a and b coincide, but since we're counting separately, overlaps would be counted twice, which is correct unless there are constraints that prevent that.

But in reality, the maximum might be higher due to the positioning of t relative to the multiples.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each installation, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1, similarly for b.

Because m / a gives the number of full intervals of a within m, plus one for the partial interval.

So, for the first installation, the maximum number of visible fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1

Similarly, for the second installation, it's floor(m / b) + 1

Then, the total maximum would be floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 = floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2

But is this always achievable?

Wait, maybe not, because there might be overlaps in the launch times.

Wait, no, since a and b are different, their launch times are independent.

Wait, but if a and b have a common multiple, there might be some interference.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, this sum cannot be achieved.

Let me check with an example.

Take a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

According to the formula, floor(4 / 6) + 1 + floor(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2

And in the example, it's possible to see 2 fireworks simultaneously.

Another example: a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

floor(10 / 3) + 1 + floor(10 / 4) + 1 = 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7

And in the example, it's 7.

Another example: a = 7, b = 8, m = 56

floor(56 / 7) + 1 + floor(56 / 8) + 1 = 8 + 1 + 7 + 1 = 17

Which matches the third example.

Another example: a = 5, b = 6, m = 78123459896

floor(78123459896 / 5) + 1 + floor(78123459896 / 6) + 1 = 15624691979 + 1 + 13020576649 + 1 = 28645268630

Which matches the fourth example.

Last two examples:

a = 1, b = 1, m = 1

floor(1 / 1) + 1 + floor(1 / 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

And in the example, it's 4.

a = 1, b = 1, m = 1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) + 1 + floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) + 1 = 1000000000000000000 + 1 + 1000000000000000000 + 1 = 2000000000000000002

Which matches the last example.

So, in all these cases, the formula floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1 seems to give the correct maximum number of visible fireworks.

Therefore, I can conclude that the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time is floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) + 1.

Hence, the program provided is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1}

**Correctness: True**
