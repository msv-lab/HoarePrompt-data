Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, Bessie has a birthday cake in the shape of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n clockwise. Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y additional vertices. But in this easy version, y is always 0, which means I can't choose any additional vertices. My goal is to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake by cutting non-intersecting diagonals using the chosen vertices.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides and angles equal. For example, a square is a regular polygon with 4 sides, a pentagon with 5 sides, and so on.

The problem allows me to cut non-intersecting diagonals using the chosen vertices. These diagonals should form triangles, and I need to maximize the number of such triangles.

Let me consider a simple example. Suppose n=4 (a square), x=2, and y=0. If Bessie chooses two vertices, say 1 and 3, which are opposite corners of the square, I can't choose any more vertices since y=0. So, I need to see how many triangles I can form using these two vertices and cutting diagonals. In this case, I can't form any triangles because I need three vertices to form a triangle, and I only have two chosen vertices. Wait, but the sample input has a case with n=4, x=2, and y=0, and the output is 2. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the note, it says that in test case 3, with n=4, x=2, y=0, and vertices 1 and 3 chosen, the output is 2. How is that possible? Let's think about it.

In a square, vertices are 1,2,3,4. If Bessie chooses 1 and 3, which are opposite corners, I can draw a diagonal between 1 and 3. But to form a triangle, I need three vertices. So, maybe I can consider the whole square divided into two triangles by this diagonal. But in that case, each triangle would be formed by vertices 1,2,3 and 1,3,4. But are these non-intersecting diagonals? Wait, maybe I need to consider that the diagonals are only drawn between the chosen vertices.

Wait, the problem says that the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices. So, if Bessie chooses vertices 1 and 3, I can draw a diagonal between 1 and 3. But to form a triangle, I need a third vertex. But I can't choose any more vertices since y=0. So, perhaps I can consider the triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the existing edges of the polygon.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the triangulation of the polygon using the chosen vertices as endpoints of the diagonals.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

3

8 4 0

1 6 2 5

8 8 0

1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8

4 2 0

1 3

Sample Output:

2

6

2

So, for n=8, x=4, y=0, with vertices 1,6,2,5, the output is 2.

For n=8, x=8, y=0, with all vertices chosen, the output is 6.

For n=4, x=2, y=0, with vertices 1 and 3, the output is 2.

Wait, in the third case, with n=4 and x=2, output is 2. But how can I have 2 triangles with only 2 chosen vertices? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized."

But in this easy version, y=0, so I can't choose any additional vertices.

So, I only have the x chosen vertices to work with.

I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals using these x vertices as endpoints, and count the number of triangles formed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the planar graph formed by the polygon and the chosen diagonals, and count the number of triangular faces.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me think about the sample inputs.

In the first sample input, n=8, x=4, y=0, vertices 1,6,2,5.

Assuming these are chosen, and I can't choose any more vertices, I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals using only these vertices.

So, I can draw diagonals between these vertices, making sure they don't intersect.

Then, count the number of triangles formed by these diagonals.

Similarly, for n=8, x=8, y=0, all vertices are chosen, and I can draw non-intersecting diagonals between them.

And for n=4, x=2, y=0, vertices 1 and 3 are chosen, and I can draw a diagonal between them, forming two triangles.

Ah, maybe that's it. If I have only two vertices in a quadrilateral, drawing a diagonal between them splits the quadrilateral into two triangles.

So, in that case, even though I only have two chosen vertices, the number of triangular pieces is two.

Similarly, in the first sample input, with four chosen vertices in an octagon, drawing non-intersecting diagonals among them might divide the polygon into two triangular pieces.

Wait, but in the second sample input, with n=8 and x=8, choosing all vertices and drawing non-intersecting diagonals, it's divided into six triangular pieces.

Wait, in a polygon with n sides, the number of triangles formed by triangulating it is n-2.

Wait, but in this problem, we are not necessarily triangulating the entire polygon, only using the chosen vertices to draw diagonals, and counting the number of triangles formed by these diagonals.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2, or something similar.

Wait, in the first sample input, x=4, output=2, which is x-2=2.

In the second sample input, x=8, output=6, which is x-2=6.

In the third sample input, x=2, output=2, which is not x-2=0, but 2.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps in the third sample, since y=0 and x=2, but in a quadrilateral, choosing two opposite vertices and drawing a diagonal results in two triangles.

So, maybe the formula is different when x is small.

Wait, maybe the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of connected components or something like that.

This seems complicated.

Let me look at the code provided.

The code simply prints x-2 for each test case.

Given that in two sample inputs, x-2 matches the output, but in one it doesn't, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the third sample input, x=2, n=4, y=0, and the output is 2, which is not equal to x-2=0, but it's 2.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
