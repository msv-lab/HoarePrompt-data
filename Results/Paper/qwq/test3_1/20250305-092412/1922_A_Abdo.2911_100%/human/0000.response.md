Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t, which is also a string of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The problem explains that:

- If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same as the template's i-th letter.

- If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's i-th letter.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that at least one position i violates one of the above conditions.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to find a template t such that:

1. For each position i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

2. If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Actually, for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

But for a and b to match the template, they must satisfy:

- If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i]).

So, I need to choose t in such a way that a and b satisfy these conditions, and c does not.

Let me consider each position i from 1 to n independently.

For each position i, I can decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase:

- Then a[i] must equal t[i], and b[i] must equal t[i], and c[i] must not equal t[i].

This implies that a[i] must equal b[i], because both must equal t[i]. So, if a[i] != b[i], I cannot choose t[i] to be lowercase.

If a[i] == b[i], then I can set t[i] to be a[i] (lowercase), and c[i] must not be equal to a[i].

So, in this case, for c[i], it must be different from a[i].

If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then choosing t[i] as lowercase a[i] would satisfy the conditions for position i.

If a[i] == b[i] but c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase.

Alternatively, if I choose t[i] to be uppercase:

- Then a[i] must not equal lowercase(t[i]), and b[i] must not equal lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i].

So, for uppercase t[i]:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for position i, if I choose t[i] to be uppercase, then c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i], and both a[i] and b[i] must be different from that.

Given that a, b, and c are all lowercase strings, since the problem states they consist of lowercase Latin letters.

So, t[i] can be uppercase or lowercase.

But when comparing, c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]), which is just t[i] since c consists of lowercase letters.

Similarly, a[i] and b[i] must not equal lowercase(t[i]) if t[i] is uppercase.

Wait, but t[i] can be uppercase, and lowercase(t[i]) would be the lowercase version.

But a, b, c are all lowercase, so comparisons are case-sensitive.

Wait, no. The problem says t can have uppercase or lowercase letters, but a, b, c are all lowercase.

So, when comparing a[i], b[i], c[i] to t[i], need to consider the case.

Wait, let's read the problem again carefully.

"if the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i"

So, s_i is a lowercase letter, and t_i is uppercase, so lowercase(t_i) is the lowercase version.

So, s_i != lowercase(t_i)

Similarly, if t_i is lowercase, s_i == t_i

For c to not match, there exists at least one i where:

- If t_i is lowercase, c_i != t_i

- If t_i is uppercase, c_i == lowercase(t_i)

Okay, now I need to find a template t such that:

- For a and b, for all i:

  - If t_i is lowercase, a_i == t_i and b_i == t_i

  - If t_i is uppercase, a_i != lowercase(t_i) and b_i != lowercase(t_i)

- For c, there exists at least one i where:

  - If t_i is lowercase, c_i != t_i

  - If t_i is uppercase, c_i == lowercase(t_i)

Given that a, b, and c are all lowercase strings, I need to choose t[i] appropriately.

I need to decide for each position i whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, based on a, b, and c.

Let me consider each position independently.

For each position i, I have two choices for t[i]: make it lowercase or uppercase.

Let me consider both options and see if they can satisfy the conditions for a, b, and c.

Case 1: Choose t[i] to be lowercase.

Then:

- a[i] must equal t[i]

- b[i] must equal t[i]

- c[i] must not equal t[i]

So, for this choice to be valid:

- a[i] == b[i], because both must equal t[i]

- c[i] != a[i]

If a[i] != b[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase because a[i] and b[i] must both equal t[i].

If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then choosing t[i] as a[i] (lowercase) satisfies the conditions for position i.

If a[i] == b[i] but c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase because c[i] would equal t[i], which violates the condition.

Case 2: Choose t[i] to be uppercase.

Then:

- a[i] must not equal lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] must not equal lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i])

Since t[i] is uppercase, lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i], which is a lowercase letter.

So, for this choice to be valid:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, I need to choose a lowercase letter for lowercase(t[i]) such that:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but c[i] is already a lowercase letter.

So, I need to choose lowercase(t[i]) such that it equals c[i], and a[i] and b[i] are both different from c[i].

So, for this choice to be valid:

- c[i] != a[i]

- c[i] != b[i]

Because a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Wait, no.

Wait, if I choose t[i] to be uppercase, then:

- lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]

- a[i] != c[i]

- b[i] != c[i]

So, for this choice to be valid:

- c[i] must be different from a[i]

- c[i] must be different from b[i]

Because a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

So, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] to be uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]

But t[i] is uppercase, so t[i] == c[i].upper()

But c[i] is lowercase, so t[i] would be the uppercase version of c[i]

So, in this case, t[i] is uppercase, and lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]

And a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i]

So, for position i, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] to be uppercase with t[i] == c[i].upper()

Now, to satisfy the overall condition, I need to choose t[i] for each i such that:

- For all i, the choices satisfy the conditions for a and b.

- There exists at least one i where the choice makes c[i] not match t.

So, for each i, I have two possibilities:

1. Choose t[i] as lowercase a[i] (which requires a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i])

2. Choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and lowercase(t[i]) != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, more precisely:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase, then:

  - a[i] == t[i]

  - b[i] == t[i]

  - c[i] != t[i]

  - Hence, a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase, then:

  - a[i] != c[i]

  - b[i] != c[i]

  - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for each position i, I can choose either option if the conditions are met.

Now, to have a valid template t, I need to choose for each i either option 1 or option 2, such that:

- For all i, if I choose option 1, a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- For all i, if I choose option 2, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

And, among all positions, there is at least one position where c[i] does not match t[i], regardless of the choices for other positions.

Wait, but the conditions are per position, and c must not match the template, meaning there exists at least one position where c does not match.

So, in the template t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in other words, for the positions where I choose option 1 (t[i] lowercase), c[i] != t[i]

For positions where I choose option 2 (t[i] uppercase), c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But in the overall template, I need at least one position where c does not match, meaning at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, no. For c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in other words, for c to not match, there exists at least one i where:

- (t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]) OR (t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]))

So, in my template, I need to choose for each i either:

- t[i] lowercase, equal to a[i] (which requires a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i])

- t[i] uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i]

And, among all positions, at least one position must be such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But, since for a and b to match, for all positions:

- If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

And for c to not match, there exists at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, to summarize, for each position i:

- If I choose t[i] lowercase:

  - a[i] == b[i] == t[i]

  - c[i] != t[i]

- If I choose t[i] uppercase:

  - a[i] != c[i]

  - b[i] != c[i]

  - c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, for the entire template t:

- For all positions i:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == b[i] == t[i], and c[i] != t[i]

  - If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

- Additionally, there must be at least one position where:

  - If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

  - Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But, since in both choices for each position, these conditions are already satisfied, the main constraint is that for the positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), and a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i]

And for positions where t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i], and a[i] == b[i] == t[i]

So, to have a valid template, I need to choose for each position i either:

- t[i] lowercase == a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i]

- t[i] uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

And ensure that at least one position is chosen such that c does not match t.

Wait, but in the choice of t[i], the conditions are already set such that for each position, c does not match t.

Wait, no. If I choose t[i] lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

If I choose t[i] uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in the latter case, c matches t at position i.

Wait, no. For c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, actually, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's condition.

Wait, the problem says that c does not match the template, which means that c does not satisfy the template's conditions for at least one position.

In other words, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in the template t, there must be at least one position where this condition holds.

But in our earlier choices:

- If we choose t[i] lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If we choose t[i] uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in either choice, the condition for that position is satisfied for c not matching.

Therefore, if I choose any combination where at least one position is chosen such that the condition holds, then c does not match t.

But, I need to ensure that a and b match t for all positions.

So, the overall strategy is:

- For each position i:

  - If a[i] == b[i]:

    - If c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] to be lowercase a[i]

    - If c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], so I must choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

  - If a[i] != b[i]:

    - I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because a[i] and b[i] would not both equal t[i]

    - So, I must choose t[i] as uppercase, with lowercase(t[i]) != a[i] and != b[i], and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but if a[i] != b[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, so I must choose t[i] as uppercase.

In that case, I need:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Hence, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and t[i] is uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]

If a[i] != b[i], but c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot choose t[i] in a way that satisfies the conditions, so it's impossible for that position.

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Now, for positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i]

- If c[i] == a[i], I must choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], but since c[i] == a[i], and a[i] == b[i], this would mean c[i] == a[i], but earlier we saw that for t[i] uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), and a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], and I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then a[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which violates the condition that a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, if a[i] == b[i] == c[i], and I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then a[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which violates the condition that a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

So, in this case, it's impossible to choose t[i] in a way that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, if there exists a position i where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then it's impossible to have a template t where c does not match, because:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], then c[i] != t[i] is required, but c[i] == a[i], which contradicts.

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) must hold, but a[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which contradicts.

Hence, in such cases, the answer is "NO"

Similarly, for positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], otherwise, it's impossible.

So, to summarize:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to find a template t that satisfies the conditions.

- For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase a[i]

- For positions where a[i] != b[i], I must have c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]

Additionally, I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

But, since for positions where t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i], and for positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is already set to c[i], so it's matching there.

Wait, no. For positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c matches t at that position.

Wait, but for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, actually, the condition for c not matching t is that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's condition.

But according to the problem, "the string c does not match the template t", which means that there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] != lowercase(t[i])

Wait, I think I misread the condition earlier.

Let me re-read the problem.

"The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold for all i from 1 to n:

- if the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i;

- if the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i."

So, for c to not match t, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, no. The "not matching" condition is that the string does not satisfy the template's conditions for all positions, meaning there exists at least one position where the condition is violated.

So, for c to not match t, there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Yes, that's correct.

So, in the template t, for c to not match, there must be at least one position where:

- Either t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]

- Or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in our earlier choices:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], then c[i] != a[i]

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in both cases, the condition for c not matching t is satisfied for that position.

Therefore, if I can choose t[i] for each position according to the rules, and ensure that at least one position is chosen in a way that c does not match t, then the answer is "YES"

But, in practice, since for positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], choosing t[i] as lowercase a[i] ensures c[i] != t[i]

And for positions where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], choosing t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i] ensures that c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in both choices, the condition for c not matching t is satisfied for that position.

Therefore, as long as for all positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible, otherwise, it's possible.

Wait, but in the positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], choosing t[i] as lowercase a[i] ensures c[i] != t[i], which satisfies the condition for c not matching t.

In positions where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], choosing t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is the condition for c not matching t when t[i] is uppercase.

Wait, no. When t[i] is uppercase, the condition for c not matching t is c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in this case, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c does not match t at that position.

Wait, no. Actually, when t[i] is uppercase, the condition for c not matching t is c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But, in our choice, we set lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], so c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c does not match t at that position.

Wait, but according to the problem, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in the positions where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), c does not match t at that position.

Hence, if I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then c does not match t at that position.

Similarly, if I choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], and c[i] != a[i], then c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, as long as for all positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible, otherwise, it's possible.

So, the overall approach is:

- For each position i:

  - If a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then it's impossible to find a template t that satisfies the conditions.

  - Else, it's possible to choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t at that position.

- Therefore, if there are no positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then it's possible to find such a template t.

- Otherwise, it's impossible.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there are no positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], otherwise "NO"

Wait, but let's check the example to verify.

In the first test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Here, a[1] != b[1], and c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], so it's possible to choose t[1] as uppercase 'C', and c[1] == 'c' == lowercase('C'), so c does not match t.

Hence, "YES"

In the second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

For position 1: a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a'

Here, a[1] != b[1], and c[1] == a[1], so it's impossible to choose t[1] because c[1] == a[1], which violates the condition that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] when a[i] != b[i]

Hence, "NO"

In the third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

We need to check if there exists any position i where a[i] == b[i] == c[i]

Looking at the strings:

a: m a t h f o r c e s

b: l u c k f o r c e s

c: a d h o c c o d e r

Comparing position by position:

1: m != l != a

2: a != u != d

3: t != c != h

4: h != k != o

5: f == f == c -> No

6: o == o == c -> No

7: r == r == o

8: c == c == d

9: e == e == e

10: s == s == r

So, positions 5,6,7,8,9,10 do not have a[i] == b[i] == c[i], but position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == e, and c[i] == e, so a[9] == b[9] == c[9]

Hence, it's impossible, but the output is "YES", which contradicts my earlier conclusion.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in position 9:

a[9] == 'e', b[9] == 'e', c[9] == 'e'

So, a[9] == b[9] == c[9], which should make it impossible, but the output is "YES", so my earlier conclusion must be wrong.

Hence, there must be something wrong with my reasoning.

Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to ensure that for positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t, but in other positions, I can choose t[i] such that c does not match t.

But in the third test case, position 9 has a[9] == b[9] == c[9], which according to my earlier reasoning should make it impossible, but the output is "YES", so maybe I need to reconsider.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose t[i] in such a way that for positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], and for positions where a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]

And for positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose anything, so it's impossible.

But in the third test case, position 9 has a[9] == b[9] == c[9], which should make it impossible, but the output is "YES", so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose t[i] in a way that for at least one position, c does not match t, and for all other positions, c can match or not match t, as long as a and b match t.

Wait, no, the problem says that c does not match t, meaning that there exists at least one position where c does not satisfy the template's condition.

But, in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for at least one position, c does not match t, and for all other positions, a and b match t.

But in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t.

Wait, in such positions, if I choose t[i] as lowercase a[i], then c[i] == t[i], which means c matches t at that position.

If I choose t[i] as uppercase with lowercase(t[i]) == c[i], then c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which means c matches t at that position.

Wait, but according to the problem, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], no matter what I choose for t[i], c matches t at that position.

Therefore, to have c not match t, I need to have at least one position where c does not match t, i.e., where:

- t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]

- Or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But in positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] in a way that c does not match t.

Hence, if all positions have a[i] == b[i] == c[i], it's impossible to have c not match t.

But if there exists at least one position where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] accordingly to make c not match t at that position, and choose t[i] for other positions in a way that a and b match t.

Hence, the answer is "YES" if there exists at least one position i where:

- a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Otherwise, "NO"

Let me verify this with the examples.

First test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Here, a[1] != b[1], and c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], so it's "YES"

Second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 1: a == a != b, but c[1] == a[1], so cannot choose t[1] as lowercase a[1], must choose t[1] as uppercase with lowercase(t[1]) == c[1] == 'a', but a[1] == 'a' != lowercase(t[1]) == 'a', which is a contradiction.

Position 2: a[2] == a != b, c[2] == a[2], same issue.

Hence, "NO"

Third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Comparing position by position:

1: m != l != a

2: a != u != d

3: t != c != h

4: h != k != o

5: f == f != c

6: o == o != c

7: r == r != o

8: c == c != d

9: e == e == e

10: s == s != r

So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 have a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] != b[i]

Position 9 has a[i] == b[i] == c[i]

But since there are other positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] accordingly for those positions, and for position 9, choose t[i] in a way that c matches t, but since there are other positions where c does not match t, overall c does not match t.

Hence, "YES"

Fourth test case:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Comparing:

1: a == a == a

2: c != b != c

3: c != d != c

Position 1: a == b == c, cannot choose t[1] to make c not match t

Positions 2 and 3: a[2] != b[2] and c[2] != a[2] != b[2], so can choose t[2] uppercase with lowercase(t[2]) == c[2] == 'c'

Similarly for position 3.

But position 1 has a[1] == b[1] == c[1], so I cannot choose t[1] to make c not match t.

Hence, even though positions 2 and 3 can be chosen to make c not match t, position 1 forces c to match t, so overall c matches t.

Hence, "NO"

Therefore, the correct approach is:

- If there exists at least one position i where:

  - a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

  - a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- And there are no positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], then "YES"

- Otherwise, "NO"

Wait, but in the third test case, there is a position where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], but since there are other positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], it's still "YES"

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that for at least one position, I can make c not match t, and for all positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I have to make c match t at those positions.

But as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t, and for all other positions, a and b match t, it's acceptable.

Hence, the condition is:

- If there exists at least one position i where:

  - a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

  - a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- And for all positions j, not both a[j] == b[j] == c[j] and t[j] is chosen in a way that c[j] matches t[j]

Wait, perhaps it's sufficient to check if there exists at least one position where:

- a[i] == b[i] != c[i], or

- a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

If so, then "YES", else "NO"

Because in such positions, I can choose t[i] accordingly to make c not match t, and for other positions, choose t[i] in a way that a and b match t.

Hence, in code, for each test case, iterate through all positions, and check if there exists at least one position i where:

- (a[i] == b[i] != c[i]) or

- (a[i] != b[i] and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i])

If such a position exists, then "YES", else "NO"

Let me implement this logic.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match the template, while string `c` does not. We will iterate through each position of the strings and check specific conditions to see if such a template can be constructed.

### Approach
1. **Matching Conditions**:
    - For the template `t`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match `t[i]`, whereas `c[i]` must not match `t[i]`.
    - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must not match the lowercase version of `t[i]`, whereas `c[i]` must match the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

2. **Feasibility Check**:
    - For each position `i`, check if we can choose `t[i]` appropriately to satisfy the conditions for `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    - Identify positions where:
        - `a[i] == b[i] != c[i]` (option 1: choose `t[i]` as lowercase `a[i]`).
        - `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]` and `c[i] != b[i]` (option 2: choose `t[i]` as uppercase with `lowercase(t[i]) == c[i]`).

3. **Result Determination**:
    - If there exists at least one position where the above conditions hold, print "YES".
    - Otherwise, print "NO".

### Solution Code
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read `n` (length of strings), and strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Feasibility**:
    - For each position `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
        - If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` does not equal `a[i]`, set `possible` to `True`.
        - If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, set `possible` to `True`.

3. **Output Result**:
    - If `possible` is `True`, print "YES".
    - Otherwise, print "NO".

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether a valid template `t` exists for each test case by checking the necessary conditions at each position of the strings.
