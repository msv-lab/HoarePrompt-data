Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals. The first one launches every 'a' minutes, and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks from both installations interact over time.

Let's consider the launch times:

- Installation 1: launches at a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, ...

- Installation 2: launches at b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, ...

Each firework is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, so for any launch at time t, it's visible from t to t + m inclusive.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible simultaneously.

I should think about how many fireworks from each installation are visible at any given time.

For installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of launch times ka such that t - m <= ka <= t.

Similarly, for installation 2, it's the number of launch times lb such that t - m <= lb <= t.

So, total visible fireworks at time t is the sum of these two counts.

I need to maximize this sum over all possible t.

Now, since a and b can be different, I need to consider how their launch schedules overlap.

Let me consider the possible scenarios:

1. If a and b are co-prime or have no common factors, their launch times won't coincide except at multiples of their least common multiple (LCM).

2. If a and b have a common factor, their launch times will coincide at multiples of their LCM.

In either case, I need to consider the visibility periods overlapping.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of events: launch times and cease times (when a firework is no longer visible).

This sounds like a classic problem in scheduling or event scheduling.

I can list all the launch times and the times when fireworks cease to be visible.

Then, I can sort these events and keep a counter of current visible fireworks.

But given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this without simulating each event.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let's consider the maximum number of visible fireworks from each installation separately and then sum them up, but I need to account for overlaps in their launch times.

Wait, but the problem seems to suggest that the maximum visible fireworks could be higher due to overlaps between the two installations's fireworks.

Let me try to find a general formula.

First, for installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at any time t is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

Similarly, for installation 2, it's floor((t)/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b).

So, the total visible fireworks at time t is the sum of these two.

I need to maximize this sum over all integer t.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I can find the maximum possible value of this expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the maximum possible value for each installation and see how they combine.

Wait, but since the installations launch at different intervals, their visible fireworks may overlap in time.

I need to consider the times when both installations have their fireworks visible simultaneously.

Let me consider the case when a and b are co-prime.

In this case, their launch times will only coincide at multiples of LCM(a, b) = a*b.

So, at time t = 0, no fireworks are visible.

At time t = a, installation 1 launches a firework, visible until t = a + m.

At time t = b, installation 2 launches a firework, visible until t = b + m.

At time t = a*b, both installations launch together, and their fireworks are visible until t = a*b + m.

So, in this case, the maximum visible fireworks would be the sum of the individual maximums minus any overlaps.

But I need a general approach.

Let me think about the number of fireworks launched by each installation that are visible at time t.

For installation 1, the number of visible fireworks is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a).

Similarly for installation 2.

So, total visible fireworks is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over integer t.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can consider t such that it maximizes both terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider t to be such that it's close to multiples of a and b.

Wait, perhaps I can set t to be the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, or some multiple thereof.

But given that a and b can be up to 10^18, computing LCM directly might not be feasible.

Moreover, m can be up to 10^18, so I need a formula that doesn't involve iterating over time.

Let me consider the asymptotic behavior.

As t becomes large, the number of visible fireworks approaches floor(t/a) - floor(t/a - m/a) + floor(t/b) - floor(t/b - m/b)

But since m can be larger than a or b, this might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the maximum possible number of visible fireworks.

For installation 1, the maximum number of visible fireworks is ceil((m + 1)/a).

Similarly, for installation 2, it's ceil((m + 1)/b).

But since the installations can launch fireworks that overlap, the total maximum could be the sum of these two.

However, there might be overlaps in their launch schedules, so I need to account for that.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of ceil(m/a) and ceil(m/b).

But looking back at the sample input and output, let's see.

First sample input:

6 7 4

According to the explanation, the output is 2.

ceil(4/6) = 1, ceil(4/7) = 1, sum is 2, which matches the sample output.

Second sample input:

3 4 10

ceil(10/3) = 4, ceil(10/4) = 3, sum is 7, which matches the second output.

Third sample input:

7 8 56

ceil(56/7) = 8, ceil(56/8) = 7, sum is 15, but the sample output is 17.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((m)/(a - 1)) or something else.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 7 8 56

ceil(56/7) = 8, ceil(56/8) = 7, sum is 15, but sample output is 17.

So, my initial assumption is incorrect.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((m + a -1)/a) + floor((m + b -1)/b)

Wait, no, floor((56 + 7 -1)/7) = floor(62/7) = 8, floor((56 + 8 -1)/8) = floor(63/8) = 7, sum is still 15, but sample output is 17.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's m//a + m//b + 2

Let's check:

For 6 7 4:

4//6 = 0, 4//7 = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, matches sample output.

For 3 4 10:

10//3 = 3, 10//4 = 2, so 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, matches sample output.

For 7 8 56:

56//7 = 8, 56//8 = 7, so 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, matches sample output.

Wait, that seems to work.

Let me check another sample:

5 6 78123459896

78123459896//5 = 15624691979.2, but integer division would be 15624691979

78123459896//6 = 13020576649.333, integer division 13020576649

Sum: 15624691979 + 13020576649 = 28645268628

Plus 2: 28645268630, matches sample output.

Another sample:

1 1 1

1//1 = 1, 1//1 = 1, sum 2, plus 2 equals 4, matches sample output.

Last sample:

1 1 1000000000000000000

1000000000000000000//1 = 1000000000000000000

Sum: 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 = 2000000000000000000, plus 2 equals 2000000000000000002, matches sample output.

So, it seems the formula is m//a + m//b + 2.

But why does this work?

Let's try to understand.

Each installation can have up to floor(m / a) + 1 fireworks visible at once.

Similarly, floor(m / b) + 1 for the second installation.

So, sum would be floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

Which matches the formula.

Wait, but why floor(m / a) + 1?

Because the first firework is launched at time 0, and it's visible up to m.

Then, another at time a, visible up to a + m, and so on.

So, the number of fireworks visible at any time t is the number of launch times ka where t - m <= ka <= t.

Which is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

In the worst case, when t is such that it captures the maximum number of launches within t - m to t.

But in practice, the maximum number of visible fireworks from one installation is floor(m / a) + 1.

Because m / a gives the number of complete intervals within m, plus one for the initial launch.

Hence, summing up for both installations gives floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

Hence, the formula seems correct.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Yes}}\]

**Correctness: True**
