Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character "special." From the example provided, in the string "AAABAACC," there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). But since it's the first character, it only has a right neighbor. So, 'A' equals its only neighbor 'A', but the definition says "exactly one of its neighbors." Wait, but it only has one neighbor, so it's equal to that one neighbor. So, it's special.

- Position 2: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'B' (right). It equals 'A' on the left but not 'B' on the right. So, exactly one neighbor is equal to it. Hence, special.

- Position 3: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It equals both neighbors. So, not special because it's equal to both, not exactly one.

Wait, but the example says position 3 is special. Maybe I miscounted the positions. Let's re-examine.

Wait, strings are usually 0-indexed or 1-indexed. In this context, it's probably 1-indexed. So, positions:

1: 'A'

2: 'A'

3: 'B'

4: 'A'

5: 'A'

6: 'C'

7: 'A'

8: 'C'

Okay, now let's check again:

- Position 1: 'A' equals right neighbor 'A'. So, exactly one neighbor (only right neighbor), which is equal. Special.

- Position 2: 'A' equals left neighbor 'A' but not right neighbor 'B'. So, exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 3: 'B' does not equal left neighbor 'A' or right neighbor 'A'. So, no neighbors equal to it. Not special.

- Position 4: 'A' equals left neighbor 'B' (no, wait: left neighbor is 'B', right neighbor is 'A'). So, equals right neighbor 'A', not left neighbor 'B'. So, exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 5: 'A' equals left neighbor 'A' and right neighbor 'C'. So, equals left neighbor but not right. Exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 6: 'C' equals right neighbor 'A'. Wait, right neighbor is 'C', left neighbor is 'A'. So, equals right neighbor 'C', not left neighbor 'A'. Exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 7: 'A' equals left neighbor 'C' and right neighbor 'C'. So, does not equal left neighbor 'C', equals right neighbor 'C'. Exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 8: 'C' equals left neighbor 'A', no right neighbor. So, does not equal left neighbor 'A'. No neighbors equal to it. Not special.

Wait, but the example says there are 6 special characters, and according to this, positions 1,2,4,5,6,7 are special, which is 6. But in my earlier analysis, position 3 and 8 are not special, which matches. So, perhaps the initial description had a typo or I misread it.

Moving on, I need to generate a string where exactly n characters are special as defined above.

Constraints:

- The string should consist only of uppercase Latin letters.

- The string length should be at most 200.

- For each test case, output "YES" followed by the string if such a string exists, or "NO" if it's impossible.

- There are t test cases, with t up to 50, and n up to 50.

First, I need to think about how to construct such a string for a given n.

Let me think about the properties of special characters.

A character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

- For the first character, it only has a right neighbor.

- For the last character, it only has a left neighbor.

- For any character in between, it has both left and right neighbors.

So, for the first and last characters:

- They are special if and only if they equal their only neighbor.

- Wait, no: according to the definition, special means equal to exactly one neighbor.

- For the first character, it has only one neighbor (right), so it's special if it equals that neighbor.

- Similarly, for the last character, it's special if it equals its left neighbor.

For characters in the middle:

- They are special if they equal exactly one of their two neighbors.

So, to maximize or minimize the number of special characters, I need to control these equalities.

Let me consider some small examples:

- n = 0: Is there a string where no character is special?

- For n = 0:

- If the string is empty, but probably minimum length is 1.

- If string has length 1: Only one character, which has no neighbors, so no special characters. Wait, but according to the definition, a character is special if it equals exactly one of its neighbors. If it has no neighbors, it doesn't equal any neighbor, so not special.

- So, a single character is not special.

- But, per the problem, n is at least 1, so n=0 might not be allowed, but according to constraints, n can be 1.

- Wait, n can be 1.

- So, for n=1: Is there a string with exactly one special character?

- Let's see.

- If the string has length 1: No special characters.

- Length 2: Two characters.

- If they are equal: Both characters equal their only neighbor, so both are special. Total special characters: 2.

- If they are different: Neither is equal to their neighbor, so no special characters. Total: 0.

- So, for length 2: Either 0 or 2 special characters.

- No way to have exactly 1 special character.

- Length 3:

- Options:

- All equal: AAA -> None are special, because each equals both neighbors (but in positions 2, it equals both neighbors, so not special). Wait:

- Position 1: A == A (right neighbor), so special.

- Position 2: A == A (left) and A == A (right), so not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), so special.

- Total special characters: Positions 1 and 3.

- So, 2 special characters.

- If two equal and one different: AAB, ABA, BAA.

- AAB:

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), so special.

- Position 3: B == A (left), so special.

- Total: 3 special characters.

- ABA:

- Position 1: A == B (right), so special.

- Position 2: B != A (left), B == A (right), so special.

- Position 3: A == B (left), so special.

- Total: 3 special characters.

- BAA:

- Position 1: B == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (right), not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), not special.

- Wait, in BAA:

- Position 1: B == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (right), not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), not special.

- Total: 1 special character.

- Ah, found it.

- So, for n=1, the string "BAA" has exactly one special character.

- Similarly, "ABBB" :

- Position 1: A != B, so not special.

- Position 2: B == B, not special.

- Position 3: B == B, not special.

- Position 4: B == B, not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- "ABBBB":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B, not special.

- Position 3: B == B, not special.

- Position 4: B == B, not special.

- Position 5: B == B, not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- "ABBBB" has 0 special characters.

- "ABBBBC":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B, not special.

- Position 3: B == B, not special.

- Position 4: B == B, not special.

- Position 5: B == C, special.

- Position 6: C == B, special.

- Total: 2 special characters.

- "ABBBBCD":

- Position 1: A != B, special.

- Position 2: B == B, not special.

- Position 3: B == B, not special.

- Position 4: B == B, not special.

- Position 5: B == C, special.

- Position 6: C == B, special.

- Position 7: D != C, special.

- Total: 4 special characters.

- Wait, position 1: A != B, so exactly one neighbor (B) is not equal, but according to the definition, special means equal to exactly one neighbor.

- Wait, the first character has only one neighbor, so it's equal to it if it's the same character.

- Wait, in "ABBBBCD":

- Position 1: A != B, so not equal to its only neighbor. So, not special.

- Position 2: B == B, so equals both neighbors (A and B), but since A != B, actually equals only one neighbor. Wait:

- Wait, position 2: B's left neighbor is A, right neighbor is B. So, B == right neighbor, B != left neighbor. So, exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 3: B == B (left) and B == B (right). Equals both neighbors, so not special.

- Position 4: B == B (left) and B == B (right). Equals both, not special.

- Position 5: B == B (left) and B == C (right). Equals left neighbor, not right. So, exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 6: C == B (left) and C != D (right). So, not equal to any neighbor. Not special.

- Position 7: D != C (left), no right neighbor. So, not equal to its only neighbor. Not special.

- Total special characters: positions 2 and 5: 2 special characters.

- Wait, earlier I thought position 6 was special, but actually it's not because C != B on the left and no right neighbor, so not equal to any neighbor, hence not special.

- So, in "ABBBBCD", positions 2 and 5 are special: n=2.

- Back to n=1: "BAA" has n=1 special character, as seen earlier.

- So, it's possible for n=1.

- Wait, but earlier I thought for n=1 it's impossible, but "BAA" has n=1.

- Wait, in "BAA":

- Position 1: B == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (right), not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), not special.

- Total: 1 special character.

- So, n=1 is possible.

- Wait, but in the example, for n=1, the output is "NO". So, perhaps I'm missing something.

- Wait, maybe there's a constraint I'm missing.

- Looking back at the problem statement:

- "print one line containing the string 'NO'"

- "otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string 'YES'; on the second line print a string of length at most 200 â€” the answer itself"

- So, for n=1, the sample output is "NO", meaning it's impossible to have a string with exactly n=1 special characters.

- But according to my earlier analysis, "BAA" has exactly one special character.

- So, perhaps the problem has some other constraints that I'm missing.

- Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the string has exactly n special characters, and the total number of special characters must be exactly n, nothing more.

- In "BAA", there is exactly one special character, so it should be acceptable for n=1.

- But the sample output for n=1 is "NO". So, perhaps there's something wrong with my understanding.

- Wait, perhaps the problem is that in "BAA", the string has length 3, but the number of special characters is 1, but maybe for some reason, with n=1, no string satisfies the condition.

- Wait, perhaps it's impossible to have exactly n=1 special characters in a string under the given definition.

- Let me think differently.

- Let's consider that for any string, the number of special characters is always even, or something like that.

- From earlier examples:

- Length 1: 0 special.

- Length 2:

- If characters are equal: 2 special.

- If different: 0 special.

- Length 3:

- "AAA": positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

- "AAB": positions 1,2,3 are special, total 3.

- "BAA": positions 1 is special, total 1.

- Wait, but according to the problem, for n=1, it's "NO", so perhaps my earlier analysis is incorrect.

- Maybe in "BAA", position 3 is also special.

- Wait, in "BAA":

- Position 1: B == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (right), not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), special.

- Wait, now I'm getting confused.

- According to the definition, a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

- In "BAA":

- Position 1: B == A (right), so exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 2: A == A (right), so equals both neighbors. Not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), so equals one neighbor. Special.

- Wait, but position 3 has only one neighbor, which is equal to it. So, exactly one neighbor is equal. So, special.

- So, positions 1 and 3 are special, total 2.

- So, "BAA" has 2 special characters, not 1.

- Wait, that changes things.

- So, n=1 is impossible because any string that seems to have 1 special character actually has more.

- For example, "BAA" has 2 special characters.

- Similarly, "ABA":

- Position 1: A == B (right), special.

- Position 2: B != A (left), B == A (right), so exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- Position 3: A == B (left), special.

- Total: 3 special characters.

- So, it's hard to get exactly n=1.

- Similarly, "AAB":

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), so special.

- Position 3: B == A (left), special.

- Total: 3 special characters.

- So, perhaps it's impossible to have exactly n=1 special characters.

- Let's try "AB":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B != A, not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- "ABB":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B, not special.

- Position 3: B == B, not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- "ABBA":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B == B, not special.

- Position 3: B == B, not special.

- Position 4: A != B, not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- "ABC":

- Position 1: A != B, not special.

- Position 2: B != A and B != C, not special.

- Position 3: C != B, not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- "AABC":

- Position 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), special.

- Position 3: B == C, not special.

- Position 4: C == B (left), not special.

- Total: 1 special character.

- Wait, position 2 is special.

- Position 3: B == C, so equals right neighbor, but C == B (left), so equals both neighbors? Wait:

- Position 3: B == C (right), C == B (left), so B == C, so position 3: B == C (right), B != C (left)? Wait, if B == C, then position 3: B == C (right), B == C (left), so equals both neighbors, not special.

- Wait, assuming B and C are different letters, but in "AABC", B and C are different, so position 3: B != C (right), B == A (left)? Wait, position 3: B's left neighbor is A, right neighbor is C. So, B != A and B != C, so not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), so exactly one neighbor is equal. Special.

- So, total: only position 2 is special. n=1.

- So, "AABC" has exactly one special character.

- But according to the sample input for n=1, the output is "NO". So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

- Wait, maybe the problem requires that the string has exactly n special characters, and no more or no less.

- But in "AABC", we have exactly one special character, which matches n=1.

- So, why is the sample output "NO"?

- Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

- Looking back at the problem statement:

- "print one line containing the string 'NO'"

- "otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string 'YES'; on the second line print a string of length at most 200 â€” the answer itself"

- In the sample input:

- 3

- 6

- 1

- 2

- Sample output:

- YES

- AAABAACC

- NO

- YES

- MM

- So, for n=6, "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters, which matches.

- For n=1, "NO"

- For n=2, "MM" has 2 special characters.

- So, in "MM", positions 1 and 2 are both special because each M equals its only neighbor.

- Wait, position 1: M == M (right), special.

- Position 2: M == M (left), special.

- So, total 2 special characters, which matches n=2.

- But for n=1, "NO" is printed, even though "AABC" seems to have exactly one special character.

- So, perhaps my earlier analysis is incorrect.

- Maybe in "AABC", there are more than one special characters.

- Let's re-examine "AABC":

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), special.

- Position 3: B != A (left), B != C (right), not special.

- Position 4: C != B (left), no right neighbor, not special.

- Total: positions 1 and 2 are special, so n=2.

- Oh, I see, I miscounted earlier. So, "AABC" has two special characters, not one.

- So, my earlier assumption was wrong.

- Therefore, it's impossible to have exactly n=1 special characters.

- Because in any string:

- If the string has length 1: 0 special characters.

- Length 2:

- If characters are equal: 2 special characters.

- If different: 0 special characters.

- Length 3:

- "AAA": positions 1 and 3 are special, n=2.

- "AAB": positions 1, 2, 3 are special, n=3.

- "ABA": positions 1, 2, 3 are special, n=3.

- "BAA": positions 1 and 3 are special, n=2.

- "ABC": no special characters, n=0.

- "AABC": positions 1 and 2 are special, n=2.

- So, indeed, there seems to be no string with exactly n=1 special characters.

- Hence, for n=1, the answer should be "NO".

- Now, for n=2, "MM" works.

- For n=6, "AAABAACC" works.

- So, the general approach seems to be:

- For even n, construct a string where pairs of identical characters are placed together, resulting in each pair contributing two special characters.

- For odd n, it's impossible, as seen from n=1.

- Wait, but what about n=3? Is it possible?

- Let's try to construct a string for n=3.

- Suppose "AAABC":

- Position 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), A != B (right), special.

- Position 4: B != A (left), B == C (right), special.

- Position 5: C == B (left), not special.

- Total: positions 2,3,4 are special, n=3.

- So, n=3 is possible with "AAABC".

- But according to my earlier hypothesis, only even n are possible, but n=3 is possible.

- So, my hypothesis is incorrect.

- So, need to think differently.

- Perhaps n=1 is the only impossible case, and all other n are possible.

- Wait, but in the sample input, n=1 is "NO", and n=2 and n=6 are "YES".

- And according to my construction, n=3 is possible.

- So, perhaps only n=1 is impossible.

- Let me check for n=0.

- n=0: is there a string with 0 special characters?

- For example, "ABC": positions 1,2,3 are not special.

- So, "ABC" has 0 special characters.

- So, n=0 is possible.

- But according to constraints, n >=1, but perhaps n=0 is allowed in some cases.

- Wait, no, the problem says 1 <= n <=50.

- So, n=1 is the only impossible case?

- Wait, but in the sample input, n=1 is "NO", and n=2 and n=6 are "YES".

- So, perhaps all n except n=1 are possible.

- But in my earlier example, n=3 is possible.

- So, perhaps n=1 is impossible, and all other n are possible.

- Let me try to find a general way to construct a string for any n >=2.

- One approach is to create a string consisting of repeated pairs of the same character, like "AABBCCDD...", which would make every character special except the last one if the length is odd.

- Wait, no, in "AABBCC", each pair contributes two special characters.

- In "AABBCC":

- Position 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == A (right), not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == A (left), B == B (right), special.

- Position 5: B == B (left), B == C (right), special.

- Position 6: C == B (left), not special.

- Wait, positions 3,4,5 are special.

- So, in "AABBCC", n=3 special characters.

- Not as expected.

- Maybe a better approach is to alternate different characters, but that leads to no special characters.

- So, perhaps constructing a string with runs of two identical characters separated by different characters.

- For example, "AABBCC": as above, n=3.

- For n=4: "AABBCCDDEE", which would have positions 3,4,7,8 as special, total n=4.

- So, seems to work.

- For n=5: "AABBCCDDE", positions 3,4,7,8,9 are special, n=5.

- So, seems possible.

- For n=0: "ABC", n=0.

- For n=1: seems impossible, as any construction leads to even number of special characters or higher odd numbers, but n=1 can't be achieved.

- Hence, the conclusion is that n=1 is impossible, and all other n are possible.

- So, in the program, for n=1, it should output "NO", and for other n, output "YES" and a suitable string.

- Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

os.system('cls')

s = string.ascii_uppercase

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n == 1:

print('NO')

else:

ans = ''

x = 0

if n % 2 == 0:

for j in range(n // 2):

ans += s[x] * 2

x += 1

else:

(ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)

for j in range(n // 2 - 1):

ans += s[x] * 2

x += 1

print('YES')

print(ans)

- So, for n=1, it prints "NO", which is correct.

- For n even, it creates a string with n/2 pairs of the same character, each pair contributing two special characters.

- Wait, but in "AABBCC", we saw that it has n=3 special characters, not n=6.

- Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

- Wait, in "AABBCC":

- Position 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == A (right), not special.

- Position 3: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == A (left), B == B (right), special.

- Position 5: B == B (left), B == C (right), special.

- Position 6: C == B (left), not special.

- So, positions 3,4,5 are special, total n=3.

- So, for n=6, the program outputs "AAABAACC", which according to the problem has 6 special characters.

- But according to my earlier analysis, "AAABAACC" has positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 as special, total n=6.

- So, it seems correct.

- For n even, the program creates n/2 pairs of the same character, which, based on the earlier analysis, would result in n special characters.

- Wait, in "AABBCC", we have n=3 special characters, but according to the program's logic for even n, it should output n special characters.

- Wait, perhaps I need to verify the number of special characters for different constructions.

- Let's take n=4:

- The program would create two pairs, e.g., "AABB".

- In "AABB":

- Position 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

- Position 3: B == A (left), B == B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == B (left), not special.

- Total: positions 2 and 3 are special, n=2.

- Wait, that's only n=2 special characters, but n=4 was supposed to have n=4 special characters.

- So, there's a discrepancy here.

- Wait, perhaps I need to see how the program constructs the string for n=4.

- For n=4, which is even, it would do:

- ans = ''

- x = 0

- for j in range(2):

ans += s[0] * 2

x +=1

- So, ans = 'AA' + 'BB'

- So, "AABB"

- As above, n=2 special characters.

- But n=4 was in the sample input with output "YES" and "MM", which for "MM" has n=2 special characters.

- Wait, in the sample input, n=2 corresponds to "MM", which has n=2 special characters.

- So, perhaps the program is designed to output a string with n special characters, but in this case, for n=4, it outputs "AABB", which has n=2 special characters, which doesn't match.

- Wait, but in the sample input for n=6, "AAABAACC" has n=6 special characters.

- Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

- Let's re-examine "AAABAACC":

- Positions:

1: A == A (right), special.

2: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

3: A == B (left), A == A (right), special.

4: B == A (left), B == A (right), special.

5: A == A (left), A == C (right), special.

6: A == C (left), A == C (right), special.

7: C == A (left), C == C (right), special.

8: C == C (left), not special.

- So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are special, total n=7, which is more than n=6.

- Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

- Position 3: A == B (left), A == A (right), special.

- Position 4: B == A (left), B == A (right), special.

- Position 5: A == A (left), A == C (right), special.

- Position 6: A == C (left), A == C (right), special.

- Position 7: C == A (left), C == C (right), special.

- Position 8: C == C (left), not special.

- So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are special, total n=7.

- But according to the problem, "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.

- Maybe the problem counts differently.

- Wait, perhaps only internal characters are considered for having two neighbors.

- Wait, the problem says "exactly one of its neighbors".

- For the first and last characters, they have one neighbor each.

- For "AAABAACC":

- Position 1: A == A (right), special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

- Position 3: A == B (left), A == A (right), special.

- Position 4: B == A (left), B == A (right), special.

- Position 5: A == A (left), A == C (right), special.

- Position 6: A == C (left), A == C (right), special.

- Position 7: C == A (left), C == C (right), special.

- Position 8: C == C (left), not special.

- So, positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 are special, total n=7.

- But the problem claims there are 6 special characters in "AAABAACC".

- Maybe there's a mistake in the problem or my understanding.

- Perhaps position 7 is not special because C == C (left), so equals one neighbor (left), but C == C (right), so equals both. Wait:

- Position 7: C == A (left), C == C (right). Wait, C != A (left), C == C (right). So, equals exactly one neighbor. Special.

- Position 8: C == C (left), no right neighbor, so equals its only neighbor. So, special.

- Wait, but in the problem, it's mentioned that position 8 is special in "AAABAACC".

- So, total n=7 special characters.

- Maybe the problem has a typo.

- Alternatively, perhaps the definition of special is misunderstood.

- Let me re-read the problem:

- "special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors."

- So, for position 8 in "AAABAACC":

- C == C (left), no right neighbor.

- So, equals one neighbor (left), so special.

- Similarly, position 1: A == A (right), equals one neighbor.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == B (right), equals one neighbor.

- And so on.

- So, in "AAABAACC", positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 are all special.

- But the problem says there are 6 special characters in "AAABAACC".

- Maybe the positions are 1,3,5,6,7,8, totaling 6.

- But according to my analysis, positions 1 through 7 are special, and position 8 is special as well.

- So, n=8 special characters.

- Confusing.

- Perhaps the problem has a mistake in the example.

- Given this confusion, perhaps I should find a different way to construct the string.

- Let me consider constructing a string where every pair of different characters is used.

- For example, for n=2: "AB", which has positions 1 and 2 as special.

- Wait, in "AB":

- Position 1: A != B, so not special.

- Position 2: B != A, so not special.

- Total: 0 special characters.

- So, that doesn't work.

- Alternatively, "AAB":

- Positions 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A != B (right), special.

- Position 3: B == A (left), not special.

- Total: position 2 is special, n=1.

- Which is "NO" according to the problem.

- So, perhaps another approach.

- Let me consider that for n even, constructing a string like "AABBAADDCC...", where each "AABB" contributes two special characters.

- Wait, in "AABB":

- Positions 3 and 4 are special, total n=2.

- So, for n=4: "AABBCCDD", which would have positions 3,4,7,8 as special, total n=4.

- So, seems to work.

- For n=5: "AABBCCDDE", positions 3,4,7,8,9 are special, total n=5.

- For n=6: "AABBCCDDEE", positions 3,4,7,8,11,12 are special, total n=6.

- So, in general, for n even, construct n/2 pairs of identical characters, separated by different characters.

- For n odd, construct (n-1)/2 pairs and add an extra character.

- Wait, but in the program, for n even, it creates n/2 pairs, each contributing two special characters, but according to my analysis, each pair contributes two special characters, but in "AABB", it's only n=2 special characters.

- Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the construction.

- Let's take "AABB":

- Positions 1: A == A, not special.

- Position 2: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

- Position 3: B == A (left), B == B (right), special.

- Position 4: B == B (left), not special.

- Total: positions 2 and 3 are special, n=2.

- So, for n=4: "AABBCCDD":

- Positions 2,3,6,7 are special, n=4.

- So, seems to work.

- For n=5: "AABBCCDDE", positions 2,3,6,7,10 are special, n=5.

- So, the general construction is to have n//2 pairs of identical characters, and if n is odd, add an extra character.

- But in the program, for even n, it creates n//2 pairs, each contributing two special characters, but according to my analysis, each pair contributes two special characters, but in reality, in "AABB", it's only n=2 special characters.

- Wait, in "AABB":

- n=2 special characters.

- So, to get n special characters, need to create n//2 pairs.

- Wait, but in "AABB", n=2 special characters, which matches n=2.

- So, for n=4, "AABBCC" has n=3 special characters, which doesn't match.

- Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the construction.

- Wait, in "AABBCC":

- Positions 3,4,7,8 are special, total n=4.

- Wait, no, earlier analysis showed n=3.

- Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

- In "AABBCC":

- Positions:

1: A == A, not special.

2: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

3: B == A (left), B == B (right), special.

4: B == B (left), B == C (right), special.

5: C == B (left), C == C (right), special.

6: C == C (left), not special.

- So, positions 2,3,4,5 are special, total n=4.

- Wait, earlier I missed position 5.

- So, for "AABBCC", n=4 special characters.

- So, for n=4, "AABBCC" works.

- Similarly, for n=6, "AABBCCDD" has positions 3,4,7,8,11,12 as special, total n=6.

- So, the pattern is to have n//2 pairs of identical characters, separated by different characters.

- So, in general, for even n, construct a string with n//2 pairs of identical characters, each pair separated by different characters, to get n special characters.

- For odd n, perhaps add an extra character at the end.

- But in the program, for odd n, it starts with 'AAA' and then adds (n//2 -1) pairs.

- For example, for n=3:

- ans = 'AAA'

- x =1

- Then, for j in range(1):

- ans += s[1]*2

- So, ans = 'AAA' + 'BB' = 'AAAABB'

- In 'AAAABB':

- Positions:

1: A == A, not special.

2: A == A (left), A == A (right), not special.

3: A == A (left), A == A (right), not special.

4: A == A (left), A == B (right), special.

5: A == B (left), A == B (right), special.

6: B == A (left), B == B (right), special.

- So, positions 4,5,6 are special, total n=3.

- Which matches n=3.

- So, the program seems to be correctly constructing strings for even and odd n.

- For n=1, it correctly outputs "NO".

- Hence, the program is correct.

- Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to construct a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in the string, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Special Characters**:
   - For the first and last characters, they are special if they equal their only neighbor.
   - For characters in between, they are special if they equal exactly one of their two neighbors.

2. **Construction of the String**:
   - For even n, create n/2 pairs of identical characters separated by different characters to achieve exactly n special characters.
   - For odd n, start with 'AAA' and add (n//2 - 1) pairs of identical characters to achieve exactly n special characters.
   - For n=1, it's impossible to create such a string, hence output "NO".

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use the string of uppercase letters from the `string` module.
   - Handle each test case by checking if n is 1, output "NO". For other values of n, construct the string as per the rules above.

### Solution Code

```python
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation

- **For even n**:
  - We create n/2 pairs of identical characters. Each pair contributes exactly two special characters.
  - For example, for n=4, "AABB" has special characters at positions 2 and 3.

- **For odd n**:
  - We start with 'AAA', which contributes two special characters, and then add (n//2 - 1) pairs of identical characters.
  - For example, for n=3, "AAA" has special characters at positions 2 and 3.

- **For n=1**:
  - It's impossible to create a string with exactly one special character, hence output "NO".

This approach ensures that we generate a string with exactly n special characters for allowed values of n, and correctly handle the impossible case when n=1.
