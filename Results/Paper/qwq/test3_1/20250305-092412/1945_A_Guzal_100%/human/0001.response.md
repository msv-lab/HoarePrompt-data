Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on the preferences of three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

First, I need to understand the preferences:

- Introverts want to be alone in a tent. So, each introvert needs their own tent.

- Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

- Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, we should return -1.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, the introverts are the most restrictive because each one needs their own tent. So, the number of tents required for introverts is simply 'a'.

Next, extroverts need to be in tents with exactly two others, so each tent for extroverts must have three people: one extrovert and two others, who can be universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but according to the problem, extroverts want to be with two others, meaning the tent must have exactly three people, including the extrovert. So, for each extrovert, we need to make sure that there are two other people in the tent with them.

Now, universals are flexible, so they can fill in the tents as needed.

I need to figure out how to allocate the extroverts and universals into tents, making sure that each extrovert has exactly two other people in their tent, and universals can adapt to different scenarios.

Let me consider the number of extroverts 'b' and universals 'c'.

First, each extrovert needs two other people in their tent. So, for 'b' extroverts, they need a total of 2*b additional spots in tents.

These spots can be filled by universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts need to be in tents with two others, meaning the tent must have exactly three people, including the extrovert.

So, for each tent that has an extrovert, it must have exactly two other people, who can be universals or other extroverts.

But, if an extrovert is in a tent with two other extroverts, then those three extroverts are all satisfied, as each perceives the tent as having exactly three people.

Wait, no. Each extrovert wants their tent to have exactly three people, including themselves. So, if three extroverts are in one tent, each of them sees the tent as having three people, which satisfies their preference.

Similarly, an extrovert can be in a tent with one extrovert and one universal, or two universals.

In all cases, the tent must have exactly three people.

So, the key is to group the extroverts and universals into groups of three, where each group represents a tent.

But, there's a catch: universals are flexible, but extroverts are not.

Moreover, any tent that has an extrovert must have exactly three people.

Tents that don't have extroverts can have one, two, or three universals.

Wait, but introverts must be in tents alone, so their tents have exactly one person.

So, the plan is:

- Assign each introvert to their own tent.

- Then, group the extroverts and universals into tents of exactly three people, each containing at least one extrovert.

- Any remaining universals can be placed into tents of their own, or shared with others, depending on availability.

But the goal is to minimize the number of tents, so we should maximize the number of tents that contain three people.

Wait, but we have to respect the extroverts' requirement that any tent they are in must have exactly three people.

So, first, let's calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: that's simply 'a'.

Then, for the extroverts and universals, we need to see how many groups of three we can make from 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals.

But, there's a constraint: each tent that has at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

Moreover, universals can be in tents with one, two, or three people.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents that have three people, including at least one extrovert.

Let me think about the total number of people that need to be placed in tents, excluding the introverts.

Total people excluding introverts: b + c.

Each tent for extroverts must have exactly three people, including at least one extrovert.

So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / (3 - 1)) = ceil(b / 2), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no.

Let's think in terms of the number of extroverts and how they can be grouped.

Each tent that includes at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, if we have 'b' extroverts, and each tent that includes an extrovert must have three people, then the number of such tents is ceil(b / 1), but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no.

Each tent that includes at least one extrovert must have exactly three people, and each extrovert must be in such a tent.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), but that would mean one tent per extrovert, which isn't efficient.

But extroverts can share tents with up to two other people.

Wait, no, each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, for each tent that has at least one extrovert, it must have exactly three people.

So, the number of such tents is ceil(b / 1), but that doesn't account for the fact that each tent can hold up to three people.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(b / 2).

No, I'm getting confused.

Let me try a different approach.

Suppose we have 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals.

Each tent that includes at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, these tents will have:

- One extrovert and two universals.

- Two extroverts and one universal.

- Three extroverts.

But in all cases, the tent must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert.

So, the number of such tents is ceil(b / 2), because:

- If we have one tent with one extrovert and two universals, that accommodates one extrovert and two universals.

- If we have a tent with two extroverts and one universal, that accommodates two extroverts and one universal.

- If we have a tent with three extroverts, that accommodates three extroverts.

So, in terms of extroverts, each tent can take up to two extroverts (in the case of two extroverts and one universal).

Wait, no, a tent can take up to three extroverts, but in that case, it's still three people.

But to maximize the number of extroverts per tent, we should aim for tents with three extroverts, if possible.

But we also have universals to consider.

So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number of people that need to be placed in tents, which is b + c, and the number of tents required is ceil((b + c) / 3), but with the constraint that each tent that has at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

Wait, but that might not be accurate because we have to ensure that all extroverts are in tents with exactly three people, including themselves.

Let me consider the following:

- Each tent that includes at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

- Tents without extroverts can have one, two, or three universals.

- Introverts must be in tents alone.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents that have three people, including at least one extrovert.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 2), because:

- If we have tents with two extroverts and one universal, each such tent accommodates two extroverts and one universal.

- If we have tents with one extrovert and two universals, each such tent accommodates one extrovert and two universals.

- If we have tents with three extroverts, each such tent accommodates three extroverts.

So, in terms of extroverts, each tent can take up to two extroverts (in the case of two extroverts and one universal) or three extroverts.

But, to minimize the number of tents, we should aim to have as many tents as possible with three extroverts.

But, we have to consider the number of universals available.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals together, ensuring that each tent that includes an extrovert has exactly three people.

Let me think about the total number of tents needed.

Total tents = tents for introverts + tents for extroverts and universals.

Tents for introverts: 'a'.

Tents for extroverts and universals: need to accommodate 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals, with the constraints that each tent with at least one extrovert has exactly three people.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents that have three people, including at least one extrovert.

Let me consider the following formula:

Total tents for extroverts and universals = ceil((b + c) / 3)

But, this doesn't account for the fact that tents with extroverts must have exactly three people.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to see how many tents are needed to accommodate 'b' extroverts, each requiring a tent with exactly three people, and then see how the universals can fill in those tents.

But, that's not quite right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have 'b' extroverts, and each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.

So, the total number of "spots" needed for extroverts is b * 2.

But, each tent can provide up to two spots for extroverts (since each tent can have up to two extroverts, with the third being a universal).

Wait, no, each tent can have up to two extroverts (if there is one universal in the tent).

Wait, no, each tent can have up to three extroverts, but in that case, there are no universals in that tent.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to model it differently.

Let's consider that each tent that has at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, for each such tent, it must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert.

We can have tents with:

- 1 extrovert + 2 universals

- 2 extroverts + 1 universal

- 3 extroverts

Now, the goal is to distribute 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals into tents of three people, with the above configurations.

The number of such tents would be the ceiling of b divided by the maximum number of extroverts per tent, which is 3.

Wait, but if we have tents with 3 extroverts, then the number of tents for extroverts would be floor(b / 3), but that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the number of tents needed is ceil(b / 2), because in the best case, we can have tents with 2 extroverts and 1 universal, so each tent takes care of 2 extroverts.

But, if we have more extroverts than that, we might need more tents.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(b / 2).

Let me check with an example.

Suppose b = 1, c = 2.

We can have one tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals.

Total tents: 1.

Which matches ceil(1 / 2) = 1.

Another example: b = 2, c = 1.

We can have one tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

Total tents: 1.

Which matches ceil(2 / 2) = 1.

Another example: b = 3, c = 0.

We can have one tent with 3 extroverts.

Total tents: 1.

Which matches ceil(3 / 2) = 2, but in this case, we can have all three in one tent, so ceil(3 / 3) = 1.

Hmm, seems like ceil(b / 2) might overestimate the number of tents needed.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(b / 2), but in some cases, it's ceil(b / 3).

Wait, perhaps it's min(ceil(b / 2), ceil(b / 3)).

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, let's think in terms of the number of tents required to accommodate 'b' extroverts, given that each tent can take up to 2 extroverts (in the case of 2 extroverts and 1 universal).

But, if there are enough universals, we can have tents with 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

If there are not enough universals, we might need to have tents with 3 extroverts.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 2), provided there are enough universals.

But, if there aren't enough universals, we might need to use tents with 3 extroverts.

Wait, more carefully:

If we have tents with 2 extroverts and 1 universal, then for each such tent, we accommodate 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

So, the number of such tents is floor((b + c) / 3).

But that might not be accurate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals is ceil(b / 2) + ceil((c - b) / 3), but that seems off.

Let me try to find a formula.

Let’s denote the number of tents that contain extroverts as t.

Each such tent must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert.

So, in total, these t tents will have 3*t people.

These 3*t people consist of 'b' extroverts and some number of universals.

The remaining universals will go into additional tents, which can have 1, 2, or 3 universals per tent.

So, the total number of tents is t plus the number of tents needed for the remaining universals.

But we need to minimize the total number of tents, so we should maximize the number of universals that go into the tents with extroverts.

So, t should be the minimum number such that 3*t >= b + (number of universals assigned to extrovert tents).

But this seems a bit convoluted.

Let me look for a better approach.

I recall that in similar problems, it's useful to consider the remainder when dividing by the group size.

In this case, since each tent for extroverts must have exactly three people, including at least one extrovert, we can think in terms of grouping 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals into groups of three, with the constraint that no group has zero extroverts.

So, we need to partition 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals into groups of three, each containing at least one extrovert.

We need to find the minimum number of such groups (tents).

This is equivalent to finding the smallest integer t such that:

- t >= ceil(b / 1), but that would mean one extrovert per tent, which isn't efficient.

Wait, no, because each tent can have up to two extroverts (in the case of two extroverts and one universal).

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the number of tents needed is ceil(b / 2), meaning that each tent can take up to two extroverts.

But, we also need to make sure that the number of universals is sufficient to fill the remaining spots in these tents.

Each tent that has extroverts requires 3 - e universals, where e is the number of extroverts in that tent (1 <= e <= 3).

To minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts per tent.

So, ideally, we would have as many tents as possible with three extroverts, then with two extroverts and one universal, and so on.

But, we have to see what's possible given the number of universals.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s compute the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals:

- Let t = ceil(b / 2). This assumes that each tent takes two extroverts and one universal.

But, we need to check if there are enough universals for this.

Each such tent requires one universal.

So, if c >= ceil(b / 2), then this is possible.

Otherwise, we need to adjust.

Wait, but if we have tents with three extroverts, we don't need any universals for those tents.

So, perhaps a better approach is:

- Compute the maximum number of tents that can have three extroverts: this is min(floor(b / 3), floor(c / 0)), but since c / 0 is undefined, it's just floor(b / 3).

- Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 3 * floor(b / 3).

- For the remaining extroverts, we need to form tents with two extroverts and one universal.

- The number of such tents is ceil((b - 3 * floor(b / 3)) / 2).

- For these tents, we need that many universals.

- Then, any remaining universals can be placed in additional tents.

But, I need to make sure that the number of universals is sufficient.

Let me try to generalize this.

Let’s compute the number of tents needed for extroverts:

- First, compute the number of tents that can have three extroverts: floor(b / 3).

- Then, the remaining extroverts are b % 3.

- For the remaining extroverts, if b % 3 == 0, no additional tents are needed.

- If b % 3 == 1, we need one additional tent with one extrovert and two universals.

- If b % 3 == 2, we need one additional tent with two extroverts and one universal.

But, in both cases, we need to make sure that there are enough universals.

So, total tents for extroverts and universals:

- floor(b / 3) + ceil(b % 3 / 2)

And, the number of universals required:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0 universals.

- If b % 3 == 1: 2 universals.

- If b % 3 == 2: 1 universal.

So, total tents for extroverts and universals: floor(b / 3) + ceil(b % 3 / 2)

And, the number of universals required is:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0

- If b % 3 == 1: 2

- If b % 3 == 2: 1

Then, the remaining universals are c - (number of universals used).

If the remaining universals are negative, it's impossible.

Otherwise, the remaining universals can be placed into additional tents, each tent can have up to three universals.

So, the number of additional tents needed for remaining universals is ceil((c - used Universals) / 3).

Therefore, total tents = tents for introverts (a) + tents for extroverts and universals (floor(b / 3) + ceil(b % 3 / 2)) + additional tents for remaining universals.

But, to minimize the total number of tents, we should maximize the number of universals that are placed in the tents with extroverts.

So, the formula I proposed earlier might not be optimal.

Wait, perhaps there is a better way.

I found this approach a bit confusing. Maybe I should look for a different way to model the problem.

Let’s consider that the tents for extroverts must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert.

Each such tent can have:

- 1 extrovert + 2 universals

- 2 extroverts + 1 universal

- 3 extroverts

Our goal is to minimize the number of tents, so we should maximize the number of tents that have three people.

To do that, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, then with two extroverts and one universal, and finally with one extrovert and two universals, depending on the availability of universals.

So, let’s try to compute the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

First, let's see how many tents we can have with three extroverts.

Let’s set as many tents as possible with three extroverts.

Let’s set t3 = min(floor(b / 3), floor(c / 0)).

Wait, but c / 0 is undefined.

Actually, tents with three extroverts don't require any universals.

So, t3 = floor(b / 3).

Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 3 * t3.

Now, with the remaining extroverts and universals, we need to form tents with two extroverts and one universal, or one extrovert and two universals.

So, let’s set t2 = floor((b - 3 * t3) / 2).

Each such tent takes two extroverts and one universal.

So, the number of universals used in these tents is t2.

Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 3 * t3 - 2 * t2.

And the remaining universals are c - t2.

Now, if there are any remaining extroverts, we need to place them into tents with one extrovert and two universals.

So, t1 = ceil((b - 3 * t3 - 2 * t2) / 1).

Each such tent takes one extrovert and two universals.

So, the number of universals used in these tents is 2 * t1.

Therefore, the remaining universals after all this would be c - t2 - 2 * t1.

If the remaining universals are negative, it's impossible.

Otherwise, the remaining universals can be placed into additional tents, each tent taking up to three universals.

So, the number of additional tents needed for remaining universals is ceil((c - t2 - 2 * t1) / 3).

Then, the total number of tents is:

a (for introverts) + t3 + t2 + t1 + ceil((c - t2 - 2 * t1) / 3)

But, this seems too complicated.

Maybe there is a simpler way.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample input and output.

Looking at the first test case:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

Output: 3

So, total tents: 1 (for introvert) + 1 (for two extroverts and one universal) + 1 (for two universals) = 3

Which matches.

Second test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

Output: -1

Let's see:

Tents for introverts: 1

Tents for extroverts:

- First tent: 3 extroverts (leaving 1 extrovert)

- Second tent: 1 extrovert and 2 universals, but there's only 1 universal left, so impossible.

Hence, -1.

Third test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

Output: 3

Tents:

- 1 tent for introvert

- 1 tent for 3 extroverts

- 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals

Total tents: 3

Fourth test case:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

Output: -1

Tents:

- 1 tent for introvert

- 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 1 universal, but this doesn't satisfy the extrovert's requirement of having exactly three people in the tent.

Hence, impossible, output -1.

Fifth test case:

a = 1, b = 3, c = 2

Output: 3

Tents:

- 1 tent for introvert

- 1 tent for 3 extroverts

- 1 tent for 2 universals

Total tents: 3

Sixth test case:

a = 19, b = 7, c = 18

Output: 28

Let's see:

Tents for introverts: 19

Tents for extroverts and universals:

- floor(7 / 3) = 2 tents with 3 extroverts (accommodating 6 extroverts)

- remaining extroverts: 7 - 6 = 1

- need 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals

- total tents for extroverts and universals: 2 + 1 = 3

- remaining universals: 18 - 2 = 16

- additional tents for remaining universals: ceil(16 / 3) = 6

- total tents: 19 + 3 + 6 = 28

Seems correct.

Seventh test case:

a = 0, b = 0, c = 0

Output: 0

Eighth test case:

a = 7, b = 0, c = 0

Output: 7

Ninth test case:

a = 0, b = 24, c = 0

Output: 8

Explanation:

- floor(24 / 3) = 8 tents with 3 extroverts each.

Tenth test case:

a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000

Output: 1666666667

Let's verify:

Tents for introverts: 1000000000

Tents for extroverts and universals:

- floor(1000000000 / 3) = 333333333 tents with 3 extroverts (accommodating 999999999 extroverts)

- remaining extroverts: 1000000000 - 999999999 = 1

- need 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals

- total tents for extroverts and universals: 333333333 + 1 = 333333334

- remaining universals: 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998

- additional tents for remaining universals: ceil(999999998 / 3) = 333333333 tents

- total tents: 1000000000 + 333333334 + 333333333 = 1666666667

Which matches the sample output.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Hence, the approach is:

- Tents for introverts: a

- Tents for extroverts and universals:

- floor(b / 3) tents with 3 extroverts

- ceil((b % 3) / 2) tents for remaining extroverts:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0 tents

- If b % 3 == 1: ceil(1 / 2) = 1 tent (for 1 extrovert and 2 universals)

- If b % 3 == 2: ceil(2 / 2) = 1 tent (for 2 extroverts and 1 universal)

- Universals used: 2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2)

- Remaining universals: c - (2 * (b % 3 == 1) + 1 * (b % 3 == 2))

- Additional tents for remaining universals: ceil(remaining universals / 3)

- Total tents: tents for introverts + floor(b / 3) + ceil(b % 3 / 2) + ceil(remaining universals / 3)

But, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of universals that are placed in the tents with extroverts.

Wait, perhaps there is a better way.

I found that in the sample inputs, the formula seems to work, but maybe there's a simpler way.

Looking back at the provided code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

k = 0

if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

So, the code is:

- For each test case:

- Read a, b, c

- If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, output -1

- Else, calculate k = a + floor((b + c) / 3)

- If (b + c) % 3 != 0, increment k by 1

- Output k

Let's see if this matches the sample inputs.

First test case:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

b % 3 = 2, 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3, so proceed.

k = 1 + floor((2 + 3)/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

Since (2 + 3) % 3 = 2 != 0, k += 1 → k = 3

Output: 3

Matches sample.

Second test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

b % 3 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so output -1

Matches sample.

Third test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

b % 3 = 1, 1 + 2 = 3 >= 3, proceed.

k = 1 + floor((4 + 2)/3) = 1 + 2 = 3

(4 + 2) % 3 = 0, so no increment.

Output: 3

Matches sample.

Fourth test case:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

b % 3 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, output -1

Matches sample.

Fifth test case:

a = 1, b = 3, c = 2

b % 3 = 0, proceed.

k = 1 + floor((3 + 2)/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

(3 + 2) % 3 = 2 != 0, k += 1 → k = 3

Output: 3

Matches sample.

Sixth test case:

a = 19, b = 7, c = 18

b % 3 = 1, 1 + 18 = 19 >= 3, proceed.

k = 19 + floor((7 + 18)/3) = 19 + floor(25/3) = 19 + 8 = 27

(7 + 18) % 3 = 25 % 3 = 1 != 0, k += 1 → k = 28

Matches sample.

Seventh test case:

a = 0, b = 0, c = 0

b % 3 = 0, proceed.

k = 0 + floor(0 + 0)/3 = 0

(0 + 0) % 3 = 0, no increment.

Output: 0

Matches sample.

Eighth test case:

a = 7, b = 0, c = 0

b % 3 = 0, proceed.

k = 7 + floor(0 + 0)/3 = 7 + 0 = 7

(0 + 0) % 3 = 0, no increment.

Output: 7

Matches sample.

Ninth test case:

a = 0, b = 24, c = 0

b % 3 = 0, proceed.

k = 0 + floor(24 + 0)/3 = 0 + 8 = 8

(24 + 0) % 3 = 0, no increment.

Output: 8

Matches sample.

Tenth test case:

a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000

b % 3 = 1, 1 + 1000000000 = 1000000001 >= 3, proceed.

k = 1000000000 + floor((1000000000 + 1000000000)/3) = 1000000000 + floor(2000000000/3) = 1000000000 + 666666666 = 1666666666

(2000000000) % 3 = 2 != 0, k += 1 → k = 1666666667

Matches sample.

So, the code seems to be correct.

Now, let's see if this logic is accurate.

The logic is:

- If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, output -1

- Else, k = a + floor((b + c)/3)

- If (b + c) % 3 != 0, k += 1

- Output k

Why does this work?

Well, the idea is to group all extroverts and universals into groups of three, with the constraint that each group must include at least one extrovert.

So, the total number of such groups is ceil((b + c)/3).

But, we have to ensure that in each group, there is at least one extrovert.

Given that, the minimal number of groups is floor((b + c)/3), but we might need an extra group if there are remaining people.

However, we have to make sure that the distribution allows for each group to have at least one extrovert.

That's why there's a condition:

- If b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then it's impossible to form the groups properly, hence output -1.

Otherwise, proceed with k = a + floor((b + c)/3), and if (b + c) % 3 != 0, increment k by 1.

This seems to capture the essence of the problem.

Hence, the given code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The given code is correct.}} \]
