Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on the preferences of different types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

First, I need to understand the constraints and preferences:

- Each tent can hold up to 3 people.

- Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent.

- Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, so each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

- Universals are flexible; they can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My task is to find the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or determine if it's impossible.

Okay, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to handle the introverts since they require their own tents. So, the number of tents needed for introverts is simply 'a'.

Next, I need to accommodate the extroverts. Each extrovert wants to be in a tent with two others, so for every extrovert, there needs to be two more people in the tent with them. These two others can be universals or other extroverts, but considering that extroverts also need two others, it might get a bit tricky.

Wait, actually, since extroverts need exactly two others in their tent, and universals are flexible, I can think of extroverts as requiring a tent that is fully occupied (three people), where at least one is an extrovert.

But I need to make sure that the number of extroverts and universals can be arranged in such a way that all extroverts are in tents with exactly two others.

Let me try to model this.

Let's say I have 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals.

Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly two others. So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), but wait, no, because each tent can have up to three people, and extroverts need exactly three people in their tent.

Wait, actually, since each tent for an extrovert must have exactly three people, including the extrovert, so each tent can accommodate one extrovert and two universals.

But universals are flexible, so they can also be in tents with fewer people.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I want to maximize the number of extroverts accommodated in tents with exactly three people, including the extrovert and two universals.

So, for every tent that has one extrovert and two universals, that accommodates one extrovert and two universals.

If I have 'b' extroverts, I need at least 2*b universals to fill up the tents with extroverts, but that's not necessarily true because universals can also be in tents without extroverts.

Wait, no. Each extrovert needs two others in their tent, but those two others can be any combination of universals and extroverts, as long as the tent has three people.

Wait, but if a tent has one extrovert, it must have exactly two others, but those two others can be universals or other extroverts.

Similarly, if a tent has two extroverts, then it needs one more person, who can be a universal.

Wait, but the problem states that for extroverts, the tent must have exactly three people.

Wait, re-reading: "Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people."

So, for any tent that contains at least one extrovert, it must have exactly three people.

But, tents that do not contain any extroverts can have one, two, or three people, since only tents with extroverts have the constraint of exactly three people.

Wait, no. The problem says: "Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people."

But it doesn't say anything about tents without extroverts. So, for tents that have extroverts, they must have exactly three people, but tents without extroverts can have one, two, or three people, depending on the universals.

Wait, but universals can be in tents with one, two, or three people.

Introverts must be in tents with exactly one person.

Extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people, and those tents must include the extrovert and two others, who can be universals or other extroverts.

So, I need to arrange the extroverts into tents of exactly three people each, and the remaining universals can be arranged into tents of one, two, or three people, but aiming to minimize the total number of tents.

To minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents that contain three people.

So, first, allocate tents for introverts: 'a' tents, each with one introvert.

Then, for extroverts, I need to place them into tents of exactly three people.

Each such tent will include one extrovert and two others (universals or extroverts).

But, since extroverts need to be in tents with exactly three people, and universals can be in any size tent, I should try to maximize the number of extroverts placed in tents with exactly three people.

Wait, but extroverts need to be in tents with exactly three people, so all extroverts must be in such tents.

The question is, how to arrange the universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

Let me think in terms of the number of tents needed for extroverts.

Since each tent for extroverts must have exactly three people, and at least one of them is an extrovert.

So, each such tent can absorb one extrovert and two universals.

If I have 'b' extroverts, and 'c' universals, I need to see if there are enough universals to fill up the tents with extroverts.

Each tent that includes one extrovert requires two universals.

But, if I have multiple extroverts, perhaps some tents can have more than one extrovert.

Wait, but if a tent has two extroverts, then it needs only one more person, who can be a universal.

Similarly, if a tent has three extroverts, it's fine, but I'm not sure if that's allowed, because each extrovert needs to be in a tent with two others, which would be satisfied if there are three extroverts in a tent.

Wait, but in that case, each extrovert is with two others, which satisfies their preference.

So, tents can have:

- One extrovert and two universals.

- Two extroverts and one universal.

- Three extroverts.

All of these are acceptable, as long as any tent with at least one extrovert has exactly three people.

Additionally, tents without extroverts can have one, two, or three universals.

My goal is to minimize the total number of tents.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents that have three people, including those with extroverts.

So, first, allocate tents for introverts: 'a' tents.

Then, for extroverts, I can group them into groups of three, if possible, each in their own tent.

If 'b' is divisible by 3, then I can have 'b'/3 tents, each with three extroverts.

If 'b' modulo 3 is 1, then I can have floor('b'/3) tents with three extroverts, and one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

Wait, but if 'b' modulo 3 is 1, and I have at least two universals, I can have floor('b'/3) tents with three extroverts, and one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

Similarly, if 'b' modulo 3 is 2, I can have floor('b'/3) tents with three extroverts, and one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

But, I need to ensure that there are enough universals for these configurations.

So, let's consider:

- If 'b' is divisible by 3, then I need 'b'/3 tents for extroverts, and the remaining universals can be arranged in tents of three each to minimize the number of tents.

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 1, then I need floor('b'/3) tents for three extroverts, and one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 2, then I need floor('b'/3) tents for three extroverts, and one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

In all cases, the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b/3).

But, I need to ensure that there are enough universals for the tents that require them.

Specifically:

- For each tent that has one extrovert and two universals, I need two universals.

- For each tent that has two extroverts and one universal, I need one universal.

So, in the case where 'b' modulo 3 is 1, I need at least two universals for the additional tent.

In the case where 'b' modulo 3 is 2, I need at least one universal for the additional tent.

If 'b' modulo 3 is 0, I don't need any universals for the extrovert tents.

So, the conditions are:

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 0, no problem, provided I have enough universals for the remaining tents.

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 1, I need at least two universals.

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 2, I need at least one universal.

But, after allocating the tents for extroverts, I have some universals left, which can be arranged into tents of three each.

So, the total number of tents is:

- 'a' tents for introverts.

- ceil(b/3) tents for extroverts.

- ceil((c - required universals)/3) tents for the remaining universals.

Wait, but I need to account for the universals required in the extrovert tents.

Let me try to calculate the required universals.

From above:

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 0, required universals are 0.

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 1, required universals are 2.

- If 'b' modulo 3 is 2, required universals are 1.

So, required universals = max(0, 2 - ('b' modulo 3))

Wait, no.

Wait, 'b' modulo 3:

- If 0, required universals = 0.

- If 1, required universals = 2.

- If 2, required universals = 1.

So, required universals = ('b' modulo 3) ? (3 - ('b' modulo 3)) : 0;

In other words, required universals = (3 - ('b' modulo 3)) % 3.

But, in programming terms, it's easier to handle it with conditional statements.

So, in code, it would be:

if b % 3 == 0:

required = 0

elif b % 3 == 1:

required = 2

else:

required = 1

Then, if c >= required, then it's possible, else, it's impossible.

Then, the total number of tents would be a + ceil((b + c - required)/3).

Wait, but need to be careful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the total number of tents needed for extroverts and the remaining universals.

So, first, allocate ceil(b/3) tents for extroverts.

Then, the number of universals used in these tents is:

- If 'b' modulo 3 == 0: 0

- If 'b' modulo 3 == 1: 2

- If 'b' modulo 3 == 2: 1

So, used Universals = 2 * (b // 3) + (b % 3 == 1 ? 2 : 0)

Wait, no.

Wait, for each full group of 3 extroverts, no universals are needed.

For each tent with 1 extrovert and 2 universals, need 2 universals.

For each tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal, need 1 universal.

So, the number of tents with 1 extrovert is max(0, b % 3 == 1 ? 1 : 0)

The number of tents with 2 extroverts is floor(b / 3) if b % 3 == 2 else 0

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total universals required for the extrovert tents.

So, total universals required = 2 * (number of tents with 1 extrovert) + 1 * (number of tents with 2 extroverts)

Then, the remaining universals can be placed into tents of 3 each.

So, total tents = a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

But, to minimize the number of tents, perhaps there is a better way.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

1 2 3

Output:

3

Explanation:

1 tent for the introvert.

1 tent for two extroverts and one universal.

1 tent for the remaining two universals.

Total: 3 tents.

This matches the calculation:

a = 1

ceil(b/3) = ceil(2/3) = 1

ceil((c - required_universals)/3) = ceil((3 - 1)/3) = ceil(2/3) = 1

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Which matches the sample.

Another sample:

1 4 1

Output: -1

Explanation:

b = 4

ceil(4/3) = 2 tents for extroverts.

Required universals:

4 % 3 = 1, so required universals = 2

But c = 1 < 2, so impossible.

Hence, -1.

Another sample:

1 4 2

Output: 3

Explanation:

a = 1

ceil(b/3) = ceil(4/3) = 2

required universals = 2 (since 4 % 3 = 1)

c = 2 >= 2

Total tents = a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required)/3) = 1 + 2 + ceil(0/3) = 3

Which matches the sample.

Wait, but in this case, after allocating two tents for extroverts (one tent with three extroverts and one tent with one extrovert and two universals), the remaining universals are c - required = 2 - 2 = 0, so no additional tents needed for universals.

Hence, total tents = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3.

Seems correct.

Another sample:

0 0 0

Output: 0

Which is straightforward.

Sample:

7 0 0

Output: 7

Explanation:

a = 7, b = 0, c = 0

So, 7 tents for introverts, no extroverts, no universals.

Sample:

0 24 0

Output: 8

Explanation:

a = 0, b = 24, c = 0

ceil(24/3) = 8 tents for extroverts.

Required universals:

24 % 3 = 0, so required universals = 0

Hence, total tents = 0 + 8 + ceil(0/3) = 8

Sample:

1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

Output: 1666666667

Explanation:

a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000

ceil(b/3) = ceil(1000000000/3) = 333333334

required universals:

1000000000 % 3 = 1, so required universals = 2

c - required = 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998

Then, ceil(999999998/3) = 333333333

Total tents = a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required)/3) = 1000000000 + 333333334 + 333333333 = 1666666667

Seems correct.

So, general formula:

If b % 3 == 0:

required_universals = 0

elif b % 3 == 1:

required_universals = 2

else:

required_universals = 1

if c >= required_universals:

total_tents = a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

else:

impossible, output -1

But, in the code provided, it seems to be calculating total_tents as a + ceil((b + c)/3)

But, according to my reasoning, it should be a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

Which is not necessarily the same as a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Wait, let's check with the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

required_universals = 1 (since b%3==2)

c - required_universals = 3 - 1 = 2

ceil(2/3) = 1

total_tents = 1 + ceil(2/3) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

But according to the code:

total_tents = a + ceil((b + c)/3) = 1 + ceil(5/3) = 1 + 2 = 3

Which matches.

Another sample:

a=1, b=4, c=1

required_universals = 2 (since b%3==1)

c - required_universals = 1 - 2 = -1 (invalid)

Hence, impossible, output -1

Code:

ceil(b/3) = ceil(4/3) = 2

c - required_universals = 1 - 2 = -1

ceil((-1)/3) not possible, but in code, it's ceil((b + c)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Then total_tents = a + ceil((b + c)/3) = 1 + 2 = 3

But according to the problem, it's impossible, so should output -1

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the code, it seems to check if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:

if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

So, in the case where b=4, c=1:

b % 3 = 1 != 0

b % 3 + c = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3 → true → print -1

Which matches the sample output of -1

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought the total_tents would be a + ceil((b + c)/3), but the code seems to handle the condition where it's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the code.

Looking back at the code:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

k = 0

if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:

print(-1)

else:

k += a + (b + c) // 3

if (b + c) % 3 != 0:

k += 1

print(k)

So, it's checking if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then output -1

Else, calculate k = a + floor((b + c)/3), and if (b + c) % 3 != 0, then k += 1

Which is equivalent to a + ceil((b + c)/3)

But, in my earlier reasoning, I thought it should be a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

But, in the first sample, both methods give 3, and in the second sample, the code correctly outputs -1.

Wait, but in the first sample:

a=1, b=2, c=3

b % 3 = 2 != 0

b % 3 + c = 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3 → so, not -1

Then, k = a + floor((b + c)/3) = 1 + floor(5/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

Then, since (b + c) % 3 != 0, k += 1 → k = 3

Which matches the correct answer.

In the second sample:

a=1, b=4, c=1

b % 3 = 1 != 0

b % 3 + c = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3 → output -1

Which is correct.

Another sample:

a=1, b=4, c=2

b % 3 = 1 != 0

b % 3 + c = 1 + 2 = 3 >= 3 → not -1

Then, k = a + floor((b + c)/3) = 1 + floor(6/3) = 1 + 2 = 3

Then, since (b + c) % 3 == 0, no additional increment.

Hence, k=3, which matches the sample.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, for a=1, b=4, c=1, it should be:

required_universals = 2 (since b%3==1)

c=1 < 2 → impossible, output -1

Which is what the code does.

For a=1, b=4, c=2:

required_universals = 2

c=2 >= 2

Then, total_tents = a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required)/3) = 1 + ceil(4/3) + ceil(0/3) = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

Which matches the code's output.

Another sample:

a=0, b=0, c=0

b % 3 = 0 → not -1

k = 0 + floor(0/3) = 0

No remainder, so k=0

Correct.

Sample:

7 0 0

b=0, c=0

b % 3 = 0 → not -1

k = 7 + floor(0/3) = 7 + 0 = 7

Correct.

Sample:

0 24 0

b=24, c=0

b % 3 = 0 → not -1

k = 0 + floor(24/3) = 0 + 8 = 8

Correct.

Sample:

1000000000 1000000000 1000000000

b=1000000000, c=1000000000

b % 3 = 1

b % 3 + c = 1 + 1000000000 >= 3 → not -1

k = 1000000000 + floor((1000000000 + 1000000000)/3) = 1000000000 + floor(2000000000/3) = 1000000000 + 666666666 = 1666666666

Then, since (b + c) % 3 != 0, k +=1 → k=1666666667

Which matches the sample.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be:

required_universals = 2 (since b % 3 ==1)

c - required_universals = 1000000000 - 2 = 999999998

ceil(999999998/3) = 333333333

Total tents = a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3) = 1000000000 + 333333334 + 333333333 = 1666666667

Which matches the code's output.

Hence, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that total_tents should be a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

But, in the code, it's calculating a + ceil((b + c)/3)

Which seems different, but in the samples, it matches.

Wait, perhaps mathematically, it's equivalent.

Let me see.

ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

Versus ceil((b + c)/3)

But in the sample where a=1, b=2, c=3:

ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3) = ceil(2/3) + ceil((3 - 1)/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

Plus a=1, total=3

Versus a + ceil((b + c)/3) = 1 + ceil(5/3) = 1 + 2 = 3

Matches.

Another sample: a=1, b=4, c=1

ceil(4/3) + ceil((1 - 2)/3) → invalid, but code correctly outputs -1

Another sample: a=1, b=4, c=2

ceil(4/3) + ceil((2 - 2)/3) = 2 + 0 = 2

Plus a=1, total=3

Which matches code's output.

Hence, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but why does this work?

Let me think.

The code calculates k = a + floor((b + c)/3)

If (b + c) % 3 != 0, k +=1

But, in reality, it's a + ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3)

But, in practice, it seems to give the correct answer in the samples.

Perhaps there's a mathematical equivalence here.

Let me consider that ceil(b/3) + ceil((c - required_universals)/3) can be simplified to ceil((b + c - required_universals)/3) + floor(required_universals/3)

But, required_universals is either 0,1,2.

If required_universals = 0: ceil(b/3) + ceil(c/3) = ceil((b + c)/3)

Wait, no, ceil(b/3) + ceil(c/3) is not necessarily equal to ceil((b + c)/3)

For example, b=2, c=2:

ceil(2/3) + ceil(2/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

ceil((2+2)/3) = ceil(4/3) = 2

Same.

Another example: b=2, c=1:

ceil(2/3) + ceil(1/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

ceil((2+1)/3) = ceil(3/3) = 1

Which is different.

Hence, in this case, it's not equal.

Wait, but according to the code, it would calculate a + ceil((b + c)/3)

In this case, a=0, b=2, c=1:

According to the code: 0 + ceil(3/3) = 1

But according to my earlier reasoning:

required_universals = 1 (since b%3==2)

c - required_universals = 1 - 1 = 0

ceil(0/3) = 0

Total tents = 0 + ceil(2/3) + 0 = 1

Which matches the code.

Wait, but in the earlier counterexample, it seemed to match.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the code is correct because it's effectively combining the extroverts and universals in a way that minimizes the number of tents.

Given that, perhaps it's correct.

Given that, I should conclude that the code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants with different preferences for the hike. The participants include introverts, extroverts, and universals, each with specific requirements for tent occupancy.

### Approach

1. **Introverts**: Each introvert needs their own tent, so the number of tents required for introverts is equal to the number of introverts (a).
2. **Extroverts and Universals**: Extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people, and universals can be in tents with one, two, or three people. To minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents with three people.

To achieve this:
- Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts, which is `ceil(b / 3)`.
- Determine if there are enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' tent requirements.
- Calculate the remaining universals after satisfying the extroverts' requirements and compute the additional tents needed for these remaining universals.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys
import math

def main():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index+1])
        c = int(data[index+2])
        index += 3
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k = a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**: Read all input data at once for efficiency.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, extract the number of introverts (a), extroverts (b), and universals (c).
   - Check if it's possible to accommodate the extroverts given the number of universals. If `b % 3 != 0` and the remaining universals (`b % 3 + c`) are less than 3, it's impossible, and we output -1.
3. **Calculating the Number of Tents**:
   - Calculate the base number of tents needed for introverts and the combined extroverts and universals: `a + floor((b + c) / 3)`.
   - If there are any remaining people who can't fill a tent completely (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), add one more tent.
4. **Output the Result**: Print the total number of tents required for each test case.

This approach ensures that the tents are used optimally, respecting the preferences of all participants while minimizing the total number of tents used.
