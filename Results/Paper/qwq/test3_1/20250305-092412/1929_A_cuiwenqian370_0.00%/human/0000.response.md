Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input:

In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. According to the explanation, rearranging it to [1, 2, 3] gives a beauty of (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

Wait a minute, but if I think about it, (a_i - a_{i-1}) for each i, and summing these up, isn't this just equal to a_n - a_1? Because it's a telescoping sum: (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the total sum should just be the last element minus the first element in the arranged array.

But in the first example, an - a1 is 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the given output. In the second example, all elements are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0, which also matches.

Wait, but in the third example, with array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90], rearranged in some way to get a beauty of 57. If it's just an - a1, then the maximum beauty would be the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is 100 - 43 = 57. Okay, that matches.

Similarly, in the fourth example, [3,4,3,3], the maximum beauty would be 4 - 3 = 1, which matches the output.

And in the fifth example, [2,1], it's 2 - 1 = 1, which also matches.

So, it seems that the beauty is simply the difference between the last and the first element in the arranged array.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, I should arrange the array such that the largest element is last and the smallest element is first. The order of the other elements in between doesn't matter because the intermediate differences will cancel out in the sum.

Wait, but in the first example, they arranged it as [1,2,3], which has the smallest first and the largest last, and the beauty is 2, which is 3-1.

But in the third example, [100,54,80,43,90], arranged in some order to get 57, which is 100 - 43.

So, seems like no matter how I arrange the middle elements, as long as the first is the smallest and the last is the largest, the beauty will be maximized.

Wait, but in the program given, it's sorting the array and then arranging it in a specific way: starting from the largest and smallest alternately.

Let me look at the code:

def func_1(n, arr):

arr.sort()

new_arr = []

left = 0

right = n - 1

while left <= right:

if left == right:

new_arr.append(arr[left])

else:

new_arr.append(arr[right])

new_arr.append(arr[left])

left += 1

right -= 1

max_beauty = 0

for i in range(1, n):

max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])

return max_beauty

So, it's sorting the array, then picking the largest and smallest alternately, and constructing a new array that way.

Then, it calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

But, according to my earlier reasoning, since the sum is just an - a1, why are we doing all this?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's see.

In the first example, sorted array is [1,2,3]. Then, left starts at 0 (1), right at 2 (3). It appends 3 and 1, then left=1, right=1, which is left==right, so appends 2. So, new_arr = [3,1,2]. Then, calculate |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3, but the expected beauty is 2. Hmm, that's different.

Wait, but in the explanation, they arranged it as [1,2,3], which gives beauty 2, but according to this function, it's arranging it as [3,1,2], which gives beauty 3.

But according to the problem, the beauty should be (a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) = (1-3) + (2-1) = (-2) + 1 = -1, but the function uses absolute differences, which would be |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3.

Wait, but in the problem description, it's (a_i - a_{i-1}), not necessarily positive differences. So, it could be negative.

But in the example, they have positive differences, maybe because they arranged the array in increasing order.

Wait, but the problem says "the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n", which is just an - a1, as I thought earlier.

But in the function, they are using absolute differences, which seems unnecessary.

Wait, in the first test case, with [1,2,3], the sum is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the example.

But in the function, it's arranging it as [3,1,2], and summing absolute differences, which gives 3.

But according to the problem, it should be an - a1, which would be 2 - 3 = -1, but in the example, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement:

"the beauty of the array a is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n."

So, it's sum_{i=2 to n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_n - a_1.

So, it's just a_n - a_1.

Wait, but in the first example, a_n - a_1 = 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the output.

In the second example, all elements are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0.

In the third example, 100 - 43 = 57.

Fourth example, 4 - 3 = 1.

Fifth example, 2 - 1 = 1.

So, it's indeed just a_n - a_1.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, we should have the largest element as a_n and the smallest as a_1.

The order of the middle elements doesn't matter.

But in the function provided, they are arranging the array in a specific way: largest, smallest, second largest, second smallest, etc.

And then summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's just sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which is a_n - a_1.

So, why are they doing this?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the beauty is sum of absolute differences: sum_{i=2 to n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|

If that's the case, then arranging it in an alternating large and small way would maximize the sum of absolute differences.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's (a_i - a_{i-1}), without absolute value.

But in the function, they are using absolute differences.

Which one is correct?

Let's look again at the problem statement:

"the beauty of the array a is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n."

No mention of absolute value.

So, it's sum_{i=2 to n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_n - a_1.

But in the function, they are summing absolute differences: sum_{i=2 to n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|

That doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Let me check the example again.

In the first test case, with [1,2,3], sum is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

In the function, with [3,1,2], sum would be |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3, but according to the problem, it should be (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1.

But in the explanation, they have positive differences, probably because they arranged it in increasing order.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the sum of positive differences, i.e., sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) where a is sorted in increasing order.

Wait, but in the first test case, sorted [1,2,3], sum is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2.

If arranged as [3,1,2], sum is (1-3) + (2-1) = -2 + 1 = -1.

So, the maximum beauty is 2, achieved by arranging in increasing order.

Hence, the function should arrange the array in increasing order and compute the sum as per the problem.

But in the function, they are arranging in an alternating fashion and summing absolute differences.

That seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to maximize sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|.

But the problem says sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), without absolute value.

So, it's just a_n - a_1.

Hence, to maximize a_n - a_1, we should have the largest a_n and the smallest a_1.

The rest of the array doesn't matter.

So, the function should simply find the maximum and minimum in the array and compute their difference.

That's all.

No need to sort or rearrange the array in any specific way.

Wait, but in the function, they are doing a lot more work than necessary.

Let me check with the third test case: [100,54,80,43,90]

Sorted: [43,54,80,90,100]

Arrange as [100,43,90,54,80]

Then sum of |43-100| + |90-43| + |54-90| + |80-54| = 57 + 47 + 36 + 26 = way more than 57.

But according to the problem, the beauty should be a_n - a_1, which is 100 - 43 = 57.

But the function is computing sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is much larger.

But in the example, the output is 57, which matches a_n - a_1.

So, perhaps the problem expects sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which is a_n - a_1, and not sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|.

Hence, the function is incorrect because it's summing absolute differences instead of just computing a_n - a_1.

Therefore, to fix the function, it should simply find the maximum and minimum in the array and return their difference.

Wait, but in the second test case, all elements are 69, so max - min = 0, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, [3,4,3,3], max is 4, min is 3, difference is 1, which matches the output.

In the fifth test case, [2,1], max is 2, min is 1, difference is 1, which matches.

Hence, the function can be simplified to return max(arr) - min(arr).

But the given function is doing a lot more work and summing absolute differences, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it's incorrect.

But in the examples, it seems to give the correct output, but only coincidentally because in those cases, sum of absolute differences happens to equal max - min.

But in reality, for other test cases, it would give wrong answers.

For example, take n=3, arr=[1,2,3], arranged as [3,1,2], sum of |1-3| + |2-1| = 2 + 1 = 3, but according to the problem, it should be 2.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is to maximize sum of |a_i - a_{i-1}|.

But the problem statement says sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), without absolute value.

Hence, it's just a_n - a_1.

Hence, the function should return max(arr) - min(arr).

Hence, the given function is incorrect.

But in the given function, they are summing absolute differences, which coincidentally equals max - min in the examples provided, but not in general.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem statement again.

"the beauty of the array a is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n."

So, sum_{i=2 to n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) = a_n - a_1.

Hence, to maximize a_n - a_1, we need to maximize a_n and minimize a_1.

Hence, set a_n to max(arr), a_1 to min(arr), and the rest can be in any order.

Hence, beauty = max(arr) - min(arr).

Hence, the function should return max(arr) - min(arr).

But the given function is doing something else.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{false}} \]
