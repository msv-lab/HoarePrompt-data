Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is simply the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. In a grid, it's the distance you'd travel if you can only move horizontally and vertically, not diagonally. So, for example, in a 2x2 grid, the possible Manhattan distances between any two cells are 0 (for the same cell), 1 (for adjacent cells), and 2 (for diagonally opposite cells).

Looking at the examples provided:

- For n=2, the output is:

1 1

1 2

And it says that H = {0,1}, with size 2, and it's the maximum possible.

- For n=3, the output is:

2 1

2 3

3 1

And H = {0,1,2,3}, with size 4.

- For n=4, it's a bit more involved, but apparently, you can achieve a certain H with size 6 or something.

I need to find, for each n, a set of n cells that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances between pairs of these cells.

My initial thought is that to maximize the number of distinct distances, I should spread out the cells as much as possible, so that their distances vary widely.

But I need to be systematic about this.

Let me consider small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

For n=2:

- Choosing (1,1) and (1,2) gives distances 0 and 1.

- Choosing (1,1) and (2,2) gives distances 0 and 2.

- Choosing (1,1) and (2,1) gives distances 0 and 1.

- Choosing (1,2) and (2,2) gives distances 0 and 1.

It seems that the maximum number of distinct distances is 2 in this case.

For n=3:

- The example chooses (2,1), (2,3), (3,1). Let's compute the distances:

- Between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 2

- Between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- So H = {1,2,3}. But according to the note, it's {0,1,2,3}. Wait, maybe I need to include the zero distances as well, since a cell has distance zero to itself.

But in the n=2 example, H was {0,1}, so yes, including zero.

But in n=2, there are only two cells, so only one actual distance between them, which is 1, and then zero for each cell to itself.

But in the n=3 case, with three cells, there are three pairwise distances: 2,1,3, and each cell has zero distance to itself.

So H has four elements: 0,1,2,3.

Seems like that's the maximum for n=3.

Now, for n=4, according to the example, there are four cells chosen, and apparently, H has more elements.

I need to find a general strategy for any n.

One approach could be to place the cells in such a way that their pairwise distances are as distinct as possible.

Perhaps placing them along the diagonal or something like that.

Wait, in the n=2 case, placing them in the same row gives distances 0 and 1.

Placing them diagonally gives 0 and 2.

But in n=3, the example places two in the same row and one below, giving distances up to 3.

Wait, in n=3, the maximum possible Manhattan distance is when one cell is at (1,1) and the other at (3,3), which is |1-3| + |1-3| = 4, but in the example, they have distances up to 3.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in n=3, the maximum Manhattan distance is between (1,1) and (3,3), which is 2 + 2 = 4.

But in the example, with cells at (2,1), (2,3), (3,1):

- (2,1) to (2,3): 2

- (2,1) to (3,1): 1

- (2,3) to (3,1): 1 + 2 = 3

So, no distance 4 is achieved there.

Maybe there's a better arrangement that includes distance 4.

But according to the note, this is the optimal.

Wait, perhaps in n=3, 4 is not achievable because the maximum distance is 4, but with only three points, maybe you can't get all distances up to 4.

Wait, with three points, you can have at most three pairwise distances, plus the zero distances.

So, H can have up to four elements: zero and three positive distances.

In the example, they have 0,1,2,3.

Is 4 achievable with three points in a 3x3 grid?

Let's see:

If I choose (1,1), (2,2), (3,3):

- Distance between (1,1) and (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 2

- Distance between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 4

- Distance between (2,2) and (3,3): |2-3| + |2-3| = 2

So, H = {0,2,4}.

That gives three distinct distances besides zero.

But in the previous arrangement, they have four: 0,1,2,3.

So, that's better.

Hence, the arrangement in the example seems better.

Wait, but in the note, they choose (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), getting distances 1,2,3.

Alternatively, choosing (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) gives distances 2 and 4.

So, in terms of the number of distinct distances, both have three distinct positive distances plus zero, so H has four elements in both cases.

But in the first arrangement, they have distances 1,2,3, and in the second, 2,4.

So, in terms of maximizing the number of distinct distances, both are equally good, since H has four elements in both cases.

But perhaps the problem wants the maximum possible |H|, which is four in this case.

Moving on, for n=4, the example provides an arrangement with four points.

I need to generalize this for any n.

I need to find a way to choose n points in an n x n grid such that the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any two points is maximized.

One idea is to place the points in a way that minimizes overlapping distances.

For example, placing them along a diagonal might not be optimal because many distances could be the same.

Alternatively, placing them in a way that they are spread out, perhaps in a spiral or some other pattern that varies the distances.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

What's the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances for a given n?

Well, the Manhattan distance can range from 0 up to 2(n-1).

Because the maximum |x1 - x2| is n-1, and similarly for y, so |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| can be up to 2(n-1).

But not all values between 0 and 2(n-1) may be achievable, depending on n and the arrangement of points.

Moreover, with n points, there are C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2 pairwise distances, plus the zero distances for each point.

So, |H| can be at most min(n(n-1)/2 + 1, 2(n-1) + 1).

But I need to maximize |H|, so I need to choose points such that their pairwise distances are as distinct as possible.

Now, looking back at the provided program, let's see what it does.

The function func reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, reads n and outputs n points.

Specifically:

- It always prints (1,1) and (1,2).

- If n == 3, it prints (2,3).

- Otherwise, it prints (2,4), and then for each j from 4 to n, it prints (j,j).

Wait, for n=4, it prints:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

For n=5:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

4 5

5 5

And for n=6:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

4 5

5 5

6 6

Let me check for n=3:

It prints:

1 1

1 2

2 3

Let me verify if this is optimal.

For n=3:

- Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,3)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 1

- (1,1)-(2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus zero for each point.

So H = {0,1,2,3}, which matches the example.

For n=4:

- Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): |1-2| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- (1,2)-(2,4): |1-2| + |2-4| = 1 + 2 = 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5

- (2,4)-(4,4): |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Plus zero for each point.

So H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is seven elements.

Is this the maximum possible for n=4?

Well, with n=4, the maximum Manhattan distance is 6 (between corners), and the smallest is 0.

If we can achieve all distances from 0 up to 6, that would be seven distances.

But in this arrangement, H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which seems optimal.

For n=5:

- Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (4,5)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(4,5): |1-4| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7

- (1,2)-(2,4): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(4,5): |1-4| + |2-5| = 3 + 3 = 6

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2

- (2,4)-(4,5): |2-4| + |4-5| = 2 + 1 = 3

- (4,4)-(4,5): 1

- Plus zero for each point.

So H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, which is eight elements.

Again, seems optimal.

For n=6:

- Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(4,5): 7

- (1,1)-(5,5): |1-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8

- (1,1)-(6,6): 10

- (1,2)-(2,4): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(4,5): 6

- (1,2)-(5,5): |1-5| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7

- (1,2)-(6,6): 9

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2

- (2,4)-(4,5): 3

- (2,4)-(5,5): |2-5| + |4-5| = 3 + 1 = 4

- (2,4)-(6,6): |2-6| + |4-6| = 4 + 2 = 6

- (4,4)-(4,5): 1

- (4,4)-(5,5): |4-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2

- (4,5)-(5,5): 1

- (5,5)-(6,6): |5-6| + |5-6| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Plus zero for each point.

So H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, which is eleven elements.

Again, seems optimal.

So, the pattern in the provided program is:

- Always choose (1,1) and (1,2).

- For n=3, choose (2,3).

- For n=4, choose (2,4) and (4,4).

- For n>=5, choose (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), ..., up to n points.

And for n=6, it chooses (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6).

I need to verify if this pattern indeed maximizes |H| for any n.

Looking at the distances computed above, it seems that for each n, the chosen points yield a set H with as many distinct distances as possible.

But to be thorough, I should check if there's a better arrangement that can achieve more distinct distances.

For n=2, H has 2 elements: {0,1}. It's impossible to have more.

For n=3, H has 4 elements: {0,1,2,3}. Is it possible to have five?

The maximum possible Manhattan distance is 4 (for n=3), so H can have at most five elements: {0,1,2,3,4}.

But in the arrangement chosen, H has four elements.

Is there an arrangement where H has five elements?

Let's try:

Choose (1,1), (2,2), (3,3):

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,2): 2

- (1,1)-(3,3): 4

- (2,2)-(3,3): 2

- So H = {0,2,4}, which has three distinct positive distances.

Not better than the previous arrangement.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (1,3), (3,1):

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(3,1): 2

- (1,3)-(3,1): 4

- So H = {0,2,4}, again three distinct positive distances.

Another arrangement: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2):

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(2,3): 3

- (1,1)-(3,2): 3

- (2,3)-(3,2): 2

- So H = {0,2,3}, again three distinct positive distances.

Seems like no arrangement for n=3 can achieve five distinct distances.

Hence, H has at most four elements for n=3.

Therefore, the provided program's output for n=3 is optimal.

For n=4, H has seven elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Is it possible to achieve eight?

The maximum Manhattan distance is 6, so H can have at most seven elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}.

Hence, the provided arrangement is optimal.

Similarly, for n=5, H has eight elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.

Wait, in my earlier calculation for n=5, I have H with eight elements, but actually, it's nine elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.

Wait, in the n=5 case, the possible Manhattan distances range from 0 to 8.

In the provided program's arrangement, H has nine elements.

But in my earlier calculation, I listed eight elements, but actually, it should be nine.

Wait, let's recount for n=5:

- Points: (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (4,5)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,2): 1

- (1,1)-(2,4): 4

- (1,1)-(4,4): 6

- (1,1)-(4,5): 7

- (1,2)-(2,4): 3

- (1,2)-(4,4): 5

- (1,2)-(4,5): 6

- (2,4)-(4,4): 2

- (2,4)-(4,5): 3

- (4,4)-(4,5): 1

- Plus zero for each point.

So H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, which is eight elements.

Is it possible to achieve nine?

Well, the maximum Manhattan distance is 8 (between corners like (1,1) and (5,5)), and the smallest is 0.

If we can have all distances from 0 to 8, that would be nine elements.

But in this arrangement, H has eight elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.

Wait, where is 8?

Oh, in the n=5 case, (1,1) to (5,5) is |1-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8, which is included in the distances.

Wait, in the arrangement above, (1,1)-(5,5): 8.

But in the earlier list, I missed that.

So, H should be {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, which is nine elements.

Hence, the provided program's arrangement for n=5 is optimal.

Similarly, for n=6, H has eleven elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

Is it possible to have more?

The maximum Manhattan distance is 10 (between corners like (1,1) and (6,6)), so H can have at most eleven elements: {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}.

Hence, the provided arrangement is optimal.

So, based on these observations, it seems that the provided program's approach is correct for the given examples.

Now, I need to generalize this for any n.

Looking at the pattern:

- Always choose (1,1) and (1,2).

- For n=3, choose (2,3).

- For n=4, choose (2,4) and (4,4).

- For n=5, choose (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5).

- For n=6, choose (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6).

It seems that after choosing (1,1) and (1,2), the next points are chosen in a specific pattern.

Specifically:

- Choose (2, n).

- Then, choose (n, n).

- Then, choose (n, n-1), (n, n-2), ..., as needed to reach n points.

Wait, for n=4, it's (2,4), (4,4).

For n=5, it's (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5).

For n=6, it's (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6).

So, the pattern is:

- Always choose (1,1) and (1,2).

- Then, choose (2,4).

- Then, choose (4,4).

- Then, choose (4,5), (5,5), and so on, up to (n,n).

But why (2,4)? Is there a reason for choosing (2,4)?

Looking back, in n=3, it chooses (2,3), which is similar to (2,4) for n>=4.

Maybe it's a general rule: choose (2,n).

But for n=3, it's (2,3), which is (2,n).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- Choose (1,1) and (1,2).

- Then, choose (2,n).

- Then, choose (n,n).

- Then, if n is larger, choose (n,n-1), (n,n-2), ..., until you have n points.

This seems to be the pattern.

Now, I need to verify if this approach maximizes |H| for any n.

From the examples, it seems to work.

But to be sure, let's think about n=7.

For n=7, according to the pattern:

- Choose (1,1), (1,2), (2,7), (7,7), (7,6), (7,5), (5,5).

Wait, but in the provided program, for n>=5, it chooses (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), and so on.

Wait, but in n=6, it chooses (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6).

So, for n=7, it would choose (2,4), (4,4), (4,5), (5,5), (6,6), (7,7), and one more point, probably (7,6).

But in my earlier thought, I had (2,7) for n=7, but in the program, it's (2,4).

Wait, perhaps the program has a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

print('1 1')

print('1 2')

if n == 3:

print('2 3')

else:

print('2 4')

for j in range(4, n + 1):

print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))



So, for n>=4, it prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), and then (4,4), (5,5), ..., (n,n).

Wait, for n=5, it prints (1,1), (1,2), (2,4), (4,4), (5,5).

But in the example for n=5, it's (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5).

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In the problem's example for n=5, the output is:

1 1

1 3

1 4

2 1

5 5

But in the provided program, for n=5, it's:

1 1

1 2

2 4

4 4

4 5

5 5

So, different from the problem's example.

But in my earlier calculation, the program's arrangement for n=5 gives H with eight or nine elements, which seems optimal.

But the problem's example for n=5 has a different arrangement.

Let me check the problem's example arrangement for n=5:

- Points: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (2,1), (5,5)

- Distances:

- (1,1)-(1,3): 2

- (1,1)-(1,4): 3

- (1,1)-(2,1): 1

- (1,1)-(5,5): 8

- (1,3)-(1,4): 1

- (1,3)-(2,1): 3

- (1,3)-(5,5): 6

- (1,4)-(2,1): 4

- (1,4)-(5,5): 5

- (2,1)-(5,5): 7

- Plus zero for each point.

So H = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, which is nine elements.

Same as the provided program's arrangement.

Hence, both arrangements achieve the same |H|.

So, multiple arrangements can achieve the same maximum |H|.

Therefore, the provided program's approach is correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**
