Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform a certain operation on it multiple times to maximize the sum of the array. The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing these operations, and I need to output the maximum sum possible along with a sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for "minimum excludant," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given set. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not.

So, the operation allows me to select any subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I can do this up to 5*10^5 times, but I don't need to minimize the number of operations, just ensure that I don't exceed the limit.

Given that n can be up to 18, which is relatively small, it suggests that an exhaustive or a dynamic programming approach might be feasible.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

In the first sample:

Input:

2

0 1

Output:

4 1

1 2

Explanation: After applying the operation on the entire array, the MEX of [0,1] is 2, so both elements become 2, resulting in a sum of 4.

In the second sample:

Input:

3

1 3 9

Output:

13 0

Explanation: The sum is already 13, and no operations are needed because any operation would set a subarray to its MEX, which might not increase the sum.

In the third sample:

Input:

4

1 100 2 1

Output:

105 2

3 3

3 4

Explanation: After the first operation on [3,3], it becomes [0], so the array is [1,100,0,1]. Then, applying the operation on [3,4], the MEX of [0,1] is 2, so both become 2, resulting in [1,100,2,2], summing to 105.

In the fourth sample:

Input:

1

0

Output:

1 1

1 1

Explanation: Applying the operation on the single element, its MEX is 1 (since MEX of [0] is 1), so it becomes 1.

From these examples, it seems that applying the operation strategically can increase the sum by setting subarrays to their MEX, which might be higher than the current elements.

Now, I need to find a way to maximize the sum. Since n is small (n <= 18), a dynamic programming approach could be feasible. I need to consider all possible ways to partition the array and compute the MEX for each subarray.

Let me think about how to model this with DP.

Define dp[l][r] as the maximum sum for the subarray from index l to r.

Base case: When l == r, dp[l][r] = max(1, arr[l])

Because if I have a single element, I can set it to its MEX, which is 1 if arr[l] == 0, or arr[l] if it's already greater than 0.

Wait, no. MEX of a single element arr[l] is the smallest non-negative integer not in {arr[l]}. So, if arr[l] == 0, MEX is 1. If arr[l] == 1, MEX is 0, but wait, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present, so MEX of [1] is 0, but according to the problem, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

Wait, in the first sample, MEX of [0,1] is 2, which is correct. So, MEX of [1] should be 0, because 0 is not in the set.

But in the fourth sample, MEX of [0] is 1, because 0 is present, so the smallest non-present is 1.

Wait, there's a confusion here.

Actually, MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

So, MEX of [0] is 1, because 0 is present.

MEX of [1] is 0, because 0 is not present.

MEX of [0,1] is 2, because 0 and 1 are present.

So, in the fourth sample, with a single element 0, its MEX is 1, so setting it to 1 increases the sum from 0 to 1.

In the first sample, [0,1], MEX is 2, setting both to 2 gives sum 4.

So, in general, for a subarray, its MEX can be computed, and setting all elements in that subarray to MEX would contribute MEX * length of subarray to the total sum.

But I need to maximize the sum, so I need to choose how to partition the array into subarrays and set each subarray to its MEX.

This sounds similar to segmenting the array in a way that maximizes the sum when each segment is set to its MEX.

So, perhaps I can consider all possible ways to split the array into segments and compute the sum for each segmentation, then choose the one with the maximum sum.

Given that n is small (n <= 18), an O(n^3) DP approach should be feasible.

Let me formalize this.

Define dp[l][r] as the maximum sum for the subarray from index l to r.

Transition:

- For a subarray from l to r, I can choose to set the entire subarray to its MEX, contributing MEX * (r - l + 1) to the sum.

- Or, I can split the subarray into smaller segments.

So, for each possible split point i in [l, r), I can compute dp[l][i] + dp[i+1][r].

But wait, in this problem, when I set a subarray to its MEX, it affects the MEX values of other subarrays because MEX depends on the values in the subarray.

Wait, no, each operation is independent in terms of choosing subarrays and setting them to their MEX.

But the operations are sequential, and each operation can be on any subarray of the current array state.

But the problem allows up to 5*10^5 operations, which is way more than needed, and I don't need to minimize the number of operations.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as choosing a partition of the array into segments, where each segment is set to its MEX, and I need to choose the partition that maximizes the sum.

In other words, I can think of the operations as partitioning the array into segments, and setting each segment to its MEX, and I need to choose the partition that maximizes the sum.

This seems reasonable because each operation can be thought of as setting a segment to its MEX, and since operations are independent in terms of choosing different subarrays, I can effectively partition the array into segments and set each segment to its MEX.

So, the problem reduces to finding a partition of the array into segments that maximizes the sum of MEX(segment) * length(segment) for all segments.

Given that, I can use a DP approach where dp[i] represents the maximum sum for the subarray from 0 to i.

But since the array is small (n <= 18), I can also consider precomputing the MEX for all possible subarrays and then finding the partition that maximizes the sum.

Wait, but n is up to 18, which means there are 18 choose 2 possible subarrays, which is manageable.

Wait, more precisely, the number of subarrays is n*(n+1)/2, which is manageable for n=18.

So, perhaps I can precompute the MEX for all subarrays and then find a way to partition the array to maximize the sum.

But I need to model this in a way that allows overlapping subarrays, but since operations are sequential and can be on any subarrays, I need to ensure that the partition doesn't overlap, as overlapping would require considering the dependencies between operations.

Wait, but in reality, each operation can be on any subarray of the current array state, and operations are sequential. However, since the problem allows up to 5*10^5 operations, which is way more than needed, and I don't need to minimize the number of operations, perhaps I can assume that operations are non-overlapping for simplicity.

But that might not lead to the optimal sum. So, I need a better way to model this.

An alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each node represents a position in the array, and edges represent possible segments, with weights being the sum contributed by setting that segment to its MEX.

Then, finding the maximum sum would be equivalent to finding a path that covers all positions with maximum weight.

This sounds similar to the maximum interval scheduling problem, but with weights.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a DP where dp[i] is the maximum sum for the first i elements.

Then, for each i, I can consider all possible segments ending at i, and choose the one that gives the maximum sum.

But I need to consider all possible partitions, not just those ending at i.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or something similar.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix a partition of the array into segments, and for each segment, I set it to its MEX, and sum up the contributions.

I need to choose the partition that maximizes this sum.

Given that, I can model this using DP, where dp[l][r] is the maximum sum for the subarray from l to r.

Then, the transitions would be:

- Set the entire subarray from l to r to its MEX, contributing MEX(l to r) * (r - l + 1) to the sum.

- Or, split the subarray into smaller segments: for each k in [l, r), dp[l][r] = dp[l][k] + dp[k+1][r].

Then, dp[0][n-1] would give the maximum sum for the entire array.

This seems promising.

Now, I need to compute the MEX for each subarray efficiently.

Given that n is small (n <= 18), I can precompute the MEX for all possible subarrays.

To compute MEX of a subarray, I can iterate through all possible subarrays and compute their MEX values.

Once I have all MEX values precomputed, I can use them in my DP transitions.

So, first step: precompute MEX for all subarrays.

Then, implement the DP as described.

Additionally, I need to output the sequence of operations that achieve this maximum sum.

To do that, I need to keep track of the choices made in the DP, i.e., which segments are chosen to be set to their MEX.

This can be done by storing the parent information or by reconstructing the operations after computing the DP table.

Given that, I need to implement the DP to maximize the sum, and then backtrack to find the sequence of operations.

Now, looking at the provided code, it seems to implement something similar to what I described.

Let's analyze the code step by step.

First, it reads the input values: n and the array arr.

Then, it defines a dictionary res_dict to store the results of subproblems.

It defines a function func_1(start_index, end_index) that computes the maximum sum for the subarray from start_index to end_index.

In this function, it first checks if the result is already computed and stored in res_dict. If yes, it returns that value.

If not, it computes it as follows:

- If the subarray has only one element, it returns max(1, arr[start_index]). This makes sense because the MEX of a single element is 1 if arr[start_index] is 0, otherwise it's arr[start_index].

- For subarrays with more than one element, it considers two main options:

1. Set the entire subarray from start_index to end_index to its MEX, contributing (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2 to the sum. This seems incorrect because MEX is not necessarily (end_index - start_index + 1). Maybe there's a mistake here.

2. Split the subarray into smaller segments and sum their individual maximum sums.

Wait, in the code, it seems to have a mistake:

res = (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2

This is assigned to res, but this doesn't make sense because MEX is not necessarily (end_index - start_index + 1). For example, in the first sample, MEX of [0,1] is 2, but (2 - 1 + 1)^2 = 4, which coincides with the sum, but this might be a coincidence.

Wait, in the first sample, MEX is 2, and setting both elements to 2 gives sum 4, which is (2 - 1 + 1)^2 = 4. So, perhaps the author observed this pattern.

But in general, MEX is not equal to (r - l + 1), so this seems like a mistake.

Wait, let's look at another sample.

In the third sample:

Input:

4

1 100 2 1

If I consider the entire array, MEX of [1,100,2,1] is 0, because 0 is not present. So, setting all to 0 would give sum 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is worse than the original sum of 1 + 100 + 2 + 1 = 104.

But in the sample output, it's 105, which is better than both the original sum and the sum after setting the entire array to MEX.

So, the approach in the code seems flawed because it assumes that setting the entire subarray to MEX gives a sum of (r - l + 1)^2, which is not generally true.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
