Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game played on a tree structure with n nodes, where the tree has exactly two leaves, making it similar to an array. There are t rounds, but in this version, t is always 1, which simplifies things a bit. Each round starts with a stone on one node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor until no moves are left. The player who can't make a move loses. Both players play optimally, and I need to determine who wins each round.

First, I need to understand the tree structure. Since it's a tree with exactly two leaves, it must be a straight line, like a linked list, because in a tree, leaves are nodes with only one edge. If there are exactly two leaves, it means the tree is a path where all internal nodes have two edges, connecting to the previous and next nodes in the path.

So, the tree can be visualized as a linear structure, like an array or a list, where each node is connected to at most two other nodes, except for the two leaves, which are connected to only one node each.

Given that, I can represent the tree as a list of nodes in order, from one leaf to the other.

Now, the game is played by placing a stone on a starting node and alternately moving it to an inactive neighbor. The nodes are activated as the stone moves to them, and once a node is active, it can't be used again. The player who can't make a move loses.

Since the tree is linear, the game essentially boils down to moving the stone along this path, and the game's state can be determined based on the position of the stone and the active nodes.

I need to determine, for a given starting node, whether Ron (the first player) or Hermione (the second player) will win if both play optimally.

In games like this, where players take turns and the game state changes with each move, the concept of "game theory" and "Nim-game" or "Sprague-Grundy theorem" might apply, especially for more complex structures. However, since the tree is linear, there might be a simpler way to determine the winner based on the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Let me think about it in terms of the number of moves available.

Each move activates a new node, and the game ends when there are no more inactive neighbors to move to.

Since the tree is a straight path, the number of moves is determined by the number of nodes that can be activated starting from the initial node.

But wait, in this game, only inactive neighbors can be moved to, and once a node is active, it can't be used again. So, the game progresses by moving the stone along the path, activating nodes as it goes.

Given that it's a linear path, once the stone is moved in one direction, all subsequent moves must be in that direction until it reaches a leaf.

Wait, no. Actually, since it's a tree, and in this case, a linear path, each move is to an inactive neighbor. So, from the starting node, you can move to either neighbor, provided they are inactive.

But in this game, since nodes are activated as the stone moves to them, and only inactive neighbors can be moved to, it's like traversing the path, but you can't go back to a previously activated node.

Given that, if the starting node is not a leaf, the first player (Ron) can choose to move towards one leaf or the other.

However, since the tree is symmetric in a way (being a straight path), the outcome might depend on the parity of the distances from the starting node to the leaves.

Wait, in the problem, it's specified that t=1, so I only need to handle one starting node.

Let me look at the examples provided.

In the first example:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

Output: Ron

So, n=3, t=1

Edges: 2-3 and 3-1

So the tree is 1-3-2

Starting node is 3

From 3, you can move to 1 or 2.

If Ron moves to 1, then Hermione can move to 2, and then there are no moves left, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but the output is Ron, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the game ends when there are no more inactive neighbors to move to.

In this case, starting at 3, Ron can move to 1 or 2.

If Ron moves to 1, then Hermione can only move to 2, and then there are no more moves, so Hermione wins.

But the output is Ron, which suggests that Ron has a winning strategy.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, the total number of moves determines the winner.

If the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins, because he makes the last move.

If it's even, Hermione wins, because she makes the last move.

Wait, but in the first example, starting at 3, Ron moves to 1, Hermione moves to 2, and then no moves left, so total moves: 2 (even), so Hermione wins, but the output is Ron.

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Let me look at the second example:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

Output: Hermione

So, n=5, t=1

Tree is 1-2-3-4-5

Starting at 5

Ron moves to 4, Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 2, Hermione moves to 1, and then no moves left.

Total moves: 4 (even), so Hermione wins, which matches the output.

So, in the first example, starting at 3, moves would be:

Ron: 3 to 2

Hermione: 2 to 1

No more moves, total moves: 2 (even), so Hermione should win, but the output is Ron.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

If Ron moves from 3 to 2, Hermione moves from 2 to 1, and then there are no more moves, so Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, but output is Ron.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the game ends when the current player can't make a move, meaning the player who makes the last move wins.

In the first example:

- Ron moves from 3 to 2

- Hermione moves from 2 to 1

- Now, Hermione can't move anymore, so Ron wins.

Yes, that makes sense. The player who makes the last move wins, and the one who can't make a move loses.

So, in the first example, Hermione can't make a move after her second move, so Ron wins.

In the second example:

- Ron moves from 5 to 4

- Hermione moves from 4 to 3

- Ron moves from 3 to 2

- Hermione moves from 2 to 1

- Now, Hermione can't move anymore, so Ron wins, but the output is Hermione, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think in terms of game theory and impartial games.

In impartial games like Nim, the Sprague-Grundy theorem can be applied.

But in this case, the game is played on a tree, specifically a path graph.

In path graphs, the game of moving a stone to an inactive neighbor is similar to moving a piece on a path.

This seems similar to the game of Nim with a single pile, where the number of moves corresponds to the number of nodes that can be activated.

But in this problem, the tree is a path, and the game is played by moving the stone along the path, activating nodes as they are visited.

I need to determine the number of possible moves and see who makes the last move.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a game where the number of moves is equal to the number of nodes that can be activated starting from the initial node.

In the first example:

n=3, starting at 3.

Possible moves: 3->2, 3->1

Then, from 2: 2->1

From 1: no moves

Similarly, from 1: 1->3->2->1, but 1 is already active, so it's invalid.

Wait, no, once a node is active, it can't be moved to again.

So, if Ron moves from 3 to 2, Hermione moves from 2 to 1, and then no moves are left.

Total moves: 2, which is even, so Hermione makes the last move, meaning Ron wins, but the output is Ron, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the player who cannot make a move loses, and the player who makes the last move wins.

In the first example:

- Ron moves from 3 to 2

- Hermione moves from 2 to 1

- Now, Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins.

In the second example:

- Ron moves from 5 to 4

- Hermione moves from 4 to 3

- Ron moves from 3 to 2

- Hermione moves from 2 to 1

- Now, Hermione cannot make a move, so Ron wins, but the output is Hermione, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the rules.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Each move consists of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that cannot make a move loses."

So, the game starts with one node activated (the starting node), and the players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor, activating it in the process.

The game ends when the current player cannot make a move, and that player loses.

In the first example:

- Start at 3 (activated)

- Ron moves to 2 (activates 2)

- Hermione moves to 1 (activates 1)

- Ron cannot move anymore, so Ron loses, but the output is "Ron", which suggests Ron wins, so maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the output is "Ron" when Ron wins, and "Hermione" when Hermione wins.

In the first example, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's move, so Hermione wins, but the output is "Ron", which is incorrect unless I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is misstated in the example or I'm misunderstanding the rules.

Wait, in the first example, starting at 3:

- Ron moves to 2

- Hermione moves to 1

- Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins, but the output is "Ron", which suggests Ron wins, which is contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the player who cannot make a move loses, and in this case, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's turn, so Hermione wins, but the output is "Ron", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there is a misinterpretation of the starting conditions.

Wait, perhaps the starting node is considered already activated, and the first move is to an inactive neighbor.

In the first example:

- Start at 3 (activated)

- Ron moves to 2 (activates 2)

- Hermione moves to 1 (activates 1)

- Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which is inconsistent.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the starting node is not activated initially, but I think the problem says it is activated.

Wait, let's read the problem again:

"Each move consists of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player that cannot make a move loses."

So, the starting node has the stone on it and is considered activated.

In the first example, starting at 3:

- Ron moves to 2

- Hermione moves to 1

- Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the game ends when a player cannot make a move, and that player loses.

In this case, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's turn, so Ron loses, but output is "Ron", which might mean Ron wins, which is contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the output is "Ron" when Ron wins, and "Hermione" when Hermione wins.

Given that, in the first example, Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the game is such that the player who makes the last move wins, and the one who cannot make a move loses.

In the first example:

- Ron moves from 3 to 2

- Hermione moves from 2 to 1

- Ron cannot move, so Hermione makes the last move, so Hermione wins, which matches the output "Ron" if "Ron" means Ron wins, but in this case, Hermione wins.

This is confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps, in a path graph, the game can be analyzed by considering the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

If the starting node is such that the maximum number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

In the first example, starting at 3, the maximum number of moves is 2, which is even, so Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which is inconsistent.

In the second example, starting at 5, the number of moves is 4, which is even, so Hermione wins, and output is "Hermione", which matches.

So, perhaps there is a mistake in my earlier reasoning for the first example.

Wait, perhaps the number of moves is odd in the first example.

Wait, in the first example, starting at 3, moves are:

1. Ron moves to 2

2. Hermione moves to 1

Total moves: 2, which is even, so Hermione makes the last move, meaning Ron wins, but output is "Ron", which would mean Ron wins, but according to my earlier logic, Hermione should win.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the player who cannot make a move loses, and in the first example, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's turn, so Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which suggests Ron wins, which is inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the game ends when the active node has no inactive neighbors, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

In the first example, after Hermione moves to 1, Ron cannot move because 1 has no inactive neighbors, so Ron loses, meaning Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which is inconsistent.

This suggests that perhaps the program is incorrect.

But before concluding that, let's look at the program provided.

The program seems to be reading n and t, then reading the edges to build the tree, identifying the two leaves, constructing the path from one leaf to the other, and then for each starting node, determining who wins.

In the func_1 function:

- It reads n and t, though t is always 1.

- It builds the adjacency list of the tree.

- It finds the two leaves (nodes with degree 1).

- It constructs the path from one leaf to the other.

- It finds the index of the starting node in this path.

- It calculates two moves: the distance from the starting node to one end and to the other end.

- It checks if any of these distances is odd; if so, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

So, in the first example, starting at 3, which is in the middle, the distances to both ends are 1, which is odd, so Ron wins, which matches the output "Ron".

Wait, in the path [1,3,2], the index of 3 is 1.

moves = [1, 1], both are odd (1 is odd), so Ron wins.

In the second example, path is [1,2,3,4,5], starting at 5, index is 4.

moves = [4, 0], 4 is even, 0 is even, so Hermione wins.

But in the first example, moves = [1,1], both odd, so Ron wins, which matches the output "Ron".

Wait, but earlier I thought that in the first example, Hermione should win, but according to the program, Ron wins, which matches the output.

Perhaps my initial reasoning was wrong.

Let me re-examine the first example:

n=3, t=1

Edges: 2-3 and 3-1

So, the path is 1-3-2

Starting at 3.

Possible moves:

- Ron moves to 1, then Hermione moves to 2, and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

- Alternatively, Ron moves to 2, then Hermione moves to 1, and Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

But according to the program, it's checking if any of the distances from the starting node to the ends is odd.

Here, both distances are 1, which is odd, so Ron wins.

But according to the game play, Hermione wins.

This suggests that the program might be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the game can be modeled as a sum of two Nim-heaps, where each heap corresponds to the number of moves available in each branch.

In a path graph, starting from a node, the game can be seen as two separate games: one towards each leaf.

In the first example, starting at 3, there are two branches: 3-1 and 3-2.

Each branch has one move.

In Nim-game terms, it's like having two heaps of size 1.

The XOR of the heap sizes is 1 XOR 1 = 0, which means the second player wins, so Hermione wins, but the program says Ron wins.

Wait, but in this problem, Ron is the first player, and if the XOR is 0, the second player wins, so Hermione wins, but the output is "Ron", which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is wrong in this case.

In the second example, starting at 5, which is a heap of size 4, and another heap of size 0 (since 5 is one of the leaves).

XOR of 4 and 0 is 4, which is non-zero, so first player wins, meaning Ron wins, but the output is "Hermione", which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the program, it checks if any of the moves is odd; in the second example, moves = [4,0], 4 is even, 0 is even, so Hermione wins, which matches the output "Hermione".

But in the first example, moves = [1,1], both odd, so Ron wins, which is incorrect based on the game play, but matches the output "Ron".

So, the program is producing the correct output, but based on my earlier reasoning, it seems wrong.

Perhaps I need to consider that in the first example, Ron has a winning strategy.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that Ron can choose to move in a way that ensures he wins.

In the first example, starting at 3:

- Ron moves to 2

- Hermione moves to 1

- Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins

But according to the program, Ron wins, which suggests that perhaps my earlier analysis is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Ron can choose which direction to move to maximize his winning chances.

In this case, since both directions have the same number of moves, it doesn't matter which direction Ron chooses; Hermione will still win.

But according to the program, Ron wins, which contradicts this.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the game is such that the player who moves to a leaf loses, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, the number of moves is calculated as the sum of the distances from the starting node to each leaf.

In the first example, starting at 3, distance to 1 is 1, distance to 2 is 1, sum is 2, which is even, so Hermione wins, but output is "Ron", which is incorrect.

In the second example, starting at 5, distance to 1 is 4, distance to 5 is 0, sum is 4, which is even, so Hermione wins, and output is "Hermione", which matches.

So, perhaps the program is incorrectly determining the winner in the first example.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, the output is "Ron", but based on the game play, Hermione should win.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

But in the second example, the program's output matches the expected output.

So, perhaps there is an error in the program's logic.

Looking back at the program:

It calculates two moves: the distance from the starting node to one end and to the other end.

Then, it checks if any of these distances is odd.

If any is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, both distances are 1 (odd), so Ron wins.

In the second example, distances are 4 and 0, both even, so Hermione wins.

But according to the game play, in the first example, Hermione should win, not Ron.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but the output matches the program's output, which is "Ron", but according to the game play, Hermione should win.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

But perhaps there is something wrong with my understanding of the game.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of moves available.

In the first example, starting at 3, there are two possible moves: to 1 or to 2.

If Ron moves to 1, Hermione moves to 2, and Ron cannot move.

Total moves: 2 (even), so Hermione makes the last move, meaning Ron wins, which contradicts the expected output.

Wait, but in this case, Hermione cannot make a move after her second move, so Ron should win, but according to the game rules, the player who cannot make a move loses, so Hermione loses, meaning Ron wins, which matches the output "Ron".

But earlier, I thought that Hermione makes the last move, but in this case, she cannot make a move, so she loses.

Therefore, Ron wins, which matches the output "Ron".

So, perhaps my initial confusion came from miscounting who makes the last move.

In the first example, Hermione cannot make a move after her second move, so she loses, and Ron wins.

Hence, the program is correct.

In the second example, starting at 5:

- Ron moves to 4

- Hermione moves to 3

- Ron moves to 2

- Hermione moves to 1

- Ron cannot move, so Hermione wins.

Total moves: 4 (even), Hermione makes the last move, so Ron wins, but according to the game rules, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's fourth move, so Ron loses, meaning Hermione wins, which matches the output "Hermione".

Therefore, the program is correct in both examples.

So, the program's logic seems to hold.

It calculates the distances from the starting node to both leaves and checks if any of them is odd.

If any distance is odd, Ron wins; else, Hermione wins.

In the first example, both distances are 1 (odd), so Ron wins.

In the second example, distances are 4 and 0 (both even), so Hermione wins.

This matches the expected outputs.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played on a tree structure with specific properties. The tree is linear, having exactly two leaves, and the game involves moving a stone along inactive neighbors until no moves are left. The player unable to make a move loses.

### Approach

1. **Tree Structure Analysis**:
   - The tree is linear, similar to an array, with exactly two leaves.
   - We represent the tree as a list of nodes in order from one leaf to the other.

2. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game starts with a stone on a specified node, which is considered activated.
   - Players alternately move the stone to an inactive neighbor, activating it.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - Calculate the distances from the starting node to both leaves.
   - If any of these distances is odd, Ron (the first player) wins.
   - If both distances are even, Hermione (the second player) wins.

### Solution Code

```python
from functools import reduce
import math
from collections import deque, defaultdict

t = 1
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, t) = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
        nodes[u].append(v)
        nodes[v].append(u)
    ends = []
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            ends.append(key)
    (s, e) = list(ends)
    tree = [s]
    prev = s
    curr = nodes[s][0]
    while curr != e:
        tree.append(curr)
        if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][1]
        else:
            prev = curr
            curr = nodes[curr][0]
    tree.append(e)
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [idx, n - idx - 1]
    if any([move % 2 == 1 for move in moves]):
        print('Ron')
    else:
        print('Hermione')
```

### Explanation

1. **Tree Construction**:
   - Read the tree structure from input and build an adjacency list.
   - Identify the two leaves of the tree.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - Construct the linear path from one leaf to the other.

3. **Starting Position Analysis**:
   - Determine the positions of the starting node in the path.
   - Calculate distances from the starting node to both leaves.

4. **Determine Winner**:
   - If any distance is odd, Ron wins.
   - If both distances are even, Hermione wins.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for each game round.
