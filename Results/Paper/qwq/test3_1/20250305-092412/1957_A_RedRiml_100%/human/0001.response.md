Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each with a certain number of sticks of various lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with each stick used in at most one polygon. Regular polygons mean all sides are equal, like equilateral triangles, squares, regular pentagons, and so on.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a regular polygon. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all internal angles equal. So, for sticks of the same length, I can form a polygon with that many sides, provided I have enough sticks.

For example, to make a triangle, I need at least 3 sticks of the same length. For a square, I need 4 sticks of the same length, and so on for higher polygons.

Looking at the sample input and output:

- In the first test case, there's only one stick, which isn't enough to form any polygon. So, output is 0.

- In the second test case, there are two sticks of the same length, which isn't enough to form a polygon (since the smallest polygon is a triangle, requiring 3 sticks). So, output is 0.

- In the third test case, there are six sticks: two of length 2 and four of length 3. The code seems to consider only the count of each stick length and then checks if any count is at least 3, then it calculates how many triangles (or higher polygons?) can be made from them.

Wait, but in the third test case, the output is 1. Looking back, it's because there are four sticks of length 3, which can form a square. But according to the code, it's checking if the count is at least 3 and then doing integer division by 3 to see how many shapes can be made.

So, in this case, for sticks of length 3, count is 4. 4 divided by 3 is 1 (integer division), so it counts one shape, which corresponds to using 3 sticks to make a triangle, but in the note, it says it's making a square using all four sticks. There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the code. Let's look closer.

The code reads the number of test cases, w, and then for each test case:

- Reads the number of sticks, ln.

- Reads the list of stick lengths, palka.

- Initializes an empty list pl and a dictionary d.

- Iterates through the sticks, counting the occurrences of each length using the dictionary d, and also collecting unique lengths in pl.

- Then, for each unique length in pl, if the count is at least 3, it adds the floor division of the count by 3 to the shapes count.

- Finally, prints the shapes count.

But, according to the problem, we need to form regular polygons, which could be triangles (3 sides), squares (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), etc. The code seems to be considering only triangles, as it checks if the count is at least 3 and then divides by 3 to see how many triangles can be made.

However, in the sample input's third test case, it's mentioned that we can make one square with four sticks of length 3. But according to the code, it would make one triangle (since 4 // 3 = 1), which doesn't align with the sample output explanation.

Wait, in the sample output for the third test case, it's 1, and the explanation says it's making a square. So, perhaps the code is incorrect in this regard.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Maybe the code is trying to maximize the number of shapes by considering the minimum number of sides required, which is 3, and thus dividing the count by 3 to see how many shapes can be made.

But that doesn't seem right because, for example, if I have 4 sticks of the same length, I can make one square, which is better than making one triangle and leaving one stick unused.

Wait, perhaps the goal is to maximize the number of shapes, not necessarily the number of sides per shape.

So, if I have 4 sticks of length 3, I can make one square, which is one shape. Alternatively, I could make one triangle and have one stick left over, which is still only one shape. So, in terms of the number of shapes, it's the same.

But, if I have 5 sticks of the same length, I can make one square and one triangle, which would be two shapes, or just one pentagon, which is one shape. So, choosing to make smaller shapes allows for more shapes, but according to the problem, it seems like it's asking for the maximum number of shapes, not necessarily using all sticks.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, with 9 sticks: four of length 4 and five of length 2, the output is 2. According to the note, it's making a pentagon with side length 2 and a square with side length 4, which totals two shapes.

If I were to follow the code's logic, for sticks of length 2: count is 5, 5 // 3 = 1 (so one triangle), and for sticks of length 4: count is 4, 4 // 3 = 1 (so one triangle), totaling two shapes, which matches the sample output.

But in reality, for sticks of length 2, I can make one pentagon (5 sides), which is one shape, and for length 4, I can make one square, which is another shape, totaling two shapes.

So, in this case, the code happens to give the correct number, but for the wrong reason. It's counting how many triangles can be made from each group of sticks, whereas actually, we should be considering the possibility of making larger polygons to maximize the number of shapes.

Wait, but in this case, making a pentagon and a square gives two shapes, which is the same as making two triangles from the sticks.

But in general, making larger polygons would use more sticks per shape, potentially allowing for fewer shapes but using more sticks.

Wait, but the problem is to maximize the number of shapes, not necessarily using all sticks.

So, perhaps the strategy is to make as many small shapes (triangles) as possible, since they use fewer sticks and thus allow for more shapes.

But in the fourth test case, making two triangles would use 6 sticks (3 for each), leaving 3 sticks unused. Alternatively, making a pentagon and a square uses all 9 sticks.

But the sample output is 2, which matches making two triangles.

Wait, but according to the note, it's making a pentagon and a square, which also totals two shapes, but uses all sticks.

So, in terms of the number of shapes, it's the same as making two triangles.

But perhaps making larger shapes is necessary when the number of sticks doesn't divide evenly by 3.

Wait, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, the code would make one triangle (using 3 sticks) and leave one stick unused, but according to the note, it's making one square (using all four sticks).

But the sample output is 1, which matches both scenarios.

Wait, perhaps in cases where sticks can form a polygon with more sides, it's better to do so, but in terms of the number of shapes, it's the same.

But in the fourth test case, making a pentagon and a square uses all sticks and makes two shapes, which is the same as making two triangles and leaving some sticks unused.

So, perhaps the code coincidentally gives the correct number of shapes, but for the wrong reason.

But is the code actually correct or not?

Let me think differently. Maybe the problem allows using sticks of different lengths for different shapes, as long as each shape is regular on its own.

So, for example, in the fourth test case, I can make a pentagon with side length 2 (using five sticks of length 2) and a square with side length 4 (using four sticks of length 4), totaling two shapes.

Alternatively, I could try to make more shapes with the remaining sticks, but since I have only five sticks of length 2, I can make one pentagon, and four sticks of length 4, making one square.

If I try to make smaller shapes, like triangles, I could make one triangle with three sticks of length 2, and one triangle with three sticks of length 4, totaling two shapes again.

But in this case, making pentagons and squares uses more sticks, but the number of shapes remains the same.

So, perhaps the strategy is to make as many shapes as possible, regardless of their size, as long as all shapes are regular.

But in this case, it seems that making larger shapes doesn't give more shapes; it just uses more sticks.

Wait, but in the third test case, making one square with four sticks of length 3 gives one shape, which is the same as making one triangle with three sticks and leaving one stick unused.

So, in terms of the number of shapes, it's the same.

Hence, perhaps the code is correct in outputting the maximum number of shapes by considering the minimum number of sides required per shape, which is 3.

But let's consider another example.

Suppose n=7, with stick lengths: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1.

According to the code, d[1]=7, so shapes = 7//3 = 2 (using 6 sticks to make two triangles, leaving one stick unused).

Alternatively, I could make one triangle and one quadrilateral, which is also two shapes.

Or, make one hexagon and leave one stick unused, which is one shape.

So, the maximum number of shapes is two.

Hence, the code seems correct in this case.

Another example: n=10, with stick lengths: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2.

According to the code, d[2]=10, shapes=10//3=3 (using 9 sticks to make three triangles, leaving one stick unused).

Alternatively, I could make one triangle and one heptagon, which is two shapes.

Or, make one pentagon and one square, which is two shapes.

But making three triangles uses more shapes.

Hence, according to the problem's goal to maximize the number of shapes, making three triangles is better than making fewer larger shapes.

Therefore, the code seems to be correctly maximizing the number of shapes by considering the minimum number of sides per shape, which is 3.

Hence, for each unique stick length, it calculates how many triangles can be made from them and sums up these counts for all unique lengths.

Therefore, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from given sticks of various lengths, ensuring each stick is used in at most one polygon.

## Approach

1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases, followed by the details of each test case (number of sticks and their lengths).
2. **Frequency Counting**: For each test case, count the frequency of each unique stick length.
3. **Polygon Formation**: For each unique stick length, calculate how many triangles (the smallest regular polygon with 3 sides) can be formed. This is determined by integer division of the frequency of each stick length by 3.
4. **Summing Up Shapes**: Sum the number of triangles that can be formed from each stick length to get the total number of regular polygons.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = {}
        for stick in sticks:
            if stick not in freq:
                freq[stick] = 1
            else:
                freq[stick] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            shapes += count // 3
        print(shapes)

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1**: Read the number of test cases (`t`).
- **Step 2**: For each test case, read the number of sticks (`n`) and the list of stick lengths.
- **Step 3**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each unique stick length.
- **Step 4**: For each unique stick length, calculate how many triangles can be formed by dividing the frequency by 3 using integer division.
- **Step 5**: Sum these values to get the total number of regular polygons that can be formed and print the result.

This approach ensures that we maximize the number of regular polygons by forming as many triangles as possible from the available sticks for each unique length.
