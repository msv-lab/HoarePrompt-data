Alright, I have this problem here about cows participating in a coding tournament. Each cow has a unique rating, and they compete in a series of matches where the higher-rated cow always wins. I'm supposed to figure out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve, and I have the option to swap my cow's position with another cow's position exactly once.

First, I need to understand the tournament structure. There are n cows, each in positions 1 to n. The tournament starts with a match between the cows in positions 1 and 2. Then, each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. This continues until all matches are done.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for my cow, which is cow k. I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow or choose not to swap at all.

Let me think about how the tournament progresses. In each match, the higher-rated cow wins and proceeds to the next match. So, effectively, it's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner keeps advancing.

If I don't swap any positions, the tournament proceeds with the initial ordering, and my cow k will participate in the matches according to its initial position.

But I have the option to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once. This could potentially change the sequence of matches and give my cow more opportunities to win.

I need to find the best possible swap (or choose not to swap) to maximize the number of wins for my cow.

Let me consider the initial case where I don't swap any positions. I need to simulate the tournament and count how many wins my cow gets.

Then, I need to consider all possible swaps: swapping my cow with cow 1, with cow 2, ..., with cow n, and for each swap, simulate the tournament and count the wins for my cow.

Finally, I choose the option that gives the maximum number of wins.

But considering that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution. Simulating the tournament for each test case and for each possible swap is not feasible due to time constraints.

So, I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of wins without simulating every possible swap.

Let me think about the tournament structure more carefully.

The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. The winner is the one with the higher rating.

Then, the winner of the first match plays against cow 3.

Then, the winner of that match plays against cow 4, and so on, until all cows have participated.

So, it's like a tournament where the initial winner progresses through the line of cows, facing each one in turn.

Now, if I want to maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to position it in such a way that it gets to play against cows with lower ratings as much as possible.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, I need to ensure that my cow is as high as possible in the sequence, but I can only perform one swap.

Let me consider the initial sequence without any swaps.

I can simulate the tournament and see how many wins my cow gets.

Then, consider swapping my cow with another cow to see if that increases the number of wins.

But again, simulating for each possible swap is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament is essentially a sequence of matches where the winner of each match advances to the next one.

So, it's like a single-elimination tournament, but not a standard one because the matches are not paired in the usual way.

In this setup, the cow that wins the entire tournament is the one that can defeat all other cows in sequence.

But I'm not interested in who wins the tournament; I'm interested in maximizing the number of wins for my cow.

Given that, I need to think about the path my cow takes through the tournament and how many wins it can accumulate before being defeated.

Now, if I can position my cow in a favorable location through a single swap, I can potentially increase its number of wins.

Let me consider the initial sequence.

Suppose I don't perform any swap.

I can determine how many wins my cow gets by seeing how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat before encountering a cow with a higher rating.

But actually, since the tournament is structured in a specific way, I need to simulate the matches to see exactly how many wins my cow gets.

Wait, but simulating the entire tournament for each test case is feasible because n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5, so it should be manageable.

But I need to optimize it further.

Let me try to model the tournament.

Let's say we have cows in positions 1 to n.

Match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2 → winner advances.

Match 2: winner of match 1 vs cow 3.

Match 3: winner of match 2 vs cow 4.

...

Match n-1: winner of match n-2 vs cow n.

So, it's like a linked list where each match is a step.

Now, if my cow is in position k, and I don't swap, I need to see how many matches it can win starting from its initial position.

But actually, since the matches are sequential, I need to see when my cow gets into the tournament sequence.

Wait, actually, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Start with match 1 between cow 1 and cow 2.

- The winner of match 1 then plays against cow 3 in match 2.

- The winner of match 2 plays against cow 4 in match 3.

- And so on, until all cows have participated.

So, the tournament is essentially a sequence where the initial two cows compete, and the winner faces the next cow, and so on.

Given that, the tournament can be represented as a binary tree where each match is a node, and the winner advances to the next level.

But in this case, it's a bit different because it's not a standard balanced binary tree; it's more like a linked list, where each match's winner plays the next cow in sequence.

Given that, the tournament can be simulated by repeatedly finding the winner between two cows and advancing.

But simulating this for each test case directly might be too slow if done naively.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that higher-rated cows always win.

So, the cow with the highest rating will win the entire tournament.

Now, if my cow has the highest rating, it will win all matches.

But probably, my cow doesn't have the highest rating.

So, I need to see how many cows with higher ratings are there, and how they are positioned relative to my cow.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of how many cows with higher ratings are before my cow in the sequence.

Because, in the tournament, the matches are sequential, and the winner of each match advances to the next match.

So, if there are cows with higher ratings before my cow, they might defeat my cow earlier in the tournament.

But, if I can swap my cow earlier in the sequence, before some higher-rated cows, I might delay the match against those higher-rated cows, thus increasing the number of wins.

Alternatively, if I swap my cow to a position where it can avoid facing higher-rated cows until later, I can maximize its wins.

This seems a bit complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I don't perform any swap.

I can simulate the tournament and see how many wins my cow gets.

Then, consider performing a swap between my cow and another cow, and see if that increases the number of wins.

But again, doing this for all possible swaps is too slow.

I need a way to calculate the maximum possible wins in a more efficient manner.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is determined by how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

So, effectively, it's the number of cows with lower ratings that are after my cow in the sequence, plus one (for the first win), until it faces a higher-rated cow.

But, since the tournament is sequential, I need to consider the sequence of matches.

Wait, maybe I can model this as the number of consecutive wins before losing.

In other words, the number of cows with lower ratings that are after my cow in the sequence, plus one, minus one, because the first match is against the next cow.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think about it step by step.

First, without any swap, I need to determine how many wins my cow can achieve.

Then, consider performing one swap to optimize that number.

I need to find a way to calculate this efficiently.

Let me consider that the tournament can be represented as a sequence of matches, where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, starting with cows 1 and 2, the winner faces cow 3, and so on.

Now, if my cow is in position k, I need to see when it enters the tournament sequence.

In this setup, my cow in position k will enter the tournament when the previous k-1 cows have been matched against each other, and the winner of those matches faces my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me try to understand the match sequence.

Match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2 → winner W1.

Match 2: W1 vs cow 3 → winner W2.

Match 3: W2 vs cow 4 → winner W3.

...

Match k-1: W_{k-2} vs cow k → winner W_{k-1}.

...

Match n-1: W_{n-2} vs cow n → winner W_{n-1}.

So, my cow in position k faces the winner of the first k-1 cows.

If my cow has a higher rating than W_{k-1}, it wins and proceeds to face cow k+1, and so on.

Otherwise, it loses.

But, since higher-rated cows always win, W_{k-1} is the highest-rated among the first k-1 cows.

Therefore, if a_k > W_{k-1}, my cow wins against W_{k-1}, and then proceeds to face cow k+1, and so on.

This continues until my cow faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are after my cow in the sequence, plus one (for the match against W_{k-1}), until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, more precisely, it's the number of consecutive cows after position k that have lower ratings than my cow.

But, I need to consider that W_{k-1} might be higher than my cow, in which case my cow doesn't even win the first match.

So, first, I need to check if a_k > W_{k-1}, where W_{k-1} is the highest-rated cow among the first k-1 cows.

If a_k > W_{k-1}, then my cow wins the first match and proceeds to face cow k+1.

If a_k > W_{k-1} and a_k > a_{k+1}, it wins again, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position k that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one (for the match against W_{k-1}), but only if a_k > W_{k-1}.

If a_k <= W_{k-1}, then my cow doesn't even win the first match, so the number of wins is zero.

So, without any swap, the number of wins for my cow is:

- If a_k > max(a_1 to a_{k-1}), then the number of consecutive cows after k with a_i < a_k, plus one.

- Else, zero.

Now, with one swap, I can choose to swap my cow with another cow to potentially change the sequence and maximize the number of wins.

I need to consider swapping my cow with another cow, say cow j, and then recalculate the number of wins for my cow in the new sequence.

I need to choose the swap that maximizes the number of wins for my cow.

But again, considering that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about possible optimizations.

First, precompute the maximum rating among the first k-1 cows for each k.

Wait, actually, for each k, W_{k-1} is the maximum of a_1 to a_{k-1}.

So, I can precompute the prefix maximum of the array a.

Then, for each k, if a_k > prefix_max[k-1], then my cow can start winning matches.

Otherwise, it doesn't win any matches.

Then, the number of wins is the length of the longest suffix starting from k where a_k > a_{k+1}, a_k > a_{k+2}, and so on.

But, since I can perform one swap, I need to consider swapping my cow with another cow to potentially increase the number of wins.

I need to consider two scenarios:

1. Swapping my cow with a cow before it, to change the W_{k-1}.

2. Swapping my cow with a cow after it, to change the sequence of cows it faces.

Let me consider these two scenarios separately.

First, swapping my cow with a cow before it.

If I swap my cow with a cow before it, say position i < k, then the new position of my cow is i, and the cow that was in position i is now in position k.

In this case, W_{i-1} is the maximum of a_1 to a_{i-1} (which might include the cow that was originally in position k).

Then, my cow in position i can win if a_k > W_{i-1}.

If it wins, it proceeds to face cow i+1, and so on.

Similarly, I need to calculate the number of wins for my cow in this new position.

Second, swapping my cow with a cow after it.

If I swap my cow with a cow after it, say position j > k, then my cow is now in position j.

In this case, W_{j-1} is the maximum of a_1 to a_{j-1}, which now includes the cow that was originally in position k.

Then, my cow in position j can win if a_k > W_{j-1}.

If it wins, it proceeds to face cow j+1, and so on.

Again, I need to calculate the number of wins for my cow in this new position.

Additionally, I have the option to not swap at all.

So, I need to consider all these options and choose the one that gives the maximum number of wins for my cow.

This seems quite involved.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula that can help me compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is determined by how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

If I can position my cow such that it faces as many lower-rated cows as possible before facing a higher-rated cow, I can maximize its wins.

By performing one swap, I can try to place my cow in a position where:

1. The maximum rating among the cows before it is as low as possible, so that my cow can start winning from its position.

2. The cows after it have as many lower-rated cows as possible before encountering a higher-rated cow.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the best position for my cow is the one where the maximum rating before it is less than my cow's rating, and the number of consecutive lower-rated cows after it is maximized.

So, for each possible position p where I can place my cow, the number of wins would be:

- If a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a_k, plus one.

- Else, zero.

I need to choose the position p that maximizes this value, and also consider that I can only perform one swap.

But, I need to ensure that the cow I swap with ends up in position p.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of selecting a position p to place my cow, and then swapping my cow with the cow in position p.

Then, the number of wins would be as described above.

So, I need to choose p optimally to maximize the number of wins.

But, I need to make sure that p is such that I can perform the swap with the cow in position p.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through all possible positions p, calculate the number of wins if I place my cow in position p, and choose the maximum among these values.

But, since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about precomputing some values.

First, precompute the prefix maximum for each position p.

Then, for each p, if a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then my cow can start winning from position p.

Then, the number of wins is the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one.

Else, it's zero.

So, for each p, I can calculate this value.

Then, among all possible p (from 1 to n), including p = k (which corresponds to not swapping), I choose the p that gives the maximum number of wins.

But, I need to make sure that I can only perform one swap.

Wait, actually, since I can only perform one swap, I can only swap my cow with one other cow.

So, in the new sequence, only two positions are changed: my original position k and the position p that I swap with.

Therefore, not all positions p are achievable through a single swap.

Wait, actually, I can swap my cow with any one other cow, meaning I can place my cow in any one position by swapping it with the cow in that position.

So, effectively, I can choose to place my cow in any position p by swapping it with the cow in position p.

Therefore, I can consider all positions p from 1 to n, calculate the number of wins if my cow is in position p, and choose the maximum among these values.

This seems feasible.

So, for each test case, I can iterate through all positions p from 1 to n, calculate the number of wins if my cow is in position p, and take the maximum over all p.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5, this should be efficient enough.

Now, let's formalize this.

For each position p from 1 to n:

- If p == k, it corresponds to not swapping.

- Else, swapping my cow with the cow in position p.

Then, in the new sequence:

- The cow in position p is now my cow.

- The cow that was originally in position p is now in position k.

- All other cows remain in their positions.

Then, I need to calculate the number of wins for my cow in position p.

As described earlier:

- Compute prefix_max[p-1].

- If a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then my cow can start winning.

- Then, count the number of consecutive cows after position p with a_i < a_k.

- The total number of wins is the number of such cows plus one (for the first match).

- Else, if a_k <= prefix_max[p-1], my cow doesn't win any matches.

Then, choose the maximum number of wins over all p.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to precompute the prefix_max array for each test case.

Then, for each p from 1 to n, check if a_k > prefix_max[p-1].

If yes, then count the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one.

Else, zero.

Then, take the maximum over all p.

This should work.

But, to optimize it, I need to precompute the prefix_max array and then, for each p, quickly determine the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k.

I can precompute the suffix for each position p, the number of consecutive cows with a_i < a_k.

So, for each p, if a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then the number of wins is precomputed_suffix[p] + 1.

Else, zero.

Then, I can take the maximum over all p.

This way, the precomputations can be done efficiently.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, k, and the array a.

- Compute prefix_max[p] for p from 1 to n.

- Compute for each p, the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k.

- Then, for each p from 1 to n:

- If a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then number of wins is precomputed_suffix[p] + 1.

- Else, zero.

- Take the maximum over all p.

This seems efficient enough, as it's O(n) per test case, and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5.

Now, let's consider an example to verify this approach.

Take the first test case from the sample input:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

Compute prefix_max:

prefix_max[0] = 0 (no elements before position 1)

prefix_max[1] = 12

prefix_max[2] = 12

prefix_max[3] = 12

prefix_max[4] = 12

prefix_max[5] = 12

Compute suffix[p] for each p:

For p from 1 to 6:

p=1: a_k=12

Check cows after p=1: 10,14,11,8,3

Number of consecutive cows with a_i < 12: 10 < 12, 14 > 12 → so only 1 cow.

So, suffix[1] = 1

p=2: a_k=12

Check cows after p=2: 14,11,8,3

Number of consecutive cows with a_i < 12: 14 > 12 → stop → 0

So, suffix[2] = 0

p=3: a_k=12

Check cows after p=3: 11,8,3

Number of consecutive cows with a_i < 12: 11 < 12, 8 < 12, 3 < 12 → 3 cows.

So, suffix[3] = 3

p=4: a_k=12

Check cows after p=4: 8,3

Number of consecutive cows with a_i < 12: 8 < 12, 3 < 12 → 2 cows.

So, suffix[4] = 2

p=5: a_k=12

Check cows after p=5: 3 < 12 → 1 cow.

So, suffix[5] = 1

p=6: a_k=12

No cows after p=6 → 0

So, suffix[6] = 0

Now, for each p from 1 to 6:

p=1:

prefix_max[0] = 0 < a_k=12 → wins = suffix[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

p=2:

prefix_max[1] = 12 >= a_k=12 → wins = 0

p=3:

prefix_max[2] = 12 >= a_k=12 → wins = 0

p=4:

prefix_max[3] = 12 >= a_k=12 → wins = 0

p=5:

prefix_max[4] = 12 >= a_k=12 → wins = 0

p=6:

prefix_max[5] = 12 >= a_k=12 → wins = 0

So, the maximum wins is 2.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, there must be something wrong with my approach.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says that without swapping, the cow in position 1 (my cow) plays against cow 2 (10), wins, then plays against cow 3 (14), loses. So, 1 win.

But according to my approach, p=1 gives wins = 2.

What's wrong here?

Ah, I see.

In my approach, I'm assuming that if a_k > prefix_max[p-1], then my cow can win against all the cows in the suffix until it finds one with a_i >= a_k.

But in reality, in the tournament, my cow has to play against the winner of the previous matches, not directly against all the cows in sequence.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me think again.

In the tournament, the matches are sequential:

- Match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2 → winner W1.

- Match 2: W1 vs cow 3 → winner W2.

- Match 3: W2 vs cow 4 → winner W3.

- And so on.

So, my cow in position p would enter the tournament when it's its turn, facing the winner of the previous matches.

So, for my cow in position p, it would face W_{p-1}, where W_{p-1} is the winner of the first p-1 cows.

If a_k > W_{p-1}, it wins and becomes the new winner, then faces cow p+1, and so on.

The number of wins is the number of consecutive cows after p that it can defeat, starting from cow p+1.

But, in reality, it's not just about the cows after p; it's about the sequence of matches.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me try to simulate the tournament for p=1 in the first test case.

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

If I place my cow in position p=1:

Match 1: cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10) → cow 1 wins.

Match 2: cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14) → cow 3 wins.

Match 3: cow 3 (14) vs cow 4 (11) → cow 3 wins.

Match 4: cow 3 (14) vs cow 5 (8) → cow 3 wins.

Match 5: cow 3 (14) vs cow 6 (3) → cow 3 wins.

So, my cow in position 1 wins only one match.

But according to my earlier approach, I calculated wins=2 for p=1.

So, my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after p with a_i < a_k, until the first a_i >= a_k, plus one, but only if a_k > W_{p-1}.

But in the sample, W_{1-1} = 0 < a_k=12, so wins should be the number of cows after p=1 with a_i < 12 before encountering a_i >=12.

Which are cows 2 (10) <12, cow 3 (14)>=12 → so only one win.

Hence, wins=1.

But in my earlier calculation, I had wins=2 for p=1.

So, I must have miscalculated.

Therefore, I need to adjust my approach.

Let me try to formalize it correctly.

For each position p:

- Compute W_{p-1} = prefix_max[p-1].

- If a_k > W_{p-1}, then my cow can start winning.

- Then, the number of wins is the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one (for the match against W_{p-1}).

- But, in the tournament structure, my cow has to face the next cows one by one, and it stops when it loses.

So, in reality, the number of wins is indeed the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one (for the match against W_{p-1}).

But in the sample, for p=1, W_{0}=0 <12, and cows after p=1: 10<12, 14>12 → so wins=1+1=2.

But in reality, my cow only wins one match because after winning against 10, it faces 14 and loses.

Wait, but according to the tournament structure, the winner of match 1 (cow 1) faces cow 3 (14), which is higher rated, so loses.

So, only one win.

But according to my calculation, wins=2.

There's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the winner of each match proceeds to face the next cow in sequence, not necessarily the next cow in the array.

Wait, no, in the tournament structure, it's match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2 → winner faces cow 3 in match 2, and so on.

So, in this case:

- Match 1: cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10) → cow 1 wins.

- Match 2: cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14) → cow 3 wins.

- Match 3: cow 3 (14) vs cow 4 (11) → cow 3 wins.

- Match 4: cow 3 (14) vs cow 5 (8) → cow 3 wins.

- Match 5: cow 3 (14) vs cow 6 (3) → cow 3 wins.

So, my cow (cow 1) only wins one match.

Hence, the correct number of wins is 1.

But according to my earlier approach, I calculated wins=2 for p=1.

So, my approach is incorrect.

I need to adjust it.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, the number of wins for my cow when placed at position p is:

- If a_k > W_{p-1}, then wins = 1 (for defeating W_{p-1}).

- Then, it faces cow p+1, and if a_k > a_{p+1}, wins +=1.

- And so on, until it faces a cow with a_i >= a_k.

So, it's not just the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one, but considering that it only faces them one by one in sequence.

But in reality, in the tournament structure, the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.

So, if my cow is in position p, it first faces W_{p-1}.

If it wins, it then faces cow p+1.

If it wins again, it faces cow p+2, and so on.

So, the number of wins is indeed the number of cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one (for the match against W_{p-1}), but only as long as a_k > a_{p+1}, a_k > a_{p+2}, etc.

Hence, it's equivalent to the number of consecutive cows after p with a_i < a_k, plus one, provided that a_k > W_{p-1}.

But in the sample, for p=1, W_{0}=0 <12, and cows after p=1: 10<12, 14>12 → so wins=1+1=2.

But in reality, my cow only wins one match because after winning against 10, it faces 14 and loses.

So, perhaps I need to consider that the number of wins is the number of cows after p with a_i < a_k before encountering a cow with a_i >= a_k.

Wait, but in the tournament, my cow faces the cows one by one in sequence.

So, for p=1:

- Win against cow 2 (10).

- Then, win against cow 3 (14)? No, 12 <14, so loses.

Hence, only one win.

Wait, but according to the tournament structure, after winning against cow 2, my cow (cow 1) faces cow 3.

But cow 3 has 14, which is higher than 12, so my cow loses.

Hence, only one win.

But according to my earlier approach, I had wins=2 for p=1.

So, my approach is overcounting.

I need to adjust it.

Perhaps, the correct number of wins is:

- If a_k > W_{p-1}, then wins = 1 (for defeating W_{p-1}).

- Then, for each cow after p, if a_k > a_{p+i}, wins +=1, else, stop.

But in the tournament structure, it's sequential, so it's effectively the same.

But in the sample, for p=1, wins=1, but according to this, it should be 1+1=2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after winning against W_{p-1}, my cow faces cow p+1, then cow p+2, and so on, as long as it wins.

So, for p=1:

- Win against W_{0}=0.

- Then, face cow 2 (10), win.
