Alright, I've got this problem here. It's about a coding tournament with cows, each having a unique rating. The tournament is structured in a specific way, and I need to figure out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve, possibly by swapping positions once.

First, let's understand the tournament structure. There are n cows, each with a distinct rating a_i. Initially, each cow is in position i, where i ranges from 1 to n. The tournament consists of n-1 matches:

1. The first match is between cow in position 1 and cow in position 2.

2. Subsequently, each match i (starting from i=1) is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of the previous match (match i-1).

3. In each match, the cow with the higher rating wins and proceeds to the next match.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for my cow, which is cow k. I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow exactly once or choose not to swap at all.

I need to determine the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with this option.

Let me think about how the tournament progresses.

Starting with position 1 and position 2:

- Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2. The higher-rated cow wins and proceeds.

- Match 2: The winner of match 1 vs Cow 3. Again, the higher-rated cow wins.

- This continues until only one cow remains.

My cow is cow k, initially in position k.

I need to consider two scenarios:

1. Not swapping my cow.

2. Swapping my cow with another position.

For each scenario, I need to calculate the number of wins my cow can achieve.

Let's first consider not swapping.

In this case, my cow is in position k.

I need to see how many matches it can win in the tournament structure described.

Given that the tournament is a single elimination tournament where each match is between the next cow in line and the current winner, my cow can only participate in matches if it is either the next cow in line or the current winner.

So, my cow can only start participating in the tournament from position k.

Let me try to simulate the tournament without swapping.

Initialize the tournament:

- Current winner starts as the winner between cow 1 and cow 2.

- Then, this winner plays against cow 3, and so on, up to cow n.

My cow is in position k.

For my cow to participate in the tournament, it needs to be in the path of the current winner.

Wait, actually, in this structure, only one cow is the current winner, and it keeps winning until it loses.

Wait no, let's read the problem again carefully.

"The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2."

"Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1."

"So, in match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2, the winner is W1."

"Match 2: W1 vs cow 3, winner is W2."

"Match 3: W2 vs cow 4, winner is W3."

And so on, until match n-1: W_{n-2} vs cow n.

So, effectively, it's like a tournament where each match is between the next cow in line and the current champion.

The champion progresses by defeating the next cow in line, until all cows have been matched.

My cow is cow k, in position k.

If I don't swap, then cow k is in position k.

I need to see how many matches cow k can win in this setup.

Given that cow k is in position k, it will only participate in the tournament when it's its turn, i.e., in match k-1.

Wait, let's see:

- Match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2, winner W1.

- Match 2: W1 vs cow 3, winner W2.

- ...

- Match k-1: W_{k-2} vs cow k, winner W_{k-1}.

So, cow k only participates in match k-1.

In that match, cow k faces the current champion W_{k-2}.

If cow k has a higher rating than W_{k-2}, it wins and becomes the new champion, and proceeds to match k, where it faces cow k+1, and so on.

Otherwise, if W_{k-2} has a higher rating, it wins and proceeds, and cow k is eliminated.

So, in the no-swap scenario, the number of wins for cow k is:

- If cow k wins match k-1, it wins 1 match.

- If it loses match k-1, it wins 0 matches.

Wait, but actually, if cow k wins match k-1, it can proceed to future matches, potentially winning more matches.

So, the number of wins is the number of consecutive cows it can defeat starting from match k-1.

Similarly, in the swap scenario, I can choose to swap cow k with any other cow, changing the initial positions.

I need to choose the swap that maximizes the number of wins for cow k.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to think differently.

First, let's consider the no-swap case.

In the no-swap case, cow k is in position k.

The current champion progresses through matches 1 to k-1, and then faces cow k in match k-1.

If cow k wins that match, it becomes the new champion and proceeds to match k, where it faces cow k+1, and so on.

The number of wins cow k can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that come after it in the sequence, starting from position k.

Wait, no.

Actually, it's more about how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat in sequence starting from match k-1.

But I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider the entire sequence of matches.

The tournament can be viewed as a sequence of matches where the current champion faces the next cow in line.

The champion progresses as long as it defeats the next cow.

So, the number of wins for cow k is equal to how many cows it can defeat in a row starting from its position.

But to maximize this, I might want to place my cow in a position where it can defeat as many subsequent cows as possible.

Moreover, by swapping, I can change the initial position of my cow, which might allow it to participate in more matches.

Wait, but I can only swap once.

So, I need to choose whether to swap my cow with another cow to a different position, or keep it in its original position, to maximize the number of wins.

I need to find the optimal position for my cow to be placed, either by swapping or keeping it in place.

Once placed, the tournament proceeds as described, and I need to calculate how many wins my cow can achieve.

I need an efficient way to compute this, considering that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5.

So, per test case, I need an O(n) solution, but since t can be up to 10^4, and sum of n is 10^5, it's manageable.

But I need to optimize it well.

Let me think about the no-swap case first.

In the no-swap case, cow k is in position k.

I need to see how many wins it can achieve.

As described earlier, it participates in match k-1, where it faces the current champion after matches 1 to k-2.

If it wins that match, it becomes the champion and proceeds to match k, facing cow k+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after position k-1 that it can defeat.

Wait, no.

Actually, it's a bit more involved.

Because the current champion up to match k-2 is the winner of matches 1 to k-2.

So, to find out who the current champion is when cow k participates in match k-1, I need to know the winner of the first k-2 matches.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let me consider the entire sequence of matches.

The tournament can be represented as a tournament tree, where each match is an edge, and the winner progresses.

But given the specific structure here, where each match is between the next cow in line and the current champion, it's a bit different from a standard tournament tree.

Perhaps I can think of it as the current champion accumulating wins by defeating each subsequent cow one by one.

My goal is to maximize the number of wins for my cow, either in its original position or in a swapped position.

Let me consider that I can choose to place my cow in any position, by swapping it with another cow.

Once placed, the tournament proceeds as described.

I need to choose the position for my cow that maximizes its number of wins.

So, for each possible position p where I can place my cow, I need to calculate how many wins it can achieve starting from position p.

Then, choose the position p that gives the maximum number of wins.

But since n can be up to 10^5, and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

First, let's consider that all a_i are distinct, which simplifies things.

Given that, I can sort the cows by their ratings.

But I need to consider the positions.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the relative ordering of the cows' ratings.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place my cow.

Then, in the tournament, my cow will participate starting from match p-1, where it faces the current champion up to that point.

If it wins, it becomes the champion and proceeds to the next match, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p-1 that it can defeat in sequence.

But I need to know who the current champion is when my cow is in position p.

Wait, actually, it's more about how many cows with lower ratings are after position p, because my cow can defeat cows with lower ratings.

But it's not just the number of cows with lower ratings after p, because the champion up to p-1 might have a higher rating than my cow.

So, I need to consider the maximum number of consecutive cows with lower ratings starting from position p that my cow can defeat.

But I also need to consider that if the champion up to p-1 has a higher rating than my cow, then my cow cannot win any matches starting from p.

Wait, no.

Actually, in match p-1, my cow in position p faces the champion up to p-1.

If my cow has a higher rating, it wins and becomes the champion, then proceeds to match p, facing cow p+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows starting from p that my cow can defeat, which are the cows with lower ratings than my cow.

So, it's the length of the longest suffix starting at p where the cows have lower ratings than my cow.

Wait, but not exactly, because the champion up to p-1 might have a higher rating than my cow.

So, actually:

- If the champion up to p-1 has a higher rating than my cow, then my cow loses immediately and wins 0 matches.

- If the champion up to p-1 has a lower rating than my cow, then my cow wins match p-1 and proceeds to defeat all subsequent cows with lower ratings.

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose p such that:

- The champion up to p-1 has a lower rating than my cow.

- And then, among the cows from p onwards, as many as possible have lower ratings than my cow.

Wait, but I don't have information about the champion up to p-1.

How can I determine for each possible p whether the champion up to p-1 has a lower rating than my cow?

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that the champion up to p-1 is the cow with the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

Because in each match, the winner is the cow with the higher rating.

So, in matches 1 to p-2, the champion is the cow with the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

Wait, no.

Actually, in match 1: cow 1 vs cow 2, winner is the one with higher rating.

In match 2: winner of match 1 vs cow 3.

In match 3: winner of match 2 vs cow 4.

And so on.

So, the champion up to p-1 is the winner of the first p-2 matches.

Given that, the champion up to p-1 is the cow with the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

Because each match is between the current champion and the next cow, and the higher-rated cow wins.

So, the champion progresses by always being the highest-rated cow seen so far.

Therefore, the champion up to p-1 is the cow with the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows.

So, for my cow to win match p-1 when placed in position p, its rating must be higher than the maximum rating among the first p-1 cows.

If it is, then it wins match p-1 and becomes the champion, then proceeds to defeat all subsequent cows with lower ratings.

Otherwise, it loses immediately.

So, for each possible p, the number of wins is:

- 0, if a_k <= max(a_1 to a_{p-1})

- 1 + number of cows after p with ratings lower than a_k, if a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1})

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to choose p such that:

- p is minimized where a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}), and then the number of wins is 1 + number of cows after p with ratings lower than a_k.

Because minimizing p maximizes the number of cows after p that my cow can potentially defeat.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of wins.

So, I need to choose p such that:

- a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1})

- And the number of cows after p with ratings lower than a_k is maximized.

Given that, to maximize the number of wins, I should choose the smallest p such that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

Because the smaller p is, the more cows there are after p, potentially increasing the number of wins.

But I need to ensure that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

So, I need to find the smallest p such that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

Then, the number of wins is 1 (for winning match p-1) plus the number of cows after p with ratings lower than a_k.

Wait, but I need to make sure that my cow can defeat those cows in sequence.

Actually, once my cow becomes the champion, it will face each subsequent cow one by one, defeating all with lower ratings until it encounters one with a higher rating.

So, yes, the number of wins is indeed 1 (for winning match p-1) plus the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k.

Wait, no, it's not necessarily consecutive.

It's the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k, because my cow can defeat any of them with lower ratings.

But in practice, it's the number of cows with lower ratings than a_k among cows p+1 to n.

But wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure, my cow faces the cows one by one in order.

So, it's the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k, because it can defeat each one in sequence.

So, the total wins would be the number of cows from p to n with lower ratings than a_k.

Wait, but including the win in match p-1, which is defeating the champion up to p-1.

So, total wins would be 1 (for match p-1) plus the number of cows after p that have lower ratings than a_k.

Wait, but only if a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

Otherwise, it's 0.

So, for each p from 1 to n, if a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}), then wins = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

Else, wins = 0.

I need to choose p that maximizes wins.

Additionally, I have the option to not swap, in which case p = k.

So, I need to consider p = k as one of the options.

But since I can choose any p, including p = k, I don't need to treat the no-swap case separately.

Wait, but in the problem, not swapping means p = k.

But in the swap option, I can choose p != k.

So, I need to consider all p from 1 to n, and choose the one that maximizes wins, including p = k.

Wait, but in the swap option, I can only swap my cow with one other cow, meaning that only one pair of cows is swapped.

But in this approach, it seems like I'm choosing to place my cow in any position p, which would require swapping it with the cow that's originally in position p.

Wait, but in the problem, I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow once, or choose not to swap.

So, in terms of choosing p, it's equivalent to choosing to place my cow in position p, and placing the cow originally in position p where my cow was.

But in terms of calculating the number of wins, it's about choosing p and considering the tournament progression accordingly.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Given that, perhaps I can precompute for each p, the number of wins if my cow is placed in position p.

Then, take the maximum over all p.

But with n up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to find a smarter way.

First, let's fix p and see what the number of wins would be.

As established:

- If a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}), then wins = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

- Else, wins = 0.

So, to maximize wins, I need to choose p such that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}), and p is as small as possible to maximize the count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

Wait, but p needs to satisfy a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

So, I need to find the smallest p such that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

Then, for that p, the number of wins is 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

Then, I need to consider all such p and choose the one that gives the maximum wins.

But actually, there might be multiple p satisfying a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

I need to choose the smallest such p to maximize the number of cows after p with ratings < a_k.

Wait, but p can be from 1 to n.

Let's consider p=1.

Then, max(a_1 to a_{p-1}) = max([]) = -infinity (since there are no cows before p=1).

So, a_k > -infinity, which is always true.

Thus, for p=1, wins = 1 + count of cows from 2 to n with ratings < a_k.

Similarly, for p=2, max(a_1) < a_k, then wins = 1 + count of cows from 3 to n with ratings < a_k.

And so on.

So, effectively, for each p from 1 to n, if a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}), then wins = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

Else, wins = 0.

I need to choose p that maximizes wins.

To compute this efficiently, I can precompute:

- The maximum rating from a_1 to a_{p-1} for each p.

- The count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k for each p.

Then, for each p, if a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}), then wins = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

Else, wins = 0.

Then, take the maximum wins over all p.

But since n can be up to 1e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to compute these values efficiently.

First, precompute max(a_1 to a_{p-1}) for each p.

This can be done in O(n) time per test case.

Second, precompute the count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k for each p.

This can also be done in O(n) time per test case.

Then, for each p, compute wins accordingly.

Finally, take the maximum wins over all p.

This seems feasible, given the constraints.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe I can find the smallest p such that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

Then, for that p, the number of wins is 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

And for p larger than this, it's also possible, but the count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k would be smaller.

So, choosing the smallest such p maximizes the number of wins.

But I need to make sure that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

So, find the smallest p such that a_k > max(a_1 to a_{p-1}).

Then, wins = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

This seems efficient.

But I need to handle the case where a_k is smaller than all a_1 to a_{p-1} for all p, meaning that my cow cannot win any matches.

In that case, the maximum wins would be 0.

Also, I need to consider the no-swap option, but in this approach, p can be k, which corresponds to not swapping.

Wait, no, in this approach, choosing p = k corresponds to not swapping.

But in reality, choosing p = k is just one option among many.

But in terms of swapping, I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow, which effectively allows me to place my cow in any position p, provided that I also place the cow originally in p to my original position.

But in terms of calculating wins, it's equivalent to choosing any p.

Wait, but in the problem, swapping means choosing two positions and swapping the cows in them.

But in this approach, choosing p means placing my cow in position p, which would require swapping it with the cow originally in p.

So, it's equivalent.

Hence, I can proceed with this approach.

Let me try to formalize it.

For each p from 1 to n:

- Let max_p = max(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{p-1})

- If a_k > max_p:

- Then, wins_p = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k

- Else:

- wins_p = 0

Then, the maximum wins is the maximum over wins_p for p from 1 to n.

I need to compute this efficiently.

First, compute max_p for each p:

- max_p[1] = -infinity

- max_p[2] = a_1

- max_p[3] = max(a_1, a_2)

- ...

- max_p[p] = max(a_1, a_2, ..., a_{p-1})

This can be computed in O(n) time.

Next, compute count_p for each p:

- count_p[p] = number of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k

This can be computed by first counting the number of cows with ratings < a_k, and then using a prefix sum or something similar.

Wait, actually, I can sort the a_i and use binary search to find the count of cows with ratings < a_k.

But since all a_i are distinct, I can sort the a_i and find the index of a_k to get the number of cows with ratings < a_k.

But for count_p[p], I need the number of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

So, I can sort the a_i and get their sorted order.

Then, for each p, count_p[p] = number of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k.

This can be precomputed by computing a suffix sum.

Let me think differently.

Since all a_i are distinct, I can sort the a_i in ascending order and get their ranks.

Let's assign each cow a rank based on their rating, where rank 1 is the lowest rating and rank n is the highest rating.

Then, for a given p, count_p[p] is the number of cows from p+1 to n with ratings < a_k, which is equal to the number of cows from p+1 to n with ranks < rank_k.

Since the ranks are from 1 to n, with 1 being the lowest, count_p[p] is the number of cows from p+1 to n with ranks < rank_k.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Maybe I can sort the a_i and find the position of a_k.

Let me try another approach.

Let me sort the a_i in descending order and keep their positions.

Then, I can find the position where a_k would fit in this sorted order
