Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and an even number k. The task is to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have to select some elements from both arrays, specifically k/2 from each, and make sure that the combined selection includes every number from 1 to k at least once.

Let me think about the constraints:

- n and m can be up to 2*10^5, which is pretty large, so any solution needs to be efficient.

- k is even and between 2 and 2*min(n,m), inclusive.

- The total sum of n and m over all test cases doesn't exceed 4*10^5, which suggests that the solution should be linear or near-linear in time complexity.

Given that k can be up to 2*min(n,m), and considering the size of n and m, I need to find an efficient way to check for the possibility of such a selection without actually performing the selection.

Let's consider what's necessary for the selection to include all numbers from 1 to k.

Each number from 1 to k must appear in the chosen elements from either array a or array b.

Since we have to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array, we need to ensure that the union of these choices covers all numbers from 1 to k.

I need to find a way to check if it's possible to pick k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b such that their union contains all numbers from 1 to k.

One approach is to count how many unique numbers from 1 to k are present in each array and ensure that together they cover all numbers from 1 to k, with enough elements to choose from.

But I need to be careful because some numbers might appear in both arrays, and I have to make sure that the choices don't overlap in a way that prevents covering all numbers.

Wait, actually, the problem allows choosing any k/2 elements from each array, as long as their union contains all numbers from 1 to k.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the coverage provided by each array.

Let me consider the numbers from 1 to k and see how they are distributed between array a and array b.

For each number from 1 to k, it can be in:

- Only array a

- Only array b

- Both arrays

To cover all numbers from 1 to k, each number must be chosen from at least one of the arrays.

Given that we have to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array, I need to make sure that the choices cover all required numbers.

This sounds a bit like a set cover problem, but with constraints on the number of elements chosen from each set.

However, set cover is NP-hard, and given the time constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me try to rephrase the problem.

We need to choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b, and their union should include all numbers from 1 to k.

This means that for each number from 1 to k, it should be chosen from at least one of the arrays.

But since we're choosing only k/2 elements from each, and k is even, I need to ensure that the selected elements from both arrays together include all numbers from 1 to k.

Wait a minute, k is even, and we're choosing k/2 from each. So, total chosen elements are k.

But some of these might be duplicates if the same number appears in both arrays.

However, since we're interested in the union, duplicates don't matter as long as all numbers from 1 to k are present.

But the problem is about choosing exactly k/2 elements from each array, not about the unique numbers.

Wait, no, it's about the union of the chosen elements including all numbers from 1 to k.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of frequency of each number from 1 to k in both arrays.

Let me consider the frequency of each number from 1 to k in array a and array b.

For each number i from 1 to k, let freq_a[i] be the number of times i appears in a, and freq_b[i] be the number of times it appears in b.

Now, for each number i from 1 to k, it must be chosen from at least one of the arrays.

But since we're choosing exactly k/2 elements from each array, I need to ensure that the choices cover all numbers.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider the minimal requirements.

Each number from 1 to k must be present in the union of the chosen elements from a and b.

That is, for each number i from 1 to k, it must be chosen from a or from b, but not necessarily from both.

But we have to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array.

So, it's a constrained selection.

I need to find a way to select k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b such that their union includes all numbers from 1 to k.

This sounds like a matching problem, where I need to match the selections from a and b to cover all required numbers.

But maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the total number of unique numbers from 1 to k in both arrays.

Wait, but I need to ensure that all numbers from 1 to k are present in the union of the selected elements.

So, if a number appears in both arrays, I can choose it from either array.

If a number appears only in one array, I must choose it from that array.

Wait, that might be a key point.

Let's categorize the numbers from 1 to k based on their presence in a and b.

- Numbers that are only in a.

- Numbers that are only in b.

- Numbers that are in both a and b.

For numbers that are only in a, I must choose them from a.

Similarly, for numbers that are only in b, I must choose them from b.

For numbers that are in both, I can choose them from either array.

Now, let's think about the minimal number of elements I need to choose from a and b to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

But in this problem, I have to choose exactly k/2 from a and k/2 from b.

So, it's not just about minimal coverage; it's about choosing exactly k/2 from each.

This adds an extra constraint.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s define:

- Let s_a be the set of numbers from 1 to k that are only in a.

- Let s_b be the set of numbers from 1 to k that are only in b.

- Let s_ab be the set of numbers from 1 to k that are in both a and b.

Then, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, I need to choose all numbers in s_a from a, all numbers in s_b from b, and enough numbers from s_ab to make up the required k/2 choices from each array.

Wait, but I have to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array.

So, the total number of choices is k/2 from a and k/2 from b, totaling k.

But some of these choices might be the same number if they are in both arrays.

However, since we're dealing with the union, duplicates don't help in covering more numbers.

So, I need to ensure that the choices cover all numbers from 1 to k.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let c_a be the number of unique numbers from 1 to k in a.

- Let c_b be the number of unique numbers from 1 to k in b.

- Let c_ab be the number of unique numbers from 1 to k in both a and b.

Then, the total unique numbers from 1 to k in a or b is c_a + c_b - c_ab.

But we need this to be at least k, otherwise, it's impossible to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

Wait, no. Since we have to choose from a and b such that their union includes all numbers from 1 to k, the union of a and b must include all numbers from 1 to k.

So, if the union of a and b doesn't include all numbers from 1 to k, it's impossible.

Therefore, a necessary condition is that the union of a and b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

So, first, I need to check if a.union(b) contains all numbers from 1 to k.

If not, immediately answer "NO".

Assuming that a.union(b) contains all numbers from 1 to k, now I need to check if I can choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b such that their union includes all numbers from 1 to k.

Given that, I need to ensure that the choices cover all numbers from 1 to k.

Let’s consider the minimal number of elements needed from a and b to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

But again, I have to choose exactly k/2 from each.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of elements needed from each array to cover the required numbers.

Let me define:

- Let required_a be the number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are only in a.

- Let required_b be the number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are only in b.

- Let shared be the number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are in both a and b.

Then, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, I need to choose all required_a numbers from a and all required_b numbers from b.

Additionally, for the shared numbers, I can choose them from either array.

Now, the number of choices from a must be exactly k/2, which includes required_a numbers and some from shared.

Similarly, the number of choices from b must be exactly k/2, which includes required_b numbers and some from shared.

So, the number of choices from a that are from shared is k/2 - required_a.

Similarly, the number of choices from b that are from shared is k/2 - required_b.

But these must be non-negative, meaning that k/2 >= required_a and k/2 >= required_b.

Also, the sum of the choices from shared in a and b must be less than or equal to the total number of shared numbers.

Wait, no.

Actually, the choices from shared in a and b are independent, but we cannot choose more shared numbers than available.

But it's a bit confusing.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let’s denote:

- required_a = number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are only in a.

- required_b = number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are only in b.

- shared = number of unique numbers from 1 to k that are in both a and b.

Then, to choose k/2 elements from a, I need to choose required_a numbers from a that are only in a, and the remaining k/2 - required_a from the shared numbers.

Similarly, to choose k/2 elements from b, I need to choose required_b numbers from b that are only in b, and the remaining k/2 - required_b from the shared numbers.

Now, the total number of shared numbers that need to be chosen is (k/2 - required_a) + (k/2 - required_b) = k - required_a - required_b.

But since shared numbers are the same numbers in both arrays, the total number of shared numbers must be at least k - required_a - required_b.

Also, required_a + required_b + shared >= k, because the union must contain all numbers from 1 to k.

Wait, actually, required_a + required_b + shared = k, because these are the counts of unique numbers in a only, b only, and both.

So, required_a + required_b + shared = k.

Therefore, k - required_a - required_b = shared.

So, the total number of shared numbers needed is shared = k - required_a - required_b.

But from above, we have that the total number of shared numbers is shared, and we need to choose k/2 - required_a from shared for a, and k/2 - required_b from shared for b.

But since shared = k - required_a - required_b, and k is even, we need to ensure that k/2 - required_a <= shared and k/2 - required_b <= shared.

Wait, but shared = k - required_a - required_b, so k/2 - required_a <= shared becomes k/2 - required_a <= k - required_a - required_b.

Simplifying, k/2 - required_a <= k - required_a - required_b => -k/2 <= -required_b => required_b <= k/2.

Similarly, k/2 - required_b <= shared becomes required_a <= k/2.

So, the conditions reduce to required_a <= k/2 and required_b <= k/2.

If these two conditions hold, then it's possible to choose the required elements.

Wait, is that it?

Let me verify.

Given that required_a + required_b + shared = k, and shared = k - required_a - required_b.

We need to choose k/2 elements from a, which includes required_a elements that are only in a, and the remaining k/2 - required_a from shared.

Similarly, choose k/2 elements from b, which includes required_b elements that are only in b, and the remaining k/2 - required_b from shared.

For this to be possible, we need:

- k/2 - required_a >= 0 => required_a <= k/2

- k/2 - required_b >= 0 => required_b <= k/2

- And, the total shared elements chosen shouldn't exceed the available shared elements.

But since shared = k - required_a - required_b, and we're choosing k/2 - required_a from shared for a, and k/2 - required_b from shared for b, the total chosen from shared is (k/2 - required_a) + (k/2 - required_b) = k - required_a - required_b = shared.

So, as long as required_a <= k/2 and required_b <= k/2, it's possible.

Wait, but in the second test case of the example, it's "NO", but let's see if this condition holds.

In the second test case:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3], k=6.

First, find unique numbers from 1 to k in a and b.

a: {2,3,4,5,6}

b: {1,3}

Union: {1,2,3,4,5,6} which is equal to k=6.

required_a = numbers only in a: {2,4,5,6} => required_a=4

required_b = numbers only in b: {1} => required_b=1

shared = numbers in both: {3} => shared=1

Now, check required_a <= k/2 and required_b <= k/2.

k/2 = 3.

4 <= 3? No.

1 <= 3? Yes.

Since required_a = 4 > 3, it's not possible, hence "NO".

This matches the example.

Another test case:

3 3 4

a: [1,3,5]

b: [2,4,6]

required_a = {1,3,5} intersect with 1 to 4: {1,3} => required_a=2

required_b = {2,4,6} intersect with 1 to 4: {2,4} => required_b=2

shared = {} => shared=0

k=4, k/2=2.

Check required_a <=2 and required_b <=2. Yes.

So, "YES".

Another test case:

2 5 4

a: [1,4]

b: [7,3,4,4,2]

required_a = {1} (since 4 is in both)

required_b = {2,3} (assuming 4 is in both)

shared = {4}

k=4, k/2=2.

Check required_a=1 <=2 and required_b=2 <=2. Yes.

So, "YES".

Another test case:

1 4 2 4 3

This seems incomplete based on the input format.

Assuming it's:

1 4

2 4 3

But it's unclear; perhaps it's a different test case.

Anyway, based on the pattern, it seems that the condition required_a <= k/2 and required_b <= k/2 is sufficient to determine "YES" or "NO".

So, in the program, we need to:

1. For each test case, read n, m, k.

2. Read array a and array b.

3. Find the unique numbers from 1 to k in a and b.

4. Compute required_a = unique numbers in a only.

required_b = unique numbers in b only.

5. Check if required_a <= k/2 and required_b <= k/2.

If yes, "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, but we also need to ensure that the union of a and b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

So, the full steps are:

1. Read n, m, k.

2. Read a and b.

3. Find unique numbers from 1 to k in a and b.

4. Check if union of these unique numbers contains all numbers from 1 to k.

- If not, "NO".

5. Else, compute required_a and required_b.

6. Check if required_a <= k/2 and required_b <= k/2.

- If yes, "YES"; else, "NO".

But in the program provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let's look at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

(len_a, len_b) = (len(a), len(b))

(count_a, count_b) = (0, 0)

d = k // 2

for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):

if len_a > i + 1:

if a[i] <= k:

count_a += 1

if len_b > i + 1:

if b[i] <= k:

count_b += 1

print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')

So, it's counting the number of elements in a and b that are less than or equal to k, up to the maximum length of a and b.

Wait, that seems different from what I thought.

It's counting, for each array, how many elements are <= k, considering up to the longer array's length.

But in our earlier reasoning, we were concerned with unique numbers from 1 to k in each array.

This seems to be counting the total number of elements <= k in each array, not the unique ones.

This might not be correct.

For example, in the first test case:

a: [2,3,8,5,6,5], b: [1,3,4,10,5], k=6.

count_a: elements <=6: 2,3,5,6,5 => count_a=5

count_b: elements <=6: 1,3,4,5 => count_b=4

d = k//2 = 3

So, count_a >=3 and count_b >=3 => "YES"

Which matches the first test case.

In the second test case:

a: [2,3,4,5,6,5], b: [1,3,8,10,3], k=6.

count_a: 2,3,4,5,6,5 => count_a=5

count_b: 1,3 => count_b=2

d=3

count_b < d => "NO"

Which matches the second test case.

In the third test case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a: [1,3,5], b: [2,4,6]

count_a: 1,3 <=4 => count_a=2

count_b: 2,4 <=4 => count_b=2

d=2

So, "YES"

Fourth test case:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a: [1,4], b: [7,3,4,4,2]

count_a: 1,4 <=4 => count_a=2

count_b: 3,4,2 <=4 => count_b=3

d=2

So, "YES"

Fifth test case:

n=1, m=4, k=2

a: [4], b: [2,4,3]

count_a: 4 <=2? No, count_a=0

count_b: 2,4 <=2 => count_b=2

d=1

count_a < d => "NO"

Sixth test case:

n=2, m=2, k=1

a: [1,4], b: [3]

count_a: 1 <=1 => count_a=1

count_b: 3 >1 => count_b=0

d=0.5, but k must be even, so k=1 is invalid.

Wait, k=1 is invalid because k is even and >=2.

So, perhaps this test case is invalid.

But assuming k=2, as above.

So, in all valid test cases, the program seems to produce the correct output.

But is this logic generally correct?

Wait, in our earlier reasoning, we concluded that we need to consider unique numbers from 1 to k in each array, not just the count of elements <=k.

But in the examples, it seems to work.

Let me think of a case where this logic fails.

Suppose n=2, m=2, k=2

a: [1,1], b: [2,2]

According to the program:

count_a: 1,1 <=2 => count_a=2

count_b: 2,2 <=2 => count_b=2

d=1

So, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1 => "YES"

But in reality, we need to choose 1 element from a and 1 from b, and their union must include 1 and 2.

If we choose 1 from a and 2 from b, it's fine.

But if we choose 1 from a and 2 from b, it's fine.

So, "YES" is correct.

Another case:

n=3, m=3, k=4

a: [1,1,1], b: [2,2,2]

count_a: 1,1,1 <=4 => count_a=3

count_b: 2,2,2 <=4 => count_b=3

d=2

So, "YES"

But we need to choose 2 from a and 2 from b, and their union should include 1,2,3,4.

But in this case, the union is only {1,2}, which doesn't include 3 and 4.

So, it should be "NO", but the program says "YES".

This is a contradiction.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't ensure that the union of the chosen elements includes all numbers from 1 to k; it only checks that there are enough elements <=k in each array, which is not sufficient.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
