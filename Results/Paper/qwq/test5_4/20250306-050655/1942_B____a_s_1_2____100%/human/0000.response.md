Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Farmer John has a permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and he gives Bessie an array a, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i. My task is to reconstruct the permutation p from the array a.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX stands for "minimum excluded," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array. For example, MEX of [1,2,3] is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. MEX of [3,1,0] is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not.

So, for each position i in the permutation p, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. I need to find p given a.

The problem says that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't have to worry about invalid inputs.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since p is a permutation, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once in p. That's important to keep in mind.

Maybe I can try to build p step by step, from left to right, using the values in a.

Wait, but the MEX is calculated for the prefix up to i, so maybe it's easier to process the array from right to left, since the MEX of a prefix depends on all elements up to that point.

Let me consider the last element, p_n. The MEX of p_1 to p_n minus p_n is a_n. Since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the MEX of the entire permutation should be n, because all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

Wait, no. The MEX of p_1 to p_n would be the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_n. But p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, so all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present, and the MEX would be n.

So, a_n = MEX(p_1 to p_n) - p_n = n - p_n.

From this, I can express p_n in terms of a_n: p_n = n - a_n.

Similarly, for p_{n-1}, a_{n-1} = MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) - p_{n-1}.

But the MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Wait, but p_n is already determined, and p is a permutation, so the MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} would be the only number not in p_1 to p_{n-1} among 0 to n-1.

Wait, no. Actually, since p is a permutation, all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present in p, but in some order. So, the MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} would be the smallest number from 0 to n-1 that's not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p_1 to p_{n-1} contains n-1 distinct numbers from 0 to n-1, missing exactly one number.

Therefore, the MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} is the number that's missing from p_1 to p_{n-1}.

So, a_{n-1} = MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) - p_{n-1}.

But I know p_n, and p is a permutation, so I can figure out which number is missing from p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from the end to the start, building p step by step.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote mex_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i).

Then, a_i = mex_i - p_i, so p_i = mex_i - a_i.

I need to find p_i for each i.

But mex_i depends on p_1 to p_i, which are all previous elements.

So, maybe I can find a way to compute mex_i for each i.

Wait, but computing MEX for each prefix would be O(n^2) in general, which is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of which numbers have appeared so far and find the smallest missing one for each prefix.

But again, that seems inefficient for large n.

Let me think differently.

Given that p is a permutation, and mex_i is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i, and a_i = mex_i - p_i.

I need to find p_i for each i.

Maybe I can consider the positions where certain numbers appear.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the mex values.

Let me consider the entire permutation.

At position n, mex_n should be n, since all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present in p_1 to p_n.

So, a_n = n - p_n, so p_n = n - a_n.

Similarly, at position n-1, mex_{n-1} is the number missing from p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Since p_n is already determined, and p is a permutation, mex_{n-1} is the number not in p_1 to p_{n-1}, which is the number not in p_1 to p_n except p_n.

Wait, p is a permutation, so p_1 to p_n contains all numbers from 0 to n-1 exactly once.

Therefore, p_1 to p_{n-1} contains all numbers from 0 to n-1 except p_n.

So, mex_{n-1} is p_n.

Because p_n is the number missing from p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Therefore, a_{n-1} = mex_{n-1} - p_{n-1} = p_n - p_{n-1}.

So, p_{n-1} = p_n - a_{n-1}.

Wait, that's interesting.

Similarly, for p_{n-2}, mex_{n-2} is the number missing from p_1 to p_{n-2}.

Given that p_1 to p_{n-1} contains all numbers except p_n, and p_1 to p_{n-2} contains all numbers except p_{n-1} and p_n.

Wait, no.

Wait, p_1 to p_{n-1} contains all numbers except p_n.

So, p_1 to p_{n-2} contains all numbers except p_{n-1} and p_n, unless p_{n-1} is equal to some earlier element, but p is a permutation, so all elements are distinct.

Wait, no, p is a permutation, so p_1 to p_{n-1} contains all numbers from 0 to n-1 except p_n.

Therefore, p_1 to p_{n-2} contains all numbers from 0 to n-1 except p_{n-1} and p_n.

So, mex_{n-2} is the smaller of p_{n-1} and p_n.

Because the missing numbers in p_1 to p_{n-2} are p_{n-1} and p_n, and MEX is the smallest of them.

So, mex_{n-2} = min(p_{n-1}, p_n).

Therefore, a_{n-2} = min(p_{n-1}, p_n) - p_{n-2}.

So, p_{n-2} = min(p_{n-1}, p_n) - a_{n-2}.

This seems like a pattern.

Let me generalize this.

It seems that mex_i is equal to the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i, which, in permutation terms, is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i.

Given that p is a permutation, up to position i, p_1 to p_i contains i distinct numbers from 0 to n-1, so mex_i is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i.

As I go from i = n down to i = 1, I can compute p_i based on mex_i and a_i.

From the above, for i = n, p_n = n - a_n.

Then, for i = n-1, mex_{n-1} = p_n, and a_{n-1} = p_n - p_{n-1}, so p_{n-1} = p_n - a_{n-1}.

Similarly, for i = n-2, mex_{n-2} = min(p_{n-1}, p_n), and a_{n-2} = min(p_{n-1}, p_n) - p_{n-2}, so p_{n-2} = min(p_{n-1}, p_n) - a_{n-2}.

Continuing this way, for each i from n-3 down to 1, mex_i = min of all p_j for j from i+1 to n, and a_i = mex_i - p_i, so p_i = mex_i - a_i.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the current mex as I iterate from n down to 1.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize mex as n.

Then, for i from n down to 1:

p_i = mex - a_i

Then, update mex to be the minimum of current mex and p_i.

Because, for position i-1, the mex would be the smallest number not in p_1 to p_{i-1}, which is the smallest of the remaining numbers, i.e., the smallest of the p_j for j from i to n.

So, mex_{i-1} = min(mex_i, p_i)

Because p_i could be smaller than the current mex.

Wait, yes, that makes sense.

So, starting from i = n:

p_n = mex - a_n, where mex = n

Then, mex = min(mex, p_n)

Then, for i = n-1:

p_{n-1} = mex - a_{n-1}

Then, mex = min(mex, p_{n-1})

And so on, down to i = 1.

This seems like a efficient way to compute p.

Let me test this logic with the first example.

Example 1:

n = 5

a = [1,1,-2,1,2]

According to the formula:

Initialize mex = 5

i = 5:

p_5 = 5 - 2 = 3

mex = min(5,3) = 3

i = 4:

p_4 = 3 - 1 = 2

mex = min(3,2) = 2

i = 3:

p_3 = 2 - (-2) = 4

mex = min(2,4) = 2

i = 2:

p_2 = 2 - 1 = 1

mex = min(2,1) = 1

i = 1:

p_1 = 1 - 1 = 0

mex = min(1,0) = 0

So, p = [0,1,4,2,3]

Which matches the first example.

Let's check the second example:

n = 5

a = [1,1,1,1,1]

Initialize mex = 5

i=5:

p_5 =5-1=4

mex=min(5,4)=4

i=4:

p_4=4-1=3

mex=min(4,3)=3

i=3:

p_3=3-1=2

mex=min(3,2)=2

i=2:

p_2=2-1=1

mex=min(2,1)=1

i=1:

p_1=1-1=0

mex=min(1,0)=0

So, p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Which matches the second example.

Third example:

n=3

a=[-2,1,2]

Initialize mex=3

i=3:

p_3=3-2=1

mex=min(3,1)=1

i=2:

p_2=1-1=0

mex=min(1,0)=0

i=1:

p_1=0 - (-2) = 2

mex=min(0,2)=0

So, p=[2,0,1]

Which matches the third example.

Great, so this logic seems to work.

Now, let's see how to implement this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 2e5, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution, O(n) per test case.

The approach above is O(n) per test case, which should be acceptable.

So, in code, I'll read t, then for each test case:

- Read n

- Read array a of length n

- Initialize p as an array of size n with -1

- Set mex to n

- Iterate from i = n-1 down to 0:

- p[i] = mex - a[i]

- mex = min(mex, p[i])

- Print p

This should work.

Let me think about possible edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1

If n=1, a=[1]

Then, p_1 = 1 - a_1 = 1 -1 =0

Which is correct, since p=[0]

Edge case 2: n=2

a=[1,1]

p_2=2-1=1

mex=min(2,1)=1

p_1=1-1=0

p=[0,1]

Another n=2

a=[2,1]

p_2=2-1=1

mex=min(2,1)=1

p_1=1 -2=-1

Wait, but p_i should be between 0 and n-1, which is 0 and 1.

But p_1=-1 is invalid.

But the problem states that the input is given in such a way that at least one valid p exists, so this case shouldn't occur.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that at least one valid p exists, so I don't need to handle invalid cases.

Another consideration: since p is a permutation, all p_i should be unique and in range 0 to n-1.

But according to the above logic, p_i = mex - a_i, and mex is updated to min(mex, p_i) at each step.

I need to ensure that p_i are unique and within 0 to n-1.

Given that it's guaranteed that at least one valid p exists, I don't need to handle cases where it's impossible.

So, I can proceed with this approach.

I should implement this in code.

In summary, the approach is correct.

**Final Solution**

     - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

3. **Output:**
   - It prints the reconstructed permutation `p` for each test case.

This approach ensures that the permutation is reconstructed correctly by leveraging the properties of the MEX function and iterating backwards for efficient computation. The time complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

**Final Solution Code**

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)

```

**Correctness**

The code correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the array `a`, which is derived from MEX operations on prefixes of `p`.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct a permutation of integers based on a given array derived from the MEX (Minimum EXCLUDED) operation on prefixes of the permutation.

## Approach

1. **Understanding MEX**: MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in that array.
2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
    - Start from the end of the array and calculate the permutation values using the MEX properties.
    - Use an iterative approach to build the permutation array by maintaining the current MEX value.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)

func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read the integer `n` (length of the permutation and the array `a`).
    - Read the array `a` which contains values derived from MEX operations.

2. **Permutation Reconstruction**:
    - Initialize an array `p` of size `n` with placeholders (`-1`).
    - Set `mex` to `n`, as the initial MEX for the full permutation.
    - Iterate from the end of the array to the start:
        - Calculate `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
        - Update `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

3. **Output**:
    - Print the reconstructed permutation `p` for each test case.

This method ensures that the permutation is reconstructed correctly by leveraging the properties of the MEX function and iterating backwards for efficient computation. The approach is optimal with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, making it suitable for the given constraints.
