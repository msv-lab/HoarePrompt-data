Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome. The goal is to distribute my bets in such a way that no matter which outcome wins, the total coins I get back are more than the total coins I bet.

First, I need to understand the constraints. For each test case, I'm given n (number of outcomes) and a list of k_i values. I need to output the bets x_i for each outcome such that the sum of all x_i is less than k_i * x_i for every i. That means, for every outcome, the reward should be greater than the total bet.

Let me rephrase that condition. For each i, sum of all x_j for j from 1 to n should be less than k_i * x_i.

Mathematically, for each i:

sum_{j=1 to n} x_j < k_i * x_i

I can rearrange this inequality:

sum_{j=1 to n} x_j - k_i * x_i < 0

Or,

sum_{j â‰  i} x_j + (1 - k_i) * x_i < 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

I recall something about solving systems of inequalities. But with n up to 50 and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution.

Looking at the example, in the first test case:

n = 3

k = [3, 2, 7]

And the solution is x = [27, 41, 12]

Let's check if this satisfies the condition:

Total bet: 27 + 41 + 12 = 80

If outcome 1 wins: 3 * 27 = 81 > 80

Outcome 2: 2 * 41 = 82 > 80

Outcome 3: 7 * 12 = 84 > 80

Perfect, it works.

Another test case:

n = 2

k = [3, 3]

x = [1, 1]

Total bet: 1 + 1 = 2

Outcome 1: 3 * 1 = 3 > 2

Outcome 2: 3 * 1 = 3 > 2

Good.

Now, a test case where it's impossible:

n = 5

k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]

Output: -1

So, in this case, it's impossible to find such bets.

I need to find a general way to determine if such bets exist and what they are.

Let me think about the condition again.

For all i, sum_{j=1 to n} x_j < k_i * x_i

Let me denote s = sum_{j=1 to n} x_j

So, s < k_i * x_i for all i

I can write this as s < k_i * x_i for all i

I need to find x_i such that this holds.

Let me try to express s in terms of x_i.

From s < k_i * x_i, I can write x_i > s / k_i

But s = sum_{j=1 to n} x_j

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can use the concept of proportions.

Suppose I set x_i = c / k_i for some constant c.

But x_i need to be integers, so that might not work directly.

Wait, in the program provided, it seems to be using some approach involving the product of k_i.

Let me look at the code.

The code reads t, the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calls func_1.

In func_1:

- Read n

- Read list of k_i

- Compute prod = product of all k_i

- Compute vprod = [prod // k_i for each i]

- Compute den = prod - sum(vprod)

- If den <= 0, output -1

- Else, output vprod

Wait, that's interesting.

So, it's computing the product of all k_i, then for each x_i, setting x_i = prod // k_i

Then, it computes den = prod - sum(vprod)

If den > 0, it outputs vprod, else -1.

Let me check with the first example:

n = 3

k = [3,2,7]

prod = 3*2*7 = 42

vprod = [42//3, 42//2, 42//7] = [14, 21, 6]

sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41

den = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0

So, it outputs [14,21,6]

But in the example, it's outputting [27,41,12]. So, different numbers, but both are valid.

Wait, is there multiple solutions?

Yes, the problem says "if there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them"

So, the program is finding one possible solution, which is [14,21,6], and it's valid:

sum = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41

3*14 = 42 > 41

2*21 = 42 > 41

7*6 = 42 > 41

So, it's correct.

But in the example, it's showing [27,41,12], which also works:

27 + 41 + 12 = 80

3*27 = 81 > 80

2*41 = 82 > 80

7*12 = 84 > 80

So, multiple solutions exist.

Now, in the second test case:

n = 2

k = [3,3]

prod = 9

vprod = [9//3, 9//3] = [3,3]

sum(vprod) = 6

den = 9 - 6 = 3 > 0

So, outputs [3,3]

But in the example, it's outputting [1,1]

So, again, multiple solutions.

Now, in the third test case:

n = 5

k = [5,5,5,5,5]

prod = 5^5 = 3125

vprod = [3125//5, 3125//5, 3125//5, 3125//5, 3125//5] = [625,625,625,625,625]

sum(vprod) = 3125

den = 3125 - 3125 = 0 <=0

So, outputs -1

Which matches the example.

Another test case in the example has n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13], and it outputs [1989,1547,4641,819,1547,1071]

Let me check if this works.

sum = 1989 + 1547 + 4641 + 819 + 1547 + 1071 = 11614

Check each k_i * x_i:

7*1989=13923 >11614

9*1547=13923 >11614

3*4641=13923 >11614

17*819=13923 >11614

9*1547=13923 >11614

13*1071=13923 >11614

So, it works.

But according to the program, it should be using prod // k_i.

prod = 7*9*3*17*9*13 = let's calculate that.

7*9=63

63*3=189

189*17=3213

3213*9=28917

28917*13=375921

vprod = [375921//7, 375921//9, 375921//3, 375921//17, 375921//9, 375921//13]

Which is [53703, 41769, 125307, 22113, 41769, 28917]

sum(vprod) = 53703 + 41769 + 125307 + 22113 + 41769 + 28917 = 313578

den = 375921 - 313578 = 62343 >0

So, it would output [53703,41769,125307,22113,41769,28917]

But in the example, it's outputting [1989,1547,4641,819,1547,1071]

Which is a different solution, but both are valid.

So, the program's approach seems to work, but it's not the only solution.

Now, I need to verify if this approach is correct in general.

So, the program computes prod = product of all k_i

Then, x_i = prod // k_i for each i

Then, den = prod - sum(x_i)

If den > 0, output x_i, else -1

I need to see if this satisfies the condition sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i for all i

Let's see:

sum(x_j) = sum(prod // k_j for all j)

k_i * x_i = k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod if k_i divides prod.

Wait, in Python, '//' is integer division.

So, prod // k_i is floor division.

If k_i divides prod, then prod // k_i = prod / k_i

Otherwise, it's floor division.

But in this problem, since k_i can be any integer >=2, and prod is product of k_i's, it's possible that k_i divides prod, but in cases where there are duplicates, maybe not.

Wait, in the third test case, k_i are all 5, prod=5^5=3125, vprod=[625,625,625,625,625]

sum(vprod)=3125, den=0, so -1, which is correct.

In other cases where den >0, it's possible to find such x_i.

But is this the minimal sum? Not necessarily, as seen in the examples.

But the problem allows any solution where sum(x_j) < min(k_i * x_i for all i)

So, is this approach correct?

Let me verify.

Given x_i = prod // k_i

Then, k_i * x_i = k_i * (prod // k_i)

If k_i divides prod, this is prod.

Otherwise, it's k_i * floor(prod / k_i)

But in the program, it's checking den = prod - sum(x_i)

If den >0, then sum(x_i) = prod - den

So, sum(x_i) = prod - den

We need sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i for all i

Given that x_i = prod // k_i

So, sum(x_i) < k_i * (prod // k_i)

But k_i * (prod // k_i) is either prod (if k_i divides prod) or less than prod.

Wait, in the first test case, prod=42, x_i=[14,21,6]

sum=41

k_i * x_i = [42,42,42]

So, 41 <42 for all i

In the second test case, prod=9, x_i=[3,3]

sum=6

k_i * x_i = [9,9]

6 <9 for both

In the fourth test case, prod=375921, x_i=[53703,41769,125307,22113,41769,28917]

sum=313578

k_i * x_i for each i:

7*53703=375921

9*41769=375921

3*125307=375921

17*22113=375921

9*41769=375921

13*28917=375921

So, sum=313578 <375921 for all i

Hence, it satisfies the condition.

Now, in the third test case, prod=3125, x_i=[625,625,625,625,625]

sum=3125

k_i * x_i =5*625=3125

So, 3125 <3125 is false, hence -1

Which is correct.

So, the program's approach seems to work.

But is this the only possible solution? No, as seen in the first test case, [27,41,12] is another valid solution with smaller sum.

But the problem allows any solution, so it's acceptable.

Now, I need to check if this approach is always correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=1, k=[2]

Then, prod=2

x_i=2//2=1

sum=1

den=2-1=1>0

Check: sum=1 <2*1=2, which is true.

Another example: n=1, k=[100]

prod=100

x_i=100//100=1

sum=1

den=100-1=99>0

Check: 1 <100*1=100, true.

Now, n=2, k=[2,2]

prod=4

x_i=[4//2,4//2]=[2,2]

sum=4

den=4-4=0<=0, so -1

Wait, but according to the condition:

sum=4

k_i * x_i=2*2=4

4 <4 is false, so correctly -1

Another test case: n=2, k=[2,3]

prod=6

x_i=[6//2,6//3]=[3,2]

sum=5

den=6-5=1>0

Check:

k_1 * x_1=2*3=6 >5

k_2 * x_2=3*2=6 >5

Good.

Another test case: n=3, k=[2,3,4]

prod=24

x_i=[24//2,24//3,24//4]=[12,8,6]

sum=26

den=24-26=-2<=0, so -1

Wait, but let's check the condition:

sum=12+8+6=26

k_1 * x_1=2*12=24 <26? No, 24 <26 is true.

k_2 * x_2=3*8=24 <26? 24 <26 is true.

k_3 * x_3=4*6=24 <26? 24 <26 is true.

So, according to the program, it should output [12,8,6], but den=24-26=-2<=0, so it outputs -1, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the condition, sum=26 < min(k_i * x_i)=24, but actually, 26 is not less than 24, it's greater.

Wait, no, the condition is sum < k_i * x_i for all i.

In this case, sum=26 <24 for all i, but 26 is not less than 24, so it should be -1, which matches the program's output.

Wait, but according to the condition, sum < k_i * x_i for all i.

But in this case, sum=26 is not less than 24 for any i, so it's invalid.

Hence, -1 is correct.

Wait, no, for each i, sum < k_i * x_i.

So, for i=1: 26 < 24? No.

i=2: 26 <24? No.

i=3: 26 <24? No.

Hence, it's invalid, so -1 is correct.

Wait, but according to the program, den=prod - sum(x_i)=24-26=-2<=0, so -1, which is correct.

So, seems correct.

Another test case: n=1, k=[2]

prod=2

x_i=[2//2]=[1]

sum=1

den=2-1=1>0

Check: 1 <2*1=2, which is true.

Good.

Now, let's think about the general case.

Suppose we have n outcomes with multipliers k_i.

We set x_i = prod // k_i

sum(x_i) = sum(prod // k_i for all i)

den = prod - sum(x_i)

If den >0, then sum(x_i) = prod - den

We need sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i for all i.

Given that x_i = prod // k_i

So, k_i * x_i = k_i * (prod // k_i)

If k_i divides prod, then k_i * (prod // k_i) = prod

Otherwise, k_i * (prod // k_i) < prod

But sum(x_i) = prod - den

If den >0, then sum(x_i) < prod

So, for each i, sum(x_i) < prod <= k_i * x_i

Wait, no, k_i * x_i = k_i * (prod // k_i)

Which is less than or equal to prod.

Wait, no, k_i * (prod // k_i) could be less than prod.

Wait, in the earlier test case, n=3, k=[2,3,4], prod=24

x_i=[12,8,6]

sum=26

k_i * x_i=[24,24,24]

sum=26 is not less than 24, so it's invalid, and den=24-26=-2<=0, so -1.

Wait, but according to the previous step, sum(x_i)=prod - den

If den >0, then sum(x_i) < prod

But we need sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i for all i.

Given that k_i * x_i = k_i * (prod // k_i)

Which is less than or equal to prod.

Hence, if sum(x_i) < prod <= k_i * x_i, then sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, sum=26 > prod=24, but den=24-26=-2<=0, so -1.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, in that test case, sum=26, prod=24, den=-2.

But according to the condition, sum < k_i * x_i for all i.

But sum=26 > prod=24, which is not less than k_i * x_i=24.

Hence, it's invalid, and the program correctly outputs -1.

So, the condition is:

If den >0, then sum(x_i) = prod - den < prod <= k_i * x_i for all i.

Hence, sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i for all i.

If den <=0, then sum(x_i) >= prod.

But we need sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i for all i.

Given that k_i * x_i = k_i * (prod // k_i), which is <= prod.

Hence, if sum(x_i) >= prod, then sum(x_i) >= prod >= k_i * x_i, which violates the condition sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i.

Hence, in such cases, it's impossible, and the program outputs -1.

Therefore, the program's approach is correct.

Moreover, the problem mentions that if a solution exists, there is always a solution with x_i <=10^9.

Given that prod can be up to 20^50 (since k_i <=20 and n<=50), but in practice, for n=50, prod would be 20^50, which is way larger than necessary, but since we're using integer division, and den=prod - sum(x_i), it should work as long as den >0.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}\]
