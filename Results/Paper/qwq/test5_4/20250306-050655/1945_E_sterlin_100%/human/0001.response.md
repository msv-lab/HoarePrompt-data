Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps on the permutation before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that after performing the binary search, the value at position l is equal to x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. For example, [2, 3, 1, 5, 4] is a permutation of size 5.

Now, binary search typically requires a sorted array. However, in this problem, we're supposed to apply binary search on an unsorted permutation, but with the ability to perform up to two swaps to make the binary search yield the correct result.

Let me try to understand the binary search algorithm as described in the problem:

1. Initialize l = 1 and r = n + 1.

2. While r - l != 1:

a. Calculate m = floor((r + l) / 2).

b. If p_m <= x, set l = m; else set r = m.

After the loop, p_l should be equal to x.

Wait a minute, this binary search seems a bit unusual. Typically, binary search on a sorted array would have l = 0 and r = n, and the loop condition is l < r or something similar. Here, l starts at 1 and r at n+1, which is a bit non-standard. Also, the array isn't sorted, which makes things tricky.

I need to think about how this binary search works on a permutation that isn't sorted. The key is that I can perform up to two swaps to make sure that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

The problem also states that it can be shown that two operations are always sufficient. So, I don't need to worry about cases where more than two swaps are needed; two swaps will always suffice.

Let me consider some examples to understand this better.

Example 1:

n = 6, x = 3

p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

This is already sorted. Let's see what the binary search does.

Initialize l = 1, r = 7

While 7 - 1 != 1:

m = floor((7 + 1)/2) = 4

p_4 = 4 <= 3? No, so r = 4

Now, l = 1, r = 4

m = floor((4 + 1)/2) = 2

p_2 = 2 <= 3? Yes, so l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = floor((4 + 2)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = floor((4 + 3)/2) = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, so l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, so loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 3, which is equal to x. So, no swaps needed. That makes sense.

Example 2:

n = 6, x = 5

p = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]

Let's perform the binary search.

l = 1, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 1)/2) = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 4)/2) = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 5)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = floor((7 + 6)/2) = 6

p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_6 = 4, which is not equal to x=5.

So, we need to perform swaps to make p_l = 5.

Looking at the permutation: [3,1,6,5,2,4]

Index 1: 3

Index 2: 1

Index 3: 6

Index 4: 5

Index 5: 2

Index 6: 4

We need p_6 = 5. Currently, p_4 = 5. So, swap indices 4 and 6.

After swap: [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Now, perform binary search again.

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4

p_4 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

Now, l = 4, r = 7

m = 5

p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

Now, l = 5, r = 7

m = 6

p_6 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, l = 6, r = 7

m = 6

p_6 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_6 = 5, which is equal to x=5.

So, one swap was enough.

Example 3:

n = 5, x = 1

p = [3,5,4,2,1]

Perform binary search.

l = 1, r = 6

m = 3

p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 3

Now, l = 1, r = 3

m = 2

p_2 = 5 <= 1? No, r = 2

Now, l = 1, r = 2

m = 1

p_1 = 3 <= 1? No, r = 1

Now, r - l = 0, which is not greater than 1, so loop ends.

p_l = p_1 = 3 != 1.

Need to make p_1 = 1.

Current permutation: [3,5,4,2,1]

Swap index 1 and 5: [1,5,4,2,3]

Now, perform binary search.

l = 1, r = 6

m = 3

p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 3

Now, l = 1, r = 3

m = 2

p_2 = 5 <= 1? No, r = 2

Now, l = 1, r = 2

m = 1

p_1 = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 1

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_1 = 1, which is equal to x=1.

So, one swap was enough.

Example 4:

n = 6, x = 3

p = [4,3,1,5,2,6]

Perform binary search.

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 3? No, r = 4

Now, l = 1, r = 4

m = 2

p_2 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 1 != 3.

Need to make p_3 = 3.

Current permutation: [4,3,1,5,2,6]

Index 1: 4

Index 2: 3

Index 3: 1

Index 4: 5

Index 5: 2

Index 6: 6

Swap index 2 and 3: [4,1,3,5,2,6]

Now, perform binary search.

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4

p_4 = 5 <= 3? No, r = 4

Now, l = 1, r = 4

m = 2

p_2 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 3, which is equal to x=3.

So, one swap was enough.

Example 5:

n = 3, x = 2

p = [3,2,1]

Perform binary search.

l = 1, r = 4

m = 2

p_2 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 1 != 2.

Need to make p_3 = 2.

Current permutation: [3,2,1]

Swap index 2 and 3: [3,1,2]

Now, perform binary search.

l = 1, r = 4

m = 2

p_2 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, l = 2, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, l = 3, r = 4

m = 3

p_3 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 2, which is equal to x=2.

So, one swap was enough.

From these examples, it seems that one swap is often enough to make the binary search yield the correct result. But the problem allows up to two swaps, and it's guaranteed that two swaps are always sufficient.

Now, I need to find a general approach to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me try to analyze the binary search process.

Given that the binary search is applied to an unsorted array, the behavior is unpredictable. However, the binary search is deterministic, meaning that for a given array, it will always terminate with the same l.

The key is to make sure that after at most two swaps, the array is arranged such that the binary search ends with p_l = x.

Since the array is a permutation, every number from 1 to n appears exactly once, which might be useful.

I need to find a way to adjust the array so that the binary search, with its specific behavior, lands on x.

Let me think about what the binary search is doing.

It starts with l = 1 and r = n + 1.

It repeatedly calculates m = floor((l + r)/2) and updates l or r based on whether p_m <= x.

The loop continues until r - l = 1.

Then, it checks p_l.

Given that, I need to ensure that after swaps, p_l = x.

But since the binary search is deterministic, I need to predict where l will end up based on the initial array, and then adjust the array so that p_l = x.

Wait, but I can perform swaps before running the binary search.

So, perhaps I can simulate the binary search to see where l ends up, and then see what needs to be done to make p_l = x.

If p_l already equals x, then no swaps are needed.

If p_l doesn't equal x, I need to make it equal to x with at most two swaps.

But I need to be careful because swapping might affect other parts of the array, potentially changing where the binary search ends up.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the positions involved:

- The final position l after the binary search.

- The position of x in the array.

- Possibly other positions if one swap isn't enough.

I need to find a way to make p_l = x.

One approach could be:

1. Perform the binary search as is to find the final l.

2. If p_l == x, do nothing.

3. Else, swap p_l with the position where x is to make p_l = x.

But wait, swapping p_l with x's position might affect the binary search process if x was involved in the earlier steps of the binary search.

In other words, swapping might change the path the binary search takes, so the final l might change if I swap.

This could be a problem.

Let me think of another way.

Perhaps I can think about where the binary search ends up and ensure that x is placed there.

To do that, I need to identify the final l without performing any swaps and then see what's at p_l.

If p_l != x, I need to swap p_l with x's current position.

But as I thought earlier, this might alter the binary search path.

Wait, maybe I need to perform the binary search step by step, keeping track of how swaps could affect it.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that since the array is a permutation, and I can perform up to two swaps, I can potentially adjust the positions of at most two elements.

I need to ensure that after these swaps, the binary search ends with p_l = x.

I need a systematic way to determine which swaps to perform.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Perform the binary search as is, without any swaps, to see where l ends up.

- If p_l == x, then no swaps are needed.

- If p_l != x, then:

- Option 1: Swap p_l with x's current position. Then, p_l = x, and the binary search path might be altered.

- Option 2: Find another position to swap to adjust the path.

This seems messy.

Maybe I need to consider that with two swaps, I can adjust two elements to their correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of where x should be to satisfy the binary search conditions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the binary search's decision process.

At each step, it chooses m based on l and r, looks at p_m, and decides whether to set l = m or r = m.

The loop continues until r - l = 1.

Then, it checks p_l.

I need to ensure that p_l = x after at most two swaps.

Let me consider that the binary search divides the array into segments and narrows down the possible position for x.

But since the array isn't sorted, the binary search might not behave as expected.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the binary search as partitioning the array into regions based on the comparisons.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me try a different approach.

Since the array is a permutation, every element is unique.

I can track the positions of elements and see how they influence the binary search.

Let me consider that the binary search is deterministic, so for a given array, l will always end up at the same position.

I need to make p_l = x.

If p_l != x, I need to make p_l = x, which requires swapping p_l with x's current position.

But as I thought before, this might alter the binary search path.

Wait, perhaps I need to perform the binary search, see where l ends up, and if p_l != x, swap p_l with x's position, and then perform the binary search again to see if p_l == x.

But I can only perform swaps before the binary search, not after.

So, that's not feasible.

I need a way to predict the effect of swaps on the binary search's final l.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can adjust the positions of two elements to their desired positions.

So, perhaps I can identify which elements are causing the binary search to land on the wrong l, and adjust them.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote the final l after the binary search as l_final.

If p_l_final == x, then no swaps are needed.

If p_l_final != x, then I need to make p_l_final = x.

To do that, I can swap p_l_final with x's current position.

But as I thought earlier, this might alter the binary search's path.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the swap doesn't affect the binary search's decisions.

How can I do that?

Let me consider that the binary search only looks at specific elements, namely those at positions m during each step.

If I can ensure that the elements at these positions are correct, then the binary search will proceed as desired.

But I don't know in advance which positions m will be chosen at each step.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the binary search to see which elements are examined and how they influence the final l.

But since the binary search is deterministic, for a given array, the path is fixed.

So, perhaps I can record the entire path of the binary search, see which elements are compared, and adjust those elements accordingly.

This sounds promising.

Let me try to outline this approach:

1. Simulate the binary search to find l_final.

2. If p_l_final == x, do nothing.

3. Else, identify the path taken by the binary search:

a. Record all m's chosen during the binary search.

b. See which elements were compared.

4. Determine which elements need to be adjusted to make sure that the binary search ends with p_l_final = x.

5. Perform up to two swaps to adjust these elements.

This seems more systematic.

Let me try to apply this to one of the examples.

Take Example 2:

n = 6, x = 5

p = [3,1,6,5,2,4]

Binary search steps:

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4, p_4 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 7

m = 5, p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

l = 5, r = 7

m = 6, p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

l = 6, r = 7

m = 6, p_6 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_6 = 4 != 5.

So, l_final = 6.

Now, I need to make p_6 = 5.

Current p: [3,1,6,5,2,4]

x = 5 is at position 4.

So, swap p_4 and p_6: [3,1,6,4,2,5]

Now, p_6 = 5, which is what we need.

Now, perform the binary search again:

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4, p_4 = 4 <= 5? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 7

m = 5, p_5 = 2 <= 5? Yes, l = 5

l = 5, r = 7

m = 6, p_6 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

l = 6, r = 7

m = 6, p_6 = 5 <= 5? Yes, l = 6

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_6 = 5 == x=5.

So, one swap was enough.

This seems straightforward in this case.

But let's consider another example where one swap might not be sufficient.

Suppose n = 4, x = 3

p = [4,1,2,3]

Perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_4 = 3 == x=3.

No swaps needed.

Another example:

n = 4, x = 2

p = [4,1,3,2]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 2? No, r = 3

l = 1, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

l = 2, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_2 = 1 != 2.

Need to make p_2 = 2.

Current p: [4,1,3,2]

Swap p_2 and p_4: [4,2,3,1]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 2? No, r = 3

l = 1, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

l = 2, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_2 = 2 == x=2.

Again, one swap was enough.

Wait, perhaps in all cases one swap is enough, but the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient, implying that sometimes one swap might not be enough, but two are always enough.

I need to find a case where one swap isn't enough, and two are required.

Let's try n = 4, x = 2

p = [3,4,1,2]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 4

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_4 = 2 == x=2.

No swaps needed.

Another case: n = 4, x = 1

p = [2,3,4,1]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 3

l = 1, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 3 <= 1? No, r = 2

l = 1, r = 2

m = 1, p_1 = 2 <= 1? No, r = 1

Now, r - l = 0, which is not greater than 1, so loop ends.

p_l = p_1 = 2 != 1.

Need to make p_1 = 1.

Current p: [2,3,4,1]

Swap p_1 and p_4: [1,3,4,2]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 1? No, r = 3

l = 1, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 3 <= 1? No, r = 2

l = 1, r = 2

m = 1, p_1 = 1 <= 1? Yes, l = 1

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_1 = 1 == x=1.

Again, one swap was enough.

Hmm.

Let me try a more tricky example.

n = 5, x = 3

p = [5,1,2,4,3]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

m = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 6

m = 4, p_4 = 4 <= 3? No, r = 4

l = 3, r = 4

m = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 2 != 3.

Need to make p_3 = 3.

Current p: [5,1,2,4,3]

Swap p_3 and p_5: [5,1,3,4,2]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

m = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 6

m = 4, p_4 = 4 <= 3? No, r = 4

l = 3, r = 4

m = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 3 == x=3.

Again, one swap was enough.

Wait, maybe in all cases one swap is sufficient.

But the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient, which suggests that one swap might not be enough in some cases.

I need to find such a case.

Let's try n = 4, x = 3

p = [4,1,2,3]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 3? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 4

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_4 = 3 == x=3.

No swaps needed.

Another case: n = 4, x = 2

p = [3,4,1,2]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 5

m = 3, p_3 = 1 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 4

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_4 = 2 == x=2.

No swaps needed.

Wait, maybe in all cases one swap is enough, or even no swaps are needed if the binary search happens to land on x.

But the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient, so perhaps there are cases where one swap isn't enough.

Let me try n = 5, x = 2

p = [3,4,1,5,2]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

Need to make p_3 = 2.

Current p: [3,4,1,5,2]

Swap p_3 and p_5: [3,4,2,5,1]

Now, perform binary search:

m = 3, p_3 = 2 <= 2? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 2 == x=2.

Again, one swap was enough.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to look for a more complex case.

Let's try n = 6, x = 4

p = [5,2,3,6,1,4]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4, p_4 = 6 <= 4? No, r = 4

l = 1, r = 4

m = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

m = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 4? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 4

m = 3, p_3 = 3 <= 4? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 3 != 4.

Need to make p_3 = 4.

Current p: [5,2,3,6,1,4]

Swap p_3 and p_6: [5,2,4,6,1,3]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

l = 1, r = 4

m = 2, p_2 = 2 <= 4? Yes, l = 2

m = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 3

l = 3, r = 4

m = 3, p_3 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 3

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_3 = 4 == x=4.

Again, one swap was enough.

Wait, maybe in all cases one swap is sufficient, and the problem allows up to two swaps just to be safe.

But perhaps there are cases where one swap isn't enough, and two are needed.

Let me try to find such a case.

Suppose n = 5, x = 3

p = [4,1,5,2,3]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

l = 2, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 1 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_2 = 1 != 3.

Need to make p_2 = 3.

Current p: [4,1,5,2,3]

Swap p_2 and p_5: [4,3,5,2,1]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 6

m = 3, p_3 = 5 <= 3? No, r = 3

l = 1, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

l = 2, r = 3

m = 2, p_2 = 3 <= 3? Yes, l = 2

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_2 = 3 == x=3.

Again, one swap was enough.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to look for a case where swapping p_l with x's position affects the binary search path in such a way that p_l no longer points to x.

But in all the examples I've tried, one swap was sufficient.

Perhaps I need to consider a case where x is involved in the binary search path before reaching l_final.

Wait, maybe if x is examined during the binary search before reaching l_final, swapping x to l_final could affect the path.

Let me try to find such a case.

Suppose n = 6, x = 4

p = [5,2,3,1,6,4]

Binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4, p_4 = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 7

m = 5, p_5 = 6 <= 4? No, r = 5

l = 4, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 1 <= 4? Yes, l = 4

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_4 = 1 != 4.

Need to make p_4 = 4.

Current p: [5,2,3,1,6,4]

Swap p_4 and p_6: [5,2,3,4,6,1]

Now, perform binary search:

l = 1, r = 7

m = 4, p_4 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 4

l = 4, r = 7

m = 5, p_5 = 6 <= 4? No, r = 5

l = 4, r = 5

m = 4, p_4 = 4 <= 4? Yes, l = 4

Now, r - l = 1, loop ends.

p_l = p_4 = 4 == x=4.

Again, one swap was enough.

Wait, maybe in all cases one swap suffices, and the problem allows up to two swaps as a safety net.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider that with permutations and up to two swaps, it's always possible to adjust the array so that p_l = x.

Given that, maybe the general approach is:

- Perform the binary search to find l_final.

- If p_l_final == x, do nothing.

- Else, swap p_l_final with x's current position.

- Check if p_l_final == x after the swap.

- If yes, output one swap.

- If not, perform a second swap to fix any discrepancies.

But I need a more concrete plan for the second swap.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x at l_final and adjust any other elements that might have been affected by the first swap.

But this still seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a pattern or a specific strategy to determine which elements to swap.

Let me consider that the binary search divides the array into halves at each step, and the choice of m affects where l ends up.

But since the array isn't sorted, these divisions might not make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the binary search is effectively partitioning the array based on the comparisons, and I need to ensure that x is in the correct partition at each step.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I identify the final l after the binary search.

Then, I need to make sure that p_l = x.

To do that, I can swap p_l with x's current position.

But as I thought earlier, this might affect the binary search's path.

An alternative approach is to find a way to make the binary search reach a position where x is currently located.

But that seems unclear.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the binary search reaches l_final based on the current array, and if p_l_final != x, I need to adjust the array so that the binary search reaches the current position of x.

To do that, I need to ensure that the comparisons during the binary search guide l to the position where x is currently located.

This seems complicated because the binary search path depends on the array's values.

Maybe I need to consider that with two swaps, I can adjust the comparison points to steer l to x's current position.

But this is still too vague.

Let me try to think about the binary search's behavior.

At each step, it calculates m = floor((l + r)/2), looks at p_m, and decides whether to set l = m or r = m based on p_m <= x.

The loop continues until r - l = 1.

Then, it checks p_l.

So, the final l depends on the sequence of m's chosen and the comparisons made.

Given that, it's challenging to predict where l will end up without simulating the binary search.

Perhaps I need to simulate the binary search to find l_final, and then see what needs to be done to make p_l_final = x.

If p_l_final != x, I can swap p_l_final with x's current position.

But as I thought earlier, this might alter the binary search's path.

Wait, maybe I can perform the binary search, find l_final, and if p_l_final != x, swap p_l_final with x's position, and then check if p_l_final == x.

If yes, then one swap suffices.

If not, perform a second swap to fix any discrepancies.

But I need to ensure that the second swap corrects any issues caused by the first swap.

This still seems unclear.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can adjust two elements, which should be enough to make p_l = x, considering that the array is a permutation and every element is unique.

Given that, perhaps there's a general method to determine which elements to swap.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider all possible pairs of swaps and see which ones lead to p_l = x.

But that's computationally expensive and not feasible for n up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that the binary search's final l is determined by the sequence of comparisons, which in turn depend on the values at the m positions chosen during the search.

If I can ensure that these values are such that the comparisons lead l to the position where x is located, then p_l would be x.

But adjusting these m positions might require multiple swaps, and I'm limited to two swaps.

This seems too vague to implement.

Let me consider a different angle.

Suppose I fix the position of x and see where the binary search would place l if I adjust the array accordingly.

But this seems too circular.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the binary search's final l is a function of the array's values, and I need to adjust the array so that this function returns the position where x is located.

Again, this is too abstract.

I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that with two swaps, I can place x at l_final and adjust one other element to ensure that the binary search still reaches l_final.

But I'm not sure how to implement this.

Let me try to look for a pattern in the examples where one swap isn't enough.

Wait, in all the examples I've tried, one swap was sufficient.

Perhaps the problem's statement that two swaps are always sufficient is just to ensure that there's a way to solve the problem, and in practice, one swap often suffices.

If that's the case, then maybe the general approach is:

- Perform the binary search to find l_final.

- If p_l_final == x, do nothing.

- Else, swap p_l_final with x's current position.

- After the swap, perform the binary search again to see if p_l_final == x.

- If yes, output one swap.

- If not, perform a second swap to fix any discrepancies.

But I need to determine what the second swap should be.

This is still unclear.

Let me consider that the second swap is to adjust another element that was affected by the first swap.

But without knowing the specific array and the binary search's path, it's hard to generalize.

Perhaps I need to accept that in most cases, one swap is enough, and in the rare cases where it's not, a second swap
