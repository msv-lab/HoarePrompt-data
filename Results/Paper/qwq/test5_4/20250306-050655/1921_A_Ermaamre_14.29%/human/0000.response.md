Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given four points that are the corners of a square on a coordinate plane. The square has sides parallel to the axes, and I need to find its area. There are multiple test cases, and I have to do this for each one.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates of the corners should reflect that.

Given four points, I need to figure out which ones are opposite to each other to calculate the side length and then the area. But the points are given in random order, so I can't assume any specific ordering.

Let me think about the properties of such a square. Since the sides are parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates of the vertical sides will be the same, and the y-coordinates of the horizontal sides will be the same.

So, for example, if I have two points with the same x-coordinate, they must be on the same vertical side. Similarly, two points with the same y-coordinate are on the same horizontal side.

Given that, I can group the points based on their x and y coordinates to identify the sides.

Wait, but since it's a square, opposite sides will have the same coordinates. For example, two points sharing the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates would be on the same vertical side.

But in a square, there are two pairs of vertical sides and two pairs of horizontal sides.

Actually, in a square with sides parallel to the axes, there are two pairs of x-coordinates (for the vertical sides) and two pairs of y-coordinates (for the horizontal sides).

So, among the four points, there should be two distinct x-values and two distinct y-values, each appearing twice, corresponding to the two points on each vertical and horizontal side.

Wait, no. In a square, there are two unique x-values and two unique y-values, each pair corresponding to the two vertical sides and the two horizontal sides, respectively.

But in the points given, since they are the corners, each unique x-value should appear exactly twice (for the left and right sides), and each unique y-value should appear exactly twice (for the top and bottom sides).

Wait, no. Actually, in a square, there are two vertical lines with different x-coordinates, each having two points (top and bottom). Similarly, there are two horizontal lines with different y-coordinates, each having two points (left and right).

So, in the list of four points, there should be two pairs of points sharing the same x-coordinate (the vertical sides), and two pairs sharing the same y-coordinate (the horizontal sides).

But in terms of individual coordinates, there should be two distinct x-values, each appearing twice, and two distinct y-values, each appearing twice.

Wait, but in the example input:

First test case:

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

Here, x-coordinates are 1, 4, 1, 4 and y-coordinates are 2,5,5,2. So, x-values: 1 and 4, each appearing twice. y-values: 2 and 5, each appearing twice.

Second test case:

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

x-values: -1, 1, 1, -1 (each appearing twice), y-values: 1, -1, 1, -1 (each appearing twice).

Third test case:

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

x-values: 45,45,17,17 (two 45's and two 17's), y-values: 11,39,11,39 (two 11's and two 39's).

So, yes, in each test case, there are two unique x-values and two unique y-values, each appearing twice.

So, to generalize, in any input, I can expect four points with exactly two distinct x-values and two distinct y-values, each appearing exactly twice.

Given that, I can group the points by their x-coordinates to find the vertical sides, and by their y-coordinates to find the horizontal sides.

But to find the area, I need to find the length of one side of the square and then square it.

Since the sides are parallel to the axes, the length of a side can be found by either:

- The difference in y-coordinates of two points sharing the same x-coordinate (vertical side), or

- The difference in x-coordinates of two points sharing the same y-coordinate (horizontal side).

But in the problem, it's given that the square has positive area, so the side lengths are greater than zero.

In the provided program, it seems like it's trying to find the side length by looking at differences in y-coordinates when x-coordinates match.

Let me look at the code:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())

(x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())

(x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())

(x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())

if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:

if y1 < y3:

res = abs(y3 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y3)

elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:

if y1 < y2:

res = abs(y2 - y1)

else:

res = abs(y1 - y2)

print(res ** 2)

So, it's reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, reading four lines of input, each containing two integers (x and y coordinates of a point).

Then, it's checking conditions based on the x-coordinates to determine which points are on the same vertical sides, and then calculating the difference in their y-coordinates to find the side length.

Wait, but in the first if condition:

if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:

It assumes that x1 and x3 are on the same vertical side, and x2 and x4 are on another vertical side.

Then, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates between x1 and x3 to find the side length.

Similarly, in the next elif:

elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:

It assumes x1 and x2 are on the same vertical side, and x3 and x4 are on another vertical side.

And in the last elif:

elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:

It assumes x1 and x4 are on the same vertical side, and x3 and x2 are on another vertical side.

Then, it calculates the difference in y-coordinates for the points on the same vertical side to find the side length, and squares it to get the area.

But is this the most reliable way to determine the side length?

I'm a bit concerned because the points are given in random order, and this code is making assumptions about which points correspond to which sides based on their x-coordinates.

Let me consider the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Here, x1=1, y1=2

x2=4, y2=5

x3=1, y3=5

x4=4, y4=2

So, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 4), which matches the first if condition.

Then, it checks if y1 < y3, which is 2 < 5, so res = abs(5 - 2) = 3

Then, prints 3^2 = 9, which matches the first output in the example.

Second test case:

(-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Suppose x1=-1, y1=1

x2=1, y2=-1

x3=1, y3=1

x4=-1, y4=-1

Now, x1 == x4 (-1 == -1), and x2 == x3 (1 == 1), which would match the second elif condition.

Then, it calculates res as abs(y2 - y1) = abs(-1 - 1) = 2, and prints 2^2 = 4, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

(45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

x1=45, y1=11

x2=45, y2=39

x3=17, y3=11

x4=17, y4=39

Here, x1 == x2 (45 == 45), and x3 == x4 (17 == 17), which again matches the second elif condition.

Then, res = abs(y2 - y1) = abs(39 - 11) = 28, and prints 28^2 = 784, matching the third output.

So, in these cases, it works.

But is this approach robust for all possible orderings of the points?

Let me try to think of another ordering.

Suppose the points are: (1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

Here, x1=1, y1=2

x2=1, y2=5

x3=4, y3=2

x4=4, y4=5

So, x1 == x2 (both 1), and x3 == x4 (both 4), which matches the second elif condition.

Then, res = abs(y2 - y1) = abs(5 - 2) = 3, and prints 9.

Another ordering: (1,2), (4,2), (1,5), (4,5)

x1=1, y1=2

x2=4, y2=2

x3=1, y3=5

x4=4, y4=5

Here, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 4), which matches the first if condition.

Then, res = abs(y3 - y1) = abs(5 - 2) = 3, and prints 9.

Another ordering: (1,5), (4,2), (1,2), (4,5)

x1=1, y1=5

x2=4, y2=2

x3=1, y3=2

x4=4, y4=5

Now, x1 == x3 (both 1), and x2 == x4 (both 4), again first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = abs(2 - 5) = 3, prints 9.

Another ordering: (4,5), (1,2), (4,2), (1,5)

x1=4, y1=5

x2=1, y2=2

x3=4, y3=2

x4=1, y4=5

Here, x1 == x3 (both 4), and x2 == x4 (both 1), which matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = abs(2 - 5) = 3, prints 9.

Seems consistent.

But let's consider a different square, say with points (0,0), (0,3), (3,0), (3,3).

Following the code:

If x1=0, y1=0

x2=0, y2=3

x3=3, y3=0

x4=3, y4=3

Then, x1 == x2 (both 0), and x3 == x4 (both 3), which matches the second elif condition.

res = abs(y2 - y1) = abs(3 - 0) = 3, prints 9.

Correct area is 9.

Another ordering: x1=0, y1=3

x2=3, y2=0

x3=0, y3=0

x4=3, y4=3

Here, x1 == x3 (both 0), and x2 == x4 (both 3), which matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = abs(0 - 3) = 3, prints 9.

Again, correct.

Wait, but in this last ordering, x1 == x3 and x2 == x4, which is fine.

But what if the points are ordered in a way that doesn't neatly fit into these conditions?

For example: x1=0, y1=0

x2=3, y2=0

x3=0, y3=3

x4=3, y4=3

Here, x1 == x3 (both 0), and x2 == x4 (both 3), which matches the first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = abs(3 - 0) = 3, prints 9.

Still correct.

Another ordering: x1=0, y1=0

x2=3, y2=3

x3=0, y3=3

x4=3, y4=0

Here, x1 == x3 (both 0), and x2 == x4 (both 3), again first if condition.

res = abs(y3 - y1) = abs(3 - 0) = 3, prints 9.

Still correct.

Hmm, seems like no matter how I order the points, as long as they form a square with sides parallel to the axes, this code correctly identifies the side length and computes the area.

But is there any case where this approach might fail?

Let me think about a square where the side length is not equal to the difference in y-coordinates for some pair.

Wait, but in squares with sides parallel to the axes, the side length should always be equal to the difference in y-coordinates for points sharing the same x-coordinate, and similarly, the difference in x-coordinates for points sharing the same y-coordinate.

So, in this case, both methods should give the same side length.

For example, in the first test case, difference in y-coordinates for points with x=1 is 5 - 2 = 3, and difference in x-coordinates for points with y=2 is 4 - 1 = 3, which is consistent.

Similarly, in the second test case, difference in y-coordinates for points with x=-1 is 1 - (-1) = 2, and difference in x-coordinates for points with y=1 is 1 - (-1) = 2, which is consistent.

So, in all cases, these differences should be equal, as it's a square.

Hence, the code seems correct in calculating the side length and then squaring it to get the area.

Additionally, the code handles the absolute values, which is good, to ensure that the difference is positive.

Also, the problem states that the square has positive area, so we don't have to worry about zero-area cases.

Given that, I think the code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{True} \]
