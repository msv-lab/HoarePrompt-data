Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a strip of cells, each either white ('W') or black ('B'), and I need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment to paint white so that all cells become white. After painting, the black cells in that segment become white, and the white ones stay white.

First, I need to understand what happens when I paint a segment white. It seems that all 'B's in that segment turn into 'W's, and any 'W's remain 'W's. My goal is to choose a segment such that, after this operation, there are no 'B's left in the entire strip.

I need to find the minimum length of such a segment.

Let me think about this with an example. Take the first example from the input:

n = 6

s = W B B W B W

I need to choose a segment to paint white so that the entire strip becomes white.

Let's see:

If I choose the segment from position 2 to 5 (1-based indexing):

Original: W B B W B W

After painting positions 2 to 5:

Position 2: B -> W

Position 3: B -> W

Position 4: W -> W

Position 5: B -> W

So the strip becomes: W W W W W W

Which is all white. The length of this segment is 4.

Is there a shorter segment that can achieve the same result?

Let's try segment length 3:

Say positions 2 to 4:

Original: W B B W B W

After painting positions 2 to 4:

Position 2: B -> W

Position 3: B -> W

Position 4: W -> W

So the strip becomes: W W W W B W

Still has a 'B' at position 5. Not all white.

Another try: positions 3 to 5:

Original: W B B W B W

After painting:

Position 3: B -> W

Position 4: W -> W

Position 5: B -> W

So the strip becomes: W B W W W W

Still has a 'B' at position 2. Not all white.

Segment length 3 doesn't work.

What about segment length 2?

Try positions 2 to 3:

Original: W B B W B W

After painting:

Position 2: B -> W

Position 3: B -> W

Strip becomes: W W W W B W

Still has 'B' at position 5.

Not all white.

Another try: positions 4 to 5:

Original: W B B W B W

After painting:

Position 4: W -> W

Position 5: B -> W

Strip becomes: W B B W W W

Still has 'B's at positions 2 and 3.

Not all white.

Segment length 2 doesn't work.

Segment length 4 is the minimum in this case.

Another example:

n = 1

s = B

I need to paint the entire strip, so the minimum segment length is 1.

n = 2

s = W B

If I paint the second cell (position 2):

Original: W B

After painting: W W

All white. So segment length 1.

Alternatively, painting position 1:

Original: W B

After painting: W B (since position 1 is already W, it stays W, but position 2 is B and doesn't get painted). Wait, no.

Wait, the segment is continuous, and I have to paint a continuous segment.

If I paint position 2:

Original: W B

After painting: W W

All white.

So segment length 1.

Another example:

n = 3

s = B B W

If I paint positions 1 to 2:

Original: B B W

After painting: W W W

All white. Segment length 2.

Is there a segment of length 1 that works?

Paint position 1:

Original: B B W

After painting: W B W

Still has 'B' at position 2.

Not all white.

Paint position 2:

Original: B B W

After painting: B W W

Still has 'B' at position 1.

Not all white.

So segment length 2 is the minimum.

Another example:

n = 4

s = B W W B

If I paint positions 1 to 4:

Original: B W W B

After painting: W W W W

All white. Segment length 4.

Is there a shorter segment?

Try positions 2 to 4:

Original: B W W B

After painting: B W W W

Still has 'B' at position 1.

Not all white.

Positions 1 to 3:

Original: B W W B

After painting: W W W B

Still has 'B' at position 4.

Not all white.

Segment length 4 is necessary.

Another example:

n = 6

s = B W B W W B

If I paint positions 1 to 6:

Original: B W B W W B

After painting: W W W W W W

All white. Segment length 6.

Is there a shorter segment?

Try positions 2 to 6:

Original: B W B W W B

After painting: B W W W W W

Still has 'B' at position 1.

Not all white.

Positions 1 to 5:

Original: B W B W W B

After painting: W W W W W B

Still has 'B' at position 6.

Not all white.

Segment length 6 is necessary.

Another example:

n = 6

s = W W B B W B

If I paint positions 3 to 6:

Original: W W B B W B

After painting: W W W W W W

All white. Segment length 4.

Is there a shorter segment?

Try positions 3 to 5:

Original: W W B B W B

After painting: W W W W W B

Still has 'B' at position 6.

Not all white.

Positions 4 to 6:

Original: W W B B W B

After painting: W W B W W W

Still has 'B' at position 3.

Not all white.

Segment length 4 is necessary.

Last example:

n = 9

s = W B W B W W W B W

If I paint positions 2 to 8:

Original: W B W B W W W B W

After painting: W W W W W W W W W

All white. Segment length 7.

Is there a shorter segment?

Try positions 2 to 7:

Original: W B W B W W W B W

After painting: W W W W W W W B W

Still has 'B's at positions 8 and 9.

Not all white.

Positions 3 to 8:

Original: W B W B W W W B W

After painting: W B W W W W W W W

Still has 'B' at position 2.

Not all white.

Segment length 7 is necessary.

From these examples, it seems that the minimum segment length required is from the first 'B' to the last 'B' in the string.

In other words, find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the segment from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B' will cover all 'B's, turning them to 'W's, and any 'W's in between stay 'W's.

So, the minimum segment length would be the position of the rightmost 'B' minus the position of the leftmost 'B' plus one.

But wait, in the first example:

s = W B B W B W

Leftmost 'B' at position 2

Rightmost 'B' at position 5

Length: 5 - 2 + 1 = 4

Which matches the sample output.

In the second example:

s = B

Leftmost 'B' at position 1

Rightmost 'B' at position 1

Length: 1 - 1 + 1 = 1

In the third example:

s = W B

Leftmost 'B' at position 2

Rightmost 'B' at position 2

Length: 2 - 2 + 1 = 1

In the fourth example:

s = B B W

Leftmost 'B' at position 1

Rightmost 'B' at position 2

Length: 2 - 1 + 1 = 2

In the fifth example:

s = B W W B

Leftmost 'B' at position 1

Rightmost 'B' at position 4

Length: 4 - 1 + 1 = 4

In the sixth example:

s = B W B W W B

Leftmost 'B' at position 1

Rightmost 'B' at position 6

Length: 6 - 1 + 1 = 6

In the seventh example:

s = W W B B W B

Leftmost 'B' at position 3

Rightmost 'B' at position 6

Length: 6 - 3 + 1 = 4

In the eighth example:

s = W B W B W W W B W

Leftmost 'B' at position 2

Rightmost 'B' at position 8

Length: 8 - 2 + 1 = 7

All these match the sample outputs.

So, the strategy is to find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the minimal segment to paint is from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B'.

This seems to be correct based on the examples.

But is this always the case?

Let me think about a case where there are 'B's scattered, and perhaps painting a larger segment that covers all 'B's is necessary.

For example:

s = B W B W B

Leftmost 'B' at position 1

Rightmost 'B' at position 5

Segment length: 5 - 1 + 1 = 5

If I paint positions 1 to 5:

Original: B W B W B

After painting: W W W W W

All white.

Is there a shorter segment?

Try positions 2 to 4:

Original: B W B W B

After painting: B W W W B

Still has 'B's at positions 1 and 5.

Not all white.

So, no, segment length 5 is necessary.

Another case:

s = B B B B

Leftmost 'B' at position 1

Rightmost 'B' at position 4

Segment length: 4 - 1 + 1 = 4

Paint positions 1 to 4:

Original: B B B B

After painting: W W W W

All white.

Is there a shorter segment?

No, because all positions need to be painted.

So, seems consistent.

Another case:

s = W W W W

But according to the problem, there is at least one 'B', so this case doesn't apply.

Another case:

s = W B W B W B

Leftmost 'B' at position 2

Rightmost 'B' at position 5

Segment length: 5 - 2 + 1 = 5

Paint positions 2 to 5:

Original: W B W B W B

After painting: W W W W W B

Still has 'B' at position 6.

Not all white.

So, this doesn't work.

Wait, but according to my earlier strategy, it should be from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B'.

In this case, leftmost 'B' at position 2, rightmost 'B' at position 6.

Segment length: 6 - 2 + 1 = 5

Wait, in the earlier incorrect try, I only painted positions 2 to 5, which is length 4, but I should paint positions 2 to 6, which is length 5.

Yes, painting positions 2 to 6:

Original: W B W B W B

After painting: W W W W W W

All white.

So, segment length 5 is necessary.

Earlier mistake was in choosing the wrong segment length.

So, the general strategy is:

Find the leftmost 'B' and the rightmost 'B', and the minimal segment to paint is from leftmost 'B' to rightmost 'B', inclusive.

The length of this segment is rightmost 'B' index - leftmost 'B' index + 1.

This seems to be the minimal length because any shorter segment would not cover all 'B's.

In the earlier wrong example, I tried a segment that didn't cover all 'B's, hence it didn't work.

So, this should be the correct approach.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

inpstr = input()

ind1 = 0

ind2 = 0

outind = 0

for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):

if j == 'B':

ind1 = i

break

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

This program seems to be finding the leftmost 'B' index (ind1) and the rightmost 'B' index (ind2), and then calculating the length as len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1.

Wait a minute, is that correct?

Let's see with an example.

Take s = W B B W B W (n=6)

Leftmost 'B' at position 1 (index 0)

Rightmost 'B' at position 5 (index 4)

len(inpstr) = 6

ind1 = 1 (position 2, but index 1 in 0-based)

Wait, no.

Wait, in Python, strings are 0-based.

s = 'W B B W B W'

Actually, in Python, strings are 0-based, so:

s[0] = 'W'

s[1] = 'B'

s[2] = 'B'

s[3] = 'W'

s[4] = 'B'

s[5] = 'W'

So, leftmost 'B' is at index 1

Rightmost 'B' is at index 4

So, the segment from index 1 to index 4, inclusive.

Length: 4 - 1 + 1 = 4

According to the program:

ind1 = 1 (since s[1] = 'B')

ind2 = 2 (since s[5-2-1] = s[2] = 'B')

len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 = 6 - 2 - 1 = 3

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, there's a mistake.

Let's simulate the program step by step.

inpstr = 'W B B W B W'

Find ind1:

Loop through enumerate(inpstr):

i=0, j='W' -> no

i=1, j='B' -> ind1 = 1, break

So ind1 = 1

Find ind2:

Loop through range(len(inpstr)) = range(6):

i=0 -> inpstr[-0-1] = inpstr[-1] = 'W' -> no

i=1 -> inpstr[-2] = 'B' -> ind2 =1, break

So ind2 =1

Then, print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1) = 6 -1 -1 =4

Wait, in this case, it's printing 4, which matches the expected output.

Wait, earlier I thought ind2 would be 2, but actually it's 1.

Wait, s[-1] = 'W', s[-2] = 'B', so ind2 =1

So, 6 -1 -1 =4, which is correct.

Another example:

n=1, s='B'

ind1=0 (s[0]='B')

ind2=0 (s[-0-1]=s[-1]= 'B')

len(inpstr) -ind2 -ind1 =1 -0 -0=1, correct.

n=2, s='W B'

ind1=1 (s[1]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-1]='B')

len(inpstr)-1-1=0, but should be 1.

Wait, in this case, it's giving 0, but the correct output is 1.

Wait, there's an inconsistency.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=2, s=WB, output is 1.

But according to the program, it's printing 0, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let's see:

n=2, s='W B'

ind1=1 (s[1]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-1]='B')

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=2-1-1=0

But the correct output is 1.

So, in this case, it's incorrect.

Wait, but earlier it seemed correct for n=6.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Looking back at the program:

def func():

inpstr = input()

ind1 = 0

ind2 = 0

outind = 0

for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):

if j == 'B':

ind1 = i

break

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

In the second loop:

for i in range(len(inpstr)):

if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':

ind2 = i

break

So, i starts from 0 to len(inpstr)-1.

But in Python, negative indices start from -1 for the last character.

So, when i=0:

inpstr[-1] = last character

i=1:

inpstr[-2]

and so on.

So, ind2 represents the distance from the end.

Then, len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 should give the length from ind1 to ind1 + length - ind2 -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

Wait, maybe it's a different way to calculate the length.

Let me consider the positions.

In the n=6 example:

ind1=1 (position 2)

ind2=1 (since s[-2]='B', which is position 5)

len(inpstr)=6

6 -1 -1=4, which is correct.

In n=2, s='W B'

ind1=1 (position 2)

ind2=1 (s[-2]='W', but s[-1]='B', so i=0: s[-1]='B', ind2=0)

Wait, no, for s='W B'

len(inpstr)=2

for i in range(2):

i=0: inpstr[-1]='B' -> ind2=0, break

So, ind2=0

Then, len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=2-0-1=1, which is correct.

Wait, in my earlier calculation, I mistakenly thought ind2=1, but actually it's 0.

So, it's correct for n=2.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was giving 0, but actually it's giving 1.

I must have miscalculated.

So, for n=2, s='W B'

ind1=1

ind2=0

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=2-0-1=1, which is correct.

Another example:

n=3, s='B B W'

ind1=0 (s[0]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-2]='B')

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=3-1-0=2, which is correct.

Another example:

n=4, s='B W W B'

ind1=0 (s[0]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-2]='B')

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=4-1-0=3, but correct output should be 4.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be 4.

So, in this case, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the earlier examples, it should be 4.

Wait, maybe the program is incorrect.

Wait, let's see:

n=4, s='B W W B'

ind1=0 (s[0]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-2]='W', s[-1]='B' -> i=0: s[-1]='B', ind2=0)

Wait, no, for s='B W W B'

len(inpstr)=4

for i in range(4):

i=0: inpstr[-1]='B' -> ind2=0, break

So, ind2=0

Then, len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=4-0-0=4, which is correct.

Wait, earlier I thought ind2=1, but it's actually 0.

So, it's correct.

Another example:

n=6, s='B W B W W B'

ind1=0 (s[0]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-2]='W', s[-1]='B' -> i=0: s[-1]='B', ind2=0)

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=6-0-0=6, which is correct.

Another example:

n=6, s='W W B B W B'

ind1=2 (s[2]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-2]='W', s[-1]='B' -> i=0: s[-1]='B', ind2=0)

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=6-0-2=4, which is correct.

Last example:

n=9, s='W B W B W W W B W'

ind1=1 (s[1]='B')

ind2=1 (s[-2]='B')

len(inpstr)-ind2-ind1=9-1-1=7, which is correct.

So, in all these cases, it's giving the correct output.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought ind2 was calculated incorrectly, but it seems I was wrong.

So, the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
