Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board, and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers.

First, I need to understand what exactly is happening here. For example, if n is 12, the numbers are 1 to 12. Then, each number is replaced by the sum of its digits:

- 1 -> 1

- 2 -> 2

- 3 -> 3

- 4 -> 4

- 5 -> 5

- 6 -> 6

- 7 -> 7

- 8 -> 8

- 9 -> 9

- 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1

- 11 -> 1 + 1 = 2

- 12 -> 1 + 2 = 3

Now, summing these up: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3 = 51, which matches the example.

So, the task is to compute the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to n, for multiple test cases.

Looking at the input and output specifications:

- The first line contains t (number of test cases), where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

- Each of the next t lines contains an integer n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5.

- For each test case, output the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to n.

Given that t can be up to 10,000 and n can be up to 200,000, efficiency is crucial, especially since the time limit is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Now, looking at the provided program:

```

soma = 0

N = int(input())

for _ in range(N):

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

soma += func_1(i)

print(soma)

def func_1(n):

return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

```

Wait a minute, the variable names are in Portuguese, which might be confusing. Let's try to understand what's happening here.

- `soma` is the sum of all digit sums across all test cases.

- `N` is read from input, which should be the number of test cases, t.

- Then, for each test case, it reads an integer n.

- For each n, it iterates from 0 to n-1 (since range(n)), and for each i, it adds the sum of digits of i to `soma`.

- Finally, it prints `soma`, which is the total sum across all test cases.

- `func_1(n)` is a function that returns the sum of digits of n by converting it to a string and summing the integer values of each character.

There are a few issues here:

1. The loop `for i in range(n):` starts from 0 to n-1, but the problem says from 1 to n. So, it should be `for i in range(1, n+1):`.

2. The sum is accumulated in `soma` for all test cases and printed only once at the end. However, according to the problem, for each test case, we need to output a separate line with the sum for that test case.

3. Efficiency: With t up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5, the nested loop will be too slow. We need a better approach to compute the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

Let's think about a better way to compute the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

First, observe that the sum of digit sums from 1 to n can be computed directly without iterating through each number, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, which would result in up to 2*10^9 operations, way too slow.

We need a mathematical formula or an optimized way to calculate this sum.

Let's consider the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

For example, for n=12:

Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 51

We can think of this as the sum of the digits in each position separately.

Let's consider numbers from 1 to n, and compute the sum of digits in the units place, the tens place, and so on, separately.

For example, for n=12:

- Units place: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2 → sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+0+1+2=48

- Tens place: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1 → sum is 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+0+1+1+1=3

- Total sum: 48 + 3 = 51

So, if we can compute the sum of digits in each position from 1 to n, and add them up, we get the total sum.

This seems promising. Let's try to generalize this.

Let's consider the numbers from 1 to n, and consider each digit position separately.

For each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), we can calculate the sum of digits in that position across all numbers from 1 to n.

Then, the total sum is the sum across all digit positions.

Now, how do we calculate the sum of digits in a particular position for numbers from 1 to n?

Let's take the units place as an example.

For the units place, the digits cycle every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and repeat.

So, for numbers from 1 to n, the number of complete cycles is floor(n/10), and the remaining numbers are n mod 10.

The sum for complete cycles is (number of cycles) * (sum of digits from 0 to 9), which is (number of cycles) * 45.

Then, the sum for the remaining numbers is the sum of digits from 0 to (n mod 10).

So, sum_units = (n // 10) * 45 + sum(range(n % 10 + 1))

Similarly, for the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers: 00,01,02,...,99, and repeat.

But for the tens place, each cycle sums to 45*10 = 450, because there are 10 tens digits in each cycle (0-9 in the tens place for each hundred).

Wait, actually, for the tens place, each cycle from 0-99 has tens digits summing to 45*10 = 450.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

For the tens place in numbers from 0 to 99:

- From 0-9: tens digit is 0, sum is 0

- From 10-19: tens digit is 1, sum is 10

- From 20-29: tens digit is 2, sum is 20

- ...

- From 90-99: tens digit is 9, sum is 90

- Total sum for tens place: 0 + 10 + 20 + ... + 90 = 450

So, for every 100 numbers, the sum of the tens digits is 450.

Similarly, for hundreds place, it would be 4500 for every 1000 numbers, and so on.

So, generalizing, for the k-th digit (from right to left, starting with k=0 for units), the sum of digits in that position from 1 to n can be calculated as follows:

- Determine the number of complete cycles of 10^{k+1} numbers, which is floor(n / 10^{k+1}).

- Each complete cycle contributes sum_digit_k = 45 * 10^{k} * (n // 10^{k+1})

- Then, calculate the partial sum for the incomplete cycle.

This seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, there's a formula for the sum of digit sums from 1 to n, which is:

sum_digit_sum(1 to n) = (n*(n+1)/2) - 9*(sum floor(n/10^k))

where the sum is over k from 1 to floor(log10(n))

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Actually, I recall that the sum of digit sums from 1 to n can be expressed using the formula involving the number of carries in addition, but that might be too complicated for this context.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another idea is to iterate through each digit position and calculate the contribution of that digit to the total sum.

For example, for n=12:

- Units place: digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2 → sum=48

- Tens place: digits are 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1 → sum=3

- Total sum=48+3=51

Similarly, for n=100:

- Units: 0+1+2+...+9 * 10 = 45*10=450

- Tens: 0*10 + 1*10 + 2*10 + ... + 9*10 = 45*10=450

- Hundreds: 1*100=100

- Total sum=450+450+100=1000

Wait, but for n=100, numbers are from 1 to 100.

Sum of digit sums:

- 1 to 99: sum_digit_sum(99) = sum from 1 to 9: 45, plus sum from 10 to 99: units digits sum to 45*9=405, tens digits sum to 45*9=405, total 45+405+405=855

- Plus 100: 1+0+0=1

- Total: 855+1=856

But according to my earlier calculation, sum=1000, which is incorrect. So, my earlier assumption is wrong.

I need a better way to calculate the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

I recall that the sum of digit sums from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula:

sum_digit_sum(1 to n) = (n+1) * number_of_digits - sum(d * count_d for d in 0 to 9)

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use inclusion-exclusion or some other combinatorial method.

Wait, perhaps I can consider each digit position separately and calculate its contribution to the total sum.

Let's try to calculate the sum of digits in each position separately and then sum them up.

For a given digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), we can calculate the sum of digits in that position across all numbers from 1 to n.

Then, the total sum is the sum of these individual sums.

Let's formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let m be the number of digits in n.

- For each digit position k from 0 to m-1 (where k=0 is the units place):

- We need to calculate the sum of the k-th digit across all numbers from 1 to n.

- Then, sum over all k of (sum of k-th digit from 1 to n)

This seems manageable.

Now, how to calculate the sum of the k-th digit from 1 to n.

Let’s consider the k-th digit, with k=0 being the units digit.

We can observe that:

- The k-th digit cycles every 10^{k+1} numbers.

- Within each cycle, the sum of the k-th digit is 45 * (10^{k}).

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at examples.

Take k=1 (tens place), n=1234.

- From 0 to 9999, the tens digit cycles every 100 numbers.

- In each cycle of 100 numbers, the tens digit sums to 45*10 = 450.

- So, for n=1234:

- Number of complete cycles: floor(1234 / 100) = 12

- Sum from complete cycles: 12 * 450 = 5400

- Remaining numbers: 1234 % 100 = 34

- Sum from remaining numbers: sum of tens digits from 0 to 34.

- For numbers 0 to 34, the tens digits are 0 for 0-9, 1 for 10-19, 2 for 20-29, 3 for 30-34.

- So, sum = 0*10 + 1*10 + 2*10 + 3*5 = 0 + 10 + 20 + 15 = 45

- Total sum for tens place: 5400 + 45 = 5445

Wait, but this seems too high for n=1234. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Actually, for n=1234, the tens digit is in position k=1.

Let me try to generalize this.

For a given digit position k:

- The cycle length is 10^{k+1}

- In each cycle, the sum of the k-th digit is 45 * 10^{k}

- Number of complete cycles in n is floor(n / 10^{k+1})

- Sum from complete cycles: floor(n / 10^{k+1}) * 45 * 10^{k}

- Remaining numbers: n % 10^{k+1}

- Sum from remaining numbers: sum of k-th digit from 0 to remaining numbers

- To calculate sum from remaining numbers:

- Find the higher digit: floor(remaining numbers / 10^{k})

- The k-th digit is this higher digit for each group of 10^{k}

- Plus the sum for the last incomplete group

This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

I found a mathematical formula for the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

The sum of digit sums from 1 to n is equal to (n+1) * number_of_digits - sum(d * count_d for d in 0 to 9), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that the sum of digit sums is equal to the sum of all digits in the numbers from 1 to n.

Wait, actually, the digit sum of a number is the sum of its digits, so the total sum is the sum of all digits of all numbers from 1 to n.

So, sum_digit_sum(1 to n) = sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{d in digits of i} d

Which is equal to sum over all digits in all numbers from 1 to n.

This seems similar to calculating the frequency of each digit in each position.

But calculating the frequency of each digit in each position for all numbers from 1 to n can be efficient.

I recall a method where we calculate the count of each digit in each position separately.

For example, for the units place, the digit '1' appears floor(n/10) times fully, plus an additional count based on n % 10.

Similarly for other digits.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize this.

Let’s consider the sum of digits in the units place from 1 to n.

- The digit in the units place cycles every 10 numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and repeats.

- So, for n numbers, the number of complete cycles is floor(n/10), and the remaining numbers are n % 10.

- Each complete cycle sums to 0+1+2+...+9 = 45.

- The sum from complete cycles is floor(n/10) * 45.

- The sum from remaining numbers is sum from 0 to n%10.

- So, sum_units = (n // 10) * 45 + sum(range(n % 10 + 1))

Similarly, for the tens place:

- The digit in the tens place cycles every 100 numbers: 0,0,0,...,1,1,1,...,2,2,2,..., etc.

- For n numbers, the number of complete cycles is floor(n/100), and the remaining numbers are n % 100.

- Each complete cycle sums to (0+1+2+...+9) * 10 = 45 * 10 = 450.

- The sum from complete cycles is floor(n/100) * 450.

- The sum from remaining numbers is sum of tens digits from 0 to n%100.

- To calculate sum from remaining numbers:

- Let rem = n % 100

- The tens digit in rem is floor(rem / 10)

- The sum is floor(rem / 10) * (rem % 10 + 1) + sum from 0 to floor(rem / 10) -1

- This seems a bit messy.

Wait, maybe I need a better way to calculate the sum of digits in each position.

I found a more efficient approach.

The idea is to iterate through each digit position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) and calculate the sum of digits in that position across all numbers from 1 to n.

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Initialize the total sum to 0.

2. Determine the number of digits in n, let's say m.

3. For each digit position k from 0 to m-1:

a. Calculate the sum of the k-th digit across all numbers from 1 to n.

b. Add this sum to the total sum.

4. Finally, output the total sum.

Now, to calculate the sum of the k-th digit:

Let’s define:

- p = 10^k (position weight)

- r = floor(n / p)

- higher_digit = floor(r / 10)

- current_digit = r % 10

- remainder = n % p

Then, the sum of the k-th digit can be calculated as:

sum_k = higher_digit * p * 45 + higher_digit * (current_digit * (p)) + (current_digit * (remainder + 1)) + sum_digits(remainder)

But this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe I need a formula.

I found a formula for the sum of digits in a particular position.

For the k-th digit (units being k=0):

sum_k = (n // (10^{k+1})) * 45 * 10^{k} + (n // 10^{k}) % 10 * ((n % 10^{k}) + 1) + sum from 0 to min(n % 10^{k+1}, 10^{k+1}-1) minus sum from 0 to (n // 10^{k+1}) * 10^{k+1} -1

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a pre-written function or a library that can do this efficiently.

Alternatively, since n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, and time limit is strict, I need an O(1) or O(log n) per test case solution.

I recall that there is a mathematical formula to compute the sum of digit sums from 1 to
