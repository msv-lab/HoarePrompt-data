Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what the bitwise OR of the sequence does. The bitwise OR of a set of numbers combines their binary representations such that each bit in the result is 1 if any of the corresponding bits in the input numbers is 1.

My goal is to maximize the number of 1s in this OR result. That means I want as many bits as possible to be 1 in the OR operation.

Given that, I need to distribute k among n numbers such that their sum is k and the bitwise OR has as many 1s as possible.

One way to approach this is to maximize the number of distinct bits set across the numbers in the sequence. Because if different numbers set different bits, the OR will have all those bits set to 1.

For example, if I have n=2 and k=3, I can choose numbers like 1 and 2. In binary, 1 is 01 and 2 is 10, so OR is 11, which has two 1s. If I choose 3 and 0, which are 11 and 00, OR is 11, same number of 1s. So both are valid, but I need to choose any one.

Another example: n=2, k=5. Choosing 5 and 0: 5 is 101, 0 is 000, OR is 101, which has two 1s. Choosing 4 and 1: 4 is 100, 1 is 001, OR is 101, same as above. Choosing 3 and 2: 3 is 011, 2 is 010, OR is 011, which has two 1s again. So all these options give the same number of 1s in OR.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=2 and k=5, output is 5 0, which has two 1s in OR, but it's stated that this is correct. So seems like two 1s is the maximum possible in this case.

But let's think if there's a way to get more than two 1s in OR for n=2 and k=5.

Let's see, 5 in binary is 101, which has two 1s. Is there a way to have three 1s in OR with n=2 and sum 5?

Let's see, the smallest number with three 1s in binary is 7 (111), but that's larger than 5, so not possible. So, two is the maximum possible in this case.

Another example: n=6, k=51, and the output is 3,1,1,32,2,12. Let's see their binary representations:

3: 00011

1: 00001

1: 00001

32: 100000

2: 00010

12: 01100

Now, OR of these numbers: For each bit position, at least one number has that bit set to 1.

Let's align them:

3:    0000011

1:    0000001

1:    0000001

32:   1000000

2:    0000010

12:   0011000

OR:   1011011

This has five 1s. Is this the maximum possible?

Is there a way to get more than five 1s in OR with n=6 and sum=51?

Let's see, the maximum number of 1s in OR would be the number of distinct bits set across all numbers.

The sum is 51, which is 110011 in binary, which has four 1s. But in the OR, we can have more 1s if different numbers set different bits.

Wait, but the sum constrains the total "weight" in binary, but OR is about the union of set bits.

Wait, the sum k is the total sum of the numbers, so the sum of their binary representations.

But in OR, we're only interested in which bits are set in at least one number.

To maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to maximize the number of distinct bits set across all n numbers.

Given that, I should try to set different bits in different numbers as much as possible.

But there's a constraint that the sum is k.

So, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that as many distinct bits are set as possible.

Wait, but setting different bits doesn't necessarily maximize the number of 1s in OR, because some bits might overlap.

Wait, actually, in OR, overlapping set bits don't increase the count of 1s; only distinct bits contribute to more 1s in OR.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to maximize the number of distinct bits set across all n numbers.

Given that, I should aim to have each number set a unique set of bits.

But there's a trade-off because I need to distribute the sum k across n numbers.

I need a strategy to allocate the sum k across n numbers such that the union of their set bits has as many 1s as possible.

One way to do this is to have each number set a unique bit.

But, since the bits are shared across numbers in OR, setting the same bit in multiple numbers doesn't increase the OR's 1s count.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to set as many unique bits as possible across the n numbers.

Given that, I should aim to have each number set a distinct bit, if possible.

But, with n numbers, there are only 32 bits in an integer, so for n > 32, it's not possible to set unique bits for each number.

But in this problem, n can be up to 2*10^5, which is much larger than 32.

Wait, but in practice, since we're dealing with non-negative integers, which are typically 32-bit or 64-bit, but in Python, integers can be arbitrary precision.

But for practical purposes, we can consider up to 64 bits.

Given that, for n > 64, it's not possible to set unique bits for each number.

But in such cases, since OR can have at most 64 bits set to 1, we can't exceed that.

But in the problem, n can be up to 2*10^5, which is much larger than 64, but in reality, since OR is a single integer, its binary representation can have at most 64 bits set to 1.

Wait, but in Python, integers can have more bits, but in practice, for this problem, since k can be up to 10^9, which is 30 bits, and n up to 2*10^5, but we need to maximize the number of 1s in OR, which is limited by the number of distinct bits that can be set across the numbers.

Wait, but in OR, only the bits that are set in at least one number are set in the result, so the maximum number of 1s in OR is the number of distinct bits set across all numbers.

Given that, to maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to maximize the number of distinct bits set across the n numbers.

Given that, I should aim to have each number set at least one unique bit.

But, I also need to ensure that the sum of the numbers is k.

So, I need to distribute k across n numbers such that as many distinct bits are set as possible.

One way to do this is to assign the smallest possible numbers to as many numbers as possible, each setting a unique bit.

But, since the numbers need to sum to k, I need to allocate the remaining sum after setting these unique bits.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to start by setting the least significant bits for the first few numbers, each setting a unique bit, and then allocating the remaining sum to the remaining numbers.

But this needs more thought.

Let me consider an algorithm:

1. Identify the maximum number of distinct bits that can be set given n and k.

2. Assign numbers such that each number sets at least one unique bit, if possible.

3. Distribute the remaining sum k among the numbers,优先保证设置独特的比特位。

Wait, but in practice, since the number of bits is limited, I need to think differently.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal possible value for the bitwise OR, but in this problem, we need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, no, the problem is to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the highest possible OR value in terms of the number of 1s in its binary representation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the OR being a number with as many 1s in its binary representation as possible.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of bits set to 1 in the OR of the sequence.

One way to do this is to have each number in the sequence set a unique bit, if possible.

But since n can be larger than the number of bits in k, I need to prioritize setting the highest bits first.

Wait, no, to maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to set as many bits as possible to 1, regardless of their position, as long as they are distinct across the sequence.

But in practice, the bits are positions, and I need to set them in the numbers in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should start by setting the least significant bits.

Wait, maybe a better way is to distribute the sum k across the n numbers in such a way that as many distinct bits are set as possible.

To do that, I can start by assigning the smallest possible numbers to the first few numbers, each setting a unique bit, and then allocate the remaining sum to the remaining numbers.

But I need to ensure that the sum is k and that the OR has as many 1s as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can start by finding the binary representation of k and see which bits are set.

But that might not directly help, because the OR can have more bits set if different numbers in the sequence set different bits.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it this way: to maximize the number of 1s in OR, I need to have as many bits set to 1 in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

So, I should aim to set different bits in different numbers as much as possible.

Given that, I can start by assigning numbers that have only one bit set, starting from the least significant bit.

So, for the first number, assign 1 (binary 001), second 2 (010), third 4 (100), and so on.

But, I need to ensure that the sum is k.

So, I can assign 1, 2, 4, ..., up to the number of numbers I have, or up to the number of bits in k, whichever is smaller.

Then, assign the remaining sum to the last number.

This way, the OR will have as many bits set as the number of unique bits assigned to the first few numbers.

Let me try this with the sample input.

Sample Input 2: n=2, k=3

Assign first number as 1 (binary 01), second as 2 (binary 10), sum is 3, OR is 11, which has two 1s.

This matches the sample output.

Another sample input: n=2, k=5

Assign first number as 1 (binary 001), second as 4 (binary 100), sum is 5, OR is 101, which has two 1s.

Alternatively, assign 5 (binary 101) and 0 (binary 000), OR is 101, same number of 1s.

So, both are valid.

Another sample input: n=6, k=51

Assign first six numbers as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 22, sum is 1+2+4+8+16+22=53, which is more than 51, so not valid.

Wait, I need to adjust the last number to make the sum equal to k.

Wait, in this approach, I need to assign 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and then the last number is k minus the sum of the first five numbers.

Wait, let's calculate:

n=6, k=51

Assign first five numbers as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, sum is 1+2+4+8+16=31

Then, the sixth number is 51 - 31 = 20

So, the sequence would be 1,2,4,8,16,20

Now, OR of these numbers:

1: 00001

2: 00010

4: 00100

8: 01000

16: 10000

20: 10100

OR: 10111, which has four 1s.

But in the sample output, they have 3,1,1,32,2,12 with OR 1011011, which has five 1s.

So, my approach is not optimal.

Hence, there must be a better way to maximize the number of 1s in OR.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I should find the minimal possible value for the bitwise OR, but in this problem, I need to maximize the number of 1s in OR.

Wait, no, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the OR.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum number of bits that can be set to 1 in the OR, given n and k.

To do that, I need to set as many bits as possible to 1 in at least one of the numbers in the sequence.

Given that, I should aim to set one unique bit in each of the first m numbers, where m is the number of bits I can set.

But, I need to ensure that the sum of these numbers is less than or equal to k.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum m such that the sum of the first m distinct powers of 2 is less than or equal to k.

Wait, but the sum of the first m distinct powers of 2 is 2^m - 1.

So, I can find the maximum m where 2^m - 1 <= k.

Then, assign the first m numbers as 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(m-1), and assign the remaining sum to the last number.

But in the sample input with n=6 and k=51, 2^6 - 1 = 63, which is larger than 51, so m=5: 2^5 -1=31 <=51, and 2^6 -1=63 >51.

So, m=5, assign first five numbers as 1,2,4,8,16, sum=31, remaining 20 to the sixth number.

Then, OR would be 1|2|4|8|16|20 = 31 | 20 = 31, which is 11111 in binary, which has five 1s.

Wait, but 31 is 11111 and 20 is 10100, OR is 11111, which has five 1s.

But in the sample output, they have six numbers with OR having five 1s: 3,1,1,32,2,12.

Wait, 3 is 00011, 1 is 00001, 1 is 00001, 32 is 100000, 2 is 00010, 12 is 001100.

OR: 1011011, which has five 1s.

So, both approaches give five 1s in OR, which seems optimal.

Hence, my earlier approach seems valid.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I got OR=31 (11111), which also has five 1s.

So, both approaches are equally good.

But in the sample output, they chose a different distribution.

Anyway, as long as the OR has the maximum number of 1s, any valid sequence is acceptable.

Hence, my approach seems valid.

So, to formalize this approach:

- Find the maximum m such that the sum of the first m distinct powers of 2 is <= k.

- Assign the first m numbers as 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(m-1).

- Assign the remaining sum to the last number.

- This ensures that the OR has m bits set to 1.

- If n > m, assign zeros to the remaining numbers, but since zero doesn't set any new bits, it's fine.

Wait, but zero doesn't change the OR, so it's okay.

But in the sample input with n=2 and k=5, m would be 2: 1+2=3 <=5, remaining 2 assigned to the second number, making it 2.

But in the sample output, they have 5 and 0, which also gives OR=101, which has two 1s, same as my approach.

Hence, both are valid.

So, this seems a correct approach.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic.

Looking at the code:

def func_1(n, k):

nums = [0] * n

nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1

k -= nums[0]

for i in range(1, n):

if k > 0:

nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)

k -= nums[i]

nums[0] += k

return nums

Let's understand this code.

First, it initializes a list of n zeros.

Then, it sets nums[0] to (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1.

Wait, k.bit_length() gives the number of bits required to represent k in binary.

So, for example, if k=5, which is 101 in binary, k.bit_length() is 3.

So, (1 << 3 - 1) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3.

So, nums[0] = 3.

Then, k -= nums[0], so k = 5 - 3 = 2.

Then, for i from 1 to n-1:

if k > 0:

nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)

k -= nums[i]

So, for i=1:

nums[1] = min(3 + 1, 2) = min(4, 2) = 2

k -= 2, so k=0

Then, finally, nums[0] += k, which is nums[0] += 0, so no change.

So, the sequence is [3,2]

OR of 3 (11) and 2 (10) is 11, which has two 1s.

But according to the sample input, for n=2 and k=5, output can be [5,0], which also has OR=101, which has two 1s.

So, both are valid.

But in this case, the code outputs [3,2], which is also correct.

Hence, in this case, it's correct.

Another test case: n=1, k=5

Then, nums = [0]

nums[0] = (1 << 3 -1 ) -1 = 3

k -=3, k=2

Then, no loop since n=1

Then, nums[0] +=0, so nums=[3]

But according to the sample input, for n=1 and k=5, output should be [5]

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, if n=1, we have to output k itself.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
