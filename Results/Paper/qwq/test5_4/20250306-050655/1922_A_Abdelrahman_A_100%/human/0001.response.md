Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase letters. If the template has a lowercase letter at position i, then the string must have exactly that letter at position i. If the template has an uppercase letter at position i, then the string must have a different lowercase letter at that position.

So, for example, if t has 'a' at position i, then s must have 'a' at position i. If t has 'A' at position i, then s must have any letter except 'a' at position i.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not match.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to ensure that a and b match the template t. That means, for each position i from 1 to n:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

Additionally, c should not match the template t. That means there exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

So, I need to find a template t that satisfies these conditions.

Let me consider the constraints:

- n can be from 1 to 20.

- Strings a, b, c consist only of lowercase Latin letters.

- Template t can have both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Given that n is small (up to 20), I might be able to iterate through possible templates, but the number of possible templates is 52^n, which is too large even for n=20.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let's consider each position independently.

For each position i, I need to decide whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose t[i] to be lowercase, then:

- a[i] must equal t[i]

- b[i] must equal t[i]

- c[i] must not equal t[i]

If I choose t[i] to be uppercase, then:

- a[i] must not equal t[i] (in lowercase)

- b[i] must not equal t[i] (in lowercase)

- c[i] must equal t[i] (in lowercase)

Wait, no. For uppercase t[i], the string must have a different lowercase letter.

So, if t[i] is 'A', then:

- a[i] != 'a'

- b[i] != 'a'

- c[i] == 'a' (to make c not match)

Wait, no. If t[i] is 'A', then:

- a[i] must be different from 'a'

- b[i] must be different from 'a'

- For c not to match, c[i] must be equal to 'a'

Wait, actually, for c not to match, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, to make c not match, I need at least one such position.

But I also need a and b to match the template.

So, for each position, I have two choices: make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I make t[i] lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

If I make t[i] uppercase:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is the corresponding lowercase letter.

So, for uppercase t[i], say 'A', then lowercase('A') is 'a'.

So:

- a[i] != 'a'

- b[i] != 'a'

- c[i] == 'a'

Wait, but in the uppercase case, the template t[i] is 'A', so the lowercase version is 'a'.

So, for a and b to match, their i-th letters must not be 'a'.

For c not to match, its i-th letter must be 'a'.

So, for each position, I can choose to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, and I need to choose these in such a way that:

- For all positions where t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == t[i], b[i] == t[i], c[i] != t[i]

- For all positions where t[i] is uppercase: a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

And I need at least one position where c does not match, which means at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, I need to choose for each position whether t[i] is lowercase or uppercase, subject to the constraints above.

This sounds like a problem where I can iterate through each position and determine the possible choices for t[i], and ensure that overall, the conditions are satisfied.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each position i:

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase.

- Then, t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be different from t[i].

- So, a[i] must equal b[i], otherwise, this case is invalid.

- Also, c[i] must be different from a[i] (since t[i] = a[i] = b[i], and c[i] != t[i]).

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase.

- Then, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

- Since t[i] is uppercase, lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i].

- So, I need to choose an uppercase letter for t[i] such that:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is a lowercase letter.

So, for uppercase t[i], I need to choose t[i] such that lowercase(t[i]) is a specific letter, specifically c[i].

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is simply t[i] in lowercase.

So, if I choose t[i] = 'A', then lowercase(t[i]) = 'a'.

So, for uppercase t[i]:

- a[i] != 'a'

- b[i] != 'a'

- c[i] == 'a'

So, for uppercase t[i], the lowercase version is fixed to c[i].

Wait, but t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is determined by t[i].

But c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]).

So, for uppercase t[i], lowercase(t[i]) must be c[i].

But t[i] is uppercase, so lowercase(t[i]) is the lowercase version of t[i], which must equal c[i].

So, t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i].

But c[i] is lowercase, so t[i] must be c[i].upper().

But, in this case, a[i] and b[i] must not be equal to c[i].

Wait, no:

For uppercase t[i]:

- a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) = c[i]

- b[i] != lowercase(t[i]) = c[i]

- c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) = c[i]

So, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

So, for uppercase t[i], t[i] must be the uppercase version of c[i], and a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

So, for uppercase t[i], it's only possible if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Otherwise, uppercase t[i] is invalid.

Similarly, for lowercase t[i]:

- t[i] = a[i] = b[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

So, for lowercase t[i], a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] != a[i]

If a[i] != b[i], then lowercase t[i] is invalid.

So, for each position i, I have:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase, set t[i] = a[i], and require c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase, provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], set t[i] = c[i].upper()

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- Option 1: Choose t[i] as uppercase, provided that a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], set t[i] = c[i].upper()

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i], I have two options: lowercase or uppercase (if conditions are met).

In positions where a[i] != b[i], I can only choose uppercase, if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Now, I need to choose for each position whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, subject to these constraints.

Moreover, I need at least one position where c does not match the template, which means at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But given the above, in the case of lowercase t[i], c[i] != t[i] is already required.

In the case of uppercase t[i], c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is already required.

So, as long as I choose at least one position where c does not match, which is guaranteed by choosing at least one position where either:

- t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But given the constraints, in the positions where I choose lowercase t[i], c[i] != t[i] is already required.

In positions where I choose uppercase t[i], c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is already required.

So, as long as I choose at least one position where c does not match, which is ensured by choosing at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), depending on the choice.

Wait, but in practice, in the positions where I choose lowercase t[i], c[i] != t[i] is required, and in positions where I choose uppercase t[i], c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is required.

But I need at least one position where c does not match, which means at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But in the positions where I choose lowercase t[i], c[i] != t[i] is already required.

In positions where I choose uppercase t[i], c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is already required.

So, as long as I choose at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is always the case in the positions where I choose to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase as per the constraints.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match, but in the positions where I choose t[i] lowercase, c[i] != t[i] is already required, and in positions where I choose t[i] uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is already required.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match, which could be:

- A position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]

- Or a position where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But in the positions where I choose t[i] lowercase, c[i] != t[i] is already required.

Similarly, in positions where I choose t[i] uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is already required.

So, as long as I choose at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which is always the case in the positions where I choose to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase as per the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match, which is already guaranteed by the choices I make for t[i].

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that I need to choose t[i] for each position i, such that:

- a and b match t

- c does not match t

And for c not to match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, I need to choose t[i] for each position, subject to:

- For positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase = a[i], and c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- Can only choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

And I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t, which is already enforced by the choices.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of constraints for each position and see if there's a combination that satisfies all positions and the overall condition.

Let me consider that for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase = a[i], and c[i] != t[i]

- If c[i] == a[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because c[i] == t[i], which violates the condition.

- Additionally, if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper()

- If a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase.

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- I can only choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- Otherwise, no choice is possible.

So, for positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase = a[i]

- If c[i] == a[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase.

- If a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper()

- If a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase.

- For positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- I can only choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- Otherwise, no choice is possible.

So, for each position, I have possible choices based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Now, I need to choose for each position a valid choice (lowercase or uppercase), such that:

- For all positions where t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- For all positions where t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

And ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, but in the positions where t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i] is already required.

In positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is required.

Wait, no, for uppercase t[i], the condition for c not matching is c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but in the template definition, for uppercase t[i], s must have a different lowercase letter.

Wait, no, in the problem statement:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i].

But for c not to match, in at least one position, if t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of c not matching in at least one position.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to find a template t such that:

- a and b match t

- c does not match t

For a and b to match t:

- For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

For c not to match t:

- There exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, I need to choose t[i] for each position i such that:

- For a and b to match t:

- If t[i] is lowercase: a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: a[i] != lowercase(t[i]) and b[i] != lowercase(t[i])

- For c not to match t:

- There exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase: c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, I need to choose t[i] for each position, considering the above constraints, and ensure that at least one position has c not matching.

Let me consider positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If a[i] == b[i]:

- Option 1: Set t[i] as lowercase = a[i], provided c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: Set t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

- If a[i] != b[i]:

- Can only set t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

So, in positions where a[i] == b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i], I can choose t[i] as lowercase = a[i]

- If c[i] == a[i], I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase.

- If a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], I can choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper()

- If a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i], I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase.

- In positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- I can only choose t[i] as uppercase = c[i].upper(), provided a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Now, I need to iterate through each position and see what choices I have.

Then, I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match t.

But in the positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase, c[i] != t[i] is already required.

In positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is required.

Wait, no, for uppercase t[i], c[i] must equal lowercase(t[i]) to not match.

But in the template definition, for uppercase t[i], s[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

So, for c not to match, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) indicates that c does not match the template.

Similarly, in positions where t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i] indicates that c does not match the template.

But in our earlier analysis, when choosing t[i] as lowercase, we require c[i] != t[i], and when choosing t[i] as uppercase, we require c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, but in the problem, for c not to match, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

But in our choice, when choosing t[i] as lowercase, c[i] != t[i] is required.

When choosing t[i] as uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is required.

So, in other words, in the positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase, c[i] != t[i], which contributes to c not matching the template.

Similarly, in positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), which also contributes to c not matching the template.

So, in either choice, choosing t[i] as lowercase or uppercase, I ensure that in that position, c does not match the template.

Therefore, to satisfy the condition that c does not match the template, I need to choose at least one position where t[i] is chosen such that c does not match.

But given that in both choices (lowercase or uppercase), c does not match in that position, then as long as I choose at least one position where t[i] is chosen (either lowercase or uppercase), c will not match in at least one position.

Wait, but I need to ensure that there is at least one position where c does not match.

Given that in the positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase, c[i] != t[i], and in positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), then in those positions, c does not match the template.

So, as long as I choose at least one position where t[i] is chosen (either lowercase or uppercase), c will not match in at least one position.

But, in practice, in the positions where I choose t[i] as lowercase, c[i] != t[i] is required, and in positions where I choose t[i] as uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) is required.

So, if I choose all positions as uppercase, provided that for each position, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then c does not match in all positions.

Similarly, if I choose at least one position as lowercase where c[i] != t[i], and the rest as uppercase where c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), that would satisfy the condition.

Wait, no, actually, for c not to match, I need at least one position where c does not match, but in the positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) indicates that c does not match the template.

Wait, no, in the positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) means that c does not match the template, because for uppercase t[i], s[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

Wait, there's confusion here.

Let's clarify:

- For uppercase t[i], s[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i])

- For c not to match, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

So, in positions where t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase(t[i]) indicates that c does not match the template.

Wait, but in the template definition, for uppercase t[i], s[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

So, if c[i] == lowercase(t[i]), then c does not match the template.

Wait, no, if t[i] is uppercase, then for c to match the template, c[i] must be different from lowercase(t[i]).

But for c not to match the template, c[i] == lowercase(t[i])

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement:

"The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold for all i from 1 to n:

- if the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i;

- if the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i."

"Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't hold for at least one i."

So, for c not to match the template, there must
