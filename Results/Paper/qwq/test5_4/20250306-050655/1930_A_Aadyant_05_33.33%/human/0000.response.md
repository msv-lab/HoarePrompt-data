Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a set of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in n pairs. For each pair, I add the smaller number to my score. The goal is to arrange these pairs in such a way that the sum of the smaller numbers in each pair is as large as possible.

Let me think about an example to grasp this better. Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

1

2 3

Output:

2

So, n=1, and the numbers are 2 and 3. I have to choose one pair, which is (2,3), and add the minimum, which is 2, to my score. That makes sense.

Second test case:

Input:

2

1 1 2 1

Output:

2

Here, n=2, and the numbers are 1, 1, 2, 1. I need to form two pairs. One possible way is to pair (1,1) and (2,1), adding 1 + 1 = 2 to the score. Another way could be pairing (1,1) and (2,1), still adding 1 + 1 = 2. It seems like 2 is the maximum score possible.

Third test case:

Input:

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

3

Here, n=3, and all numbers are 1. So, pairing any two will always add 1, and doing this three times gives a total score of 3.

From these examples, it seems like to maximize the score, I should pair the smallest numbers together. That way, the minimum in each pair is as large as possible.

Wait a minute, in the second test case, if I pair (1,1) and (2,1), the minimums are 1 and 1, totaling 2. But if I pair (1,2) and (1,1), the minimums are 1 and 1 again, totaling 2. So, it doesn't matter how I pair them; the score remains the same.

But let's consider another example. Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4.

If I pair (1,2) and (3,4), minimums are 1 and 3, totaling 4.

If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), minimums are 1 and 2, totaling 3.

If I pair (1,4) and (2,3), minimums are 1 and 2, totaling 3.

So, in this case, pairing the two smallest together gives a better score than other pairings.

Wait, but according to the problem, I need to maximize the sum of the minimums of each pair.

Is there a general strategy for this?

Let me think about sorting the array first. If I sort the array in non-decreasing order, maybe I can pair them in a specific way to maximize the sum.

Let's take the second test case: 1, 1, 2, 1. Sorted: 1, 1, 1, 2.

If I pair the first two (1,1), minimum is 1.

Then pair the next two (1,2), minimum is 1.

Total score: 2.

Alternatively, if I pair (1,1) and (1,2), same as above.

Another way: pair (1,2) and (1,1), same again.

So, in this case, it doesn't matter how I pair them after sorting.

But in the previous example I made up: 1,2,3,4.

Sorted: 1,2,3,4.

If I pair (1,2) and (3,4), sum of minimums is 1 + 3 = 4.

If I pair (1,3) and (2,4), sum is 1 + 2 = 3.

If I pair (1,4) and (2,3), sum is 1 + 2 = 3.

So, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives a better sum.

Wait, but in the second test case, pairing the smallest together still gives the same sum.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me consider another example: n=3, numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorted: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Option 1: pair (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) → sum of minimums: 1+3+5=9.

Option 2: pair (1,3), (2,5), (4,6) → sum of minimums: 1+2+4=7.

Option 3: pair (1,4), (2,5), (3,6) → sum of minimums: 1+2+3=6.

So, again, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the highest sum.

Therefore, it seems that the optimal strategy is to sort the array in non-decreasing order and pair the numbers in consecutive pairs.

Wait, but in the second test case, pairing the smallest together still gives the same sum.

Wait, no, in the second test case, pairing the smallest together or in consecutive pairs gives the same sum.

But in the third test case, all numbers are the same, so it doesn't matter.

So, generalizing, sorting the array and pairing the smallest with the next smallest seems to give the maximum sum of minimums.

Let me see if there's a mathematical justification for this.

Suppose I have two pairs: (a,b) and (c,d), with a ≤ b and c ≤ d.

I want to maximize min(a,b) + min(c,d).

If I pair a with c and b with d, then min(a,c) + min(b,d).

But since a ≤ b and c ≤ d, min(a,c) is a if a ≤ c, else c.

Similarly, min(b,d) is b if b ≤ d, else d.

But if I pair a with b and c with d, then min(a,b) is a, and min(c,d) is c.

So, sum is a + c.

Comparing min(a,c) + min(b,d) with a + c.

Let me consider specific values.

Suppose a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4.

Then, pairing (1,2) and (3,4): min(1,2)=1, min(3,4)=3, sum=4.

Pairing (1,3) and (2,4): min(1,3)=1, min(2,4)=2, sum=3.

So, 4 > 3, so pairing (1,2) and (3,4) is better.

Another example: a=1, b=3, c=2, d=4.

Pairing (1,3) and (2,4): min(1,3)=1, min(2,4)=2, sum=3.

Pairing (1,2) and (3,4): min(1,2)=1, min(3,4)=3, sum=4.

Again, 4 > 3.

So, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives a higher sum.

Is this always the case?

Let me try another example: a=1, b=100, c=2, d=2.

Pairing (1,100) and (2,2): min(1,100)=1, min(2,2)=2, sum=3.

Pairing (1,2) and (100,2): min(1,2)=1, min(100,2)=2, sum=3.

Same sum.

Another way: pairing (1,2) and (100,2): min(1,2)=1, min(100,2)=2, sum=3.

Alternatively, pairing (1,2) and (100,2): same as above.

Wait, in this case, both ways give the same sum.

So, it seems that pairing the smallest with the next smallest is at least not worse than other pairings.

In some cases, it's better, in others, it's equal.

Therefore, it's a safe strategy to sort the array and pair the smallest with the next smallest.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

num = input()

out = []

for numbers in range(int(num)):

list2 = []

list1 = []

a = input()

a = int(a)

b = input('')

list1 = b.split()

list1.sort()

for i in range(a):

list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))

out.append(sum(list2))

del list1[:]

del list2[:]

for outputs in out:

print(outputs)

Let's analyze this code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case:

- It reads n.

- Reads the 2n integers.

- Sorts the list of integers.

- Then, it iterates from 0 to n-1 and picks the element at position 2*i in the sorted list, which is the i-th smallest element.

- It sums these n elements.

- Appends this sum to the output list.

- Clears the temporary lists.

Finally, it prints the sums for each test case.

Wait a second, in the sorted list, list1.sort(), which sorts the list in non-decreasing order.

Then, it picks list1[0], list1[2], list1[4], ..., list1[2*(n-1)].

Is this the correct strategy?

Let's see with an example.

Take n=2, numbers: 1,1,2,1.

Sorted: 1,1,1,2.

Then, it picks list1[0]=1 and list1[2]=1, sum=2.

Which matches the expected output.

Another example: n=1, numbers:2,3.

Sorted:2,3.

Picks list1[0]=2, sum=2.

Matches the expected output.

Third example: n=3, numbers:1,1,1,1,1,1.

Sorted:1,1,1,1,1,1.

Picks list1[0]=1, list1[2]=1, list1[4]=1, sum=3.

Matches the expected output.

Another example I thought earlier: n=2, numbers:1,2,3,4.

Sorted:1,2,3,4.

Picks list1[0]=1 and list1[2]=3, sum=4.

Which is the same as pairing (1,2) and (3,4), sum of min=1+3=4.

So, it seems correct.

But is there a better way?

Wait, in the sorted list, picking every other element starting from the first seems to be equivalent to picking the smallest, then the third smallest, and so on.

But in the example I gave earlier, n=2, numbers=1,2,3,4.

Picking list1[0]=1 and list1[2]=3, sum=4.

Alternatively, pairing (1,2) and (3,4), sum=1+3=4.

Or pairing (1,3) and (2,4), sum=1+2=3.

So, it's still the same.

But is there a case where this approach fails?

Let me think of another example.

Suppose n=3, numbers:1,2,2,3,3,4.

Sorted:1,2,2,3,3,4.

Picking list1[0]=1, list1[2]=2, list1[4]=3, sum=6.

Alternative pairings:

- Pair (1,2), (2,3), (3,4): min sum=1+2+3=6.

- Pair (1,3), (2,2), (3,4): min sum=1+2+3=6.

- Pair (1,2), (3,4), (2,3): min sum=1+2+2=5.

So, the program's approach gives 6, which is correct.

Another example: n=3, numbers:1,1,2,2,3,3.

Sorted:1,1,2,2,3,3.

Picking list1[0]=1, list1[2]=2, list1[4]=3, sum=6.

Alternative pairings:

- Pair (1,1), (2,2), (3,3): min sum=1+2+3=6.

- Pair (1,2), (1,2), (3,3): min sum=1+1+3=5.

- Pair (1,3), (1,2), (2,3): min sum=1+1+2=4.

So, again, the program's approach gives the maximum sum.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
