Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements from a_1 to a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, x_i should be equal to a_i modulo a_{i-1}.

And I need to do this for multiple test cases, with the constraints given.

First, I need to understand what the modulo operation means here. x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} means that x_i is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}. So, a_i must be at least x_i, and a_i can be expressed as k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

My goal is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions for each test case.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

4

2 4 1

3

1 1

6

4 2 5 1 2

2

500

3

1 5

Output:

3 5 4 9

2 5 11

5 14 16 5 11 24

501 500

2 7 5

So, for the first test case with n=4 and x=[2,4,1], one possible a is [3,5,4,9], which satisfies:

5 mod 3 = 2

4 mod 5 = 4

9 mod 4 = 1

I need to find a general way to construct such an array a for any given x.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to start from a_1 and then determine each subsequent a_i based on x_i and a_{i-1}.

Given that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, I can express a_i as a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer >=0.

To keep the values of a_i within the limit of 10^9, I need to choose k appropriately.

One simple choice is to set k=1 for all i, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let me check if this works with the first example.

Given x=[2,4,1], and starting with a_1=3:

a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5

5 mod 3 = 2, which matches x_2.

a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9

9 mod 5 = 4, which matches x_3.

a_4 = 9 + 1 = 10

10 mod 9 = 1, which matches x_4.

Wait, but in the example, a_4 is 9 mod 4 =1, but in this case, it's 10 mod 9=1.

Hmm, that's different from the example output where a_4 is 9.

So, my initial approach of setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to work, but in the example, they have a different a array.

That's fine, as long as it satisfies the conditions.

Let me see if there are cases where this approach might fail.

Suppose x_i >= a_{i-1}. In that case, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i would be greater than x_i, and a_i mod a_{i-1} would indeed be x_i, since x_i < a_{i-1} in this case.

Wait, no. If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and a_i mod a_{i-1} would be x_i mod a_{i-1}, which may not be equal to x_i unless x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait a minute, that's a problem.

I need to ensure that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, and if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i mod a_{i-1} != x_i.

So, my initial approach of setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i may not work if x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Let me see an example where x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Suppose x_i = 5 and a_{i-1} = 3.

Then, a_i = 3 + 5 = 8.

8 mod 3 = 2, but x_i is 5, which is not equal to 2.

So, in this case, my approach fails.

Therefore, I need a different way to choose a_i when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

I need to make sure that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, even when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Let me think about how to do that.

If x_i >= a_{i-1}, then I need to find a_i such that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, and a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

But since x_i >= a_{i-1}, x_i mod a_{i-1} != x_i.

So, perhaps I need to adjust k accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can set a_i = x_i + m * a_{i-1}, where m is chosen such that x_i + m * a_{i-1} >= a_{i-1}, but that seems redundant.

Wait, actually, the modulo operation will always give a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i if a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k.

But if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i mod a_{i-1} != x_i, so I need to adjust k to make sure that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, but x_i mod a_{i-1} is x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}, which is the remainder.

So, if x_i >= a_{i-1}, then x_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}.

But I need a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, perhaps I can set a_i = x_i + m * a_{i-1}, where m is chosen such that a_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, but I need a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, and a_i >= a_{i-1}.

Wait, actually, in general, for any a_i >= a_{i-1}, a_i can be expressed as a_i = k * a_{i-1} + r, where r < a_{i-1} and r = a_i mod a_{i-1}.

But in this problem, r = x_i, which could be >= a_{i-1}, which seems contradictory.

Wait, no, x_i is given and is between 1 and 500, and a_{i-1} is between 1 and 10^9.

Wait, no, a_{i-1} is between 1 and 10^9, but in the problem, a_i can be up to 10^9.

Wait, but in the problem, x_i is between 1 and 500, and a_i is between 1 and 10^9.

So, x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

So, if a_{i-1} > x_i, then a_i can be set to a_{i-1} + x_i, and a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

But if a_{i-1} <= x_i, then a_i needs to be something else.

Wait, but a_i can be larger than a_{i-1}, but I need a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, if a_{i-1} <= x_i, then a_i must be at least x_i + a_{i-1}, because a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, and for k=1, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But in this case, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i only if x_i < a_{i-1}, which isn't true in this case.

Wait, no, if a_i = m * a_{i-1} + x_i, then a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i mod a_{i-1}.

But since x_i >= a_{i-1}, x_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}.

But I need a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, perhaps I need to set a_i = x_i + m * a_{i-1}, where m is chosen such that x_i + m * a_{i-1} mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

Wait, but any multiple of a_{i-1} added to x_i will not change the modulo, because (x_i + m * a_{i-1}) mod a_{i-1} = x_i mod a_{i-1}.

But I need (x_i + m * a_{i-1}) mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

But x_i >= a_{i-1}, so x_i mod a_{i-1} != x_i.

Hence, I need to find a different approach.

Maybe I can set a_{i-1} to be a divisor of a_i - x_i.

Wait, from a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, we have a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >=0.

So, to satisfy a_i >= a_{i-1}, I can choose k such that a_i >= a_{i-1}.

But in the case where x_i >= a_{i-1}, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i would give a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i mod a_{i-1}, which is x_i - floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}.

But I need a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, perhaps I need to set a_i = x_i + m * a_{i-1}, where m is chosen such that x_i + m * a_{i-1} mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

But as above, (x_i + m * a_{i-1}) mod a_{i-1} = x_i mod a_{i-1}, which is not equal to x_i when x_i >= a_{i-1}.

So, perhaps I need to choose a_{i-1} such that x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but a_{i-1} is determined from the previous step.

So, maybe I need to set a_{i-1} > x_i for all i.

But that might not be possible, because x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

Wait, but a_{i-1} is determined based on previous x's.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a_1 to be larger than all x_i's.

But x_i can be up to 500, so setting a_1 to be larger than 500 would ensure that a_1 > x_i for all i.

Then, I can set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and since a_{i-1} > x_i, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

This seems promising.

Let me test this.

Set a_1 to be larger than the maximum x_i, which is 500, so set a_1 to be, say, 501.

Then, for each i from 2 to n, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Since a_{i-1} > x_i, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

Let's see with the first example:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Set a_1=501

a_2=501+2=503, 503 mod 501=2, which matches x_2=2

a_3=503+4=507, 507 mod 503=4, which matches x_3=4

a_4=507+1=508, 508 mod 507=1, which matches x_4=1

Perfect.

Another test case:

n=2, x=[500]

Set a_1=501

a_2=501+500=1001, 1001 mod 501=1001-2*501=1001-1002=-1, but modulo should be positive, wait, no.

Wait, in Python, 1001 % 501 is 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, but modulo is usually adjusted to be in the range [0, a_{i-1}).

Wait, in Python, the result of a % b is always >=0 and <b, so 1001 % 501 should be 1001 - 2*501 = -1, but Python adjusts it to be 501 -1 = 500.

Wait, let's check:

1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, then add 501 to make it positive: -1 + 501 = 500.

But in Python, 1001 % 501 is indeed 500.

But x_i=500, which matches.

So, a_2=1001, 1001 % 501=500, which matches x_2=500.

Good.

Another test case:

n=3, x=[1,5]

Set a_1=501

a_2=501+1=502, 502 % 501=1, matches x_2=1

a_3=502+5=507, 507 % 502=5, matches x_3=5

Good.

So, setting a_1 to be larger than the maximum x_i seems to work.

In the program provided, they set a_1=500.

Wait, but x_i can be up to 500, so a_1=500 is not greater than x_i if x_i=500.

So, in that case, if a_{i-1}=500 and x_i=500, then a_i=500 + 500=1000, and 1000 % 500=0, which is not equal to x_i=500.

So, this won't work.

Hence, a_1 should be set to at least 501 to be greater than any x_i.

In the program, they set a_1=500, which might cause issues when x_i=500.

Looking back at the example where n=2 and x=[500], the output is [501,500], which satisfies 500 mod 501=500, which is correct.

So, in the program, they set a_1=500, but in this case, a_1 should be greater than x_2=500, so they set a_1=501.

Wait, in the example, it's [501,500], which is correct.

But in the program, they set a[0]=500.

Wait, that might be a mistake.

Wait, in the program:

a = [0] * n

a[0] = 500

for i in range(1, n):

a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]

print(*a)

So, a_1=500, and a_i=a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}.

If x_i=500, then a_i=500 + 500=1000, and 1000 % 500=0, which is not equal to x_i=500.

Hence, this is incorrect.

So, in this case, the program would output [500,1000], but 1000 % 500=0 !=500.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, to fix this, a_1 should be set to 501, which is greater than any x_i.

Hence, the program should set a[0]=501.

Let me check with n=2, x=[500]:

Set a_1=501

a_2=501 +500=1001

1001 %501=500, which matches x_2=500.

Good.

Another test case:

n=3, x=[1,5]

Set a_1=501

a_2=501+1=502, 502%501=1

a_3=502+5=507, 507%502=5

Good.

Hence, setting a_1=501 seems to work.

In the program, they set a[0]=500, which can cause problems when x_i=500.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, they have a_1=501 for the test case where x_i=500.

So, perhaps in the program, they need to set a[0]=501.

Wait, but in the program, they set a[0]=500.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer should be Correctness: **False**

But let's see if there are other potential issues.

Another approach could be to set a_1 to any value between x_1 and 10^9, but ensuring that a_1 > x_2.

Wait, but in the first step, a_2 mod a_1 = x_2.

So, a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2.

To minimize a_2, set k=0, so a_2 =x_2.

But then a_2 mod a_1 =x_2.

But x_2 < a_1, which is required for a_2 mod a_1 =x_2.

Hence, a_1 must be greater than x_2.

Similarly, a_3 mod a_2 =x_3, so a_2 must be greater than x_3.

Wait, no, a_3 =k * a_2 +x_3, and to have a_3 mod a_2 =x_3, x_3 must be less than a_2.

Hence, a_2 >x_3.

Similarly, a_2 =k * a_1 +x_2, and to have a_2 >x_3.

But this seems complicated.

Hence, the simplest way is to set a_1 greater than all x_i's, which is 501 in this case, since x_i <=500.

Hence, setting a_1=501 ensures that a_1 >x_i for all i, and then setting a_i=a_{i-1} +x_{i-1} for i from 2 to n.

Then, a_i =a_{i-1} +x_{i-1}, and since a_{i-1} >x_{i-1}, a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_{i-1}.

Hence, this works.

Therefore, the program should set a[0]=501, not 500.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to construct an array \( a \) such that for each \( i \) from 2 to \( n \), \( x_i = a_i \mod a_{i-1} \), given the constraints \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq x_i \leq 500 \).

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We need to choose \( a_1 \) such that it is greater than any \( x_i \). Since \( x_i \) can be up to 500, setting \( a_1 = 501 \) ensures \( a_1 > x_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Constructing the Array**:
   - For each \( a_i \) (starting from \( i = 2 \) to \( n \)), set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).
   - This ensures that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \), because \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \) and \( a_{i-1} > x_i \).

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    T = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        x = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n - 1]))
        idx += n - 1
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 501  # Set a1 to 501 to ensure a1 > x_i for all x_i <= 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(' '.join(map(str, a)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Setting \( a_1 \)**:
   - We set \( a_1 = 501 \) to ensure it is greater than any \( x_i \) (since \( x_i \leq 500 \)).

2. **Building the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \( a_i \), we set \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \).
   - This guarantees that \( a_i \mod a_{i-1} = x_i \), because \( a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i \) and \( a_{i-1} > x_i \), making the modulo operation directly yield \( x_i \).

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The algorithm runs in \( O(n) \) time per test case, which is efficient given the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) and the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

This approach ensures that the constructed array \( a \) satisfies all the given conditions efficiently and correctly.
