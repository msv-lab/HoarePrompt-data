Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match this template, but c does not.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. The rules are:

1. If the i-th character of the template is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same.

2. If the i-th character of the template is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's character.

For example, if the template has 'A' at position i, then the string must have any character except 'a' at that position.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match t, but c does not match t.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I need to consider each position from 1 to n and decide whether to make the template's character at that position lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose to make the i-th character of t lowercase, then both a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

If I choose to make the i-th character of t uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- If t[i] is lowercase, say 'x', then a[i] must be 'x', b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

- If t[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then a[i] must not be 'x', b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

So, for each position i, I have two choices: make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider the constraints for each position:

1. If I choose t[i] to be lowercase:

- a[i] must equal t[i]

- b[i] must equal t[i]

- c[i] must not equal t[i]

This means that a[i] and b[i] must be equal, and c[i] must be different from a[i].

2. If I choose t[i] to be uppercase:

- a[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i]

- b[i] must not equal the lowercase of t[i]

- c[i] must equal the lowercase of t[i]

This means that a[i] and b[i] must both be different from the lowercase of t[i], and c[i] must equal the lowercase of t[i].

So, for each position i, I need to choose whether to set t[i] as lowercase or uppercase, based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i], such that the above conditions are satisfied.

Now, I need to check if there exists such a template t for each test case.

Let me look at the example provided to understand better.

Example Input:

4

1

a

b

c

2

aa

bb

aa

10

mathforces

luckforces

adhoccoder

3

acc

abd

abc

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

In the first test case, n=1, a="a", b="b", c="c".

I need to find a template t of length 1 such that a and b match t, but c does not.

Let's consider choosing t="C" (uppercase).

- For a: a[1]='a' must be different from 'c' (lowercase of 'C'), which is true because 'a' != 'c'.

- For b: b[1]='b' must be different from 'c', which is true.

- For c: c[1]='c' must be equal to 'c', which is true.

So, a and b match t, and c does not match t. Hence, YES.

In the second test case, n=2, a="aa", b="bb", c="aa".

Let's try to find a template t.

Let's consider t[1]:

- If t[1] is lowercase, say 'x', then a[1]='a' must equal 'x', b[1]='b' must equal 'x', and c[1]='a' must not equal 'x'.

This would require 'a' == 'x' and 'b' == 'x', which is only possible if 'a' == 'b', but here 'a' != 'b'. So, this is impossible.

- If t[1] is uppercase, say 'X', then a[1]='a' must not equal 'x', b[1]='b' must not equal 'x', and c[1]='a' must equal 'x'.

This would require 'a' != 'x', 'b' != 'x', and 'a' == 'x', which is a contradiction.

Similarly, for t[2]:

- If t[2] is lowercase, say 'y', then a[2]='a' == 'y', b[2]='b' == 'y', and c[2]='a' != 'y'. Again, 'a' == 'y' and 'b' == 'y' implies 'a' == 'b', which is not true.

- If t[2] is uppercase, say 'Y', then a[2]='a' != 'y', b[2]='b' != 'y', and c[2]='a' == 'y'. This would require 'a' != 'y', 'b' != 'y', and 'a' == 'y', which is contradictory.

So, there is no possible template t for this test case, hence NO.

In the third test case, n=10, a="mathforces", b="luckforces", c="adhoccoder".

I need to find a template t of length 10 such that a and b match t, but c does not.

Looking at the positions where a and b differ, for example, position 1: 'm' vs 'l', position 2: 'a' vs 'u', etc.

I need to choose t[i] such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] == b[i], and c[i] != t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase(t[i]), b[i] != lowercase(t[i]), and c[i] == lowercase(t[i]).

Given that a and b can have different characters, I need to see if there's a way to set t[i] appropriately for each position.

In this case, it's possible to construct such a template, as shown in the example output.

In the fourth test case, n=3, a="acc", b="abd", c="abc".

Again, I need to find a template t of length 3.

Let's consider each position:

Position 1:

a[1]='a', b[1]='a', c[1]='a'

If t[1] is lowercase 'x', then:

- a[1] == 'x', b[1] == 'x', c[1] != 'x'

This would require 'a' == 'x', so x='a', and c[1] != 'a', but c[1]='a', which is a contradiction.

If t[1] is uppercase 'X', then:

- a[1] != 'x', b[1] != 'x', c[1] == 'x'

With x='a', this would require 'a' != 'a' and 'a' != 'a', which is false.

Hence, no possible choice for t[1].

So, for this test case, it's impossible, hence NO.

From these examples, I can see that for each position i, the choices for t[i] depend on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to check, for each position, what are the possible choices for t[i], and see if there's a combination where a and b match t, and c does not.

Let me formalize this.

For each position i from 1 to n:

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase 'x'.

- Then, a[i] must equal 'x'

- b[i] must equal 'x'

- c[i] must not equal 'x'

This implies that a[i] == b[i], and a[i] != c[i]

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase 'X'.

- Then, a[i] must not equal 'x' (where x is the lowercase of 'X')

- b[i] must not equal 'x'

- c[i] must equal 'x'

This implies that a[i] != x, b[i] != x, and c[i] == x

So, for each position i, I need to check if either of these two cases can be satisfied based on the values of a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Now, across all positions, I need to choose, for each position, whether to make t[i] lowercase or uppercase, such that all the conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

Wait, but in the given program, it seems to be checking something different.

Let's look at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

l = 'YES'

for i in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = input()

b = input()

c = input()

for i in range(n):

if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:

l = 'YES'

else:

l = 'NO'

print(l)

So, for each test case, it reads n, a, b, c.

Then, it loops through each position i from 0 to n-1.

If it finds any position i where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], it sets l = 'YES', otherwise l = 'NO'.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

In the first test case of the example:

n=1

a='a'

b='b'

c='c'

The loop would check position 0:

a[0] = 'a' != c[0] = 'c' → True

b[0] = 'b' != c[0] = 'c' → True

So, l = 'YES'

Which matches the expected output.

In the second test case:

n=2

a='aa'

b='bb'

c='aa'

Loop through positions 0 and 1.

Position 0:

a[0]='a' != c[0]='a' → False

b[0]='b' != c[0]='a' → True

Since a[0] != c[0] and b[0] != c[0] → False (because a[0] != c[0] is False)

Position 1:

a[1]='a' != c[1]='a' → False

b[1]='b' != c[1]='a' → True

Again, a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1] → False

So, l = 'NO'

Which matches the expected output.

In the third test case:

n=10

a='mathforces'

b='luckforces'

c='adhoccoder'

I need to check each position:

For position 0:

a[0]='m' != c[0]='a' → True

b[0]='l' != c[0]='a' → True

So, l = 'YES'

Which matches the expected output.

In the fourth test case:

n=3

a='acc'

b='abd'

c='abc'

Position 0:

a[0]='a' != c[0]='a' → False

b[0]='a' != c[0]='a' → False

Position 1:

a[1]='c' != c[1]='b' → True

b[1]='b' != c[1]='b' → False

Position 2:

a[2]='c' != c[2]='c' → False

b[2]='d' != c[2]='c' → True

So, only position 1 satisfies a[1] != c[1] and b[1] != c[1] → True and False → False

Position 2: a[2] != c[2] and b[2] != c[2] → False and True → False

Position 0: False and False → False

So, l = 'NO'

Which matches the expected output.

Wait a minute, but is this logic correct?

In the first test case, it correctly identified that there exists a template because there is at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Similarly, in the second test case, there is no such position, hence no template exists.

In the third test case, there is at least one position (position 0) where a[0] != c[0] and b[0] != c[0], so template exists.

In the fourth test case, no such position exists where both a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], hence no template exists.

So, it seems that the program is checking if there exists at least one position where both a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i].

Is this sufficient to guarantee that a template exists?

Let me think about it.

From earlier analysis, for each position, there are two choices: make t[i] lowercase or uppercase.

If I can find at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then I can set t[i] in a way that a and b match t, but c does not.

Wait, is that accurate?

Let me consider the first test case again.

n=1

a='a'

b='b'

c='c'

Here, a[0]='a' != c[0]='c' and b[0]='b' != c[0]='c', so set t[0]='C' (uppercase).

Then:

- a[0]='a' != 'c' (lowercase of t[0])

- b[0]='b' != 'c'

- c[0]='c' == 'c'

So, a and b match t, c does not.

Hence, it works.

In the second test case:

n=2

a='aa'

b='bb'

c='aa'

Position 0:

a[0]='a' != c[0]='a' → False

b[0]='b' != c[0]='a' → True

So, a[0] != c[0] and b[0] != c[0] → False and True → False

Position 1:

a[1]='a' != c[1]='a' → False

b[1]='b' != c[1]='a' → True

Again, False and True → False

Hence, l='NO'

Which is correct because no such template exists.

In the third test case:

n=10

a='mathforces'

b='luckforces'

c='adhoccoder'

Position 0:

a[0]='m' != c[0]='a' → True

b[0]='l' != c[0]='a' → True

So, set t[0] as uppercase 'M' or something else, but in the earlier example, setting t[0]='C' worked.

Wait, in the note, they used t="CODEforces", which has t[0]='C' (uppercase).

Then:

- a[0]='m' != 'c'

- b[0]='l' != 'c'

- c[0]='a' == 'c' (no, 'a' != 'c'), wait, in the note, they set t="C" which is uppercase, so c[0]='c' == 'c', which is correct.

Wait, in the note, they set t="C" for n=1, but in this test case, n=10, and t="CODEforces".

Anyway, the logic seems to hold that if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then it's possible to set t[i] in a way that a and b match t, but c does not.

Is there any case where this logic fails?

Let me think of a scenario where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] at some position, but still, no such template exists.

I need to think carefully.

Suppose n=2

a="ab"

b="ba"

c="cc"

Position 0:

a[0]='a' != c[0]='c' → True

b[0]='b' != c[0]='c' → True

Position 1:

a[1]='b' != c[1]='c' → True

b[1]='a' != c[1]='c' → True

So, for both positions, a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]

Hence, l='YES'

Is this correct?

Yes, because I can set t[0] as uppercase 'A', t[1] as uppercase 'B'.

Then:

- a: 'a' != 'a' (lowercase of 'A') → 'a' != 'a' → False, which is incorrect.

Wait, no.

If t[0] is 'A' (uppercase), then a[0] must not equal 'a', but a[0]='a' == 'a', which violates the condition.

Wait, maybe I need to set t[0] as uppercase 'B', so a[0]='a' != 'b', b[0]='b' != 'b' → 'b' != 'b' is False.

This doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I need to set t[0] as uppercase 'C'.

Then:

- a[0]='a' != 'c'

- b[0]='b' != 'c'

- c[0]='c' == 'c'

This works for position 0.

Similarly, set t[1] as uppercase 'D'.

- a[1]='b' != 'd'

- b[1]='a' != 'd'

- c[1]='c' == 'd' → 'c' != 'd', which is not matching.

Wait, c[1]='c' != 'd', so c does not match.

Wait, but according to the rules, if t[1] is 'D' (uppercase), then c[1] must equal 'd', but 'c' != 'd', so c does not match.

Wait, no. If t[1] is 'D' (uppercase), then c[1] must equal 'd', but 'c' != 'd', so c does not match.

Hence, it's correct.

So, in this case, setting t="CD" works.

Hence, the logic holds.

Another example:

n=3

a="abc"

b="abd"

c="abe"

Position 0:

a[0]='a' != c[0]='a' → False

b[0]='a' != c[0]='a' → False

Position 1:

a[1]='b' != c[1]='b' → False

b[1]='b' != c[1]='b' → False

Position 2:

a[2]='c' != c[2]='e' → True

b[2]='d' != c[2]='e' → True

So, position 2 satisfies a[2] != c[2] and b[2] != c[2]

Hence, l='YES'

Is this correct?

Yes, because I can set t[2] as uppercase 'F', so:

- a[2]='c' != 'f'

- b[2]='d' != 'f'

- c[2]='e' != 'f'

Wait, but according to the rules, if t[2] is 'F' (uppercase), then c[2] must equal 'f', but 'e' != 'f', so c does not match.

Hence, it's correct.

Wait, but in this case, a and b both have characters different from 'f', and c has 'e' != 'f', so c does not match.

Wait, but according to the rules, for t[i] uppercase, c[i] must equal the lowercase of t[i], which is 'f', but c[i]='e' != 'f', so c does not match.

Hence, it's correct.

So, it seems that if there exists at least one position where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], then it's possible to set t[i] in a way that a and b match t, and c does not.

Is there any case where this logic fails?

Let me think of a case where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i] at some position, but no such template exists.

I'm having trouble coming up with such a case. It seems that whenever there is at least one position where both a[i] and b[i] differ from c[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase of some character that c[i] equals, and set other positions accordingly.

Hence, perhaps the program's logic is correct.

But let's think about the general case.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i].

Then, a and b match because a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i], and c does not match because c[i] != t[i].

For positions where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], but a[i] != b[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase of a character that is not equal to a[i] and b[i], but c[i] must equal that lowercase character.

Wait, no. If I set t[i] as uppercase 'X', then a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

So, I need to choose 'x' such that c[i] == 'x' and a[i] != 'x' and b[i] != 'x'.

Hence, for positions where a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i], I can set t[i] as uppercase with c[i] in uppercase.

Then, a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], and c[i] == c[i], so c does not match.

Wait, no. If t[i] is uppercase 'X', then c[i] must equal 'x', which is lowercase of 'X'.

So, t[i] should be uppercase of c[i].

Then, a[i] != c[i], b[i] != c[i], which is satisfied.

Hence, it works.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] == c[i], I cannot set any t[i] to satisfy the conditions.

For positions where a[i] == b[i] != c[i], I can set t[i] as lowercase a[i].

For positions where a[i] != b[i], I need to
