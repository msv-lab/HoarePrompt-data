Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n houses in a village, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference for which side they want to live on, represented by a sequence of 0s and 1s, where 0 means they want to live on the left side and 1 means the right side.

The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. The goal is to place the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with their side. In other words, for the left side, at least half of the residents there should want to be on the left (i.e., have a 0), and similarly for the right side, at least half should want to be on the right (have a 1).

Moreover, among all possible positions where this condition is satisfied, we need to choose the position that is as close as possible to the middle of the village. If there are multiple positions that are equally close to the middle, we should choose the smallest position number.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's consider an example to grasp what's being asked.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 3

a = 101

Possible road positions:

- Before the first house: position 0

- Between house 1 and 2: position 1

- Between house 2 and 3: position 2

- After the last house: position 3

Let's evaluate each position:

1. Position 0:

- Left side: no houses

- Right side: houses 1,0,1

- For left side: no residents, so condition trivially satisfied.

- For right side: need at least ceil(3/2) = 2 residents wanting right side. In a=[1,0,1], two residents want right side (1s), so condition satisfied.

- Distance from middle: |3/2 - 0| = 1.5

2. Position 1:

- Left side: house 1 (1)

- Right side: houses 0,1

- Left side: 1 resident wanting right side. Need at least ceil(1/2)=1 resident satisfied. Since only one resident and they want right, condition satisfied.

- Right side: two residents, one wants left (0) and one wants right (1). Need at least ceil(2/2)=1 resident satisfied. Only one (the 1) is satisfied, so condition satisfied.

- Distance from middle: |1.5 - 1| = 0.5

3. Position 2:

- Left side: houses 1,0

- Right side: house 1

- Left side: two residents, one wants right (1), one wants left (0). Need at least ceil(2/2)=1 satisfied. The 0 is satisfied, so condition satisfied.

- Right side: one resident wants right (1). Need at least ceil(1/2)=1 satisfied. Condition satisfied.

- Distance from middle: |1.5 - 2| = 0.5

4. Position 3:

- Left side: houses 1,0,1

- Right side: no houses

- Left side: three residents, two want right (1s), one wants left (0). Need at least ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied. Two 1s are satisfied, so condition satisfied.

- Right side: no residents, condition trivially satisfied.

- Distance from middle: |1.5 - 3| = 1.5

So, positions 1 and 2 are both valid, and both have the same minimum distance from the middle. According to the problem, we should choose the smaller position number, which is position 1.

Wait, but in the sample input and output, for this case, the output is 2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's double-check:

At position 1:

- Left side: house 1 (wants right), which is satisfied.

- Right side: houses 0 and 1. Among them, one wants left (0) and one wants right (1). So, at least one is satisfied, which is the 1.

- So, both sides satisfy the condition.

At position 2:

- Left side: houses 1 and 0. Among them, one wants right (1) and one wants left (0). At least one is satisfied (the 0).

- Right side: house 1, which wants right, so satisfied.

- Both sides satisfy the condition.

Distance from middle for both positions is |1.5 - 1| = 0.5 and |1.5 - 2| = 0.5.

According to the problem, we should choose the smaller position number, which is 1. But the sample output is 2. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem wants the road to be after the house, not before. Let me read the problem again.

"It is guaranteed that the answer always exists."

"Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

"Formally, among all suitable positions i, minimize |n/2 - i|."

"If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum |n/2 - i|, output the smaller one."

Wait, in the first sample input, n=3, a=101, and the output is 2.

Wait, perhaps position 2 is chosen over position 1 because position 2 is closer to the middle in some interpretation.

Wait, n=3, middle is at position 1.5. Position 1 is at distance 0.5, position 2 is at distance 0.5. So both are equally distant.

But according to the problem, if multiple positions have the same distance, choose the smaller one. So should choose position 1. But sample output is 2.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says "the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

"the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

Wait, perhaps the condition is to minimize |n/2 - i|, and among those, choose the smallest i.

But in the sample input, it's choosing position 2 instead of position 1, both have the same distance.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the positions.

Wait, maybe position 0 is before the first house, position 1 is between first and second house, position 2 is between second and third house, and position 3 is after the last house.

So, positions are 0,1,2,3 for n=3.

In this case, position 1 is between house 1 and 2, position 2 is between house 2 and 3.

So, positions 1 and 2 are both valid, both at distance 0.5 from the middle (n/2=1.5).

According to the problem, among positions with the same distance, choose the smaller one, which is position 1.

But sample output is 2, not 1.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting positions.

Wait, perhaps position 0 is before house 1, position 1 is after house 1, position 2 is after house 2, position 3 is after house 3.

Wait, need to clarify how positions are counted.

The problem says: "The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1. Then the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively."

So, positions are from 0 to n.

Position 0: road before first house, all houses on right side.

Position 1: road after first house, first house on left, remaining on right.

...

Position n: road after last house, all houses on left side.

So, for n=3:

- position 0: left side empty, right side houses 1,0,1

- position 1: left side house 1, right side houses 0,1

- position 2: left side houses 1,0, right side house 1

- position 3: left side houses 1,0,1, right side empty

Now, in the sample input, n=3, a=101, and output is 2.

Let's see:

- position 0: left side empty (condition satisfied trivially), right side has houses wanting 1,0,1. So, number of residents wanting right is 2 (positions 1 and 3), total residents is 3. ceil(3/2)=2, so at least 2 satisfied, which is exactly 2. So, condition satisfied.

- position 1: left side house 1 (wants right), which is satisfied. right side houses 0,1: one wants left, one wants right. So, at least one satisfied, which is the house wanting right. ceil(2/2)=1, so condition satisfied.

- position 2: left side houses 1,0: one wants right, one wants left. At least one satisfied (the 0). right side house 1: wants right, which is satisfied.

- position 3: left side houses 1,0,1: two want right, one wants left. At least ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied. right side empty: condition satisfied trivially.

So, positions 0,1,2,3 are all valid.

Now, we need to choose the position closest to n/2=1.5.

Positions 1 and 2 are both at distance 0.5 from 1.5.

Among positions 1 and 2, choose the smaller one, which is 1.

But sample output is 2, not 1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the positions are indexed differently.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

"the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

"Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

Wait, perhaps position 0 is after no house, meaning before the first house.

Position 1 is after house 1, position 2 is after house 2, position 3 is after house 3.

So, positions are 0,1,2,3.

In this case, positions 1 and 2 are both valid, both at distance 0.5 from the middle.

According to the problem, among these, choose the smaller one, which is 1.

But sample output is 2, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in the problem statement, for n=3, a=101, output is 2.

But according to my earlier reasoning, positions 1 and 2 are both valid, and position 1 should be chosen.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "minimize |n/2 - i|."

Wait, n is 3, so n/2 is 1.5.

Position 1: |1.5 - 1| = 0.5

Position 2: |1.5 - 2| = 0.5

So, both have the same distance.

According to the problem, among these, choose the smaller i, which is 1.

But sample output is 2, not 1.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the positions are numbered differently.

Wait, perhaps position i means the road is between house i and i+1, with position 0 being before house 1, position 1 between house 1 and 2, ..., position n after house n.

In this case, for n=3:

- position 0: left side empty, right side houses 1,0,1

- position 1: left side house 1, right side houses 0,1

- position 2: left side houses 1,0, right side house 1

- position 3: left side houses 1,0,1, right side empty

All positions are valid, positions 1 and 2 are both at distance 0.5 from n/2=1.5, so choose the smaller one, which is 1.

But sample output is 2, which suggests that perhaps position 1 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming all positions are valid.

Wait, in position 1:

left side: house 1 (wants right), which is satisfied.

right side: houses 0 and 1.

Among these, house 0 wants left, house 1 wants right.

So, number of residents on right side is 2, ceil(2/2)=1.

Number of satisfied residents on right side is 1 (the house wanting right).

So, condition is satisfied.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's choosing position 2, not position 1.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, but in position 1, the left side has one resident wanting right, which is satisfied, and the right side has one satisfied out of two, which is exactly half.

But the problem says "at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice."

Wait, "at least half" means at least ceil(x/2), where x is the number of residents on that side.

For the right side in position 1: x=2, ceil(2/2)=1, and one is satisfied.

So, condition is satisfied.

Wait, maybe the problem is that in position 1, the left side has one resident wanting right, which is satisfied, but the right side has one resident wanting left and one wanting right.

So, at least one is satisfied, which is okay.

But perhaps the problem expects position 2, meaning position 1 is invalid for some reason.

Wait, but according to my reasoning, position 1 is valid.

Wait, maybe I need to look at another sample input to see if I'm missing something.

Let's look at the second sample input:

n=6

a=010111

Possible positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

Let's check position 3:

left side: houses 0,1,0 (positions 1,2,3)

right side: houses 1,1,1 (positions 4,5,6)

left side: three houses, two want left, one wants right.

Need ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied.

Two houses wanting left are satisfied, so condition satisfied.

right side: three houses, all want right, all are satisfied.

So, condition satisfied.

Distance from middle: n/2=3, position 3, |3-3|=0.

Is this the closest possible? Let's check other positions.

Position 2:

left side: houses 0,1 (positions 1,2)

right side: houses 0,1,1,1 (positions 3,4,5,6)

left side: two houses, one wants left, one wants right.

Need ceil(2/2)=1 satisfied.

One house wanting left is satisfied.

right side: four houses, three want right, one wants left.

Need ceil(4/2)=2 satisfied.

Three houses wanting right are satisfied, so condition satisfied.

Distance from middle: |3-2|=1.

Position 3 is closer, so position 3 is better.

But sample output is 3, which matches.

Another sample input:

n=6

a=011001

Possible positions: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6

Position 2:

left side: houses 0,1 (positions 1,2)

right side: houses 1,0,0,1 (positions 3,4,5,6)

left side: two houses, one wants left, one wants right.

Need ceil(2/2)=1 satisfied.

One house wanting left is satisfied.

right side: four houses, two want left, two want right.

Need ceil(4/2)=2 satisfied.

Two houses wanting right are satisfied.

So, condition satisfied.

Distance from middle: |3-2|=1.

Position 3:

left side: houses 0,1,1,0 (positions 1,2,3,4)

right side: houses 0,1 (positions 5,6)

left side: four houses, two want left, two want right.

Need ceil(4/2)=2 satisfied.

Two houses wanting left are satisfied.

right side: two houses, one wants left, one wants right.

Need ceil(2/2)=1 satisfied.

One house wanting right is satisfied.

So, condition satisfied.

Distance from middle: |3-3|=0.

So, position 3 is better than position 2.

Sample output is 2, but according to this, position 3 is better.

Wait, sample output is 2, but according to my reasoning, position 3 is better.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in this case, position 2 and position 3 are both valid, but position 3 is closer to the middle.

But sample output is 2, which suggests that position 3 is not considered valid or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to look back at the problem statement.

"among all suitable positions i, minimize |n/2 - i|."

"If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum |n/2 - i|, output the smaller one."

In this case, position 3 is closer to n/2=3, with distance 0, whereas position 2 has distance 1.

So, should choose position 3, but sample output is 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the road position i is after house i, so position 2 means after house 2, meaning left side is houses 1 and 2, right side is houses 3 to 6.

Wait, in this case, position 2 corresponds to left side houses 1 and 2, right side houses 3 to 6.

For n=6, middle is at position 3.

Positions 2 and 3 are both valid, but position 3 is closer to the middle.

So, why is the sample output 2?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the positions are numbered differently.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

"Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible."

"Formally, among all suitable positions i, minimize |n/2 - i|."

"If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum |n/2 - i|, output the smaller one."

Wait, perhaps it's minimizing |n/2 - i|, not |n/2 - position|.

Wait, n/2 is 3, position 2 is at distance 1 from 3, position 3 is at distance 0.

So, position 3 is better than position 2.

But sample output is 2, not 3.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting i.

Wait, perhaps i is the number of houses on the left side.

So, for position 0: 0 houses on left.

Position 1: 1 house on left.

Position 2: 2 houses on left.

Position 3: 3 houses on left.

Position 4: 4 houses on left.

Position 5: 5 houses on left.

Position 6: 6 houses on left.

So, for position 2: 2 houses on left, 4 on right.

For n=6, n/2=3.

|3 - 2| = 1.

For position 3: 3 houses on left, 3 on right.

|3 - 3| = 0.

So, position 3 is better than position 2.

But sample output is 2, which suggests that position 3 is invalid for some reason.

Wait, perhaps in position 3, the left side has houses 0,1,1 (positions 1,2,3).

Among them, two want left and one wants right.

Need ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied.

Two houses wanting left are satisfied.

Right side: houses 0,0,1 (positions 4,5,6).

Two want left, one wants right.

Need ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied.

Only one house wanting right is satisfied, which is less than 2.

So, condition is not satisfied.

Hence, position 3 is invalid.

Therefore, position 2 is chosen.

Wait, so in position 3:

left side: houses 0,1,1 (positions 1,2,3).

Wants: 0 wants left, 1 wants right, 1 wants right.

So, two want left, one wants right.

At least ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied on left side (the two wanting left).

right side: houses 0,0,1 (positions 4,5,6).

Wants: 0 wants left, 0 wants left, 1 wants right.

Need at least ceil(3/2)=2 satisfied on right side.

Only one house wanting right is satisfied.

So, right side does not meet the condition.

Hence, position 3 is invalid.

Therefore, position 2 is chosen, which is valid and has distance 1 from n/2=3.

So, in the first sample input, n=3, a=101, positions 0,1,2,3 are all valid.

Positions 1 and 2 are both at distance 0.5 from n/2=1.5, so choose the smaller one, which is 1.

But sample output is 2, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in position 1:

left side: house 1 (wants right), which is satisfied.

right side: houses 0 and 1.

Among them, one wants left, one wants right.

So, at least one is satisfied.

But perhaps the problem requires that on the right side, at least ceil((n-i)/2) are satisfied.

Wait, in position 1: i=1, n-i=2.

ceil(2/2)=1.

So, at least one satisfied on right side, which is the house wanting right.

So, condition satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the condition more carefully.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"among x residents on one side, at least ceil(x/2) wants to live on that side."

Wait, more precisely:

"at least ceil(x/2) residents on each side are satisfied with their side."

In the first sample input, for position 1:

left side: x=1, ceil(1/2)=1, one resident wanting right is satisfied.

right side: x=2, ceil(2/2)=1, one resident wanting right is satisfied.

So, condition satisfied.

For position 2:

left side: x=2, ceil(2/2)=1, one resident wanting left is satisfied.

right side: x=1, ceil(1/2)=1, one resident wanting right is satisfied.

Condition satisfied.

So, both positions 1 and 2 are valid, both at distance 0.5 from n/2=1.5, so choose the smaller one, which is 1.

But sample output is 2, which suggests that perhaps position 1 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that on the left side, at least ceil(l/2) residents want left, and on the right side, at least ceil(r/2) residents want right, where l and r are the number of houses on each side.

Wait, in position 1:

left side: l=1, ceil(1/2)=1,
