Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have a village with n houses, and the villagers want to build a big road that divides the village into left and right sides. Each resident has a preference: they want to live on either the left (0) or the right (1) side of the road.

The road can be built between any two houses, or before the first house or after the last house. So, possible positions for the road are before house 1, between house 1 and 2, ..., between house n-1 and n, or after house n.

Each side needs to have at least half of its residents satisfied with their side. Satisfied means their preferred side matches the side they are on.

We need to choose the position for the road such that this condition is satisfied, and among all such positions, choose the one where the road is as close as possible to the middle of the village. If there are multiple positions with the same minimum distance to the middle, we choose the smaller position.

Input:

- t test cases

- For each test case:

- n: number of houses

- a string of length n consisting of 0s and 1s, where each character represents a resident's preference.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 2×10^4

- n ≤ 3×10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 3×10^5

Output:

For each test case, output a single number i, which is the position after which the road should be built. If the road should be built before the first house, output 0.

Guaranteed that the answer always exists.

Example is provided, and I should make sure my solution matches that.

First, I need to understand the problem deeply.

We have houses in a sequence, each with a preference 0 or 1.

We need to choose a position to build the road such that:

1. At least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied (want 0).

2. At least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied (want 1).

And among all such positions, choose the one closest to the middle of the village, i.e., minimize |n/2 - i|, and if there are multiple, choose the smallest i.

Let's consider what needs to be done.

First, for each possible position i (from 0 to n), where i is the position after house i, so:

- Left side: houses 1 to i

- Right side: houses i+1 to n

For i=0: entire village is on the right side.

For i=n: entire village is on the left side.

For positions in between, split accordingly.

For each possible i, check if:

- On the left side (houses 1 to i):

- Number of 0s ≥ ceil(i / 2)

- On the right side (houses i+1 to n):

- Number of 1s ≥ ceil((n - i) / 2)

If both conditions are satisfied, then i is a candidate.

Among all candidate i, choose the one with minimum |n/2 - i|.

If multiple, choose the smallest i.

First, I need to iterate through all possible positions i from 0 to n and check the conditions.

But given the constraints, t ≤ 2e4 and n ≤ 3e5, with sum of n over all test cases ≤ 3e5, I need an efficient solution.

If I naively iterate through all positions for each test case, it would be O(n*t), which could be up to 6e8 operations, which is too slow.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about how to optimize this.

First, observe that as i increases, the left side grows, and the right side shrinks.

I can precompute prefix sums for 0s and 1s.

Let's define:

- prefix_zero[i]: number of 0s in houses 1 to i

- prefix_one[i]: number of 1s in houses 1 to i

Then, for a given position i:

- Left side: houses 1 to i

- Number of 0s: prefix_zero[i]

- Number of houses: i

- So, condition: prefix_zero[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

- Right side: houses i+1 to n

- Number of 1s: prefix_one[n] - prefix_one[i]

- Number of houses: n - i

- So, condition: prefix_one[n] - prefix_one[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

I need both conditions to be true.

Now, to optimize, I need a way to find all i that satisfy both conditions without checking each i individually.

Let me think about the conditions more closely.

First, for the left side:

prefix_zero[i] >= ceil(i / 2)

Which is equivalent to:

prefix_zero[i] >= (i + 1) // 2

Similarly, for the right side:

prefix_one[n] - prefix_one[i] >= ceil((n - i) / 2)

Which is equivalent to:

prefix_one[n] - prefix_one[i] >= (n - i + 1) // 2

I need to find all i where both these inequalities hold.

Now, I need to find the minimal |n/2 - i| among such i.

If multiple, choose the smallest i.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n) per test case solution or better.

Let me think about how to find the range of i that satisfy both conditions.

Maybe I can find the minimal i that satisfies both conditions and the maximal i that satisfies both conditions, and then find the i within that range that is closest to n/2.

But I need to make sure that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously.

Alternatively, since n can be up to 3e5 and t up to 2e4, but sum of n over all test cases is ≤ 3e5, I can afford O(n) per test case.

Let me think about a sliding window approach or two pointers.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal i where the left side condition is satisfied, and the maximal i where the right side condition is satisfied, and find the intersection.

But actually, the left and right side conditions are dependent on i, so I need to find i where both are true.

Let me consider iterating i from 0 to n and keeping track of the cumulative sums.

I can precompute prefix_zero and prefix_one.

Then, for each i from 0 to n:

left_satisfied = (prefix_zero[i] >= (i + 1) // 2)

right_satisfied = (prefix_one[n] - prefix_one[i] >= (n - i + 1) // 2)

if both are true, then i is a candidate.

Among all candidate i, find the one with minimal |n/2 - i|, and if ties, choose the smallest i.

But as mentioned earlier, this would be O(n) per test case, which is too slow for t=2e4 and n=3e5.

Wait, but the sum of n over all test cases is ≤ 3e5, so total time would be O(3e5), which is acceptable.

So perhaps the initial code is correct, and I just need to implement it efficiently.

But let's check the provided code to see if it matches this logic.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

input_string = input()

arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]

z = arr.count(0)

o = arr.count(1)

z_r = z

o_r = o

z_l = 0

o_l = 0

(dist, ans, pos) = (abs(n / 2), 0, 0)

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:

b_d = dist

else:

b_d = 30001

for i in arr:

pos += 1

if i == 0:

z_l += 1

z_r -= 1

else:

o_l += 1

o_r -= 1

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos):

ans = pos

b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)

print(ans)

t -= 1

So, in this code:

- It reads t, then for each test case, reads n and the string.

- Converts the string to an array arr of integers 0 and 1.

- Counts z (number of 0s) and o (number of 1s).

- Initializes z_r = z, o_r = o, z_l = 0, o_l = 0.

- Sets dist = |n / 2|, ans = 0, pos = 0.

- If o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, sets b_d = dist, else b_d = 30001.

- Then iterates through arr:

- pos increases by 1 each time (position after house pos).

- If arr[i] == 0, z_l +=1, z_r -=1

- Else, o_l +=1, o_r -=1

- Checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos):

- If yes, sets ans = pos and b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)

- Finally, prints ans.

Wait, there are a few things to note here.

First, in the initialization:

dist = abs(n / 2)

But n / 2 is likely to be a float, and abs is redundant here since n >= 3.

Then, it checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, which is the condition for the right side when i=0 (entire village on right side).

If this condition is true, set b_d = dist, else set b_d = 30001, which seems like a large value for comparison.

Then, it iterates through the array, updating z_l and o_l based on the current house, and z_r and o_r accordingly.

For each position pos (from 1 to n), it checks if:

- o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 (right side condition)

- z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 (left side condition)

- and if the current distance is better than b_d

If so, update ans and b_d.

Finally, print ans.

Now, let's see if this logic is correct.

First, for i=0:

- Left side: 0 houses

- Right side: all n houses

- z_l = 0

- o_l = 0

- z_r = z

- o_r = o

- Check if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2

- If yes, set b_d = |n / 2 - 0| = n / 2

Else, set b_d = 30001

Then, iterate pos from 1 to n:

- For each pos, update z_l and o_l based on arr[pos-1] (since pos starts from 1)

- Update z_r and o_r accordingly

- Check if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2

- If yes and if |n / 2 - pos| < b_d, then set ans = pos and b_d = |n / 2 - pos|

Finally, print ans.

Wait, but in the code, it's using b_d to keep track of the best distance found so far.

But in the initialization, for i=0, it checks if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2, which is the condition for the right side when all houses are on the right.

If this condition is true, it sets b_d = dist, which is |n / 2 - 0| = n / 2

Else, sets b_d = 30001, which is a large value.

Then, in the loop, for pos from 1 to n, it checks the conditions for i=pos, and if better distance, updates ans and b_d.

So, it seems to be considering i=0 separately, and then i from 1 to n in the loop.

But in the loop, pos starts from 1 to n, corresponding to i=1 to i=n.

Wait, in the problem, i is the position after house i.

So, i=0: before first house

i=1: after first house

...

i=n: after last house

In the code, pos from 1 to n corresponds to i=1 to i=n.

But i=0 is handled separately.

Wait, in the code, i=0 is handled in the initialization:

if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:

b_d = dist

else:

b_d = 30001

Then, in the loop, pos from 1 to n corresponds to i=1 to i=n.

But in the problem, i can be from 0 to n.

So, the code seems to handle i=0 separately, setting b_d to n/2 if the condition for i=0 is satisfied, else to a large value.

Then, in the loop, it checks i from 1 to n, and if conditions are satisfied and the distance is better, it updates ans and b_d.

Finally, it prints ans, which would be the best position among i=0 to i=n.

Seems correct.

But in the problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so ans will always be set.

Now, let's check with the example:

Input:

7

101

6

010111

6

011001

3

000

3

110

3

001

4

1100

Output:

2

3

3

0

1

0

Let's take the first test case:

n=3, a="101"

So, arr = [1,0,1]

For i=0:

Right side: houses 1,2,3: a[0],a[1],a[2] = 1,0,1

Number of 1s = 2, total houses = 3

ceil(3/2) = 2, so 2 >= 2, condition satisfied.

Left side: 0 houses, so condition trivially satisfied.

So, i=0 is a candidate with distance |3/2 - 0| = 1.5

For i=1:

Left side: house 1: a[0]=1, which is 1, but wants to be on right side, so not satisfied.

Number of 0s on left side = 0, number of houses =1, ceil(1/2)=1, so 0 < 1, condition not satisfied.

So, i=1 is invalid.

For i=2:

Left side: houses 1,2: a[0]=1, a[1]=0

Number of 0s =1, number of houses =2, ceil(2/2)=1, so 1 >=1, condition satisfied.

Right side: house 3: a[2]=1

Number of 1s=1, number of houses=1, ceil(1/2)=1, so 1 >=1, condition satisfied.

So, i=2 is a candidate with distance |3/2 -2|=|1.5-2|=0.5

For i=3:

Left side: houses 1,2,3: a[0]=1, a[1]=0, a[2]=1

Number of 0s=1, number of houses=3, ceil(3/2)=2, so 1 <2, condition not satisfied.

So, only i=0 and i=2 are valid candidates.

Among them, i=2 has smaller distance (0.5 < 1.5), so output is 2.

Which matches the first output in the example.

Another test case:

n=6, a=010111

For i=0:

Right side: all 6 houses: a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=0, a[3]=1, a[4]=1, a[5]=1

Number of 1s=4, ceil(6/2)=3, 4 >=3, condition satisfied.

Left side: 0 houses, condition trivially satisfied.

Distance |6/2 -0|=3.0

For i=1:

Left side: house 1: a[0]=0, which wants 0, number of 0s=1, number of houses=1, ceil(1/2)=1, 1>=1.

Right side: houses 2-6: a[1]=1, a[2]=0, a[3]=1, a[4]=1, a[5]=1

Number of 1s=4, number of houses=5, ceil(5/2)=3, 4>=3.

So, both conditions satisfied, distance |3 -1|=2.0

For i=2:

Left side: houses 1,2: a[0]=0, a[1]=1

Number of 0s=1, number of houses=2, ceil(2/2)=1, 1>=1.

Right side: houses 3-6: a[2]=0, a[3]=1, a[4]=1, a[5]=1

Number of 1s=3, number of houses=4, ceil(4/2)=2, 3>=2.

Both conditions satisfied, distance |3 -2|=1.0

For i=3:

Left side: houses 1-3: a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=0

Number of 0s=2, number of houses=3, ceil(3/2)=2, 2>=2.

Right side: houses 4-6: a[3]=1, a[4]=1, a[5]=1

Number of 1s=3, number of houses=3, ceil(3/2)=2, 3>=2.

Both conditions satisfied, distance |3 -3|=0.0

For i=4:

Left side: houses 1-4: a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=0, a[3]=1

Number of 0s=2, number of houses=4, ceil(4/2)=2, 2>=2.

Right side: houses 5-6: a[4]=1, a[5]=1

Number of 1s=2, number of houses=2, ceil(2/2)=1, 2>=1.

Both conditions satisfied, distance |3 -4|=1.0

For i=5:

Left side: houses 1-5: a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=0, a[3]=1, a[4]=1

Number of 0s=2, number of houses=5, ceil(5/2)=3, 2<3.

Condition not satisfied.

For i=6:

Left side: all 6 houses: a[0]=0, a[1]=1, a[2]=0, a[3]=1, a[4]=1, a[5]=1

Number of 0s=2, number of houses=6, ceil(6/2)=3, 2<3.

Condition not satisfied.

So, valid i are 0,1,2,3,4.

Among them, i=3 has the smallest distance |3-3|=0.0, so output is 3.

Which matches the second output in the example.

Another test case:

n=3, a=000

For i=0:

Right side: all 3 houses: a[0]=0, a[1]=0, a[2]=0

Number of 1s=0, ceil(3/2)=2, 0<2, condition not satisfied.

For i=1:

Left side: house 1: a[0]=0, number of 0s=1, ceil(1/2)=1, 1>=1.

Right side: houses 2,3: a[1]=0, a[2]=0

Number of 1s=0, ceil(2/2)=1, 0<1, condition not satisfied.

For i=2:

Left side: houses 1,2: a[0]=0, a[1]=0, number of 0s=2, ceil(2/2)=1, 2>=1.

Right side: house 3: a[2]=0

Number of 1s=0, ceil(1/2)=1, 0<1, condition not satisfied.

For i=3:

Left side: all 3 houses: a[0]=0, a[1]=0, a[2]=0

Number of 0s=3, ceil(3/2)=2, 3>=2.

Right side: no houses, condition trivially satisfied.

Distance |3/2 -3|=1.5

So, only i=3 is valid, so output is 3.

Which matches the fourth output in the example.

Another test case:

n=3, a=110

For i=0:

Right side: all 3 houses: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=0

Number of 1s=2, ceil(3/2)=2, 2>=2.

Left side: 0 houses, condition trivially satisfied.

Distance |1.5 -0|=1.5

For i=1:

Left side: house 1: a[0]=1, which is 1, wants right side, but on left side, not satisfied.

Number of 0s=0, number of houses=1, ceil(1/2)=1, 0<1, condition not satisfied.

For i=2:

Left side: houses 1,2: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, number of 0s=0, ceil(2/2)=1, 0<1.

Condition not satisfied.

For i=3:

Left side: all 3 houses: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=0

Number of 0s=0, ceil(3/2)=2, 0<2.

Condition not satisfied.

Wait, but according to the example, output is 0, which corresponds to i=0.

But in my analysis, for i=0, conditions are satisfied.

So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for i=0, right side has a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=0

Number of 1s=2, ceil(3/2)=2, 2>=2.

Left side has 0 houses, condition trivially satisfied.

So, i=0 is valid with distance 1.5

For i=1:

Left side: house 1: a[0]=1, which is 1, but on left side, wants right side, so not satisfied.

Number of 0s=0, ceil(1/2)=1, 0<1, condition not satisfied.

For i=2:

Left side: houses 1,2: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, number of 0s=0, ceil(2/2)=1, 0<1.

Condition not satisfied.

For i=3:

Left side: houses 1,2,3: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=0, number of 0s=0, ceil(3/2)=2, 0<2.

Condition not satisfied.

So, only i=0 is valid, so output is 0.

Which matches the fifth output in the example.

Another test case:

n=3, a=001

For i=0:

Right side: all 3 houses: a[0]=0, a[1]=0, a[2]=1

Number of 1s=1, ceil(3/2)=2, 1<2, condition not satisfied.

For i=1:

Left side: house 1: a[0]=0, number of 0s=1, ceil(1/2)=1, 1>=1.

Right side: houses 2,3: a[1]=0, a[2]=1

Number of 1s=1, ceil(2/2)=1, 1>=1.

Both conditions satisfied, distance |1.5 -1|=0.5

For i=2:

Left side: houses 1,2: a[0]=0, a[1]=0, number of 0s=2, ceil(2/2)=1, 2>=1.

Right side: house 3: a[2]=1, number of 1s=1, ceil(1
