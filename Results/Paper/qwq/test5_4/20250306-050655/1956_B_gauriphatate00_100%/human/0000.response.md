Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there's a card game with 2n cards, each card has an integer from 1 to n, and each integer appears exactly twice. The cards are distributed between me and Nene, each getting n cards.

Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, and we do this n times each, so total 2n turns. On each turn, the player selects one card from their hand, looks at the number x on it, and places it on the table. If there's already a card with number x on the table, the player gets a point.

Nene is smart and plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in maximizing her points, she minimizes my points.

Given my cards, I need to find out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics.

There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing twice. Me and Nene each have n cards.

During the game, we take turns placing one card at a time, starting with me. So, I play, then Nene, then me, and so on, until all cards are played.

Each time a card is played, if there's already a card with the same number on the table, the player gets a point.

Nene plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she minimizes my points.

I need to play optimally to maximize my points, knowing that Nene is also playing optimally.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since Nene is playing optimally against me, I need to consider her strategy as well.

Let's consider that for each number from 1 to n, there are two cards with that number.

I have some cards in my hand, and Nene has the remaining ones.

I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize my points, considering that Nene is also trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me think about what determines whether I get a point or not.

I get a point if, when I play a card, there's already a card with the same number on the table.

Similarly, Nene gets a point if, when she plays a card, there's already a card with the same number on the table.

So, the key is to control when the second card of each number is played.

If I play the second card of a number, I get a point.

Similarly, if Nene plays the second card of a number, she gets a point.

But, since Nene is playing optimally and wants to maximize her points and minimize mine, she will try to play the second card of a number whenever possible, unless it benefits me more.

Wait, no. She wants to maximize her points first, and minimize mine second.

So, she will prioritize playing the second card of a number to get her point, but if she has a choice between playing a card that gives her a point or one that doesn't, she'll choose the one that gives her a point.

Moreover, if she has a choice between two cards that both give her a point, she'll choose the one that minimizes my points.

Wait, but in reality, her choices might be more complex.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's consider that the game is turn-based, with perfect information, since all cards played are on the table and visible to both players.

This seems like a deterministic game, and we can model it as a game tree where each node represents the state of the game, including the cards on the table and the cards in each player's hand.

But, with n up to 2*10^5, this approach is too slow. So, I need a smarter way.

Let me think in terms of the numbers and their pairs.

Each number from 1 to n has two cards. I have some of them, Nene has the others.

For each number, if both cards are in my hand, then I can play them in two turns, and the second one will give me a point.

If one card is in my hand and one in Nene's, then depending on the order we play them, either I or Nene can get the point.

So, for each number, there are two scenarios:

1. Both cards are in my hand.

In this case, I can arrange to play the second one after the first one is on the table, so I get a point.

2. One card is in my hand, and one is in Nene's.

In this case, the order in which we play the cards determines who gets the point.

Nene, being optimal, will try to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, in this scenario, I need to consider how Nene will play.

Let me categorize the numbers based on who has the two cards.

- If I have both cards, I can get one point.

- If Nene has both cards, she can get one point.

- If one card is mine and one is Nene's, then it depends on the play order.

But wait, the problem is only asking for my maximum possible points assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, for the numbers where I have both cards, I can definitely get one point.

For the numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other, it's unclear without considering the sequence.

Let me think differently.

Let me count how many numbers I have both cards for. For each such number, I can get one point.

For the numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other, I need to see if I can arrange to play my card after Nene plays hers, so that I get the point.

But Nene is trying to maximize her points and minimize mine, so she will try to play her card second if it benefits her.

Wait, no. She wants to maximize her points first, so she will try to play the second card for the numbers where she has one card and I have the other.

But, if she has both cards for some numbers, she can play them in a way to get a point from them.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of graph theory or some other combinatorial approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as a matching problem.

Let me try to think in terms of the numbers and their pairs.

Each number has two cards: card A and card B.

I have some cards, Nene has the others.

The game is about placing these cards in order, and getting points when the second card of a number is played.

I need to maximize the number of times I play the second card of a number.

Nene is trying to maximize her second cards and minimize mine.

Let me consider that for each number, there are two cards, and we need to decide the order in which they are played.

For the numbers where I have both cards, I can arrange to play the second one after the first one, so I get a point.

For the numbers where I have one card and Nene has the other, it depends on who plays their card second.

Nene, being optimal, will try to play her card second for these numbers to get the point herself.

So, in such cases, I might not get the point.

Wait, but Nene has to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points first, and minimizes mine second.

So, for the numbers where I have both cards, I will get the point.

For the numbers where Nene has both cards, she will get the point.

For the numbers where one card is mine and one is Nene's, Nene will try to play her card second to get the point.

Therefore, in these cases, I won't get the point.

So, my total points would be equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Is that it?

Wait, but maybe there's a way for me to get points from the numbers where I have only one card, depending on the sequence.

Let me think of an example.

Take the first test case:

n=4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, Nene has: 2,3,4,4

So, numbers:

1: I have both

2: I have one, Nene has one

3: I have one, Nene has one

4: Nene has both

So, for number 1, I can get one point.

For number 2, since I have one and Nene has one, Nene will play her 2 first, then I play mine, so I get a point.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says that I can get only 1 point.

Wait, in the example, it says I can get 1 point, but according to this, I get points from number 1 and number 2.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the example, it says I get 1 point, and Nene gets 3 points.

But according to my earlier logic, I should get points from number 1 and number 2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me look back at the example.

In the example, it says:

You select card 1, place it.

Nene selects card 4, place it.

You select card 1, place it and get 1 point.

Nene selects card 4, place it and get 1 point.

You select card 2, place it.

Nene selects card 2, place it and get 1 point.

You select card 3, place it.

Nene selects card 3, place it and get 1 point.

So, in this sequence, I get only 1 point, from playing the second card 1.

Nene gets points from playing the second card 4, second card 2, and second card 3.

So, in this sequence, I get only 1 point.

Is there a way for me to get more than 1 point?

Let's try another sequence.

Suppose I play card 2 first.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1 and get 1 point.

Nene plays card 2 and get 1 point.

I play card 3.

Nene plays card 3 and get 1 point.

Again, I get only 1 point.

Another sequence:

I play card 3.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1 and get 1 point.

Nene plays card 2.

I play card 2 and get 1 point.

Nene plays card 3 and get 1 point.

In this sequence, I get 2 points.

Wait, but according to the note, I can get only 1 point.

But in this sequence, I get 2 points.

Is there something wrong with this sequence?

Wait, perhaps Nene, playing optimally, would not allow me to get 2 points.

In this sequence, I get 2 points, but according to the note, it's only 1.

So, maybe Nene can play differently to prevent me from getting 2 points.

Let me see.

If I play card 3 first.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1 and get 1 point.

Nene plays card 2.

I play card 2 and get 1 point.

Nene plays card 3 and gets 1 point.

So, I get 2 points, but the note says only 1 is possible.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Nene can interleave her plays to prevent me from getting 2 points.

Let me try another sequence.

I play card 1.

Nene plays card 4.

I play card 1 and get 1 point.

Nene plays card 2.

I play card 3.

Nene plays card 4 and gets 1 point.

Nene plays card 2 and gets 1 point.

Nene plays card 3 and gets 1 point.

Again, I get only 1 point.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible for me to get more than 1 point.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for the numbers where I have both cards, I can get 1 point.

For the numbers where I have only one card, and Nene has the other, Nene can always play her card second, so she gets the point.

Therefore, my total points would be equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

In the first test case, I have both cards of number 1, so I can get 1 point.

In the second test case, let's see.

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene has the other cards: the ones not in my hand.

So, for numbers:

1: I have one, Nene has one

2: I have one, Nene has one

4: I have one, Nene has one

5: I have both

7: I have one, Nene has one

8: I have both

So, numbers 5 and 8, I have both cards, so I can get 2 points.

But in the example, it says the output is 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have only one number with both cards (number 1), but in the example, it's said that I can get only 1 point, which matches the count of numbers where I have both cards.

Similarly, in the second test case, I have two numbers with both cards (5 and 8), and the output is 2.

So, perhaps the answer is simply the count of numbers where I have both cards.

Is that always the case?

Let me consider another test case.

n=3

My cards: 1,2,3

Nene has: 1,2,3

So, for each number, I have one card and Nene has one.

In this case, according to the approach, I have no numbers with both cards, so I should get 0 points.

Indeed, in the example, the output is 0.

Another test case:

n=1

My cards: 1

Nene has: 1

Only one number, I have one card, Nene has one card.

So, I have no numbers with both cards, so I should get 0 points.

Again, matches the example.

So, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have both cards.

Because for those, I can arrange to play the second card after the first one, getting a point.

For the numbers where I have only one card and Nene has the other, Nene can play her card second and get the point.

Therefore, I cannot get points from those numbers if Nene plays optimally.

Hence, the answer is simply the count of numbers where I have both cards.

In the code provided, it seems to be implementing this logic.

It counts, for each number, how many cards I have.

If I have both cards for a number, it adds 1 to the score.

Otherwise, it doesn't add anything.

So, the function func_1 is counting the numbers where I have both cards.

In the first test case, for n=4, a=[1,1,2,3], count_a will be {1:2, 2:1, 3:1}, so only one number (1) has both cards, so score=1.

In the second test case, n=8, a=[7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5], count_a={7:1,4:1,1:1,2:1,8:2,5:2}, so numbers 8 and 5 have both cards, so score=2.

Similarly, for other test cases, it matches the output.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Yes}}
