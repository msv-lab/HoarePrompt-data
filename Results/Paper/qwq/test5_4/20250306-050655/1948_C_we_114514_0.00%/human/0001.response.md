Alright, I have this problem to solve. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1) and needs to reach cell (2,n). Every second, two things happen: the robot moves in one direction (left, right, down, or up), and then it moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics. The robot has a choice to move left, right, down, or up initially, but it can't move outside the grid, and it can't skip a move. After that, it must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

Given that, I need to find out if there's a sequence of moves that can lead the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

Looking at the provided program, it seems to try to solve this by checking reachability in each row separately. It keeps track of whether the robot can reach any cell in the first row or the second row at each column.

Let me dive into the code to see how it's implemented.

The main function reads the input and collects test cases. Then it calls func_1 with the number of test cases and the list of test cases. Func_1 processes each test case and determines if it's possible to reach cell (2,n).

In func_1, for each test case, it initializes two flags: reachable_first_row to True and reachable_second_row to False.

Then, it iterates through each column from 0 to n-1.

If reachable_first_row is True, it checks the arrow in row1 at column j.

- If the arrow is '>', it checks if j is n-1, meaning it's the last column. If so, it sets reachable_second_row to True.

- If the arrow is '<', it sets reachable_first_row to False. Additionally, if j < n-1 and the arrow in row2 at j is '>', it sets reachable_second_row to True.

If reachable_second_row is True, it checks the arrow in row2 at column j.

- If the arrow is '>', and j is n-1, it sets reachable_second_row to True.

Finally, if reachable_second_row is True, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, 'NO'.

Hmm, this seems a bit simplistic. Let me think about the movement rules again.

The robot can choose to move left, right, down, or up initially, but it can't move outside the grid or skip a move. After that, it must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

So, at each step, the robot has a choice of direction for its initial move, and then it's forced to move according to the arrow.

This seems like a deterministic finite automaton, where the robot's position is a state, and the transitions are determined by its initial move and the arrow.

But the provided solution seems to be tracking only whether the robot can reach any cell in the first or second row at each column. It doesn't seem to account for the robot's ability to switch between rows based on its initial move and the arrow's direction.

Let me consider the first test case from the example:

n = 4

row1: > < < >

row2: > > < >

According to the solution, it should output 'YES', meaning it's possible to reach (2,4).

Let's see how the solution processes this.

Initialize:

reachable_first_row = True

reachable_second_row = False

Column 0:

reachable_first_row is True:

row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action for reaching second row directly.

But the solution seems to have a condition that if row1[j] == '>', and j == n-1, set reachable_second_row = True. But here j != n-1, so maybe it does something else.

Wait, in the code, if row1[j] == '>', and j == n-1, set reachable_second_row = True. Otherwise, if row1[j] == '<', set reachable_first_row = False. And if j < n-1 and row2[j] == '>', set reachable_second_row = True.

So for j=0:

row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action for reachable_second_row based on row1.

But then, since reachable_second_row is False, it doesn't check row2.

Wait, in the code, after checking row1, it checks if reachable_second_row is True, then checks row2[j].

So for j=0:

reachable_first_row = True

row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action.

reachable_second_row is False, so no action for row2.

Move to j=1:

reachable_first_row is still True.

row1[1] == '<', so set reachable_first_row = False.

If j < n-1 and row2[1] == '>', which is '>', so set reachable_second_row = True.

Now, reachable_second_row = True.

Then, since reachable_second_row is True, check row2[1] == '>', and j != n-1, so no action.

Proceed to j=2:

reachable_first_row = False

reachable_second_row = True

Check row1[j], but since reachable_first_row is False, skip.

Check row2[j], since reachable_second_row is True.

row2[2] == '<', so no action.

Proceed to j=3:

reachable_first_row = False

reachable_second_row = True

Check row1[j], skip.

Check row2[j], row2[3] == '>', and j == n-1, so set reachable_second_row = True.

Finally, since reachable_second_row is True, output 'YES'.

This seems to work for this case.

Let's consider the second test case:

n=2

row1: ><

row2: ><

According to the example, output is 'YES'.

Let's simulate:

Initialize:

reachable_first_row = True

reachable_second_row = False

j=0:

reachable_first_row = True

row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action.

reachable_second_row = False, so no action for row2.

j=1:

reachable_first_row = True

row1[1] == '<', set reachable_first_row = False

j < n-1 is False, so no action for row2.

reachable_second_row remains False.

Since reachable_second_row is False, output 'NO'.

But according to the example, it's 'YES'. So there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, in the example, output is 'YES' for this case, but according to this simulation, it should output 'NO'. So perhaps the solution is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the example. Let me check the example again.

Looking back at the example:

Input:

4

4

>><<

>>><

2

><

><

4

>>><

>><<

6

>><<><

><>>><

Output:

YES

YES

NO

YES

So for n=2, row1: ><, row2: ><, output is 'YES'.

But according to the solution's simulation, it would output 'NO'.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the movement rules.

Let me think differently. Maybe the robot can switch rows by moving up or down initially, and then follow the arrow.

In the second test case, n=2.

Grid:

Row1: > <

Row2: > <

Start at (1,1).

Possible initial moves:

- Move right: go to (1,2), then follow arrow to (1,1) or (1,2) based on row1[1] == '<'.

- Move down: go to (2,1), then follow arrow to (2,2) or stay based on row2[1].

- Move left: can't, as it's the first column.

- Move up: can't, as it's the top row.

So, if it moves down to (2,1), and row2[1] == '>', it would move to (2,2), which is the target.

So, it should be possible.

But according to the solution, it would set reachable_first_row = True initially.

At j=0:

reachable_first_row = True

row1[0] == '>', j != n-1, so no action for reachable_second_row.

reachable_second_row = False, so no action for row2.

At j=1:

reachable_first_row = True

row1[1] == '<', set reachable_first_row = False

j < n-1 is False, so no action for row2.

reachable_second_row remains False.

Hence, output 'NO', which contradicts the example's 'YES'.

Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

Another way to see it is that the solution doesn't account for the robot's ability to switch rows by moving down or up initially, and then following the arrow.

In this case, the robot can move down from (1,1) to (2,1), then follow the arrow to (2,2), which is the target.

But the solution doesn't consider this path because it only tracks reachability in each row separately, without considering the possibility of switching rows by moving down or up.

Hence, the solution is incomplete and incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
