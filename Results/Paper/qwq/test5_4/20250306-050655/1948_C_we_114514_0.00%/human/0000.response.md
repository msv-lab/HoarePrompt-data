Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a grid with 2 rows and n columns. Each cell has an arrow pointing left or right. The robot starts at cell (1,1), which is the top-left cell, and needs to reach cell (2,n), which is the bottom-right cell.

Every second, two things happen:

1. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, but it can't move outside the grid or skip a move.

2. Then, it moves along the arrow in its current cell.

I need to determine if the robot can reach cell (2,n) from cell (1,1) following these rules.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics clearly. The robot has a choice of direction in the first move each second: left, right, up, or down. Then, it must move according to the arrow in its current cell.

Given that the grid has only two rows, moving up from row 1 takes the robot to row 2, and moving down from row 2 takes the robot to row 1. Moving left decreases the column number, and moving right increases it.

The arrows in the cells are either '<' (left) or '>' (right). The problem states that no arrow points outside the grid, so if a cell in the first column has a '<' arrow, it must stay in place or wrap around, but according to the problem, arrows don't point outside, so perhaps '<' in the first column means stay in place or something. But the problem says no arrow points outside, so perhaps in the first column, '<' is not allowed, or it's handled in a specific way.

Wait, the problem says "no arrow points outside the grid," which probably means that in the first column, '<' arrows are allowed but they won't make the robot go outside. So, if the robot is in column 1 and the arrow is '<', it probably stays in place or perhaps wraps around to the last column. But the problem doesn't specify wrapping; it likely stays in place.

Similarly, in the last column, if there's a '>' arrow, it stays in place.

But actually, the problem says "no arrow points outside the grid," but it doesn't specify what happens if an arrow would cause the robot to move outside. Perhaps it just stays in place.

Wait, perhaps I should assume that moving according to the arrow is constrained within the grid boundaries.

But to make sure, I should think about how the movements work step by step.

Let's consider the sequence of moves.

Each second, the robot:

1. Chooses to move left, right, up, or down, within the grid.

2. Then moves according to the arrow in its current cell.

I need to find a sequence of such moves that gets the robot from (1,1) to (2,n).

This seems a bit tricky because of the combination of the two moves each second.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node represents a position, and edges represent possible moves the robot can make in one second.

But given the constraints on n (up to 2e5) and t (up to 1e4), with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how the robot can move between rows and columns.

The robot can switch rows by moving up or down, but only between row 1 and row 2.

Moving left and right affects the column position, but is constrained by the arrow movement.

I need to see if there's a path that allows the robot to reach (2,n).

Perhaps I can think in terms of reachable columns in each row.

Let me consider that the robot can move within a row by choosing to move left or right and following the arrow.

Additionally, it can switch rows by choosing to move up or down.

I need to model how the robot can traverse the grid using these movements.

Let me consider that in row 1, the robot can move left or right according to the arrows, and similarly in row 2.

But the robot can also switch rows by moving up or down.

Wait, but the movement is a bit more involved because the robot first chooses a direction and then moves according to the arrow.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Maybe I can think about the possible positions the robot can be in after each second.

But that seems too broad; I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the robot can choose to move up or down to switch rows, and then follow the arrow in the new cell.

Also, when moving left or right, it follows the arrow in the current cell after moving in that direction.

Wait, no: the sequence is:

1. Move left, right, up, or down (within the grid).

2. Then move according to the arrow in the current cell.

So, effectively, each move consists of two parts: a chosen move and then an arrow move.

I need to see how these two moves combine.

Let me consider the possible combinations:

- Choose to move left, then move according to the arrow in the new cell.

- Choose to move right, then move according to the arrow in the new cell.

- Choose to move up, then move according to the arrow in the new cell.

- Choose to move down, then move according to the arrow in the new cell.

I need to see what net movement each combination provides.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to look for patterns or invariants.

Let me consider that the robot starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (2,n).

I need to see if there's a sequence of moves that can take it from (1,1) to (2,n).

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are grid cells, and edges represent possible moves the robot can make in one second.

Then, I can check if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n).

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to do this, probably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about how the robot can move between rows.

The robot can switch rows by choosing to move up or down.

But after moving up or down, it must then move according to the arrow in the new cell.

So, for example:

- If the robot is in row 1, column j, and chooses to move up, it moves to row 2, column j, then moves according to the arrow in row 2, column j.

- Similarly, if it chooses to move down from row 2, it moves to row 1, column j, then moves according to the arrow in row 1, column j.

Also, if the robot chooses to move left or right, it moves in that direction and then follows the arrow in the new cell.

Wait, but moving left or right first, then following the arrow in the new cell, could lead to further movement.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe I need to consider that the robot can move between columns in each row based on the arrows, and also switch rows by moving up or down.

Perhaps I can model the movement within each row first, and then see how switching rows affects the overall movement.

Let me consider that in each row, the arrows determine a kind of flow: left or right.

So, in row 1, the arrows are given by string row1, and in row 2 by row2.

I need to see how the robot can traverse these rows and also switch between rows.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible column positions in each row that are reachable.

Let me try to think about reachable columns in row 1 and row 2 separately, and then see how switching rows affects reachability.

First, in row 1:

- The robot starts at column 1.

- It can move left or right according to the arrows in row 1.

Similarly, in row 2:

- If the robot switches to row 2, it can move left or right according to the arrows in row 2.

But the robot can switch between rows by moving up or down.

So, perhaps I can model that the robot can switch rows at any column, provided that it chooses to move up or down and then follows the arrow in the new cell.

Wait, but when switching rows, it moves to the same column in the other row and then follows the arrow in that cell.

So, for example, if the robot is in row 1, column j, and chooses to move up, it moves to row 2, column j, then moves according to the arrow in row 2, column j.

Similarly, if it chooses to move down from row 2, column j, it moves to row 1, column j, then moves according to the arrow in row 1, column j.

Also, if it chooses to move left or right in the same row, it moves in that direction and then follows the arrow in the new cell.

This seems a bit complicated to model directly.

Maybe I need to consider that the robot can choose to stay in the current row and move along the arrows, or choose to switch rows and then move along the arrows in the new row.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible movements that can be achieved in one second.

Let me consider all possible net movements the robot can make in one second.

Given that it has four choices initially (left, right, up, down), and then follows the arrow in the new cell.

So, for each possible current position, and for each choice of initial move, I can compute where the robot ends up after following the arrow.

Then, I can see all possible positions it can reach in one second from its current position.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps I can consider that in row 1, the robot can move right or left according to the arrows, and similarly in row 2.

Then, at any point, it can choose to switch to the other row at the current column, provided that it chooses to move up or down and then follows the arrow in the new row.

Wait, but when switching rows, it moves to the same column in the other row and then follows the arrow in that cell.

So, for example, if in row 1, column j, it chooses to move up, it moves to row 2, column j, then moves according to the arrow in row 2, column j.

If row2[j] is '>', it moves to column j+1 in row 2.

If row2[j] is '<', it moves to column j-1 in row 2.

Similarly, if it chooses to move down from row 2, column j, it moves to row 1, column j, then moves according to row1[j].

This seems manageable.

Similarly, if it chooses to move left or right in the same row, it moves in that direction and then follows the arrow in the new cell.

Wait, but moving left or right first, then following the arrow, could lead to multiple movements in one second.

Wait, no: the problem says that first, the robot moves left, right, up, or down (can't skip, can't move outside the grid), and then moves along the arrow in the current cell.

So, it's two discrete movements: one chosen move, then one arrow move.

So, for example:

- If the robot chooses to move right, then moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

- If it chooses to move left, then moves according to the arrow in the new cell.

- If it chooses to move up or down, it switches rows and then moves according to the arrow in the new row's same column.

I need to see what net movements are possible.

This seems a bit involved.

Maybe I can think about it in terms of possible paths.

Let me consider that the robot can move within row 1 or row 2 based on the arrows, and can switch between rows at any column by choosing to move up or down.

I need to see if there's a sequence of such moves that allows the robot to reach (2,n) from (1,1).

Given the constraints on n and t, I need an efficient algorithm.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes are (row, column) positions, and edges represent possible moves in one second.

Then, I can perform a BFS or DFS to see if (2,n) is reachable from (1,1).

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I can consider that the robot can traverse columns in each row based on the arrows, and switching rows allows it to access the other row's arrows.

Wait, perhaps I can model that the robot can move between columns in row 1 and row 2 by switching rows and following the arrows.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about it in terms of possible movements.

Suppose the robot is in row 1, column j.

It has four options:

1. Move left: if j > 1, move to row 1, column j-1, then move according to row1[j-1].

2. Move right: if j < n, move to row 1, column j+1, then move according to row1[j+1].

3. Move up: move to row 2, column j, then move according to row2[j].

4. Move down: move to row 1, column j, then move according to row1[j].

Wait, moving down from row 1 would be moving to row 1 again, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no: moving down from row 1 would take it to row 2, since row 1 is the top row.

Wait, the rows are numbered 1 (top) and 2 (bottom).

So, moving down from row 1 takes it to row 2, and moving up from row 2 takes it to row 1.

So, correcting that:

- From row 1, column j:

- Move left: to row 1, column j-1, then move according to row1[j-1].

- Move right: to row 1, column j+1, then move according to row1[j+1].

- Move down: to row 2, column j, then move according to row2[j].

- Move up: not possible from row 1.

Wait, can the robot move up from row 1? If row 1 is the top row, moving up would be outside the grid, which is not allowed.

Similarly, from row 2, column j:

- Move left: to row 2, column j-1, then move according to row2[j-1].

- Move right: to row 2, column j+1, then move according to row2[j+1].

- Move up: to row 1, column j, then move according to row1[j].

- Move down: not possible from row 2.

Wait, but the problem says "the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell."

So, from row 1, column 1:

- Can't move left (would go outside).

- Can move right to column 2, then follow row1[2].

- Can move down to row 2, column 1, then follow row2[1].

- Can't move up (outside the grid).

Similarly, from row 2, column n:

- Can move left to column n-1, then follow row2[n-1].

- Can't move right (outside the grid).

- Can move up to row 1, column n, then follow row1[n].

- Can't move down (outside the grid).

I need to consider these movement options to see how the robot can traverse the grid.

This seems quite involved. Maybe I can look for patterns or invariants that can help determine reachability without simulating all possible moves.

Let me consider that the robot needs to reach row 2, column n.

I need to see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n) using the allowed moves.

Perhaps I can consider that the robot can traverse columns in row 1 and row 2 separately, and use switches between rows to connect them.

Given that n is even, perhaps there's some parity consideration, but I don't see it immediately.

Let me consider that in row 1, the arrows determine a kind of flow, and similarly in row 2.

Then, switching rows allows the robot to transfer to the other row's flow at any column.

I need to see if, by switching rows at certain columns and following the arrows, the robot can reach (2,n).

This seems complex, but perhaps I can find a way to model it efficiently.

Let me consider that the robot can move within a row based on the arrows and its chosen moves, and that switching rows allows it to access the other row's arrows.

I need to see if there's a sequence of such moves that can take it from (1,1) to (2,n).

Perhaps I can model this as two separate arrays for row 1 and row 2, and see if there's a way to traverse from the start to the end by switching between them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of possible column positions in each row that are reachable.

Let me try to think about it step by step.

First, in row 1, starting at column 1.

From there, the robot can choose to:

- Move right to column 2, then follow the arrow in column 2.

- Move down to row 2, column 1, then follow the arrow in row 2, column 1.

Similarly, from row 2, column 1:

- Move left or right within row 2, following the arrows.

- Move up to row 1, column 1, then follow the arrow in row 1, column 1.

I need to see how these movements can be combined to reach row 2, column n.

This seems too vague. Maybe I need to consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 independently, and that switching rows allows it to transfer between them.

Perhaps I can model that the robot can move between columns in row 1 and row 2 by switching rows at any column.

Then, I can see if there's a path from (1,1) to (2,n) by moving within rows and switching rows.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 based on the arrows, and that switching rows is an option at any column.

I need to see if, by choosing to switch rows at certain columns and moving within rows, the robot can reach (2,n).

This seems too broad. Maybe I need to look for specific conditions that make (2,n) unreachable.

For example, if there's no way to switch to row 2 from row 1 at any column, then it's impossible to reach row 2.

But in this problem, since the robot can always choose to move down from row 1 to row 2 at any column, provided that it's within the grid, which it is for row 1 and column j where 1 <= j <= n.

Wait, but from row 1, column j, the robot can choose to move down to row 2, column j, then follow the arrow in row 2, column j.

So, the robot can switch to row 2 at any column j.

Similarly, from row 2, column j, it can choose to move up to row 1, column j, then follow the arrow in row 1, column j.

So, the robot can switch between rows at any column at any time.

Given that, perhaps the key is to see if the robot can reach column n in row 2, regardless of how it moves within rows.

But I still need to figure out how the movements within rows affect reachability.

Let me consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 based on the arrows, and that switching rows allows it to access the other row's arrows.

I need to see if, by moving within rows and switching rows, the robot can reach column n in row 2.

Perhaps I can model that the robot can move between columns in row 1 and row 2 by switching rows at any column.

Then, I can see if there's a path from column 1 in row 1 to column n in row 2.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 independently, and that switching rows is instantaneous.

Then, I can model that the robot can be in either row at any column, provided that it can switch rows at that column.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach any column in row 1 or row 2 by switching rows and moving within rows.

But I need to ensure that it can actually reach column n in row 2.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column n in row 2 if it can reach column n in either row, since it can switch rows at any column.

But that doesn't seem accurate, because it needs to end up specifically in row 2, column n.

Wait, but if it can reach column n in row 1, and then switch to row 2, column n, then it's there.

Similarly, if it can reach column n in row 2 directly or via switching, that would be sufficient.

So, perhaps the key is to see if the robot can reach column n in row 2.

Given that, perhaps I can consider that the robot can move between columns in row 1 and row 2 by switching rows at any column.

Then, the problem reduces to seeing if column n in row 2 is reachable from column 1 in row 1.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 based on the arrows, and can switch rows at any column.

Then, I can model that the robot can move between any two columns in the same row if there's a path via the arrows, and can switch rows at any column.

Given that, perhaps I can model that the robot can reach column j in row 1 or row 2 if there's a path from the starting position to that column in that row.

Then, to reach (2,n), I need to see if column n in row 2 is reachable.

But I need to formalize this.

Perhaps I can model that the robot can reach column j in row 1 if:

- It can reach column j in row 1 from column 1 in row 1, moving left or right according to the arrows.

- Or, it can switch to row 2 at some column k, move to column j in row 2, and then switch back to row 1 at column j.

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider that the robot can move between columns in row 1 and row 2 independently, connected only by the ability to switch rows at any column.

Then, perhaps I can model that the robot can move between any two columns if there's a path that allows it to switch rows and move within rows to get from one column to another.

But I need a more efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 based on the arrows, and that switching rows is a direct move between row 1 and row 2 at any column.

Then, perhaps I can model that the robot can reach column j in row 2 if:

- It can reach column j in row 1 and switch to row 2 at column j.

- Or, it can reach column j in row 2 directly from other columns in row 2 via the arrows and row switches.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that the robot can move within row 1 and row 2 separately, and that switching rows allows it to transfer between the two rows at any column.

Then, I can model that the robot can reach any column in row 1 or row 2 if there's a path that connects them via row switches and internal row movements.

Given that, perhaps I can model that the robot can reach column j in row 2 if:

- It can reach column j in row 1 and switch to row 2 at column j.

- Or, it can reach column j in row 2 from other columns in row 2 via the arrows.

But I need to formalize this.

Perhaps I can consider that the robot can reach column j in row 1 if:

- It can reach column j-1 in row 1 and the arrow in column j-1 points to the right ('>').

- Or, it can reach column j+1 in row 1 and the arrow in column j+1 points to the left ('<').

- Or, it can reach column j in row 2 and switch to row 1 at column j.

Similarly, it can reach column j in
