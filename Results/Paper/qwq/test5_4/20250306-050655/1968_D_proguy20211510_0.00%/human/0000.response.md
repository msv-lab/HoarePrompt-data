Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this game called "Permutation game" played by Bodya and Sasha. They have a permutation p of length n and an array a of length n. They start at positions P_B and P_S respectively, and the game consists of k turns. Each turn, both players simultaneously:

1. Add a_x to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Choose to stay at their current position or move to p_x.

The goal is to determine who wins the game, meaning who has a higher score after k turns. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent.

- t: number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- n: length of the permutation and the array.

- k: number of turns in the game.

- P_B: Bodya's starting position (1-based index).

- P_S: Sasha's starting position (1-based index).

- Permutation p: list of integers from 1 to n.

- Array a: list of integers representing scores.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 10^4

- n ≤ 2*10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 2*10^5

- k can be up to 10^9

This suggests that the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) per test case or better, considering the constraints.

Let me try to understand the game mechanics.

Each player is at a certain position, and each turn they can choose to stay or move to p_x, where x is their current position. They add a_x to their score based on their current position.

Since both players make decisions simultaneously, their choices don't affect each other directly.

The problem is to determine who will have a higher score after k turns if both play optimally.

Given that they are both trying to maximize their own scores, I need to find the optimal strategy for each player independently.

Since the players make decisions simultaneously and don't affect each other's moves, I can consider their strategies separately.

So, for Bodya and Sasha, I need to find the maximum possible score each can achieve in k turns, given their starting positions and the rules.

Then, compare these scores to determine the winner.

But k can be up to 10^9, which suggests that I need to find a way to compute the maximum score efficiently, possibly identifying cycles or patterns in their movement.

Let me think about how a player can move.

At each turn, a player can choose to stay at the current position or move to p_x.

So, from position x, the player can either stay at x or move to p_x.

This resembles a graph where each position is a node, and there is an edge from x to p_x.

Since p is a permutation, the graph will consist of disjoint cycles.

For example, if p = [2, 1, 4, 3], then the graph has two cycles: 1->2->1 and 3->4->3.

In such a cycle, if a player is in a cycle, they can choose to stay at their current position or move along the cycle.

But since they can choose to stay, they can decide when to move and when to stay.

Wait, but in each turn, they have to choose to stay or move to p_x.

So, in a cycle, they can choose to stay forever, or to move along the cycle.

But, since they can choose to stay at any time, effectively, they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle at any time.

But, they have to make decisions simultaneously, so they can't coordinate their moves.

But, since their decisions don't affect each other, I can consider each player separately.

The key is to maximize the score for each player independently.

Given that, for each player, I need to find the maximum possible score in k turns, given their starting position and the ability to choose to stay or move to p_x each turn.

Let me try to model this.

Let's consider a single player starting at position x.

At each turn, they can choose to stay at x and get a_x, or move to p_x and get a_{p_x}.

But, they can choose differently each turn.

Wait, no. In each turn, they choose whether to stay or move, and based on that choice, they get a_x or a_{p_x}, but actually, according to the problem, they always get a_x, where x is their current position, before potentially moving to p_x.

Wait, let's read the problem again carefully.

"on each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x, his score increases by a_x.

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x."

So, in each turn:

1. Add a_x to the score.

2. Choose to stay at x or move to p_x.

So, in each turn, they are adding a_x to their score, where x is the position at the start of the turn, and then they choose to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

So, in the next turn, their current position would be either x (if they stayed) or p_x (if they moved).

So, the choice to stay or move affects the position for the next turn, but the score is always based on the current position at the start of the turn.

This seems manageable.

Given that, for each player, their score in k turns is the sum of a_{x_i} for each turn i, where x_i is their position at the start of turn i.

The choice to stay or move affects the position for the next turn, but not the score for the current turn.

So, the score is determined by the sequence of positions they occupy at the start of each turn.

Given that, for each player, their sequence of positions over k turns can be modeled as a sequence where each position is either the same as the previous one or p_{previous position}.

Given that p is a permutation, the graph formed by p is a collection of cycles.

In such a graph, if a player is in a cycle, they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn.

Wait, but they have to follow the sequence based on their choices.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a decision tree.

But with k up to 10^9, that's not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the structure of the permutation p.

Since p is a permutation, it consists of disjoint cycles.

For example, if p = [2,1,4,3], there are two cycles: 1->2->1 and 3->4->3.

In such a case, if a player starts in one cycle, they stay within that cycle.

Given that, perhaps I can analyze each cycle separately.

But wait, the players can choose to stay at their current position in any turn.

So, even if they are in a cycle, they can choose to stay put in any turn.

This complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum possible a_x in the cycle and assume that the player will maximize their score by staying at that position as much as possible.

But, they have to go through the sequence based on their choices.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum a_x in the cycle and determine how many times they can pick that maximum a_x.

But, since they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, perhaps there's a way to maximize the number of times they pick the maximum a_x.

Wait, perhaps I need to find, for each player, the maximum a_x in their cycle, and then assume that they can pick that maximum a_x in every turn.

But, they might need to move around the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, no, because they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn.

Wait, no, they have to follow their sequence of choices.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and try to find the optimal strategy for them.

At each turn, they have to choose whether to stay or move to p_x.

The choice affects their position in the next turn.

Their goal is to maximize the sum of a_x over k turns.

This resembles a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[x][t] as the maximum score achievable by being at position x at turn t.

But with k up to 10^9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the optimal choice for each turn independently.

But I think that won't work because the choice in one turn affects the position in the next turn.

Wait, perhaps I can find the optimal sequence of positions to maximize the sum of a_x over k turns.

Given that p is a permutation, and the graph is made of disjoint cycles, perhaps I can model the movement within each cycle.

Wait, maybe I can consider that in each cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, but has to follow the path defined by p.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think about what the optimal strategy is.

For a player, in each turn, they have to choose between staying at x or moving to p_x.

They get a_x for the current turn regardless of their choice.

But their choice affects their position in the next turn.

Wait, no. According to the problem, the sequence is:

1. Add a_x to the score.

2. Choose to stay at x or move to p_x for the next turn.

So, in turn i:

- They are at position x_i.

- They add a_{x_i} to their score.

- Then they choose x_{i+1} = x_i (stay) or p_{x_i} (move).

So, x_{i+1} is either x_i or p_{x_i}.

So, the sequence of positions is defined by this choice at each turn.

Given that, for each player, their sequence of positions is a sequence where each position is either the same as the previous one or p of the previous one.

Given that, for each player, their sequence of positions is determined by their choices, which are independent of the other player's choices.

Given that, for each player, to maximize their score, they need to choose, for each turn, whether to stay or move, in a way that maximizes the sum of a_x over k turns.

But with k up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider the structure of the permutation p.

Since p is a permutation, it consists of disjoint cycles.

Each player is in one of these cycles.

Within a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, but has to follow the sequence based on their choices.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as follows:

For a player in a cycle, they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, but they have to move along the cycle if they choose to move.

But, since they can choose to stay, they can effectively choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, as long as they reach that position through a sequence of moves.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, suppose a cycle is 1 -> 2 -> 1.

Then, if the player is at 1, they can choose to stay at 1 or move to 2.

If they stay at 1, next turn they are still at 1.

If they move to 2, next turn they are at 2.

At 2, they can choose to stay at 2 or move back to 1.

So, in this cycle, the player can choose to be at 1 or at 2 in any turn, but their choices are interconnected across turns.

This seems similar to choosing a sequence of positions where each position is either the same as the previous or p of the previous.

This is starting to look like a shortest path problem, but I need to maximize the sum over k turns.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about smaller k values.

For small k, I could simulate the process.

For example, for k=1:

- Both players add a_{x} to their score, where x is their starting position.

- Then, they choose to stay or move.

But since k=1, the game ends after that.

So, their score is a_{x}, where x is their starting position.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first turn:

- They add a_{x} to their score.

- Then, they choose to stay or move.

But since k=1, the game ends after one turn.

So, their final score is a_{x}, where x is their starting position.

Similarly, for k=2:

- Turn 1:

- Add a_{x} to score.

- Choose to stay at x or move to p_x.

- Turn 2:

- Add a_{y} to score, where y is the position chosen in the previous turn.

- Choose to stay at y or move to p_y.

So, for k=2, the player can be at x in both turns, or at x in the first turn and at p_x in the second turn, or at p_x in both turns, etc.

Wait, more generally, for k turns, the player's sequence of positions is a sequence where each position is either the same as the previous one or p of the previous one.

This seems like a tree structure, where each node has two children: stay and move.

But with k up to 10^9, simulating this is impossible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay or move, and their score is the sum of a_x over k turns.

I need to maximize this sum.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay at their current position or move to p_x.

So, for each turn, the player has two options:

1. Stay at x and get a_x, then stay at x for the next turn.

2. Move to p_x and get a_x, then be at p_x for the next turn.

Wait, no.

Wait, in turn i:

- They are at position x_i.

- They add a_{x_i} to their score.

- Then, they choose to stay at x_i or move to p_{x_i}, which determines x_{i+1}.

So, x_{i+1} is either x_i (if they stay) or p_{x_i} (if they move).

Hence, the sequence of positions is defined by this choice.

Given that, for each player, their sequence of positions is a sequence where each position is either the same as the previous one or p of the previous one.

Given that p is a permutation, and hence a bijection, the graph is made of cycles.

In such a graph, the player can choose to stay at any position in their cycle in any turn, but has to follow the sequence of choices.

This seems like a Markov Decision Process, but again, with k up to 10^9, I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that in the long run, the player can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a_x in their cycle for as many turns as possible.

But they might need to move around the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, but since they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, perhaps they can arrange to be at the position with the maximum a_x in as many turns as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum a_x in the cycle and assume that the player can achieve that in every turn.

But, in reality, they might need to move around the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, no, because they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn.

Wait, perhaps I need to find, for each player, the maximum a_x in their cycle, and assume that they can achieve that in every turn.

But, in reality, they might need to move around the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the cycle structure and determine how often they can be at the position with the maximum a_x.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix a player and their starting position.

I need to find the maximum possible sum of a_x over k turns, given that in each turn, they can choose to stay at their current position or move to p_x.

Let me try to model this as a recurrence.

Let dp[i][x] be the maximum sum of scores for the first i turns, ending at position x.

Then, dp[i][x] = a_x + max(dp[i-1][x], dp[i-1][p^{-1}_x])

Wait, but p is a permutation, so p^{-1} exists.

But this seems complicated, and with k up to 10^9, it's not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the player can choose to stay at any position in their cycle in any turn, as long as they follow the sequence of choices.

Wait, perhaps I can find the set of positions that the player can be at after k turns, and maximize the sum accordingly.

But this seems too broad.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2 3 2

4 1 2 3

7 2 5 6

So, n=4, k=2, P_B=3, P_S=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

So, positions:

1: p1=4, a1=7

2: p2=1, a2=2

3: p3=2, a3=5

4: p4=3, a4=6

So, cycles:

1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 (this is one cycle)

So, the cycle is 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Now, Bodya starts at 3, Sasha starts at 2.

So, both are in the same cycle.

Now, in each turn, they add a_x to their score and then choose to stay or move to p_x.

Let's simulate for k=2.

Turn 1:

- Bodya is at 3, adds a3=5 to his score.

- Chooses to stay at 3 or move to p3=2.

- If he stays, next position is 3.

- If he moves, next position is 2.

- Sasha is at 2, adds a2=2 to his score.

- Chooses to stay at 2 or move to p2=1.

- If he stays, next position is 2.

- If he moves, next position is 1.

Turn 2:

- Depending on their choices in turn 1.

Let's consider all possible combinations.

Case 1:

- Bodya stays at 3, Sasha stays at 2.

- Turn 1:

- Bodya: 5

- Sasha: 2

- Turn 2:

- Bodya is at 3, adds 5.

- Sasha is at 2, adds 2.

- Total:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10

- Sasha: 2 + 2 = 4

Case 2:

- Bodya stays at 3, Sasha moves to 1.

- Turn 1:

- Bodya: 5

- Sasha: 2

- Turn 2:

- Bodya is at 3, adds 5.

- Sasha is at 1, adds 7.

- Total:

- Bodya: 5 + 5 = 10

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9

Case 3:

- Bodya moves to 2, Sasha stays at 2.

- Turn 1:

- Bodya: 5

- Sasha: 2

- Turn 2:

- Bodya is at 2, adds 2.

- Sasha is at 2, adds 2.

- Total:

- Bodya: 5 + 2 = 7

- Sasha: 2 + 2 = 4

Case 4:

- Bodya moves to 2, Sasha moves to 1.

- Turn 1:

- Bodya: 5

- Sasha: 2

- Turn 2:

- Bodya is at 2, adds 2.

- Sasha is at 1, adds 7.

- Total:

- Bodya: 5 + 2 = 7

- Sasha: 2 + 7 = 9

So, in all possible cases, Bodya's score is higher than Sasha's score.

Hence, Bodya wins.

But according to the sample input and output, it's Bodya, Sasha, Draw, Draw, Bodya, Sasha, Sasha, Sasha, Sasha, Bodya.

Wait, the first one is Bodya, which matches my calculation.

But in the explanation, it says Bodya's score is 10 and Sasha's is 9.

So, Bodya wins.

But in the code, it's printing "Bodya", which is correct.

But I need to generalize this for any n, k, P_B, P_S, p, and a.

I need to find a way to compute the maximum possible score for each player in k turns.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient algorithm.

Let me think about the structure of the permutation p.

Since p is a permutation, it consists of disjoint cycles.

Each player is in one of these cycles.

Within a cycle, the player can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, but has to follow the sequence based on their choices.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each player, the maximum a_x in their cycle, and assume that they can achieve that in as many turns as possible.

But, they might need to move around the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, perhaps I can find the cycle that the player is in, identify the maximum a_x in that cycle, and compute how many times the player can be at that position in k turns.

But, since they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, perhaps they can arrange to be at the position with the maximum a_x in every turn.

But, in reality, they might need to move around the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, no, because in a cycle, they can choose to stay at any position in any turn, as long as they follow the sequence of choices.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this differently.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay at their current position or move to p_x.

So, for each turn, their position is either the same as the previous turn or p of the previous turn.

Hence, their position in turn i depends on their position in turn i-1 and their choice in turn i-1.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to maximize the sum of a_x over k turns by choosing the sequence of positions optimally.

But with k up to 10^9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that in the cycle containing the player's starting position, the player can cycle through the positions in the cycle.

But they can also choose to stay at any position in any turn.

Hence, perhaps the player can arrange to be at the position with the maximum a_x in as many turns as possible.

In other words, the player can choose to stay at the position with the maximum a_x in their cycle in every turn, unless constrained by the cycle structure.

But, in reality, they have to move along the cycle to reach that position again.

Wait, but since they can choose to stay at any position in the cycle in any turn, perhaps they can achieve the maximum a_x in every turn.

But, perhaps not, because their choices are sequential and dependent.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose that, in the cycle containing the player's starting position, the player can choose to be at any position in the cycle in any turn, but has to follow the sequence defined by their choices.

Given that, perhaps the player can arrange to be at the position with the maximum a_x in as many turns as possible.

Hence, the maximum possible score would
