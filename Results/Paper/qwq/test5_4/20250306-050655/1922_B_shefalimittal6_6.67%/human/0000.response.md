Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have n sticks, each with a length of 2 raised to the power of a_i, where a_i is given for each stick. I need to choose exactly 3 sticks and form a non-degenerate triangle with them. A non-degenerate triangle means that the area is greater than 0, which implies that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. Basically, it's the triangle inequality theorem.

So, my task is to count how many ways I can select 3 sticks that satisfy the triangle inequality. The order doesn't matter, so it's combinations, not permutations.

First, I need to understand the properties of the lengths. Each stick has a length of 2^{a_i}. Since exponents are involved, and 2 raised to any integer is a power of two, all lengths are powers of two. That's an important observation.

I recall that powers of two are distinct in that each one is double the previous one. So, for example, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on. This means that each length is strictly greater than the sum of all smaller lengths combined. Wait, is that true? Let's see: for example, 4 is greater than 1 + 2, which is 3. Similarly, 8 is greater than 1 + 2 + 4, which is 7. So yes, each power of two is greater than the sum of all smaller powers of two.

This property is crucial because it affects how the triangle inequality holds. For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the two smaller lengths must be greater than the largest length.

Given that the lengths are powers of two, and each power is greater than the sum of all smaller powers, it seems challenging to have three lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. In fact, in general, with powers of two, the sum of any two smaller powers is always less than the next higher power. For example, 1 + 2 < 4, 2 + 4 < 8, and so on.

Wait, but the problem says that in some test cases, you can form triangles. Looking back at the example, in the first test case, where all a_i are 1, so all sticks have length 2^1 = 2. So, choosing any three sticks, their lengths are 2, 2, 2, which should form an equilateral triangle, which is valid. So, in this case, the sum of any two sides is 4, which is greater than the third side, 2. So, that works.

In the second test case, with a_i = 3, 2, 1, 3, the lengths are 8, 4, 2, 8. So, possible combinations are:

- 2, 4, 8: 2 + 4 = 6 < 8 → not a triangle

- 2, 8, 8: 2 + 8 = 10 > 8 → valid

- 4, 8, 8: 4 + 8 = 12 > 8 → valid

So, there are two valid combinations, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, lengths are 2, 4, 8: 2 + 4 = 6 < 8 → not a triangle.

In the fourth test case, only one stick, which is less than three, so no triangles can be formed.

So, the key here is to handle the general case where we have multiple sticks with different lengths that are powers of two.

Now, looking at the code provided:

```python

import math

def func():

    t = int(input())

    for _ in range(t):

        n = int(input())

        num_of_lens = {}

        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

        for x in nums:

            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1

        res = 0

        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():

            if cnt >= 3:

                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)

            if cnt >= 2:

                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))

                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum

        print(res)

```

Let's try to understand what this code is doing.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case:

- It reads n, the number of sticks.

- It reads the list of a_i values.

- It counts the frequency of each a_i value using a dictionary num_of_lens.

Then, it initializes a result variable res to 0.

It iterates over the values of the dictionary, which are the counts of each a_i.

For each count cnt:

- If cnt >= 3, it adds the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same a_i, which is comb(cnt, 3).

- If cnt >= 2, it adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with the same a_i and one stick with a different a_i, which is comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum, where total_sum is the sum of counts of all other a_i's.

Finally, it prints the result.

Wait a minute, is this correct?

Let's think about what this code is calculating.

It's calculating the total number of ways to choose 3 sticks where either all three have the same a_i, or exactly two have the same a_i and the third is different.

But, is this equivalent to forming a triangle?

Not necessarily.

In the first test case, where all a_i are 1, so all sticks have length 2, and any three sticks form a valid triangle. So, comb(7, 3) = 35, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, a_i = 3, 2, 1, 3, so lengths are 8, 4, 2, 8.

According to the code:

- cnt for a_i=1: 1

- cnt for a_i=2: 1

- cnt for a_i=3: 2

So, for cnt=2 (a_i=3):

- cnt >= 2: comb(2, 2) * (1 + 1) = 1 * 2 = 2

- cnt >= 3: not applicable

So, total res = 2, which matches the sample output.

In the third test case, a_i = 1, 2, 3, so lengths 2, 4, 8.

No three sticks can form a triangle, which matches res = 0.

In the fourth test case, only one stick, so res = 0, which is correct.

Wait, but is this logic generalizable?

Let's consider another example.

Suppose n=4, a_i = 1,1,2,2.

So, lengths are 2,2,4,4.

Possible combinations:

- 2,2,4: 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4 → not a triangle

- 2,4,4: 2 + 4 = 6 > 4 → valid

- 2,4,4: same as above

- 2,2,4: invalid

So, only two valid combinations.

According to the code:

- cnt for a_i=1: 2

- cnt for a_i=2: 2

For cnt=2 (a_i=1):

- comb(2,2) * (2) = 1 * 2 = 2

For cnt=2 (a_i=2):

- comb(2,2) * (2) = 1 * 2 = 2

Total res = 2 + 2 = 4, which is incorrect, as there should be only 2 valid combinations.

So, the code is overcounting in this case.

Hmm, so it seems the logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the code.

Let's look again.

The code calculates:

For each group of sticks with the same a_i (say, cnt):

- If cnt >= 3, add comb(cnt, 3)

- If cnt >= 2, add comb(cnt, 2) * (total sticks with different a_i)

But in the example I just gave, this would add comb(2,2) * 2 + comb(2,2) * 2 = 1*2 + 1*2 = 4, but there are only 2 valid triangles.

So, it's overcounting.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Let's see why it's overcounting in my example.

In my example, a_i = 1,1,2,2, lengths = 2,2,4,4.

The valid triangles are:

- 2,4,4

- 2,4,4

So, two valid triangles.

But according to the code:

For a_i=1 (cnt=2):

- comb(2,2) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2

For a_i=2 (cnt=2):

- comb(2,2) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2

Total res = 4

So, it's counting each valid triangle twice.

Because when cnt=2 (a_i=1), it's considering pairs of a_i=1 with any a_i !=1, which includes a_i=2 sticks.

Similarly, when cnt=2 (a_i=2), it's considering pairs of a_i=2 with any a_i !=2, which includes a_i=1 sticks.

But in reality, each triangle is being counted twice this way.

Hence, overcounting.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, it worked.

In the first test case, all a_i are 1, so cnt=7.

res += comb(7,3) = 35, which is correct.

In the second test case, a_i=3,2,1,3, so cnt for 1:1, 2:1, 3:2.

For cnt=2 (a_i=3):

res += comb(2,2) * (1+1) = 1 * 2 = 2

No cnt >=3, so total res=2, which is correct.

In my example, a_i=1,1,2,2:

cnt=2 for a_i=1 and cnt=2 for a_i=2.

res += comb(2,2)*2 + comb(2,2)*2 = 1*2 + 1*2 = 4, but correct answer is 2.

So, overcounting.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's another way to interpret the code.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to count the number of ways to choose three sticks where at least two have the same a_i.

But that's not correct either, because in the first test case, all have the same a_i, and it's counting comb(7,3)=35, which is correct, but in my example, it's overcounting.

Alternatively, maybe the code is intended to count the number of ways to choose two sticks with the same a_i and one with a different a_i, under the assumption that this always forms a valid triangle, which is not true, as shown in my example.

Wait, in my example, choosing two sticks of length 4 and one of length 2 does form a valid triangle, but choosing two sticks of length 2 and one of length 4 does not.

But according to the code, it's adding comb(2,2)*2 + comb(2,2)*2 =4, which is more than the actual number of valid triangles.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the correct approach should be to consider the triangle inequality properly.

Given that all lengths are powers of two, and considering the property that each power of two is greater than the sum of all smaller powers of two, the only way to have three lengths form a triangle is if the two smaller lengths sum to more than the largest length.

Given that, with powers of two, this is only possible if the two smaller lengths are equal and the largest is less than their sum.

Wait, in my earlier example: lengths 2,2,4 → 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4, so it's not a valid triangle.

Wait, but according to the sample input, in the second test case, it's considered valid.

Wait, in the second test case, lengths are 8,4,2,8.

So, combinations are:

- 2,4,8: invalid

- 2,8,8: 2 + 8 = 10 > 8 → valid

- 4,8,8: 4 + 8 = 12 > 8 → valid

Hence, two valid triangles.

But according to the code, it's adding comb(2,2)*2 + comb(2,2)*2 =4, but the correct answer is 2.

Wait, perhaps the code is not correctly accounting for the triangle inequality.

I think the correct approach is to sort the lengths and then iterate through combinations where the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.

Given that the lengths are powers of two, which are unique and ordered, perhaps there's a smarter way to count the valid combinations without checking every possible triplet.

Let me think differently.

Since the lengths are powers of two, let's consider that each a_i corresponds to a unique power of two.

So, for each unique a_i, let's say we have counts c1, c2, c3, ..., ck for a_i1, a_i2, a_i3, ..., a_ik.

To form a triangle, we need to choose three lengths such that the sum of the two smaller ones is greater than the largest one.

Given the properties of powers of two, for three lengths 2^a, 2^b, 2^c where a <= b <= c, the condition 2^a + 2^b > 2^c must hold.

Now, because 2^c is the largest, and 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{b+1}, the condition 2^{b+1} > 2^c must hold, which implies b+1 > c, or c < b+1.

But since c >= b, the only way c < b+1 is if c == b.

Wait, if c > b, then c >= b+1, which would violate the condition c < b+1.

Hence, the only way to have 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is if c == b.

But c >= b, so if c == b, then the condition becomes 2^a + 2^b > 2^b, which simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

Hence, as long as c == b, the condition holds.

In other words, for any three lengths where the two larger ones are equal, the condition holds.

Wait, but in my earlier example, 2,2,4 should not form a triangle, but according to this, if the two larger ones are equal, it should hold.

Wait, in that case, 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, c == b implies 2^a + 2^b > 2^c = 2^b, which is 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4.

So, there's a mistake in the logic.

Let me re-examine.

Given a <= b <= c, and c == b, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c = 2^b.

This simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, if a < b and c == b, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^b.

But 2^a + 2^b = 2^b * (2^{a-b} + 1).

Since a <= b, 2^{a-b} <= 1, so 2^b * (2^{a-b} + 1) <= 2^b * (1 + 1) = 2^{b+1}.

But since c == b, we have 2^a + 2^b <= 2^{b+1}, but we need 2^a + 2^b > 2^c = 2^b.

So, 2^a + 2^b > 2^b implies 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in practice, when a < b and c == b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b * (2^{a-b} + 1) <= 2^b * 2 = 2^{b+1}, but we need it to be greater than 2^b.

So, 2^b * (2^{a-b} + 1) > 2^b implies 2^{a-b} + 1 > 1, which simplifies to 2^{a-b} > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, when a < b and c == b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b * (2^{a-b} + 1).

If a < b, then 2^{a-b} < 1, so 2^b * (less than 1 + 1) = 2^b * (something less than 2), which may or may not be greater than 2^b.

Wait, no: 2^{a-b} + 1 <= 2, but greater than 1.

So, 2^b * (something between 1 and 2) is between 2^b and 2^{b+1}.

So, 2^a + 2^b is between 2^b and 2^{b+1}.

But we need it to be greater than 2^c = 2^b.

So, 2^a + 2^b > 2^b is always true, but in practice, for a < b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}, but 2^{b+1} > 2^b, so 2^a + 2^b could be greater than 2^b.

Wait, but in the earlier example, 2 + 2 = 4 > 2, which is true, but in the case of 2 + 2 = 4 > 4, it's not greater.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify:

Given a <= b <= c, and c == b, then 2^a + 2^b > 2^c = 2^b.

This simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, if a < b, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a.

Since 2^a < 2^b, 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}.

But 2^c = 2^b.

So, 2^b + 2^a > 2^b implies 2^a > 0, which is always true.

Hence, in theory, any three lengths where the two larger ones are equal should form a valid triangle.

But in practice, as in the example I gave earlier, 2,2,4 does not form a valid triangle because 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c should hold as 2^a > 0, which is always true.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

I think the issue is that when a < b and c == b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a.

Now, 2^b + 2^a > 2^b is equivalent to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, for the triangle inequality, we need 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, which is 2^a + 2^b > 2^b.

This simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

However, in practice, when a < b and c == b, 2^a + 2^b may or may not be greater than 2^c.

Wait, in the case where a < b and c == b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a.

Since 2^a < 2^b, 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}.

But 2^c = 2^b.

So, 2^b + 2^a > 2^b is equivalent to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, if a < b, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^b.

But in the specific case where a = b - 1, 2^{b-1} + 2^b = 2^{b-1} + 2^{b} = 2^{b-1} * (1 + 2) = 2^{b-1} * 3.

Wait, that's not correct.

Actually, 2^{b-1} + 2^b = 2^{b-1} + 2^{b} = 2^{b-1} * (1 + 2) = 2^{b-1} * 3 = 3 * 2^{b-1}.

But 2^c = 2^b.

So, 3 * 2^{b-1} > 2^b?

3 * 2^{b-1} = 3 / 2 * 2^b = 1.5 * 2^b > 2^b, since 1.5 > 1.

Hence, in this case, it's greater.

Wait, but in the earlier example, 2 + 2 = 4, which is not greater than 4.

Wait, but in this case, a = b, which is different from a < b.

Wait, in the earlier example, a = b.

Wait, no, in the earlier example, a = b = 1, and c = 3, but wait, no, in my example, a_i =1,1,2,2, so lengths are 2,2,4,4.

So, for sticks 2,2,4:

a=1, b=1, c=2.

So, a < b is not true here, since a = b.

Wait, in this case, a=1, b=1, c=2.

So, 2^a + 2^b = 2 + 2 = 4, which is equal to 2^c = 4.

But the triangle inequality requires strict inequality: 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

So, in this case, 4 == 4, which does not satisfy the condition.

Hence, it's invalid.

But according to the earlier logic, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true, but in reality, when a = b and c = b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^{b} + 2^{b} = 2^{b+1}.

Comparing to 2^c = 2^b.

So, 2^{b+1} > 2^b, which is true.

Hence, when a = b = c, it's valid.

But in my earlier example, a=1, b=1, c=2, which is 2,2,4.

In this case, a = b < c, and 2^a + 2^b = 2 + 2 = 4, which is equal to 2^c = 4, which does not satisfy the strict inequality.

Hence, it's invalid.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true, but in reality, when a = b and c = b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^c = 2^b.

Hence, it should be valid.

Wait, but in my example, a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 = 4, which is equal to 2^c =4, which does not satisfy the strict inequality.

Wait, but 2^a + 2^b = 2 + 2 =4, and 2^c =4, so 4 > 4 is false.

Hence, it's invalid.

But according to the earlier logic, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is true, but in reality, it's not sufficient.

I think the mistake is in assuming that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is always true when c == b.

In reality, when a < b and c == b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a.

If a < b, then 2^a < 2^b, so 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}.

But 2^c = 2^b.

So, 2^b + 2^a > 2^b is equivalent to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in practice, if a < b, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a < 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^b, so it should be valid.

Wait, but in my example, a=1, b=1, c=2: a < b is false, since a = b.

Hence, in this case, a = b, c =2.

Wait, in this case, a = b.

Wait, in general, for a <= b <= c, and c == b, we have two subcases:

1. a < b: in this case, 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^b, so 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

2. a == b: in this case, 2^a + 2^b = 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^c =2^b.

Hence, in both subcases, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c holds.

But in my earlier example, a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 =4, which is equal to 2^c=4, which does not satisfy the strict inequality.

Wait, but 2^1 + 2^1 = 2 + 2 =4, which is equal to 2^2=4.

So, in this specific case, when a = b and c = b +1, it fails.

Wait, c cannot be equal to b if a < b.

Wait, in my earlier logic, c == b.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the relationship between a, b, and c more carefully.

Given that a <= b <= c, and c == b, then:

- If a < b, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^b + 2^a < 2^b + 2^b = 2^{b+1}.

But 2^{b+1} > 2^b, but 2^a + 2^b could be equal to 2^b if a = b -1.

Wait, in my example, a=1, b=1, c=2: a < b is false, since a=b.

Hence, this is a different case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a <= b <= c, with c == b.

Wait, if c == b, then a <= b = c.

Hence, 2^a + 2^b = 2^a + 2^b.

We need 2^a + 2^b > 2^c =2^b.

This simplifies to 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, when a < b, 2^a + 2^b < 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^b.

Hence, it should be valid.

But in the case where a = b, and c = b, 2^a + 2^b = 2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^c =2^b.

Hence, it should be valid.

But in my earlier example, a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 =4, which is equal to 2^c=4, which does not satisfy the strict inequality.

Wait, but 2^1 + 2^1 =2 +2=4, and 2^c=4, so 4 > 4 is false.

Hence, it's invalid.

But according to the earlier logic, 2^a + 2^b > 2^c simplifies to 2^a >0, which is always true.

So, there must be a mistake in this simplification.

Let me re-examine the simplification.

Given 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, with c == b.

So, 2^a + 2^b > 2^b.

Subtract 2^b from both sides: 2^a > 0, which is always true.

But in reality, when a < b, 2^a + 2^b =2^b +2^a < 2^b +2^b =2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^b.

Hence, 2^a + 2^b > 2^b is true.

But in the case where a = b, and c = b, 2^a + 2^b =2^{b+1}, which is greater than 2^b.

Hence, it should be valid.

But in my earlier example, a=1, b=1, c=2: 2 + 2 =4, which is equal to 2^c=4.

Wait, but if a=1, b=1, c=2, then 2^a + 2^b =2 +2=4, which is equal to 2^c=4.

Hence, it does not satisfy the strict inequality.

So, in this specific case, even though a = b, and c = b, it fails because a < c.

Wait, but c == b, so a <= b == c.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a < c, even if c == b, the sum is not necessarily greater than 2^c.

Hence, the earlier simplification is incorrect.

Hence, the condition 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is not always true, even if c == b.

Hence, the earlier logic is flawed.

So, to correctly count the number of valid triangles, I need to ensure that for any three lengths 2^a, 2^b, 2^c with a <= b <= c, the condition 2^a + 2^b > 2^c holds.

Given that, and considering the properties of powers of two, perhaps the only way to have 2^a + 2^b > 2^c is when a and b are both equal to c, or something like that.

Wait, in the case where a = c -1 and b = c, then 2^{c-1} + 2^c =2^{c-1} + 2^c =2^{c-1}(1 + 2) =3*2^{c-1}, which is greater than 2^c if 3*2^{c-1} > 2^c.

Simplify: 3*2^{c-1} > 2^c ⇒ 3*2^{c-1} > 2*2^{c-1} ⇒ 3 > 2, which is always true.

Hence, in this case, it's valid.

But in the case where a = c -1 and b = c -1, then 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} =2^c, which is equal to 2^c, not greater.

Hence, it's invalid.

So, in this specific case, it's invalid.

Hence, the general rule is:

For three lengths 2^a, 2^b, 2^c with a <= b <= c, the condition 2^a + 2^b > 2^c holds unless a = b = c -1.

Hence, to count the number of valid triangles, we need to count all combinations where a <= b <= c and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, excluding the cases where a = b = c -1.

Given that, perhaps it's better to sort the exponents and then iterate through possible triplets, checking the condition.

But considering the constraints, with n up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 3*10^5, we need an efficient algorithm, better than O(n^3).

Hence, we need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the frequency of each exponent.

Suppose we have frequencies f0, f1, f2, ..., fm for exponents 0 to m.

Given that, for three exponents a <= b <= c, we need 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that 2^c is the largest, and 2^a + 2^b must be greater than 2^c.

Given the properties of exponents, perhaps we can iterate through possible c values and find pairs (a,b) where a <= b and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But this seems inefficient.

Alternatively, for each c, find the minimum b such that for a given c, and b, there exists an a where 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps we can iterate through c from smallest to largest, and for each c, determine the number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b and a, b < c such that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that, and knowing that exponents are sorted, perhaps we can find for each c, the number of pairs (a,b) where a <= b < c and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But still, this seems non-trivial.

Alternatively, perhaps precompute for each possible b, the minimum a needed for 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But this is getting too involved.

Let me consider that for 2^a + 2^b > 2^c, given a <= b <= c, we can find the relationship between a, b, and c.

Take logarithm base 2:

log2(2^a + 2^b) > c.

But log2(2^a + 2^b) = b + log2(2^{a-b} + 1).

So, b + log2(2^{a-b} + 1) > c.

This seems messy.

Alternatively, consider that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

If a < b, then 2^a + 2^b = 2^a (1 + 2^{b-a}) = 2^a * (1 + 2^{b-a}).

This needs to be greater than 2^c.

So, 2^a * (1 + 2^{b-a}) > 2^c.

Take log2:

a + log2(1 + 2^{b-a}) > c.

This still seems complicated.

Perhaps it's better to iterate through possible c values and find for each c, the number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c such that 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that, perhaps we can iterate c from smallest to largest, keep track of the frequencies of a and b below c, and compute the number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

But how to efficiently compute the number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c and 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that, perhaps for each c, find the minimal b such that for a given c and b, there exists an a where 2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Given that, perhaps b must be at least c -1 or something like that.

Wait, let's consider:

2^a + 2^b > 2^c.

Assume a <= b < c.

Then, 2^b >= 2^a, so 2^a + 2^b <= 2*2^b.

So, 2*2^b > 2^c ⇒ 2^{b+1} > 2^c ⇒ b+1 > c ⇒ c < b+1.

But since b < c, this would imply c < b+1, which is always true since b < c.

Hence, this condition is always true.

Wait, but in my earlier example, when a = b = c -1, 2^a + 2^b = 2^{c-1} + 2^{c-1} = 2^c, which is not greater than 2^c.

Hence, in this specific case, it's invalid.

Hence, for a <= b < c, the condition 2^a + 2^b > 2^c holds unless a = b = c -1.

Hence, for each c, the number of valid pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c and (a,b) != (c-1, c-1) is the total number of pairs where a <= b < c, minus the number of pairs where a = b = c-1.

Hence, the number of valid triangles for each c is:

total pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c minus the number of pairs where a = b = c-1.

Given that, we can compute for each c, the number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c, which is the sum of frequencies of a from 0 to c-1, choosing two with replacement.

Then, subtract the number of pairs where a = b = c-1.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for each c, the number of valid pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c is equal to the total number of pairs with a <= b < c, minus the invalid pairs where a = b = c-1.

Hence, total pairs with a <= b < c is sum_{k=0}^{c-1} f_k * (f_k + 1)/2 + sum_{k < l < c} f_k * f_l.

But this is too slow to compute for each c.

Given time constraints, perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider precomputing prefix sums of frequencies.

Let freq[a] be the frequency of exponent a.

Compute prefix sums s[c] = sum_{a=0}^{c-1} freq[a].

Then, the total number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c is:

sum_{a=0}^{c-1} freq[a] * (freq[a] + 1) / 2 + sum_{a=0}^{c-1} sum_{b=a+1}^{c-1} freq[a] * freq[b]

This is equal to C(s[c], 2), the number of ways to choose two distinct elements from the first c exponents.

But wait, C(s[c], 2) counts the number of ways to choose two distinct exponents less than c, but we need to count the number of pairs (a,b) with a <= b < c.

Hence, the number of such pairs is sum_{a=0}^{c-1} freq[a] * (freq[a] + 1) / 2 + sum_{a=0}^{c-1} sum_{b=a+1}^{c-1} freq[a] * freq[b].

This is equal to C(s[c], 2), where s[c] is the total number of exponents less than c.

Hence, for each c, the number of valid pairs (a
