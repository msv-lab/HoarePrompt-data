Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform this specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position, in the order they appear. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if, by performing this operation any number of times (or zero times), I can make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. So, I need to check if there's a sequence of operations that results in an array where each element is less than or equal to the next one.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When I choose an element that's at least 10, I remove it and insert its digits in the same position. So, for a number like 123, it would be replaced by 1, 2, 3 in that order. This operation can be applied any number of times, including zero, to any qualifying elements in the array.

I need to think about how this operation affects the array. Each time I apply it, I'm essentially splitting a number into its constituent digits, which are single-digit numbers. So, the operation allows me to break down multi-digit numbers into smaller parts.

My goal is to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. That means, after all operations (or none), the array should satisfy a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= ... <= an for some n.

I should consider what the possible states of the array are after applying the operations. Since I can apply the operation multiple times, I need to consider all possible sequences of operations.

But considering all possible sequences sounds computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 50. So, I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about what happens when I apply the operation to a number. For example, if I have 12, it can be split into 1 and 2. If I have 28, it can be split into 2 and 8. If I have 45, it becomes 4 and 5.

In the first test case, [12, 3, 45, 67], the sample output is YES, and the explanation says that by splitting the first element, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

In the second test case, [12, 28, 5], the output is NO, meaning there's no way to make it sorted by splitting numbers as allowed.

In the third test case, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so the output is YES.

From these examples, it seems that splitting numbers can help in making the array sorted, but there are limitations based on the values of the numbers and their digits.

I need to find a general way to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted by splitting numbers as needed.

One approach could be to consider each number in the array and consider all possible ways it can be split into digits, and then see if there's a combination of these splits that results in a sorted array.

However, since n can be up to 50, and each number can be up to 99, which means at most two digits, the number of possible splits isn't too bad.

Wait, numbers can be up to 99, which means they can have at most two digits. So, for any number greater than or equal to 10, it can be split into two single-digit numbers.

Numbers less than 10 are already single digits and can't be split further.

So, for each number in the array, if it's greater than or equal to 10, I have the choice to keep it as is or split it into its two digits.

My task is to make a sequence where, after choosing for each number whether to split it or not, the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Wait, but the operation allows me to perform the splitting any number of times, not just once. But since splitting a number into digits doesn't allow further operations on those digits (as they are less than 10), perhaps it's sufficient to consider each number as either itself or its split digits.

But let's confirm: when I split a number, say 12 into 1 and 2, those 1 and 2 can't be split further because they are less than 10. So, for each number, the possible choices are to keep it as is (if it's less than 10 or if it's >=10 and I choose not to split), or to split it into its digits.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as, for each element, if it's >=10, I have two options: keep it as is or split it into its digits. Then, I need to check if there's a combination of these choices that results in a sorted array.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array, maintaining a current minimum value that the next element (or its split parts) should be greater than or equal to.

Wait, but I need to consider the order of elements. When I split a number, its digits are inserted in the same position, so the order is preserved.

For example, [12, 3, 45, 67]:

- If I split 12 into 1 and 2, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

- If I don't split 12, it remains [12, 3, 45, 67], which is not sorted because 12 > 3.

- If I split 45 into 4 and 5, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. If I also split 12 into 1 and 2, it's [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is sorted.

But in the first sample, it says that splitting only 12 is enough to make it sorted, which is [1, 2, 3, 45, 67].

So, in this approach, for each element, I need to consider both options: splitting it or not, and see if there's a path that leads to a sorted array.

However, with n up to 50, and each element having up to 2 choices (split or not, if >=10), the total number of possibilities could be up to 2^50, which is too large to compute explicitly.

Therefore, I need a more efficient way to determine if a sorted array can be achieved.

Perhaps I can think of it in terms of the maximum value seen so far as I iterate through the array, choosing to split or not split each element.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the sequence is non-decreasing.

Let me consider the array as a sequence, and for each position, decide whether to split the number or not, ensuring that the sequence remains non-decreasing up to that point.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the maximum value up to the current position, and check if the next element (or its split parts) is greater than or equal to that maximum.

But perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into its digits always results in smaller numbers, which could help in making the array sorted.

But in some cases, splitting might not be beneficial, as seen in the second sample input.

Wait, in the second sample input, [12, 28, 5], the sample output is NO.

Let's see why.

If I don't split any numbers, the array remains [12, 28, 5], which is not sorted because 28 > 5.

If I split 12 into 1 and 2, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. This is not sorted because 28 > 5.

If I split 28 into 2 and 8, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted because 8 > 5.

If I split 5 into 5 (it's already a single digit), it remains the same.

So, no matter what I do, I can't make this array sorted. Hence, the output is NO.

In the first sample, [12, 3, 45, 67], splitting 12 into 1 and 2 gives [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

In the third sample, [0, 0], it's already sorted.

So, the key is to consider all possible splits and see if any of those sequences are sorted.

But as mentioned earlier, with n up to 50, iterating over all possible combinations is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Perhaps I can flatten the array by considering all possible splits for each element and then check if there's a subsequence that is sorted.

Wait, but I need to consider the positions as well, since splitting inserts digits in the same position.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as expanding each element into a list of possible values: either the number itself if it's less than 10, or the digits if it's greater than or equal to 10.

Then, I need to choose, for each element, whether to use it as is or to use its digits, and see if the resulting sequence is sorted.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the array, keeping track of the maximum value so far, and ensure that the next element (or its split digits) is greater than or equal to the maximum so far.

But I need to handle the case where an element is split into multiple digits, which need to be considered in sequence.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define a function that takes the current position in the array and the current maximum value.

At each position, if the current element is less than 10, I have no choice but to take it as is, and check if it's >= the current maximum.

If it is, update the maximum and move to the next position.

If not, this path is invalid.

If the current element is >= 10, I have two choices: keep it as is or split it into its digits.

If I keep it as is, check if it's >= the current maximum, and if so, update the maximum and move to the next position.

If I split it, I need to consider each digit in sequence, and check if each digit is >= the current maximum, updating the maximum as I go.

Wait, but splitting inserts multiple digits in sequence, so I need to handle multiple steps in the array.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to flatten the array by considering all possible splits and then check if there's a sorted sequence that can be obtained.

But again, with n up to 50, this might not be efficient.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the array as is, without any splits, and check if it's sorted.

If it is, then I'm done.

If not, identify the positions where the array is not increasing, and see if splitting those elements can make the array sorted.

For example, in the first sample, [12, 3, 45, 67], it's not sorted because 12 > 3.

But if I split 12 into 1 and 2, then it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

So, splitting 12 helped to resolve the issue.

In the second sample, [12, 28, 5], it's not sorted because 28 > 5.

If I split 12 into 1 and 2, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5], which is still not sorted because 28 > 5.

If I split 28 into 2 and 8, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5], which is still not sorted because 8 > 5.

Splitting 5 doesn't help because it's already a single digit.

Hence, in this case, it's impossible to make the array sorted.

So, the key is to identify positions where the array is not increasing and see if splitting the elements at those positions can make the array increasing.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array, and at each step, consider the maximum possible value up to that point, and ensure that the next element (or its split digits) is greater than or equal to that maximum.

Wait, but I need to handle the case where splitting an element introduces multiple digits, which need to be considered in sequence.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

Looking at the given program:

m = int(input())

b = []

for i in range(m):

func_1()

for i in range(m):

if b[i] == 1:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

def func_1():

k = int(input())

a = input()

a = list(map(int, a.split()))

x = 0

y = 0

n = 0

c = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:

x = int(a[i] % 10)

y = int(a[i] / 10)

if y >= c[n - 1]:

if y <= x:

c.append(y)

c.append(x)

n = n + 2

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:

x = int(a[i] % 10)

y = int(a[i] / 10)

if y <= x:

c.append(y)

c.append(x)

n = n + 2

else:

c.append(a[i])

n = n + 1

d = sorted(c)

if c == d:

b.append(1)

else:

b.append(0)

So, the program defines a function func_1() that seems to process each test case.

It reads the input values, processes them, and appends a 1 to list b if the processed array is sorted, else 0.

Then, after processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in list b.

Now, let's understand what func_1() is doing.

It reads the integer k (which is n, the length of the array), then reads the array a.

Then, it initializes some variables and creates an empty list c.

It iterates through the array a, and for each element:

- If the element is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, it splits the number into its digits x (units place) and y (tens place).

- It checks if y is greater than or equal to the last element in c (c[n-1]).

- If y <= x, it appends y and x to c, increasing n by 2.

- Else, it appends the original number a[i] to c, increasing n by 1.

- If i == 0 and a[i] > 10, it splits a[i] into x and y, and if y <= x, appends y and x to c, else appends a[i].

- If a[i] < 10, it appends a[i] to c.

After processing all elements, it sorts c and checks if the processed array c is equal to its sorted version.

If yes, appends 1 to b, else appends 0.

Wait, this seems somewhat similar to what I was thinking earlier, but it's not entirely clear.

Let me see what it's doing step by step for the first sample input.

First sample input:

4

12 3 45 67

So, k = 4, a = [12, 3, 45, 67]

Initialize x=0, y=0, n=0, c=[]

Iterate through a:

i=0, a[0]=12 > 10 and i==0:

x = 12 % 10 = 2

y = 12 / 10 = 1.0 (but int(a[i]/10) = 1)

Check if y <= x: 1 <= 2, so append y and x to c: c=[1,2], n=2

i=1, a[1]=3 < 10, append 3 to c: c=[1,2,3], n=3

i=2, a[2]=45 > 10 and i>0:

x = 45 % 10 = 5

y = 45 / 10 = 4.0 (int:4)

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=4 >= c[2]=3, which is true.

Then, check if y <= x: 4 <=5, which is true, so append y and x to c: c=[1,2,3,4,5], n=5

i=3, a[3]=67 >10 and i>0:

x=67%10=7, y=67/10=6.0 (int:6)

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=6 >= c[4]=5, which is true.

Check if y <=x: 6 <=7, which is true, so append y and x to c: c=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], n=7

Now, sorted(c) is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which matches c, so append 1 to b.

Hence, it correctly identifies the first sample as YES.

Second sample input:

3

12 28 5

k=3, a=[12,28,5]

c=[]

i=0, a[0]=12 >10 and i==0:

x=12%10=2, y=12/10=1.0 (int:1)

y <=x: 1<=2, so append 1 and 2 to c: c=[1,2], n=2

i=1, a[1]=28 >10 and i>0:

x=28%10=8, y=28/10=2.0 (int:2)

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=2 >= c[1]=2, which is true.

Check if y <=x: 2<=8, which is true, so append 2 and 8 to c: c=[1,2,2,8], n=4

i=2, a[2]=5 <10, append 5 to c: c=[1,2,2,8,5], n=5

Now, sorted(c) is [1,2,2,5,8], which is not equal to c=[1,2,2,8,5], so append 0 to b.

Hence, correctly identifies the second sample as NO.

Third sample input:

2

0 0

k=2, a=[0,0]

c=[]

i=0, a[0]=0 <10, append 0 to c: c=[0], n=1

i=1, a[1]=0 <10, append 0 to c: c=[0,0], n=2

sorted(c) is [0,0], which matches c, so append 1 to b.

Hence, correctly identifies the third sample as YES.

So, the program seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

Looking back at the logic:

- For the first element, if it's >=10, split it into digits and append them in order only if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit.

- For subsequent elements, if they are >=10, split them into digits and append them only if the first digit is greater than or equal to the last digit of the previous element in c, and the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit.

- If the element is <10, append it as is.

- Finally, check if the resulting list c is sorted.

Wait, but in the first sample, when splitting 12 into 1 and 2, it appends 1 and 2 because y=1 <= x=2.

Then, when splitting 45 into 4 and 5, y=4 <=x=5, and y=4 >= c[n-1]=3.

Similarly, for 67 into 6 and 7, y=6 <=x=7, and y=6 >= c[n-1]=5.

So, it builds c=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], which is sorted.

In the second sample, splitting 12 into 1 and 2, y=1 <=x=2, and appends to c=[1,2].

Then, splitting 28 into 2 and 8, y=2 <=x=8, and y=2 >= c[n-1]=2, so appends 2 and 8 to c=[1,2,2,8].

Then, append 5 to c=[1,2,2,8,5], which is not sorted.

But, is there another way to split the elements to make it sorted?

For example, what if we don't split 28, keeping it as 28?

Then, c would be [1,2,28,5], which is not sorted.

Or, split 28 into 2 and 8, and don't split 12, so c=[12,28,5], not sorted.

Or, split 12 into 1 and 2, and keep 28 as is, c=[1,2,28,5], not sorted.

Or, split both 12 and 28, c=[1,2,2,8,5], still not sorted.

So, in this case, it's correctly identifying that it's impossible to make it sorted.

Hence, the logic seems to be working correctly for these cases.

But I need to think if there are any edge cases where this logic might fail.

Consider a case where splitting a number could lead to digits that are smaller than previous elements, but the original number is larger.

For example:

n=3

a=[15, 2, 30]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=15 >10 and i==0:

x=5, y=1

y <=x: 1<=5, so append 1 and 5 to c: c=[1,5], n=2

i=1, a[1]=2 <10, append 2 to c: c=[1,5,2], n=3

i=2, a[2]=30 >10 and i>0:

x=0, y=3

Check if y >= c[n-1]: 3 >=2, which is true.

Check if y <=x: 3 <=0, which is false, so append a[2]=30 to c: c=[1,5,2,30], n=4

Now, sorted(c) is [1,2,5,30], which is not equal to c=[1,5,2,30], so output NO.

But is there another way to split the elements to make it sorted?

Option 1: split 15 into 1 and 5, keep 2 as is, split 30 into 3 and 0: [1,5,2,3,0], which is not sorted.

Option 2: split 15 into 1 and 5, split 30 into 3 and 0: [1,5,30,3,0], not sorted.

Option 3: keep 15 as is, split 30 into 3 and 0: [15,2,3,0], not sorted.

Option 4: keep both 15 and 30 as is: [15,2,30], not sorted.

So, in this case, it's correctly identifying that it's impossible to make it sorted.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[20,1,21]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=20 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=2

y <=x: 2 <=0? No, so append a[0]=20 to c: c=[20], n=1

i=1, a[1]=1 <10, append 1 to c: c=[20,1], n=2

i=2, a[2]=21 >10 and i>0:

x=1, y=2

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=2 >= c[1]=1, which is true.

Check if y <=x: 2 <=1? No, so append a[2]=21 to c: c=[20,1,21], n=3

sorted(c) is [1,20,21], which is not equal to c=[20,1,21], so output NO.

Is there a way to make it sorted?

Option 1: split 20 into 2 and 0, keep 1 as is, keep 21 as is: [2,0,1,21], not sorted.

Option 2: split 20 into 2 and 0, split 21 into 2 and 1: [2,0,2,1], not sorted.

Option 3: keep 20 as is, split 21 into 2 and 1: [20,1,2,1], not sorted.

Option 4: keep both as is: [20,1,21], not sorted.

So, correctly identifies as NO.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[11,11]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=11 >10 and i==0:

x=1, y=1

y <=x: 1<=1, so append 1 and 1 to c: c=[1,1], n=2

i=1, a[1]=11 >10 and i>0:

x=1, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[1]=1, which is true.

Check if y <=x: 1<=1, so append 1 and 1 to c: c=[1,1,1,1], n=4

sorted(c) is [1,1,1,1], which equals c, so output YES.

This is correct.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[19,18]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=19 >10 and i==0:

x=9, y=1

y <=x: 1<=9, so append 1 and 9 to c: c=[1,9], n=2

i=1, a[1]=18 >10 and i>0:

x=8, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[1]=9? No, so append a[1]=18 to c: c=[1,9,18], n=3

sorted(c) is [1,9,18], which equals c, so output YES.

But is this the only way? Let's see:

Option 1: split 19 into 1 and 9, split 18 into 1 and 8: [1,9,1,8], which is not sorted.

Option 2: split 19 into 1 and 9, keep 18 as is: [1,9,18], which is sorted.

Option 3: keep 19 as is, split 18 into 1 and 8: [19,1,8], not sorted.

Option 4: keep both as is: [19,18], not sorted.

So, in this case, the program correctly identifies it as YES.

Wait, but according to the program, it appends 1 and 9 for 19, then since y=1 < c[n-1]=9, it appends a[1]=18, resulting in [1,9,18], which is sorted.

But according to the program's logic, it appends a[i] when y < c[n-1], which in this case is 18.

But in the code, for i>0 and a[i]>10, it checks if y >= c[n-1]. If yes and y <=x, appends y and x; else, appends a[i].

In this case, y=1 < c[n-1]=9, so it appends a[i]=18.

Then, [1,9,18] is sorted, so output YES.

But is this the correct approach?

Wait, in this case, y=1 < c[n-1]=9, so it appends a[i]=18.

But 18 is greater than c[n-1]=9, so it's okay.

Wait, but 18 is greater than 9, so [1,9,18] is sorted.

But what if a[i] is less than c[n-1]?

For example:

n=2

a=[19,8]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=19 >10 and i==0:

x=9, y=1

y <=x: 1<=9, so append 1 and 9 to c: c=[1,9], n=2

i=1, a[1]=8 <10, append 8 to c: c=[1,9,8], n=3

sorted(c) is [1,8,9], which is not equal to c=[1,9,8], so output NO.

Is there another way?

Option 1: split 19 into 1 and 9, keep 8 as is: [1,9,8], not sorted.

Option 2: keep 19 as is, keep 8 as is: [19,8], not sorted.

Option 3: split 19 into 1 and 9, split 8 into 8 (it's already single digit): [1,9,8], not sorted.

So, correctly identifies as NO.

Another test case:

n=1

a=[9]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=9 <10, append 9 to c: c=[9], n=1

sorted(c) is [9], which equals c, so output YES.

Correct.

n=1

a=[10]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

sorted(c) is [10], which equals c, so output YES.

Correct.

n=2

a=[10,1]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=1 <10, append 1 to c: c=[10,1], n=2

sorted(c) is [1,10], which is not equal to c=[10,1], so output NO.

Is there another way?

Option 1: split 10 into 1 and 0, keep 1 as is: [1,0,1], not sorted.

Option 2: keep 10 as is, keep 1 as is: [10,1], not sorted.

Option 3: split 10 into 1 and 0, split 1 into 1: [1,0,1], not sorted.

So, correctly identifies as NO.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[10,11,12]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=11 >10 and i>0:

x=1, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[0]=10? No, so append a[1]=11 to c: c=[10,11], n=2

i=2, a[2]=12 >10 and i>0:

x=2, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[1]=11? No, so append a[2]=12 to c: c=[10,11,12], n=3

sorted(c) is [10,11,12], which equals c, so output YES.

But is this correct?

Option 1: keep 10 as is, keep 11 as is, keep 12 as is: [10,11,12], which is sorted.

Option 2: split 10 into 1 and 0, split 11 into 1 and 1, split 12 into 1 and 2: [1,0,1,1,1,2], which is not sorted.

Option 3: other combinations would not be sorted.

So, correctly identifies as YES.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[21,12]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=21 >10 and i==0:

x=1, y=2

y <=x: 2<=1? No, so append a[0]=21 to c: c=[21], n=1

i=1, a[1]=12 >10 and i>0:

x=2, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[0]=21? No, so append a[1]=12 to c: c=[21,12], n=2

sorted(c) is [12,21], which is not equal to c=[21,12], so output NO.

Is there another way?

Option 1: split 21 into 2 and 1, split 12 into 1 and 2: [2,1,1,2], which is not sorted.

Option 2: split 21 into 2 and 1, keep 12 as is: [2,1,12], which is not sorted.

Option 3: keep 21 as is, split 12 into 1 and 2: [21,1,2], not sorted.

Option 4: keep both as is: [21,12], not sorted.

So, correctly identifies as NO.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[10,11,12,13]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=11 >10 and i>0:

x=1, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[0]=10? No, so append a[1]=11 to c: c=[10,11], n=2

i=2, a[2]=12 >10 and i>0:

x=2, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[1]=11? No, so append a[2]=12 to c: c=[10,11,12], n=3

i=3, a[3]=13 >10 and i>0:

x=3, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[2]=12? No, so append a[3]=13 to c: c=[10,11,12,13], n=4

sorted(c) is [10,11,12,13], which equals c, so output YES.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[10,15,2]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=15 >10 and i>0:

x=5, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[0]=10? No, so append a[1]=15 to c: c=[10,15], n=2

i=2, a[2]=2 <10, append 2 to c: c=[10,15,2], n=3

sorted(c) is [2,10,15], which is not equal to c=[10,15,2], so output NO.

Is there another way?

Option 1: split 10 into 1 and 0, split 15 into 1 and 5, keep 2 as is: [1,0,1,5,2], not sorted.

Option 2: split 10 into 1 and 0, keep 15 as is, keep 2 as is: [1,0,15,2], not sorted.

Option 3: keep 10 as is, split 15 into 1 and 5, keep 2 as is: [10,1,5,2], not sorted.

Option 4: keep both 10 and 15 as is, keep 2 as is: [10,15,2], not sorted.

So, correctly identifies as NO.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[10,11,12,13,14]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=11 >10 and i>0:

x=1, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[0]=10? No, so append a[1]=11 to c: c=[10,11], n=2

i=2, a[2]=12 >10 and i>0:

x=2, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[1]=11? No, so append a[2]=12 to c: c=[10,11,12], n=3

i=3, a[3]=13 >10 and i>0:

x=3, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[2]=12? No, so append a[3]=13 to c: c=[10,11,12,13], n=4

i=4, a[4]=14 >10 and i>0:

x=4, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[3]=13? No, so append a[4]=14 to c: c=[10,11,12,13,14], n=5

sorted(c) is [10,11,12,13,14], which equals c, so output YES.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[10,9]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=9 <10, append 9 to c: c=[10,9], n=2

sorted(c) is [9,10], which is not equal to c=[10,9], so output NO.

Is there another way?

Option 1: split 10 into 1 and 0, keep 9 as is: [1,0,9], which is not sorted.

Option 2: keep 10 as is, keep 9 as is: [10,9], not sorted.

So, correctly identifies as NO.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[10,10,10]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=10 >10 and i>0:

x=0, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[0]=10? No, so append a[1]=10 to c: c=[10,10], n=2

i=2, a[2]=10 >10 and i>0:

x=0, y=1

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=1 >= c[1]=10? No, so append a[2]=10 to c: c=[10,10,10], n=3

sorted(c) is [10,10,10], which equals c, so output YES.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[10,100]

Assuming 100 is allowed, though the problem says 0 <= a_i <=99, but just in case:

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=10 >10 and i==0:

x=0, y=1

y <=x: 1<=0? No, so append a[0]=10 to c: c=[10], n=1

i=1, a[1]=100 >10 and i>0:

x=0, y=10

Check if y >= c[n-1]: y=10 >= c[0]=10, which is true.

Check if y <=x: y=10 <=x=0? No, so append a[1]=100 to c: c=[10,100], n=2

sorted(c) is [10,100], which equals c, so output YES.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=2

a=[0,10]

According to the program:

i=0, a[0]=0 <10, append 0 to c: c=[0], n=1

i=1, a[1]=
