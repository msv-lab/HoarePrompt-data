Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and y is at least 1. The goal is to maximize the sum of y and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of x and y. So, I need to find y such that y + GCD(x, y) is as large as possible.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. For example, GCD of 6 and 4 is 2, as you mentioned.

So, for a given x, I need to pick y (where y < x) such that y + GCD(x, y) is maximized.

Let me think about this. Since y has to be less than x, the maximum y can be is x-1. So, for each x, I can iterate through all possible y from 1 to x-1, calculate y + GCD(x, y), and pick the y that gives the maximum value.

But, wait, iterating through all possible y for each x might not be efficient, especially if x can be up to 1000 and there are up to 1000 test cases. I need to think of a smarter way to find y without checking every single possibility.

Let me consider the properties of GCD. If y divides x (i.e., x is divisible by y), then GCD(x, y) is y itself because y is a divisor of x. So, in that case, y + GCD(x, y) = y + y = 2y.

If y does not divide x, then GCD(x, y) will be less than y, so y + GCD(x, y) will be less than 2y.

Comparing these two scenarios, it's better to have y that divides x because then y + GCD(x, y) = 2y, which is larger than y + some number less than y.

Wait, but y has to be less than x, so if y divides x, then 2y could be larger than x, but y is still less than x.

Let me take an example to see this better.

Take x = 10.

Possible y values are 1 to 9.

Let's compute y + GCD(x, y) for each:

- y=1: 1 + GCD(10,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + GCD(10,2)=2+2=4

- y=3: 3 + GCD(10,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + GCD(10,4)=4+2=6

- y=5: 5 + GCD(10,5)=5+5=10

- y=6: 6 + GCD(10,6)=6+2=8

- y=7: 7 + GCD(10,7)=7+1=8

- y=8: 8 + GCD(10,8)=8+2=10

- y=9: 9 + GCD(10,9)=9+1=10

So, the maximum value is 10, achieved by y=5, y=8, and y=9.

But according to the example output, for x=10, y=5 is chosen.

Similarly, for x=7, y=6 is chosen.

For x=21, y=18 is chosen.

For x=100, y=98 is chosen.

For x=2, y=1 is chosen.

For x=1000, y=750 is chosen.

For x=6, y=3 is chosen.

Looking at these, it seems that the program chooses the largest y that divides x, but not necessarily the largest possible y.

Wait, in x=10, y=5 divides x, and it's chosen.

In x=7, y=6 does not divide x (7%6 !=0), but GCD(7,6)=1, so y+GCD=7.

But in the output, y=6 is chosen, which gives 6+1=7.

But in x=10, y=5 gives 5+5=10, which is larger.

Wait, in x=7, y=6 gives 6+1=7, but y=1 gives 1+1=2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated for x=7.

Let's recalculate for x=7:

Possible y: 1 to 6.

- y=1: 1 + GCD(7,1)=1+1=2

- y=2: 2 + GCD(7,2)=2+1=3

- y=3: 3 + GCD(7,3)=3+1=4

- y=4: 4 + GCD(7,4)=4+1=5

- y=5: 5 + GCD(7,5)=5+1=6

- y=6: 6 + GCD(7,6)=6+1=7

So, the maximum is 7, achieved by y=6.

But y=6 does not divide x=7, since 7%6=1 ≠0.

So, in this case, y=6 is chosen, which does not divide x.

Wait, but earlier I thought that choosing y that divides x is better, but here y=6 doesn't divide x=7, but it still gives the maximum y + GCD.

So, maybe my initial assumption is not entirely correct.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that y + GCD(x, y) can be expressed in terms of their relationship.

Let’s denote d = GCD(x, y). Then, x = k*d and y = m*d, where k and m are co-prime integers.

Then, y + GCD(x, y) = m*d + d = d*(m + 1).

Our goal is to maximize d*(m + 1), given that y < x, which implies m*d < k*d, so m < k.

Since k = x/d, m < x/d.

We need to choose m and d such that m < x/d, and d*(m + 1) is maximized.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that for a fixed d, which is a divisor of x, I can choose y = m*d, where m < k.

But I'm complicating things.

Let me think about the possible values of y.

Since y < x, the possible y values are from 1 to x-1.

I need to maximize y + GCD(x, y).

Let me consider that GCD(x, y) is at most y, and it's y only when y divides x.

So, when y divides x, y + GCD(x, y) = y + y = 2*y.

When y does not divide x, GCD(x, y) < y, so y + GCD(x, y) < 2*y.

Therefore, it's better to choose y that divides x, because then y + GCD(x, y) = 2*y, which is larger than y + something less than y.

But in the case of x=7, y=6 gives y + GCD=7, which is larger than any y that divides x.

Wait, in x=7, y=1 divides x, since 7%1=0, GCD(7,1)=1, so y + GCD=2.

y=6 does not divide x, but y + GCD=7, which is larger.

So, in this case, choosing y that does not divide x gives a larger sum.

So, my initial assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, choosing y that divides x is not always better.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to consider the actual value of y + GCD(x, y), regardless of whether y divides x or not.

In the case of x=7:

- y=1: 1 + 1=2

- y=2: 2 + 1=3

- y=3: 3 + 1=4

- y=4: 4 + 1=5

- y=5: 5 + 1=6

- y=6: 6 + 1=7

So, y=6 gives the maximum sum of 7.

Similarly, for x=10:

- y=5: 5 + 5=10

- y=8: 8 + 2=10

- y=9: 9 + 1=10

All give 10.

But y=5 divides x, y=8 does not (10%8=2), y=9 does not (10%9=1).

So, in this case, y=5 divides x, and y=8 and y=9 do not, but all give the same sum.

So, perhaps there are multiple y that achieve the same maximum sum.

But in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, and it gives a higher sum than y=1, which divides x.

So, perhaps choosing y that divides x is not always the best.

Let me consider another example.

Take x=6.

Possible y: 1 to 5.

- y=1: 1 + 1=2

- y=2: 2 + 2=4

- y=3: 3 + 3=6

- y=4: 4 + 2=6

- y=5: 5 + 1=6

So, y=3, y=4, y=5 all give 6.

y=3 divides x, y=4 does not (6%4=2), y=5 does not (6%5=1).

Again, multiple y achieve the maximum sum.

In the example output, for x=6, y=3 is chosen, which divides x.

But y=4 and y=5 also achieve the same sum.

So, any of these y are acceptable, as per the problem statement.

Hence, I need to find any y that maximizes y + GCD(x, y).

Now, to make this efficient, especially since x can be up to 1000 and t up to 1000, I need an efficient way to find such y for each x.

One way is to iterate through all y from 1 to x-1, compute y + GCD(x, y), and pick the y with the maximum sum.

But this would be O(t * x), which for t=1000 and x=1000 is 10^6 operations, which should be acceptable, since Python can handle that within reasonable time.

However, perhaps there is a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of y + GCD(x, y).

As I saw earlier, if y divides x, then y + GCD(x, y) = 2*y.

If y does not divide x, then y + GCD(x, y) < 2*y.

But, in some cases, even if y does not divide x, y + GCD(x, y) can be larger than 2*y for some other y that divides x.

For example, in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, but y + GCD=7, which is larger than any 2*y for y that divides x (y=1: 2*1=2; y=7 is not allowed since y < x).

Wait, in x=7, y=1 divides x, and 2*y=2, which is less than y=6 + GCD=7.

So, in this case, choosing y that does not divide x gives a larger sum.

Hence, my initial approach of choosing the largest y that divides x may not always give the maximum sum.

Wait, in x=7, y=6 gives sum=7, and y=1 divides x, giving sum=2.

But, y=6 does not divide x, but gives a larger sum.

So, perhaps I need to consider all y, not just those that divide x.

Alternatively, maybe I can find y such that y + GCD(x, y) is maximized, which would be y + d, where d divides both y and x.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix GCD(x, y) to be d.

Then, y must be a multiple of d, and x must be a multiple of d.

So, y = k*d, where k is an integer, and k < x/d.

Also, d must be a divisor of x.

So, for each divisor d of x, I can choose y = k*d, where k < x/d.

And y + GCD(x, y) = k*d + d = d*(k + 1).

To maximize this, for each d, I can choose the largest possible k such that k < x/d.

So, k_max = floor((x/d) - 1).

Then, y = k_max * d.

And y + d = k_max * d + d = (k_max + 1)*d.

Now, across all d (divisors of x), I need to choose the d and k_max that maximize (k_max + 1)*d.

But k_max = floor((x/d) - 1).

Wait, let's see.

For example, take x=10.

Divisors of 10: 1,2,5,10.

But y < x, so d cannot be 10.

So, d=1,2,5.

For d=1:

k_max = floor(10/1 -1) = 9

y = 9*1 =9

y + d =9 +1=10

For d=2:

k_max = floor(10/2 -1)=4

y=4*2=8

y + d=8+2=10

For d=5:

k_max = floor(10/5 -1)=1

y=1*5=5

y + d=5+5=10

So, all give y + d=10.

Similarly, in x=7:

Divisors:1,7

y < x, so d=1.

k_max = floor(7/1 -1)=6

y=6*1=6

y + d=6+1=7

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, in this case, for each d, choosing y = floor((x/d)-1)*d gives y + d = floor((x/d)-1)*d + d.

Wait, but in the x=7 case, y=6, which is floor(7/1 -1)=6, d=1, y=6*1=6, y + d=7.

Similarly, for x=10, d=1, y=9, y + d=10; d=2, y=8, y + d=10; d=5, y=5, y + d=10.

So, in this case, all give the same sum.

But in x=7, y=6 gives 7, while y=1 gives 2.

So, y=6 is better.

Hence, choosing y = floor((x/d)-1)*d for d=1 gives y=x-1, and y + d =x-1 +1=x.

Similarly, for d=1 in x=10, y=9, y + d=10.

So, perhaps choosing d=1 and y=x-1 always gives y + d =x-1 +1=x.

But in x=10, y=9 gives y + d=10, which is the same as y=5 + d=5=10.

So, in this case, choosing d=1 gives y=x-1, and y + d =x.

Similarly, for d=2 in x=10, y=8, y + d=10.

For d=5, y=5, y + d=10.

So, all give the same sum.

Hence, perhaps for any d that divides x, choosing y =x - d would give y + d =x.

Because y =x - d, GCD(x, y)=GCD(x, x - d)=GCD(x, d)=d.

Hence, y + GCD(x, y)=x - d + d =x.

So, for any d that divides x, y =x - d gives y + GCD(x, y)=x.

Similarly, if y does not divide x, then y + GCD(x, y) < x.

Wait, but in x=7, y=6 does not divide x, but y + GCD=7, which equals x.

Wait, but d=GCD(x, y), so y + d = y + GCD(x, y).

If y =x - d, then y + d =x.

So, y + d =x, regardless of whether d divides x or not.

Wait, but d must divide x and y.

Wait, d=GCD(x, y), so d divides both x and y.

So, y =x - d, and since d divides x and y, it divides x and (x - d), hence d divides d, which it does.

So, y =x - d is always a valid choice, and y + d =x.

Hence, for any d that divides x, choosing y =x - d gives y + d =x.

So, the maximum possible sum is x, achieved when y =x - d, where d divides x.

Now, in the example, for x=10, y=5, which corresponds to d=5, y=5, y + d=10.

Similarly, y=8 corresponds to d=2, y=8, y + d=10.

y=9 corresponds to d=1, y=9, y + d=10.

So, all give y + d =10.

Similarly, in x=7, y=6 corresponds to d=1, y=6, y + d=7.

Hence, the maximum sum is x, achieved by choosing y =x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Hence, to maximize y + GCD(x, y), we can choose y =x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Now, the problem allows us to choose any such y that achieves this maximum sum.

Hence, we can choose y =x - d, for any d that divides x.

In the example, for x=10, y=5 corresponds to d=5.

y=8 corresponds to d=2.

y=9 corresponds to d=1.

All are acceptable.

Hence, in the program, it seems to choose y =x - d, where d is the smallest possible d >1 that divides x.

Wait, in x=10, d=5 is chosen, giving y=5.

But in x=7, d=1 is chosen, giving y=6.

Wait, but in the example output, y=6 is chosen for x=7.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 is chosen, which corresponds to d=3, since 21 -18=3, which divides 21.

For x=100, y=98 corresponds to d=2, since 100-98=2, which divides 100.

For x=2, y=1 corresponds to d=1, since 2-1=1, which divides 2.

For x=1000, y=750 corresponds to d=250, since 1000-750=250, which divides 1000.

For x=6, y=3 corresponds to d=3, since 6-3=3, which divides 6.

So, in the program, it seems to choose y =x - d, where d is the largest possible d that divides x and d < x.

Wait, in x=10, d=5 is chosen, which is larger than d=2.

In x=1000, d=250 is chosen, which is larger than d=1.

Wait, but in x=1000, y=750 corresponds to d=250, which is not the largest d that divides x.

The largest d that divides x=1000 is x itself, which is 1000, but y must be less than x, so y=1000 -1000=0, which is invalid.

Hence, the largest possible d is less than x.

For x=1000, d=500 would give y=500, which is acceptable.

But in the example, y=750 is chosen, which corresponds to d=250.

But y=500 would also give y + d=500 + 500=1000, which is the same sum.

So, why choose y=750?

Wait, perhaps the program chooses y such that y is as large as possible, but still y < x.

Wait, in x=1000, y=999 would correspond to d=1, y + d=999 +1=1000.

But in the example, y=750 is chosen.

So, perhaps the program chooses y such that y is a multiple of some d that divides x.

Wait, perhaps it chooses y such that y is the largest possible y < x, where y and x share a common divisor greater than 1.

But in x=1000, y=999 shares no common divisor with x besides 1, since 1000 is divisible by 2 and 5, and 999 is divisible by 3.

Hence, y=999 would give d=1, y + d=999 +1=1000.

But y=750 corresponds to d=250, y + d=1000.

So, both are acceptable.

Hence, perhaps the program chooses y such that y is the largest possible y < x, where y =x - d, and d is a divisor of x.

In this case, to maximize y, we need to minimize d.

Hence, choosing d=1 would give y=x-1.

But in some cases, the program chooses y=x - d, where d is larger.

For example, in x=10, y=5 corresponds to d=5.

In x=21, y=18 corresponds to d=3.

In x=1000, y=750 corresponds to d=250.

Wait, but y=750 in x=1000 corresponds to d=250, which is x/4.

Wait, 1000/4=250.

Similarly, in x=21, y=18 corresponds to d=3, which is x/7.

Wait, 21/7=3.

In x=10, y=5 corresponds to d=5, which is x/2.

Wait, this seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps the program chooses y such that y is the largest multiple of d less than x, where d is a divisor of x.

Wait, but y=x - d.

So, y=x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Hence, y is x - d.

To maximize y, we need to minimize d.

Hence, choosing d=1 would give y=x-1, which is the largest possible y < x.

But in some cases, the program chooses y=x - d, where d is larger.

For example, in x=10, d=5 is chosen, giving y=5.

But why not choose d=1, giving y=9?

Because y=9 + d=1=10, which is the same as y=5 + d=5=10.

Hence, both give the same sum.

Hence, the program can choose any y that achieves y + d =x.

Hence, in the program, it seems to choose y=x - d, where d is the largest divisor of x that is less than x.

Hence, for x=10, d=5 is the largest divisor less than x, giving y=5.

For x=1000, d=500 is the largest divisor less than x, giving y=500.

But in the example, y=750 is chosen, which corresponds to d=250.

Wait, perhaps the program chooses y=x - d, where d is the smallest divisor greater than 1.

Wait, in x=10, d=2 is the smallest divisor greater than 1, giving y=8.

But in the program, y=5 is chosen, which corresponds to d=5.

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the program chooses y=x - d, where d is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to x/2.

Because if d > x/2, then y=x - d < x/2, which might not be optimal.

Wait, in x=10, d=5 is x/2, y=5.

In x=1000, d=500 is x/2, y=500.

But in the example, y=750 is chosen, which corresponds to d=250.

Wait, 1000 - 250=750.

But why choose d=250 instead of d=500?

Both give y + d=1000.

Hence, perhaps the program chooses y=x - d, where d is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to x/2.

But in x=1000, d=500 is chosen, giving y=500.

But in the example, y=750 is chosen, which corresponds to d=250.

This is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps there is another condition.

Looking back at the program code:

def func_1(x):

"""Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

Args:

x: The given integer.

Returns:

The optimal y.

"""

max_val =1

for y in range(x -1,1,-1):

if x % y ==0:

if 2 * y >=x:

return y

max_val =y

return max_val

So, the function iterates y from x-1 down to 2.
