Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount of coins on each outcome such that, no matter which outcome wins, the money I get back is more than the total amount I bet.

First, I need to understand the constraints. For each test case, I have n outcomes, each with its own k_i, which is at least 2. I need to assign bets x_i to each outcome such that the sum of all x_i is less than k_i * x_i for every i.

In other words, for every i, sum(x_j for all j) < k_i * x_i.

This needs to hold for all i from 1 to n.

Let me try to rearrange this inequality to see if I can find a pattern or a formula to calculate the x_i's.

So, sum(x_j) < k_i * x_i for each i.

Let’s denote s = sum(x_j for all j).

Then, s < k_i * x_i for each i.

I can write this as s < k_i * x_i.

I need this to be true for all i.

Let me think about this.

One approach could be to express x_i in terms of s.

From s < k_i * x_i, I can write x_i > s / k_i.

Since x_i must be an integer, x_i >= ceil(s / k_i).

But s is the sum of all x_j's, including x_i.

This seems a bit circular.

Maybe I need to find a way to express all x_i in terms of a common variable.

Let me consider that all x_i are positive integers, as per the problem statement.

Another thought: maybe I can use the least common multiple (LCM) of the k_i's to find a suitable s and then distribute the x_i accordingly.

Wait, the program provided uses some functions involving GCD and seems to compute something related to the LCM.

Let me look at the code.

The code reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and then a list of k_i's.

It calls a function func_2(k), which computes something from the k_i's, and then sets m to that value.

Then, it calculates c_i = m // k_i for each i.

Then, it checks if sum(c) >= m. If it is, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the c_i's.

First, I need to understand what func_2(k) does.

Looking at func_1(a, b), it seems to compute the absolute value of a*b divided by gcd(a, b), which is essentially the LCM of a and b.

Then, func_2(numbers) computes the LCM of all the numbers in the list.

So, m is the LCM of all the k_i's.

Then, c_i is m // k_i for each i.

So, c_i is the LCM divided by k_i.

Now, sum(c) is sum(m // k_i for all i).

The condition is that sum(c) < m.

If sum(c) >= m, it's impossible, else, the solution is c_i = m // k_i.

Wait, but in the code, it checks sum(c) >= m and prints -1 in that case.

Otherwise, it prints the c_i's.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let's see with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 3

k = [3, 2, 7]

Compute m = LCM of 3, 2, 7.

LCM of 3 and 2 is 6.

LCM of 6 and 7 is 42.

So, m = 42.

Then, c = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]

Sum of c = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41, which is less than 42.

So, sum(c) = 41 < 42 = m.

Hence, it prints 14, 21, 6.

Now, check if this satisfies the original condition.

Total sum s = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41.

For each i:

- i=1: k_1=3, x_1=14, 3*14=42 > 41

- i=2: k_2=2, x_2=21, 2*21=42 > 41

- i=3: k_3=7, x_3=6, 7*6=42 > 41

All conditions are satisfied.

Another test case:

n=2

k=[3,3]

m=LCM(3,3)=3

c=[3//3, 3//3]=[1,1]

sum(c)=2 < 3=m

So, it prints 1,1.

Check:

s=1+1=2

- i=1: 3*1=3 >2

- i=2: 3*1=3 >2

Good.

Another test case:

n=5

k=[5,5,5,5,5]

m=LCM(5,5,5,5,5)=5

c=[5//5,5//5,5//5,5//5,5//5]=[1,1,1,1,1]

sum(c)=5 >= m=5

So, sum(c)=5 >= m=5, hence prints -1.

According to the problem, in this case, there is no solution, which matches the output.

Another test case:

n=6

k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

m=LCM(7,9,3,17,9,13)

First, LCM of 7 and 9 is 63.

LCM of 63 and 3 is 63.

LCM of 63 and 17 is 63*17=1071.

LCM of 1071 and 9 is still 1071.

LCM of 1071 and 13 is 1071*13=13923.

Wait, but 1071 and 13 are co-prime, so LCM is their product.

Wait, but 1071 is divisible by 13? Let's check: 1071 / 13 = 82.38..., not divisible.

So, LCM is 1071*13=13923.

Then, c_i = m // k_i:

- c1=13923//7=1989

- c2=13923//9=1547

- c3=13923//3=4641

- c4=13923//17=819

- c5=13923//9=1547

- c6=13923//13=1071

Sum(c)=1989+1547+4641+819+1547+1071.

Let's add them up:

1989 + 1547 = 3536

3536 + 4641 = 8177

8177 + 819 = 9096

9096 + 1547 = 10643

10643 + 1071 = 11714

Now, m=13923.

Sum(c)=11714 < 13923=m.

Hence, it prints these values, which is correct as per the sample output.

Another test case:

n=3

k=[6,3,2]

m=LCM(6,3,2)=6

c=[6//6,6//3,6//2]=[1,2,3]

sum(c)=1+2+3=6 >= m=6.

Hence, prints -1, which matches the sample output.

Last test case:

n=5

k=[9,4,6,8,3]

m=LCM(9,4,6,8,3).

First, LCM of 9 and 4 is 36.

LCM of 36 and 6 is 36.

LCM of 36 and 8 is 72.

LCM of 72 and 3 is still 72.

So, m=72.

Then, c_i = 72 // k_i:

- c1=72//9=8

- c2=72//4=18

- c3=72//6=12

- c4=72//8=9

- c5=72//3=24

Sum(c)=8+18+12+9+24=71 < m=72.

Hence, it prints these values, which matches the sample output.

So, in all the sample test cases, this approach seems to work.

Now, I need to verify if this is a correct general solution.

Let's think about the condition:

For all i, sum(x_j for all j) < k_i * x_i.

Let’s denote s = sum(x_j for all j).

Then, s < k_i * x_i for all i.

Now, from s < k_i * x_i, we can write x_i > s / k_i.

But since x_i must be integers, x_i >= ceil(s / k_i).

But s is the sum of all x_j's, including x_i.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider expressing x_i in terms of s.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula x_i = m / k_i, where m is a multiple of all k_i's.

In the code, m is the LCM of all k_i's, and x_i = m // k_i.

Then, s = sum(m // k_i for all i).

We need s < m.

Is this always sufficient?

Let’s see.

Given that m is the LCM of all k_i's, and k_i >= 2, then m >= k_i for all i.

Hence, m // k_i is at least 1 for all i.

Now, s = sum(m // k_i for all i).

We need s < m.

If s >= m, then there is no solution.

Otherwise, the x_i = m // k_i is a valid solution.

Let’s verify this.

For s < m, we have sum(m // k_i for all i) < m.

Then, for each i, k_i * x_i = k_i * (m // k_i).

Now, m // k_i is floor division, so k_i * (m // k_i) <= m.

But we need k_i * x_i > s.

Given that s < m, and k_i * x_i <= m, it's possible that k_i * x_i > s.

But wait, in the earlier examples, it worked.

Let me check with n=2, k=[2,2].

m=LCM(2,2)=2.

c=[2//2, 2//2]=[1,1]

sum(c)=2 >= m=2, so print -1.

Indeed, in this case, s=2, and k_i * x_i = 2*1=2, which is not greater than s=2.

Hence, no solution exists, which is correctly handled by the code.

Another case: n=1, k=[2].

m=2.

c=[2//2]=[1]

sum(c)=1 < m=2.

Hence, s=1 < k_1 * x_1 = 2*1=2, which is correct.

Another case: n=1, k=[3].

m=3.

c=[3//3]=[1]

sum(c)=1 < m=3.

k_1 * x_1 = 3*1=3 > s=1.

Good.

Another case: n=2, k=[2,3].

m=LCM(2,3)=6.

c=[6//2,6//3]=[3,2]

sum(c)=5 < m=6.

Check:

s=5 < 2*3=6 for i=1.

s=5 < 3*2=6 for i=2.

Good.

Another case: n=3, k=[2,3,4].

m=LCM(2,3,4)=12.

c=[12//2,12//3,12//4]=[6,4,3]

sum(c)=13 >= m=12.

Hence, no solution, print -1.

Wait, but let's check:

s=13, which is not less than any k_i * x_i.

For i=1: 2*6=12 < 13 (not satisfied).

For i=2: 3*4=12 <13 (not satisfied).

For i=3: 4*3=12 <13 (not satisfied).

Hence, indeed, no solution exists, correctly handled by the code.

So, the approach seems correct.

But let's think if there could be a case where sum(c) < m, but for some i, k_i * x_i <= s.

Suppose n=2, k=[2,3].

m=LCM(2,3)=6.

c=[6//2,6//3]=[3,2]

sum(c)=5 < m=6.

Check:

For i=1: 2*3=6 >5

For i=2: 3*2=6 >5

Good.

Another case: n=2, k=[2,4].

m=LCM(2,4)=4.

c=[4//2,4//4]=[2,1]

sum(c)=3 < m=4.

Check:

For i=1: 2*2=4 >3

For i=2: 4*1=4 >3

Good.

Wait, but in this case, s=3 < m=4.

But k_i * x_i =4 for i=2, which is greater than s=3.

So, it's fine.

Another case: n=3, k=[2,3,6].

m=LCM(2,3,6)=6.

c=[6//2,6//3,6//6]=[3,2,1]

sum(c)=6 >= m=6.

Hence, print -1.

Check:

s=6

For i=1: 2*3=6 not greater than s=6.

For i=2: 3*2=6 not greater than s=6.

For i=3: 6*1=6 not greater than s=6.

Hence, no solution exists.

Correctly handled by the code.

Now, is there a case where sum(c) < m, but for some i, k_i * x_i <= s?

I need to find such a case.

Let’s try n=2, k=[2,4].

m=4.

c=[2,1]

s=3 <4.

k_i * x_i:

- 2*2=4 >3

- 4*1=4 >3

Good.

Another case: n=2, k=[3,3].

m=3.

c=[1,1]

s=2 <3.

k_i * x_i:

- 3*1=3 >2

- 3*1=3 >2

Good.

Seems like the approach works.

Let me think about the mathematical justification.

Given that m is the LCM of all k_i's, and x_i = m // k_i.

Then, k_i * x_i = k_i * (m // k_i).

Since m is a multiple of k_i, m // k_i = m / k_i.

Hence, k_i * x_i = m.

Now, s = sum(m // k_i for all i).

We need s < m.

But in the earlier case of n=3, k=[2,3,6], m=6, s=3+2+1=6 >= m=6.

No solution exists.

In other cases where s < m, it seems to work.

But is this always the case?

Wait, in the first test case, m=42, s=41 <42.

k_i * x_i =42 >41.

Yes.

Similarly, in n=2, k=[2,3], m=6, s=5 <6.

k_i * x_i=6>5 for both.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
