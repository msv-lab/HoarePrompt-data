Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, their order relative to each other doesn't matter.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

Looking at the example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

After sorting, it could be [4, 3, 3, 3, 2] or [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], etc.

If it's [4, 3, 3, 3, 2], and k=2, he removes the first two cubes: 4 and 3. The favorite cube was originally at position 2, which had value 3. In this arrangement, it's removed.

But if it's [4, 3, 3, 2, 3], and k=2, he removes the first two: 4 and 3. The favorite cube is still the one with value 3, which is removed in this case as well.

Wait, but the problem says "the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. If it ended up in the third position, it won't be removed."

Hmm, maybe I need to consider all possible positions the favorite cube could be in after sorting, given that cubes with the same value can be in any order.

So, the key here is that when sorting, cubes with the same value can be in any order relative to each other.

Therefore, for cubes that have the same value, their positions after sorting are not fixed.

So, to determine if the favorite cube is removed, I need to see in all possible sorted arrangements whether it's always removed, never removed, or sometimes removed and sometimes not.

Given that, I need to output "YES" if in all possible sorted arrangements the favorite cube is removed, "NO" if in none of them it's removed, and "MAYBE" if it's possible in some arrangements it's removed and in others it's not.

Alright, so how do I approach this?

First, I need to understand the position of the favorite cube after sorting.

Given that the cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, the positions are determined by the values.

But since cubes with the same value can be in any order, if there are multiple cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, the favorite cube could be in any position among those with that value.

So, to find out the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting, I need to know how many cubes have values greater than or equal to the favorite cube's value.

Let me think about it step by step.

1. Find the value of the favorite cube, x = a[f].

2. Count how many cubes have values strictly greater than x. Let's call this count 'greater'.

3. Count how many cubes have values equal to x. Let's call this count 'equal'.

So, after sorting in non-increasing order, the positions from 1 to greater will have cubes with values greater than x.

Positions from greater+1 to greater+equal will have cubes with value equal to x.

The favorite cube could be in any of these positions: greater+1 to greater+equal.

Now, Dmitry removes the first k cubes.

So, if the favorite cube is in any of the first k positions, it will be removed.

Given that its possible positions are from greater+1 to greater+equal, I need to see where these positions fall relative to k.

- If greater + equal <= k, meaning that even the last cube with value x is among the first k to be removed, then the favorite cube is always removed. So, output "YES".

- If greater + 1 > k, meaning that the first cube with value x is at position greater+1, which is already after k, so the favorite cube is never removed. So, output "NO".

- If greater +1 <= k < greater + equal, meaning that some cubes with value x are removed and some are not, depending on their exact position. So, output "MAYBE".

Wait, but I need to be careful.

Let me think about it again.

If the favorite cube is among the first k in some arrangements and not in others, then the answer is "MAYBE".

Otherwise, if it's always removed or never removed, output "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

So, based on the possible positions of the favorite cube:

- If all possible positions are <= k, output "YES".

- If all possible positions are > k, output "NO".

- If some positions are <= k and others > k, output "MAYBE".

Given that the possible positions are from greater+1 to greater+equal.

So,

- If greater + equal <= k, then all possible positions are <= k, so "YES".

- If greater +1 > k, meaning greater +1 > k, so all possible positions are > k, so "NO".

- Else, "MAYBE".

Wait, but in the problem, it's 1-based indexing, and k is the number of cubes removed starting from the first.

Wait, in the code provided, there seems to be an off-by-one issue.

Let me think again.

In programming, often indexing starts from 0 or 1, so I need to be careful.

Given that n cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, and the first k are removed.

Positions are from 1 to n, with 1 being the highest value.

So, the first k positions are 1 to k.

The favorite cube's possible positions are from greater+1 to greater+equal.

So,

- If greater + equal <= k, then positions greater+1 to greater+equal are all <= k, so always removed. "YES".

- If greater +1 > k, meaning that positions greater+1 to greater+equal are all > k, so never removed. "NO".

- Else, some positions are <=k and some >k, so "MAYBE".

This seems correct.

Now, let's see how to implement this.

I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n, f, k.

- Read the array a of n integers.

- Find x = a[f-1] (since f is 1-based index).

- Count 'greater': number of cubes with value > x.

- Count 'equal': number of cubes with value == x.

- Determine:

- If greater + equal <= k, output "YES".

- Elif greater +1 > k, output "NO".

- Else, output "MAYBE".

Wait, in the code provided, there seems to be a different approach.

Let me look at the provided code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

f -= 1

k -= 1

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = a[f]

a.sort(reverse=True)

if a[k] > x:

print('NO')

elif a[k] < x:

print('YES')

else:

print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')

Hmm, this seems different from what I thought.

Let's analyze this code.

First, it adjusts f and k to 0-based indexing.

Then, it sorts a in reverse order.

Then, it checks a[k] (0-based) with x.

- If a[k] > x, it prints 'NO'.

- If a[k] < x, it prints 'YES'.

- If a[k] == x, it checks if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x, then 'YES', else 'MAYBE'.

Wait, I need to see why this works.

Given that a is sorted in reverse order, a[k] is the (k+1)-th largest value.

If a[k] > x, meaning that the (k+1)-th largest value is greater than x, then all removed cubes (positions 1 to k) have values >= a[k], which are all greater than x.

Since the favorite cube has value x, which is less than a[k], it cannot be among the first k removed cubes. So, it's never removed. Hence, 'NO'.

If a[k] < x, meaning that the (k+1)-th largest value is less than x, then the first k cubes have values >= a[k-1], which is >= a[k] < x.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, in sorted order, a[0] is the largest, a[1] is next, etc.

If a[k] < x, meaning that the (k+1)-th largest value is less than x, which implies that the first k cubes have values >= a[k-1], which is >= a[k] < x.

Wait, but in this case, the favorite cube has value x, which is greater than a[k], so it should be among the first k cubes, but the code says 'YES', meaning it's always removed.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, if a[k] < x, then the favorite cube is among the first k, so it's always removed, hence 'YES'.

Wait, but in my earlier detailed reasoning, I had a different approach based on counts of greater and equal values.

But perhaps both approaches are correct, just different ways of achieving the same result.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first example:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

Sorting in reverse: [4, 3, 3, 3, 2]

a[k] = a[1] = 3 (0-based indexing)

x = a[1] = 3

So, a[k] == x, which is 3.

Then, check if k == n-1 or a[k-1] < x.

k=1, n-1=4, so k != n-1.

a[k-1] = a[0] = 4 > x=3, so neither condition is true, so 'MAYBE'.

Which matches the example's possibility of removing or not removing the favorite cube.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

Sorting in reverse: [5,4,3,2,1]

x = a[4] = 1

a[k] = a[2] = 3 > x=1, so 'NO'.

Meaning, the favorite cube is never removed, which matches the example.

Another example:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a = [5,2,4,1,3]

Sorting in reverse: [5,4,3,2,1]

x=1

a[k]=a[1]=4 > x=1, so 'NO'.

Again, matches the example.

Wait, but in the example outputs, some are 'YES', 'NO', 'MAYBE'.

I need to check more examples to verify.

Looking back at the problem's sample input and output, it seems the code matches the expected outputs.

Therefore, the code seems correct.

But to be thorough, let's consider edge cases.

Edge case 1:

n=1, f=1, k=1

a = [42]

Sorting: [42]

x=42

a[k=0] =42 ==x

Check if k==n-1 (0==0), so 'YES'.

But in this case, the favorite cube is removed, which is correct.

Edge case 2:

n=5, f=3, k=1

a = [3,3,3,3,3]

Sorting: [3,3,3,3,3]

x=3

a[k=0]=3 ==x

Check if k==n-1 (0==4, False) and a[k-1]=a[-1] which is undefined.

Wait, a[k-1] = a[-1] which is a[4]=3, which is not < x=3, so 'MAYBE'.

But in this case, all cubes have the same value, so the favorite cube could be in any position from 1 to 5.

If k=1, it could be removed or not, depending on its position after sorting.

Hence, 'MAYBE' is correct.

Another edge case:

n=5, f=1, k=5

a = [1,1,1,1,1]

Sorting: [1,1,1,1,1]

x=1

a[k=4]=1 ==x

Check if k==n-1 (4==4), so 'YES'.

Meaning, the favorite cube is always removed, which is correct, since all cubes are the same and k=5 removes all of them.

Another edge case:

n=5, f=3, k=2

a = [2,2,1,1,2]

Sorting: [2,2,2,1,1]

x=1

a[k=1]=2 >x, so 'NO'.

Meaning, the favorite cube is never removed, which is correct, since after sorting, positions 1 and 2 have value 2, which is greater than x=1, so the favorite cube with x=1 is at position 4 or 5, which are not removed.

Wait, but in this case, k=2 removes positions 1 and 2, which have value 2, while the favorite cube with value 1 is at positions 4 and 5, so not removed. Hence, 'NO' is correct.

Another test:

n=5, f=2, k=3

a = [2,2,1,1,2]

Sorting: [2,2,2,1,1]

x=2

a[k=2]=2 ==x

Check if k==n-1 (2==4, False) and a[k-1]=a[1]=2 not <x, so 'MAYBE'.

Indeed, the favorite cube could be in position 1,2,3 (all with value 2), so if it's in position 1,2, it's removed; if in position 3, it's removed (since k=3). So, always removed. But according to the code, it's 'MAYBE'.

Wait, in this case, all positions with value 2 are positions 1,2,3, and k=3 removes positions 1,2,3, so the favorite cube is always removed. But the code outputs 'MAYBE'.

Is there a mistake in the code?

Wait, let's see:

a = [2,2,2,1,1]

x=2

a[k=2]=2 ==x

k==n-1? 2==4? No.

a[k-1]=a[1]=2 <x? No.

So, 'MAYBE'.

But in reality, all positions with x=2 are positions 1,2,3, which are all removed, so it should be 'YES'.

Hence, the code seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps the code is not fully capturing the logic.

Let me revisit my initial reasoning.

Earlier, I thought:

- Find how many cubes have value > x, say 'greater'.

- Find how many have value == x, say 'equal'.

- Then, possible positions of favorite cube are from greater+1 to greater+equal.

- If greater + equal <= k, then "YES".

- Elif greater +1 > k, then "NO".

- Else, "MAYBE".

In the above test case:

a = [2,2,2,1,1]

x=2

greater = number of cubes with value >2, which is 0.

equal = number with value=2, which is 3.

So, possible positions of favorite cube are from 1 to 3.

k=3, removes positions 1 to 3.

Hence, always removed. So, "YES".

But according to the code:

a sorted in reverse: [2,2,2,1,1]

a[k=2]=2 ==x

k==n-1? 2==4? No.

a[k-1]=a[1]=2 <x? No.

So, 'MAYBE'.

Which is incorrect, as it should be 'YES'.

Hence, the code is flawed in this scenario.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
