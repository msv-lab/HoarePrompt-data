Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. My job is to calculate the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed to have a positive area.

First, I need to understand the input and output format. The input starts with an integer t, representing the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers: the x and y coordinates of a corner of the square.

The output should be a single integer for each test case, which is the area of the square.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Output:

9

4

784

So, for the first test case, the coordinates are (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), and (4,2). Visually, I can see that this forms a square with side length 3 (from x=1 to x=4 or y=2 to y=5), so the area should be 9.

Similarly, the second test case has coordinates (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), and (-1,-1). This forms a square with side length 2, so area is 4.

The third test case has coordinates (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), and (17,39). The side lengths are from x=17 to x=45, which is 28, and y=11 to y=39, also 28, so area is 784.

Now, looking at the provided program, it seems like there's some unused code at the beginning, which is commented out. I'll ignore that and focus on the active part.

The function func() is defined, and it starts by reading an integer n, which I assume is the number of test cases, although in the problem description, it's denoted by t. There might be a typo here, but perhaps it's intended to be n.

Then, there's a while loop that runs n times. Inside the loop, it reads four coordinates, stores them in a list called coord, and sorts this list.

After sorting, it calculates two values, p1 and p2, which seem to be the squared distances between certain pairs of points. Specifically, p1 is the squared distance between the first two points in the sorted list, and p2 is the squared distance between the last two points.

Then, it calculates the area as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of p1 and p2.

Wait a minute, the area of a square is side length squared. So, if p1 and p2 represent the squared side lengths, then taking the square roots would give the side lengths, and multiplying them would give the area.

But in a square, all sides are equal, so p1 and p2 should be equal, right? So, multiplying their square roots would give side_length * side_length, which is indeed the area.

But, is this the correct approach?

Let me think about it. Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the coordinates should have some specific patterns.

If I sort the coordinates, perhaps they are ordered in a way that makes it easy to calculate the side lengths.

Let's consider the first test case:

Coordinates: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Sorting them lexicographically would order them as:

(1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

So, coord[0] = (1,2)

coord[1] = (1,5)

coord[2] = (4,2)

coord[3] = (4,5)

Then, p1 is the squared distance between coord[1] and coord[0]:

(1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

p2 is the squared distance between coord[3] and coord[2]:

(4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

Then, res = |sqrt(9) * sqrt(9)| = |3 * 3| = 9, which matches the expected area.

Similarly, for the second test case:

Coordinates: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Sorted coordinates:

(-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

p1: distance between (-1,1) and (-1,-1):

(-1 - -1)^2 + (1 - -1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

p2: distance between (1,1) and (1,-1):

(1-1)^2 + (1 - -1)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4

res: |sqrt(4) * sqrt(4)| = 2 * 2 = 4

Again, matches the expected output.

Third test case:

Coordinates: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Sorted coordinates:

(17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

p1: distance between (17,39) and (17,11):

(17-17)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

p2: distance between (45,39) and (45,11):

(45-45)^2 + (39-11)^2 = 0 + 784 = 784

res: |sqrt(784) * sqrt(784)| = 28 * 28 = 784

Which matches the expected output.

So, in all these cases, the approach seems to work.

But is this approach generalizable and correct for any such square?

Let's consider another example. Suppose the square has coordinates (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).

Sorted coordinates: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

p1: distance between (0,1) and (0,0): 0 + 1 = 1

p2: distance between (1,1) and (1,0): 0 + 1 = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct, area is 1.

Another example: coordinates (2,3), (2,6), (5,3), (5,6)

Sorted coordinates: (2,3), (2,6), (5,3), (5,6)

p1: (2,6) to (2,3): 0 + 9 = 9

p2: (5,6) to (5,3): 0 + 9 = 9

res: 3 * 3 = 9

Actual side length is 3, area is 9. Correct.

Wait, but in all these examples, the sorted coordinates result in coord[1] and coord[0] being vertically aligned, and coord[3] and coord[2] being vertically aligned, assuming the square sides are parallel to the axes.

So, in general, if I sort the coordinates lexicographically, the first two should have the same x and different y, and the last two should have the same x and different y, provided the square sides are parallel to the axes.

Then, p1 and p2 are both calculating the squared vertical side lengths. But in a square, both sides are equal, so it works out.

But, what if the square is such that after sorting, coord[1] and coord[0] are horizontally aligned instead?

Wait, let's try coordinates (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)

Sorted: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

p1: (0,1) to (0,0): vertical distance squared = 1

p2: (1,1) to (1,0): vertical distance squared = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

Still correct.

Alternatively, consider coordinates (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)

Sorted: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)

p1: (0,2) to (0,0): vertical distance squared = 4

p2: (2,2) to (2,0): vertical distance squared = 4

res: 2 * 2 = 4

But actual side length is 2, area is 4. Correct.

Wait, but in this case, the vertical side length is 2, horizontal side length is 2, area is 4.

But in the program, it's calculating p1 and p2 as vertical distances, and then multiplying their square roots.

But in a square, both side lengths are equal, so it works.

But, is this approach reliable in all cases?

Let me think of a case where it might fail.

Suppose the coordinates are (0,0), (1,1), (0,1), (1,0)

Sorted: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

p1: (0,1) to (0,0): vertical distance squared = 1

p2: (1,1) to (1,0): vertical distance squared = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

But actually, this is a square with side length sqrt(2), so area should be 2.

Wait, but according to the problem, the square has sides parallel to the axes, so this shouldn't happen.

Wait, (0,0), (1,1), (0,1), (1,0) actually form a square rotated by 45 degrees, which is invalid based on the problem statement.

The problem says "sides parallel to the coordinate axes", so this case shouldn't occur.

Hence, the program is safe from this scenario.

Given that, the program seems to be correct.

But, I should check if there are any edge cases where this approach might fail.

Edge case 1: Minimum side length.

Coordinates: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

As above, works correctly.

Edge case 2: Maximum side length.

Coordinates: (-1000,-1000), (-1000,1000), (1000,-1000), (1000,1000)

Sorted: (-1000,-1000), (-1000,1000), (1000,-1000), (1000,1000)

p1: (-1000,1000) to (-1000,-1000): vertical distance squared = (1000 - (-1000))^2 = 4,000,000

p2: (1000,1000) to (1000,-1000): vertical distance squared = 4,000,000

res: sqrt(4,000,000) * sqrt(4,000,000) = 2000 * 2000 = 4,000,000

Which is correct, since side length is 2000, area is 4,000,000.

Edge case 3: Side length 1.

Coordinates: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

As above, works correctly.

Edge case 4: Negative coordinates.

Coordinates: (-5,-5), (-5,-4), (-4,-5), (-4,-4)

Sorted: (-5,-5), (-5,-4), (-4,-5), (-4,-4)

p1: (-5,-4) to (-5,-5): vertical distance squared = 1

p2: (-4,-4) to (-4,-5): vertical distance squared = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct, area is 1.

Edge case 5: Mixed positive and negative coordinates.

Coordinates: (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,0), (0,1)

Sorted: (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,0), (0,1)

p1: (-1,1) to (-1,0): vertical distance squared = 1

p2: (0,1) to (0,0): vertical distance squared = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct.

Edge case 6: Coordinates with x or y equal to zero.

Coordinates: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)

Sorted: (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2)

p1: (0,2) to (0,0): vertical distance squared = 4

p2: (2,2) to (2,0): vertical distance squared = 4

res: 2 * 2 = 4

Which is correct.

Edge case 7: Coordinates where x and y have different scales.

Coordinates: (10,10), (10,20), (20,10), (20,20)

Sorted: (10,10), (10,20), (20,10), (20,20)

p1: (10,20) to (10,10): vertical distance squared = 100

p2: (20,20) to (20,10): vertical distance squared = 100

res: 10 * 10 = 100

Which is correct.

Edge case 8: Coordinates where x and y are large numbers.

Coordinates: (999,999), (999,1000), (1000,999), (1000,1000)

Sorted: (999,999), (999,1000), (1000,999), (1000,1000)

p1: (999,1000) to (999,999): vertical distance squared = 1

p2: (1000,1000) to (1000,999): vertical distance squared = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct.

Edge case 9: Coordinates where x or y are zero.

Coordinates: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

As above, works correctly.

Edge case 10: Coordinates where x and y are the same.

Coordinates: (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)

Sorted: (5,5), (5,6), (6,5), (6,6)

p1: (5,6) to (5,5): vertical distance squared = 1

p2: (6,6) to (6,5): vertical distance squared = 1

res: 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct.

Given that all these test cases seem to work correctly, and considering the problem constraints guarantee that the input forms a valid square with positive area and sides parallel to the axes, I can conclude that the provided program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
