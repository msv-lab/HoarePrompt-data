Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she bought less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the amount Bob pays her minus the amount she spent buying the items. Alice wants to maximize this profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what Alice's profit will be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics.

1. Alice chooses a subset of items to buy.

2. If the subset has fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit is - the amount she spent on buying those items.

3. If the subset has k or more items, Bob chooses k items from the subset to take for free, and pays for the remaining items at their b_i prices.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is:

Profit = (Sum of b_i for items Bob buys) - (Sum of a_i for items Alice buys)

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize Alice's profit, so he will choose the k items to take for free in a way that minimizes the amount he has to pay Bob.

So, in the case where Alice selects a subset with at least k items, Bob will choose the k items with the smallest b_i to take for free, leaving Alice with the items having the largest b_i to sell to Bob.

Wait, no. Actually, since Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, he should choose the k items that, when taken for free, minimize the sum of b_i for the remaining items. That is, he should choose the k items with the largest b_i to take for free, so that the remaining items have smaller b_i, thus reducing the amount he has to pay.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

If Bob takes k items for free, he wants to take the ones that would have cost him the most if he had to pay, so he takes the ones with the highest b_i for free. That way, the remaining items he has to pay for have smaller b_i, minimizing Alice's profit.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in the case where Alice selects a subset of size s >= k, Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free, and pay for the remaining s - k items at their b_i prices.

Alice's profit in this case would be:

Sum of b_i for the (s - k) items Bob pays for - Sum of a_i for all s items Alice bought.

Alice wants to maximize this profit, so she needs to choose a subset where the benefit from selling to Bob minus the cost of buying is maximized, considering that Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

Additionally, if Alice selects fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, and Alice's profit is just - the sum of a_i for those items.

So, Alice has to decide whether to select fewer than k items or at least k items, and among those options, choose the one that maximizes her profit, knowing that Bob will act to minimize her profit.

This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice maximizes her minimum possible profit.

To approach this, I need to find a way to compute the optimal profit for Alice.

Let me try to model this.

First, if Alice selects a subset S of size s:

- If s < k, profit = - sum_{i in S} a_i

- If s >= k, Bob takes the k items with highest b_i in S for free, and pays for the remaining s - k items.

So, profit = sum_{j in T} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i, where T is the set of s - k items with the smallest b_j in S.

Alice wants to choose S to maximize this profit, and Bob, in turn, chooses which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

To simplify, let's consider the following:

For a given subset S, the profit is:

sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} (b_i), where top_k_b are the k items in S with the highest b_i.

Wait, no.

Let's think differently.

Let me define for each item i:

c_i = b_i - a_i

This represents the net gain for Alice if she buys the item and Bob pays b_i for it.

But, if Bob takes the item for free, Alice only loses a_i.

So, in the subset S:

- If s < k, Alice's profit is - sum_{i in S} a_i

- If s >= k, Alice's profit is sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i

Where top_k_b are the k items in S with the highest b_j.

Wait, but Bob takes the k items with the highest b_j for free, so Alice sells S - top_k_b to Bob at b_j each, and buys all S at a_i each.

So, profit = sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i

Which can be written as sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Alice wants to maximize this profit.

This seems complicated because it involves both the c_i = b_i - a_i and the b_i separately.

Maybe I need to sort the items in a certain way.

Let me consider sorting the items based on some criterion.

One idea is to sort the items in decreasing order of b_i - a_i.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the items where b_i > a_i as profitable for Alice, and try to include them.

But Bob can take away the most b_i items for free, which might offset that.

This is tricky.

Let me think about small examples to get some intuition.

Take the first example in the problem:

n = 2, k = 0

a = [2, 1]

b = [1, 2]

If k = 0, Bob takes nothing for free if Alice buys any items.

Wait, no. If k = 0, and Alice buys less than k items (which would be less than 0 items, which doesn't make sense, since she can buy 0 items or more.

Wait, n = 2, k = 0.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free"

But k = 0, so less than 0 items would mean negative, which doesn't make sense.

Probably, k = 0 means that Bob can take all items Alice bought for free, since less than 0 is not possible, so perhaps k = 0 means Bob takes all items for free.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 1, and explanation says Alice buys the second item and sells it to Bob for 2, costing her 1, so profit is 1.

So, in this case, even though k = 0, Bob still pays for the items Alice chooses to sell to him.

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free"

But in this case, k = 0, so if Alice buys less than 0 items, which is impossible, so Bob cannot take anything for free.

Wait, maybe k = 0 means Bob can take all items for free regardless of how many Alice buys.

Wait, the problem says:

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free"

But if k = 0, less than 0 means Alice cannot buy negative items, so Bob cannot take anything for free.

Wait, perhaps k = 0 means Bob can take all items for free.

Looking back, in the first test case, k = 0, and Alice buys one item, and Bob buys it from her for 2, costing her 1, so profit is 1.

So, perhaps if k = 0, Bob cannot take any items for free, and has to buy all items Alice bought.

Wait, the explanation is a bit confusing.

Wait, in the first test case:

"Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 2 - 1 = 1"

So, even though k = 0, Bob still buys the item from Alice for b_i = 2, and Alice bought it for a_i = 1, so profit is 1.

So, perhaps when k = 0, Bob cannot take any items for free, and has to buy all items Alice bought.

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i-th item."

So, if k = 0, and Alice buys s items, where s >= 0:

- If s < 0, which is impossible, Bob can take all of them for free.

- If s >= 0, Bob takes 0 items for free and pays for the remaining s - 0 = s items.

So, in this case, Bob has to buy all items Alice bought.

Hence, Alice's profit is sum_{j in S} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i = sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j)

So, in the first test case, sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) = 2 - 1 = 1, which matches the explanation.

So, in this case, Alice should choose the subset S that maximizes sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j)

In general, when k = 0, Alice should choose the subset where sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) is maximized.

Now, for k > 0, it's more complicated.

So, perhaps I can generalize this.

Let me consider that for k = 0, Alice should choose the subset S that maximizes sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j)

For k > 0, Alice chooses a subset S with s >= k, and Bob takes the k items with highest b_i for free, so Alice sells S - top_k_b to Bob at b_j each, and buys all S at a_j each.

So, profit = sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i

Which can be written as sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Alice wants to maximize this.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that for each item, I have c_i = b_i - a_i

If Alice buys an item, she gets c_i if Bob doesn't take it for free.

If Bob takes it for free, she only loses a_i.

So, for items where c_i > 0, Alice prefers to sell them to Bob, unless Bob takes them for free.

For items where c_i < 0, Alice prefers not to buy them, unless somehow it benefits her in combination with other items.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for items where c_i > 0, Alice wants to sell them to Bob, and for items where c_i < 0, she might want to buy them only if Bob takes them for free.

But this seems messy.

Let me consider sorting the items in a certain order.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, if Alice selects a subset S with s >= k, Bob takes the top k items by b_i for free.

So, the remaining s - k items are sold to Bob at b_j each, and Alice bought all s items at a_j each.

So, profit = sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i

Which is sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Alice wants to maximize this.

This seems difficult to optimize directly.

Maybe I need to find a way to select S such that the sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) is as large as possible, minus the sum of the top k b_i in S.

Perhaps I can think of it as selecting a subset where the sum of (b_j - a_j) is maximized, minus the sum of the top k b_i in that subset.

This sounds like a maximization problem with a penalty for the top k b_i.

I need to find a way to maximize sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Which is equivalent to sum_{j in S} (-a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i = sum_{j in S} (-a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Hmm.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for items where b_i - a_i > 0, Alice wants to sell them to Bob, but Bob might take them for free.

For items where b_i - a_i < 0, Alice doesn't want to buy them unless Bob takes them for free, which would save her a_i.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a mathematical formulation.

Define:

Let S be the subset of items Alice buys.

If |S| < k, profit = - sum_{i in S} a_i

If |S| >= k, profit = sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i

Where top_k_b are the k items in S with the highest b_j.

Alice wants to choose S to maximize the profit, and Bob chooses which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

This seems like a minimax problem.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Given the constraints, n can be up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases <= 2e5, it's acceptable.

I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) per test case.

Let me think about sorting the items in a certain way.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for a subset S, the top_k_b would be the first k items in S according to this order.

Wait, perhaps I can consider including items one by one, keeping track of the sum of (b_j - a_j), minus the sum of the top k b_i.

This sounds similar to selecting a subset where I want to maximize the sum of (b_j - a_j), but subtracting the sum of the top k b_i.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to consider that for a fixed subset S, the profit is sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i

Which is equal to sum_{j in S - top_k_b} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} a_i

Wait, no.

Wait:

sum_{j in S} (b_j - a_j) - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i = sum_{j in S} b_j - sum_{j in S} a_j - sum_{i in top_k_b} b_i = sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{j in S} a_j

Which is the original profit expression.

I'm going in circles.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice selects a subset S of size s >= k.

Bob will take the k items with the highest b_i for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i

I need to maximize this over all possible S.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can transform the problem.

Let me consider that for each item, I can think of it as having a certain contribution to the profit.

But it's complicated because of the way Bob takes the top k b_i items for free.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following approach:

1. Sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

2. Select the top s items, where s >= k.

3. The profit would be sum_{j = k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

4. For s < k, profit is - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

Then, I need to choose s to maximize this profit.

Wait, this seems promising.

Let me formalize it.

Sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Let's say the sorted list is item 1 having the highest b_i, down to item n with the lowest b_i.

Now, for a subset S consisting of the top s items, the profit would be:

- If s < k: profit = - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

- If s >= k: profit = sum_{j = k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

Alice wants to choose s to maximize this profit.

So, for each possible s from 0 to n, calculate the profit, and take the maximum.

This seems efficient, as it's O(n log n) due to sorting.

Let me verify this with the first test case.

First test case:

n = 2, k = 0

a = [2, 1]

b = [1, 2]

Sort items by b_i descending: item 2 (b=2), item 1 (b=1)

For s = 0: profit = 0

For s = 1: sum_{k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i = sum{} - sum{a1} = 0 - 2 = -2

For s = 2: sum_{k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i = sum_{j=1 to 2} b_j - sum_{i=1 to 2} a_i = (2 + 1) - (2 + 1) = 0

The maximum is 0, but according to the explanation, it's 1.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, in the first test case, k = 0.

So, for s >= 0, which is all s, profit = sum_{j = 0+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i = sum_{j=1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

For s = 0: 0 - 0 = 0

For s = 1: b1 - a1 = 2 - 1 = 1

For s = 2: b1 + b2 - a1 - a2 = 2 + 1 - 2 - 1 = 0

So, the maximum is 1, which matches the explanation.

Earlier, I mistakenly calculated for s=1 in the general case, but for k=0, it's different.

Wait, in the general case, for s >= k, profit = sum_{j = k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

For k=0, this becomes sum_{j=1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i, which is correct.

So, perhaps this approach works.

Let me generalize it.

Sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for each possible s from 0 to n:

- If s < k: profit = - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

- If s >= k: profit = sum_{j = k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

Alice chooses the s that maximizes this profit.

I need to compute this efficiently.

To do this, I can sort the items by b_i descending.

Then, compute prefix sums for sum_a[s] = sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

And prefix sums for sum_b[s] = sum_{i=k+1 to s} b_i

Wait, but for s < k+1, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = 0

So, sum_b[s] = sum_{j=max(k+1,1) to s} b_j

Wait, for s < k, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = 0

For s >= k, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = sum_{j=1 to s} b_j - sum_{j=1 to k} b_j

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = sum_{j=1 to s} b_j - sum_{j=1 to k} b_j, but only if s >= k+1.

Wait, more carefully:

- For s < k: sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = 0

- For s >= k: sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = sum_{j=1 to s} b_j - sum_{j=1 to k} b_j

So, in code, I can compute:

- prefix_b[s] = sum_{j=1 to s} b_j

- prefix_a[s] = sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

Then, for s >= k:

profit = prefix_b[s] - prefix_b[k] - prefix_a[s]

For s < k:

profit = - prefix_a[s]

Then, I can iterate s from 0 to n and choose the maximum profit.

Wait, but for s < k, it's -prefix_a[s], and for s >= k, it's prefix_b[s] - prefix_b[k] - prefix_a[s]

I need to compute these efficiently.

Wait, but in the sorted list, the top k items by b_j are the first k items.

So, sum_{j=1 to k} b_j is prefix_b[k]

Then, for s >= k:

profit = (prefix_b[s] - prefix_b[k]) - prefix_a[s]

For s < k:

profit = - prefix_a[s]

I need to find the s that maximizes this profit.

I can compute prefix_b and prefix_a as I iterate through the sorted list.

Wait, but I need to sort the items in decreasing order of b_j.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=2, k=0:

sorted items: item2 (b=2), item1 (b=1)

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 2

prefix_b[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

prefix_a[1] = 1

prefix_a[2] = 1 + 2 = 3

For s=0: profit = 0

For s=1: since s >= k (k=0), profit = prefix_b[1] - prefix_b[0] - prefix_a[1] = 2 - 0 - 1 = 1

For s=2: profit = prefix_b[2] - prefix_b[0] - prefix_a[2] = 3 - 0 - 3 = 0

Maximum is 1, which matches the first test case.

Another test case:

n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,1,4]

b = [3,3,2,3]

Sort by b descending: item1 (b=3), item2 (b=3), item4 (b=3), item3 (b=2)

prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = 3

prefix_b[2] = 3 + 3 = 6

prefix_b[3] = 6 + 3 = 9

prefix_b[4] = 9 + 2 = 11

prefix_a[1] = 1

prefix_a[2] = 1 + 2 = 3

prefix_a[3] = 3 + 1 = 4

prefix_a[4] = 4 + 4 = 8

k=1, prefix_b[k]=prefix_b[1]=3

For s=0: profit = 0

For s=1: s >= k, profit = prefix_b[1] - prefix_b[1] - prefix_a[1] = 3 - 3 - 1 = -1

For s=2: profit = prefix_b[2] - prefix_b[1] - prefix_a[2] = 6 - 3 - 3 = 0

For s=3: profit = 9 - 3 - 4 = 2

For s=4: profit = 11 - 3 - 8 = 0

Maximum is 2, but according to the second test case, the output is 1.

Wait, there must be a mistake.

Wait, in the second test case, the output is 1.

But according to this calculation, it's 2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Looking back, in the problem statement, for s >= k, Bob can choose which k items to take for free.

In my approach, I assumed that Bob takes the top k b_i items for free, which is correct because he wants to minimize Alice's profit.

But in this calculation, for s=3, profit=2, which is higher than the output of 1 in the sample input.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the approach.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, k=1

a = [1,2,1,4]

b = [3,3,2,3]

According to the sample output, the profit is 1.

But according to my calculation, it's 2.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose which k items to take for free, not necessarily the top k by b_i.

Wait, but according to the problem, Bob chooses which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

So, in this case, he should take the items with the highest b_i to minimize the amount he has to pay.

Wait, but in my calculation for s=3, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = sum_{j=2 to 3} b_j = b2 + b3 = 3 + 2 = 5

sum_{i=1 to s} a_i = a1 + a2 + a3 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

So, profit = 5 - 4 = 1

But according to my earlier calculation, it was 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, with s=3, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = sum_{j=2 to 3} b_j = b2 + b3 = 3 + 2 = 5

sum_{i=1 to 3} a_i = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

So, profit = 5 - 4 = 1

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, in my earlier approach, I had:

profit = sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j - sum_{i=1 to s} a_i

Which for s=3, k=1, is sum_{j=2 to 3} b_j - sum_{i=1 to 3} a_i = 3 + 2 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 5 - 4 = 1

Which matches the sample output.

But earlier, I mistakenly calculated it as 2.

So, perhaps my approach is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had:

profit = prefix_b[s] - prefix_b[k] - prefix_a[s]

For s=3, prefix_b[3]=6 (sum of top 3 b_j: 3+3+2=8, wait, no.

Wait, I think I messed up the sorting.

Wait, in the second test case, b = [3,3,2,3]

Sorted in descending order: 3,3,3,2

So, prefix_b[1]=3

prefix_b[2]=6

prefix_b[3]=9

prefix_b[4]=11

prefix_a[1]=1

prefix_a[2]=3

prefix_a[3]=4

prefix_a[4]=8

k=1, prefix_b[k]=3

For s=3:

profit = prefix_b[3] - prefix_b[k] - prefix_a[3] = 9 - 3 - 4 = 2

But according to the correct calculation, it should be 1.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, sum_{j=k+1 to s} b_j = prefix_b[s] - prefix_b[k]

But in this case, sum_{j=2 to 3} b_j = b2 + b3 = 3 + 3 = 6, but according to the sorted list, top 3 b_j are 3,3,3, so prefix_b[3]=9, prefix_b[1]=3, so 9 - 3 =6, which matches.

Then, sum_{i=1 to s} a_i = prefix_a[3]=4

So, profit=6-4=2

But according to the sample, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when s >=k, Bob can choose any k items to take for free, not necessarily the top k by b_j.

Wait, in this case, Bob can choose to take the item with b=3 and a=2 for free, leaving Alice with two items with b=3 and a=1 and a=4.

Then, profit=3 + 3 - (1 + 2 + 4) = 6 - 7 = -1

Alternatively, if Bob takes the item with b=3 and a=1 for free, profit=3 + 3 - (1 + 2 + 4) = same as above.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, according to the problem, Bob chooses which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

So, in this case, Bob would choose the k items with the highest b_j to take for free, which are the top k items by b_j.

In this case, with k=1, he takes the item with the highest b_j (which is 3) for free.

Then, Alice sells the remaining s - k = 2 items to Bob at their b_j, and buys all s=3 items at a_j.

So, profit = sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j - sum_{i in S} a_i = (b2 + b3) - (a1 + a2 + a3)

Assuming S is the top 3 items by b_j: items with b=3,3,3, a=1,2,1

So, Bob takes the top 1 item by b_j (b=3) for free, and Alice sells the other two items (b=3,3) to Bob, costing her a1=1, a2=2, a3=1

So, profit = 3 + 3 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 6 - 4 = 2

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

So, perhaps my approach is still incorrect.

Wait, maybe Bob can choose which k items to take for free, not necessarily the top k by b_j.

Wait, in this case, if Bob takes the item with a=2 and b=3 for free, then Alice sells the other two items with b=3 and b=3, a=1 and a=1.

So, profit = 3 + 3 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 6 - 4 = 2

Alternatively, if Bob takes the item with a=1 and b=3 for free, then Alice sells the other two items with b=3 and b=3, a=2 and a=1.

Profit = 3 + 3 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 6 - 4 = 2

So, in both cases, it's 2.

But according to the sample, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the sample.

Wait, looking back at the sample input:

Wait, for the second test case, n=4, k=1, a=[1,2,1,4], b=[3,3,2,3]

And output is 1.

But according to my calculation, it's 2.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps Bob can choose which k items to take for free, but not necessarily the ones with the highest b_j.

But according to the problem, Bob chooses which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

So, in this case, he would choose the k items with the highest b_j to take for free.

But in this example, all items have b=3, except one with b=2.

So, taking any one item with b=3 for free, the remaining items have b=3 and b=2, which sum to 5, minus sum a=4, giving profit=1.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j is the sum of the remaining b_j after Bob takes the top_k_b items for free.

So, in this case, S has 3 items with b=3,3,3, a=1,2,1

Bob takes one item with b=3 for free, leaving two items with b=3 each.

So, sum_{j in S - top_k_b} b_j = 3 + 3 = 6

sum_{i in S} a_i = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Profit = 6 - 4 = 2

But according to the sample, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when s >=k, Bob chooses which k items to take for free to minimize the sum of b_j for the remaining items.

So, in this case, Bob can choose to take the item with a=2 and b=3 for free, so that the remaining items have b=3 and b=3, a=1 and a=1.

Profit = 3 + 3 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 6 - 4 = 2

Alternatively, he can take the item with a=1 and b=3 for free, then remaining items have b=3 and b=2, a=2 and a=1.

Profit = 3 + 2 - (1 + 2 + 1) = 5 - 4 =1

So, Bob会选择取a=1, b=3的物品免费，使得利润为1，而不是2。

所以，Bob会选择使得Alice的利润最小化的选择，即选择a=1, b=3的物品免费，这样利润是1。

因此，Alice的利润是1，与样本输出一致。

所以，我的方法需要调整，不能简单地假设Bob取最高b_j的物品免费，因为Bob的选择是基于最小化Alice的利润。

所以，我需要找到一种方法来考虑Bob的选择。

这使得问题更加复杂。

我需要重新思考。

也许我应该考虑对于每个可能的s，计算在Bob选择k个物品免费后的最小利润，然后Alice选择其中最大的。

但这在时间上是不可行的，因为n可以达到2e5。

我需要一个更有效的解决方案。

让我尝试从另一个角度考虑。

对于每个物品，如果Alice选择购买它，她需要支付a_i，然后如果Bob不拿它免费，他会支付b_i。

所以，对于每个物品，它的净贡献是b_i - a_i，但如果Bob拿它免费，净贡献变成 -a_i。

所以，对于Alice来说，她希望尽可能多地包含b_i - a_i > 0的物品，但Bob会拿走一些物品免费，从而减少Alice的利润。

所以，Alice需要选择一个子集，使得在Bob拿走k个物品免费之后，剩余的物品的b_i - a_i尽可能大。

这听起来像是一个选择子集的问题，其中一些物品的贡献是b_i - a_i，而其中k个物品的贡献是 -a_i。

Alice需要最大化这个总和。

所以，总的利润是sum_{j in S - top_k_b} (b_j - a_j) + sum_{i in top_k_b} (-a_i)

Wait, no.

Wait，如果Bob拿走k个物品免费，那么对于那些被拿走的物品，Alice只损失a_i，因为Bob没有支付b_i。

而对于没有被拿走的物品，Alice
