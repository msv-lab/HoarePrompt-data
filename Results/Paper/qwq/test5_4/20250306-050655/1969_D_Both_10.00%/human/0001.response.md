Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice and b_i for Bob. Alice wants to choose a subset of these items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she bought less than k items, or take k of them for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the amount Bob pays her minus the amount she spent buying the items. Alice wants to maximize this profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to figure out what Alice's profit would be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. If Alice buys fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit would be - the amount she spent on buying those items, since Bob doesn't pay her anything. If she buys k or more items, Bob takes k items for free and pays for the rest.

So, Alice has to choose a subset of items to buy, knowing that Bob will take the best k items for himself (to minimize what he has to pay). Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is the sum of b_i for the items Bob buys from her minus the sum of a_i for the items she buys.

I need to think about how Alice should choose which items to buy and how Bob will choose which k items to take for free.

Let me try to rephrase the problem in my own words. Alice selects a subset S of items to buy. If |S| < k, Bob takes all of S for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S). If |S| >= k, Bob chooses k items from S to take for free, and pays for the remaining |S| - k items, paying b_i for each of those.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for items Bob pays for) - sum(a_i for items in S).

Bob, wanting to minimize Alice's profit, will choose which k items to take for free in a way that minimizes her overall profit.

I need to find the maximum profit Alice can achieve, considering that Bob will act to minimize her profit.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n=2, k=0

a = [2,1]

b = [1,2]

If k=0, that means Bob takes no items for free if Alice buys 0 items, but if she buys any items, he takes k=0 items for free and pays for all of them.

Wait, k=0 means if Alice buys fewer than 0 items, which is impossible, so Bob always takes all items for free if she buys any items.

Wait, the problem says: if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; otherwise, he takes k items for free and pays for the rest.

So, with k=0, no matter how many items Alice buys (even if she buys 0), Bob takes all of them for free.

Wait, if she buys less than k=0 items, which is impossible, so in this case, if she buys any items, Bob takes all of them for free.

But in the example, n=2, k=0, a=[2,1], b=[1,2], and the output is 1.

According to the explanation, Alice buys the second item and sells it to Bob, getting 2 - 1 = 1.

Wait, but with k=0, Bob should take all items for free if Alice buys any items.

But in this example, it seems like Bob is paying for the item, which contradicts the initial statement.

Wait, maybe I misread the condition.

Let me read the problem again.

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i-th item."

So, if Alice buys less than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S).

If she buys k or more items, Bob takes k items for free and pays b_i for the remaining items in S.

In the first example, n=2, k=0.

If Alice buys any items, since k=0, she buys 0 or more items. If she buys 0 items, Bob takes all of them (which is none) for free, and Alice's profit is 0 - 0 = 0.

But according to the example, the output is 1, which suggests that Bob is paying for some items, so maybe I misread the condition.

Wait, perhaps when k=0, if Alice buys items, Bob has to take all of them for free, but in the explanation, it seems like Bob is paying for some items.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the first example:

"the first test case, Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 2 - 1 = 1."

So, even with k=0, Bob is paying for the item, which seems contradictory to the initial statement.

Wait, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the condition.

Let me read the condition again carefully.

"if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i-th item."

In the first example, n=2, k=0.

If Alice buys less than 0 items, which is impossible, so the "otherwise" clause applies: she buys 0 or more items, and Bob takes 0 items for free and pays for the rest.

So, with k=0, Bob takes 0 items for free and pays for the remaining items.

Hence, if Alice buys one or both items, Bob pays b_i for all the items she bought, except the k=0 items he takes for free.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for items Bob pays for) - sum(a_i for items she bought).

In the first example, if Alice buys the second item (a=1, b=2), Bob pays b=2, and Alice spent a=1, so profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

If she buys both items, Bob pays b=1 and b=2, Alice spent a=2 and a=1, profit is 3 - 3 = 0.

If she buys only the first item, Bob pays b=1, Alice spent a=2, profit is 1 - 2 = -1.

So, the maximum profit Alice can achieve is 1.

Hence, the condition with k=0 makes Bob pay for all items except the k=0 items he takes for free, meaning he pays for all items Alice buys.

Got it.

So, in general, for any k, if Alice buys S items, Bob takes the top k items (in terms of b_i) for free, and pays for the remaining |S| - k items.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for items Bob pays for) - sum(a_i for items in S).

Bob wants to minimize this profit by choosing which k items to take for free.

So, Alice needs to choose S to maximize the minimum possible profit, given Bob's choice.

This sounds like a minimax problem.

To rephrase: Alice chooses S to maximize the minimum profit over all possible choices of k items Bob can take for free.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the profit Alice makes from each item, considering that Bob might take the best k items for himself.

I need to find a way to select a subset S such that, after Bob takes the best k items in terms of b_i, the remaining items give the maximum profit possible, considering Alice's cost.

This seems tricky because it involves both selecting which items to include and accounting for Bob's choice.

Let me consider the case when k=0 first, as it's simpler.

When k=0, Bob takes 0 items for free and pays for all items Alice buys.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for all items in S) - sum(a_i for all items in S) = sum(b_i - a_i for all items in S).

To maximize this, Alice should select all items where b_i - a_i > 0.

Wait, but in the first example, b_i - a_i for item 1: 1 - 2 = -1, and for item 2: 2 - 1 = 1.

So, selecting only item 2 gives profit 1, which matches the example.

So, for k=0, it's straightforward: select all items where b_i - a_i > 0.

Now, for general k, it's more complicated because Bob can take the k items with the highest b_i.

Alice needs to choose S such that after Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i in S, the remaining items have maximum sum(b_i - a_i).

This sounds like a minimax problem where Alice wants to maximize her profit considering Bob's minimizing action.

I need to find a way to optimize this.

Let me think about the overall profit.

If Alice selects S, Bob will choose the k items with the highest b_i in S to take for free.

So, the items Bob pays for are the remaining |S| - k items.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for the |S| - k items) - sum(a_i for all items in S).

I need to maximize this over S.

This seems difficult directly, so maybe I can reformulate it.

Let me consider that Alice's profit can be expressed as sum(b_i - a_i for the |S| - k items Bob pays for) - sum(a_i for the k items Bob takes for free).

Wait, perhaps that's not the best way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice selects S, and Bob selects T subset of S with size k to take for free.

Then, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

This can be rewritten as -sum(a_i for T) + sum(b_i - a_i for S - T).

Since Bob wants to minimize this, he will choose T to minimize this expression.

Given that b_i - a_i can be positive or negative, Bob will choose T to minimize the profit.

Alice then chooses S to maximize the minimum profit over all possible T.

This seems complex.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the difference between b_i and a_i.

Define c_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, Alice's profit is sum(c_i for the items Bob pays for) - sum(a_i for the items Bob takes for free).

Wait, but Bob takes k items for free, choosing which k items to take.

So, Alice's profit is sum(c_i for S) - sum(a_i for the k items Bob takes).

Bob will choose the k items with the highest a_i among S to minimize Alice's profit.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S), where T is the subset of S with size k chosen by Bob.

Given that b_i - a_i = c_i, this is sum(c_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

Bob chooses T to minimize this expression.

So, Bob wants to maximize sum(a_i for T) - sum(c_i for T).

Wait, it's a bit messy.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

Since T is the subset of S with the k highest b_i, because Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit by choosing which k items to take for free.

Wait, no, Bob can choose any k items to take for free, but to minimize Alice's profit, he would choose the k items where taking them for free hurts Alice the least.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the items Bob pays for.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

This can be rewritten as -sum(a_i for T) + sum(b_i - a_i for S - T).

Bob chooses T to minimize this, so he will choose T to minimize -sum(a_i for T) + sum(b_i - a_i for S - T).

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to select S such that the sum of certain values is maximized.

Let me consider sorting the items in some way.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, if Alice selects the top m items, Bob will take the top k items for free, and pay for the remaining m - k items.

Alice's profit would be sum(b_i for m - k highest b_i) - sum(a_i for the top m b_i).

But I need to consider that maybe Alice shouldn't select the top m b_i items; maybe some items with higher b_i have very high a_i, making c_i = b_i - a_i small or negative.

So, perhaps I need to consider c_i = b_i - a_i and a_i together.

This is getting tricky.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

Looking at the given program:

It reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and k, then reads arrays a and b.

It negates all a_i, so a_i becomes -a_i.

Then, it creates an array arr with elements [a_i, b_i], sorted by b_i in ascending order.

Then, it initializes a heap k_arr and pushes the top k elements from arr into k_arr.

It calculates sub_sum, which seems to be the sum of a_i for k_arr plus some other sums.

Then, it iterates, updating sub_sum by popping from k_arr and pushing new elements, keeping track of the maximum sub_sum.

Finally, it prints the maximum sub_sum.

Wait, I need to understand what this code is doing.

First, it negates a_i, which suggests that it's trying to work with -a_i instead of a_i.

Then, it sorts arr by b_i in ascending order.

Then, it pushes the top k elements into a heap.

Wait, but arr is sorted by b_i ascending, and it's pushing into a heap, which by default in Python is a min-heap.

So, k_arr is a min-heap containing the k smallest b_i elements.

Then, it calculates sub_sum, which seems to be sum(a_i for k_arr) plus some other sums.

This is confusing.

Perhaps the approach is to select a subset S and manage the k items Bob takes for free in a way that maximizes the profit.

But I'm not sure.

Maybe I need to consider the profit contribution of each item differently.

Let me consider that Alice's profit can be expressed in terms of the items she buys and the items Bob pays for.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S), where T is the subset of S with size k that Bob chooses to take for free.

Bob chooses T to minimize this profit.

So, Bob wants to minimize sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

This is equivalent to minimizing sum(b_i for S) - sum(b_i for T) - sum(a_i for S).

Which is - sum(b_i for T) - sum(a_i for S - T).

Wait, this seems messy.

Perhaps I need to consider the dual problem.

Let me think about the overall profit.

Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

This can be rewritten as sum(b_i - a_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

Bob chooses T to minimize this.

So, Alice needs to choose S to maximize the minimum value of this expression over all possible T subsets of S with size k.

This seems like a difficult optimization problem.

Maybe there's a smarter way to approach it.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to not buy some items, and she wants to maximize her profit considering Bob's choice.

Perhaps I can consider the items in a certain order and select the ones that give the best profit.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some kind of greedy approach, selecting items based on certain criteria.

Let me consider defining a new value for each item, say p_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, Alice's profit is sum(p_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

Bob chooses T to minimize this.

So, Alice needs to choose S and T to maximize the minimum possible profit.

This still seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider the items in order of some combined score.

Let me consider that for each item, the cost to Alice is a_i, and the benefit from Bob is b_i.

If Alice buys an item, she pays a_i and gets b_i from Bob if he pays for it.

If Bob takes it for free, she only pays a_i and gets nothing back.

So, for each item, Alice wants to include it if the potential gain outweighs the cost.

But Bob is trying to minimize her profit by choosing which k items to take for free.

So, Alice needs to anticipate Bob's choice.

This seems like a game theory problem where Alice and Bob have opposing objectives.

Perhaps I can model this as a zero-sum game and find the minimax solution.

But with n up to 2e5, that's not feasible computationally.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the following:

If Alice selects a set S, and Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i in S for free, then the remaining items are those with lower b_i, and Alice gets sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

I need to maximize this over S.

This seems similar to selecting a subset S where the sum of (b_i - a_i for the smallest |S| - k b_i's) - sum(a_i for the k largest b_i's in S).

Wait, perhaps I can select items based on b_i and a_i in a specific way.

Let me consider sorting the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, if Alice selects the top m items, Bob will take the top k items for free, and pay for the remaining m - k items.

So, Alice's profit would be sum(b_i for m - k highest b_i in S) - sum(a_i for the top m b_i in S).

But I need to maximize this over m.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over m and compute this.

But with n up to 2e5, I need an O(n log n) solution.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for a given m, the top m items have the highest b_i.

Bob will take the top k among them for free, which would be the top k in this ordering.

Then, Alice gets sum(b_i for m - k highest b_i) - sum(a_i for the top m b_i).

But this seems suboptimal because maybe some items with lower b_i have very low a_i, making b_i - a_i large.

So, perhaps sorting by b_i isn't the best approach.

Wait, maybe I should sort by b_i - a_i.

But then, Bob still chooses the k items with the highest b_i.

It's tricky because Bob's choice depends on b_i, while Alice's profit depends on both b_i and a_i.

Let me consider that Alice's profit is sum(b_i - a_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

Bob chooses T to minimize this.

So, for a given S, the minimal profit is sum(b_i - a_i for S - T') - sum(a_i for T'), where T' is the subset of S with the k highest b_i.

Therefore, Alice needs to choose S to maximize this expression.

This seems like I need to maximize sum(b_i - a_i for S - T') - sum(a_i for T'), where T' is the k items in S with the highest b_i.

This is equivalent to sum(b_i - a_i for S) - 2 * sum(b_i for T').

Wait, not exactly.

Wait, sum(b_i - a_i for S - T') - sum(a_i for T') = sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(a_i for T') - sum(b_i - a_i for T').

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a different way to approach this.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to buy or not buy each item, and for the items she buys, Bob can choose which k to take for free.

So, Alice wants to maximize her profit, considering Bob's choice.

Perhaps I can model this as selecting a subset S, and then subtracting the cost of the k items in S with the highest a_i.

Wait, but Bob chooses the k items with the highest b_i.

Wait, no, Bob chooses the k items with the highest b_i to take for free.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S) - sum(a_i for S) - sum(b_i for the k items with the highest b_i in S).

Wait, no.

Wait, Bob takes k items for free with the highest b_i, so Alice gets nothing for those, but she still paid a_i for them.

So, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S), where T is the subset of S with the k highest b_i.

So, sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S) = sum(b_i - a_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Let me consider that for items in S, if they are in T, they contribute -a_i to the profit, and if they are in S - T, they contribute b_i - a_i.

So, the total profit is sum over S - T of (b_i - a_i) + sum over T of (-a_i).

Bob chooses T to minimize this sum.

So, Alice wants to choose S to maximize the minimal sum over possible T.

This sounds like a minimax problem.

Perhaps I can reformulate it to make it easier to compute.

Let me consider that for a fixed S, the minimal profit is achieved when T is the subset of S with the k highest values of -(b_i - a_i) - a_i.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that Bob will choose T to be the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, for a fixed S, the profit is sum(b_i for S) - sum(a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

Since Bob chooses T to minimize this, he will choose T to be the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, for a given S, the profit is sum(b_i for S) - sum(a_i for S) - sum(b_i for the k items in S with the highest b_i).

So, profit = sum(b_i for S) - sum(a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

Wait, but T is the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, profit = sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

Which is sum(b_i for S) - sum(b_i for T) - sum(a_i for S).

So, profit = sum(b_i for S) - sum(a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

I need to maximize this over S, considering that Bob chooses T to be the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, profit = sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

Alice wants to maximize this over S.

This seems difficult.

Maybe I can think about selecting items based on some combined score.

Let me consider defining c_i = b_i - a_i.

Then, profit = sum(c_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for T).

But I need to maximize this over S, with Bob choosing T to minimize it.

This seems like a classic minimax problem.

Perhaps I can use the idea of selecting items where c_i is positive and a_i is low.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for items in S - T, Alice gets c_i = b_i - a_i, and for items in T, she gets -a_i.

Bob chooses T to minimize the profit, so he chooses the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, for a given S, the profit is sum(c_i for S) - sum(b_i for T), where T is the k items in S with the highest b_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for S - T) - sum(a_i for S).

Given that T is the k items in S with the highest b_i, this is sum(b_i for S) - sum(b_i for T) - sum(a_i for S).

Which is sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

So, profit = sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

Alice wants to maximize this over S, and Bob chooses T to minimize it.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider that for each possible S, the profit is sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

To maximize this, Alice wants to maximize sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

This seems like I need to select S such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) is maximized, minus the sum of the top k b_i in S.

This is equivalent to maximizing sum(b_i - a_i for S) - sum(b_i for T).

Let me think about sorting the items in a certain way.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i.

Then, for any S, the top k b_i in S are the first k in this ordering.

Wait, not necessarily, because S is a subset.

This seems too vague.
