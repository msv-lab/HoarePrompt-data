Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Petya has an array of n integers, and Vasya wants to create his own array of n integers from a given list of m integers, where m is at least n. Vasya can choose any n integers from the list of m and arrange them in any order to form his array c. The goal is to maximize the total difference D, which is the sum of the absolute differences between corresponding elements of Petya's array a and Vasya's array c.

Okay, so the problem is to maximize D = sum(|a_i - c_i|) for i from 1 to n.

First, I need to understand what makes D as large as possible. The absolute difference |a_i - c_i| is maximized when c_i is as far away as possible from a_i. So, for each a_i, I should pair it with the c_j that is farthest from it.

But there's a catch: I have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them in a specific order to pair with a_i's. Also, m can be larger than n, so I need to select which n elements to use from the m available.

Given that, I need a strategy to select and arrange the c_i's to maximize the sum of differences.

Let me think about sorting. If I sort both arrays, perhaps I can pair the smallest a_i with the largest c_j, or something like that.

Wait, in the example provided:

Input:

9

4 6

6 1 2 4

3 5 1 7 2 3

Output:

16

In this case, a = [6,1,2,4], c = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

One possible arrangement is c = [1,5,7,2], which gives D = |6-1| + |1-5| + |2-7| + |4-2| = 5 + 4 + 5 + 2 = 16.

Alternatively, another arrangement could be [3,7,1,2], giving D = |6-3| + |1-7| + |2-1| + |4-2| = 3 + 6 + 1 + 2 = 12, which is less than 16.

So, the strategy seems to be pairing smaller a_i with larger c_j and larger a_i with smaller c_j, to maximize the differences.

Wait, in the first example, a sorted is [1,2,4,6], and c sorted in reverse is [7,5,3,3,2,1]. If we pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=7, a[1]=2 with c[1]=5, a[2]=4 with c[2]=3, a[3]=6 with c[3]=3, then D = |1-7| + |2-5| + |4-3| + |6-3| = 6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13, which is less than 16.

Hmm, but in the sample, they paired a[0]=6 with c[0]=1, a[1]=1 with c[1]=5, a[2]=2 with c[2]=7, a[3]=4 with c[3]=2, giving D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, it's not just sorting a and c in opposite orders and pairing them directly.

Maybe I need to select which c's to use and in what order to maximize the sum of differences.

Let me consider another approach. Since we can arrange the c's in any order, the order of c doesn't matter as much as which c's are paired with which a's.

Wait, but we have to choose n elements from m, and arrange them in any order. So, we need to select a subset of c of size n, and then arrange them to maximize the sum of absolute differences with a.

This sounds like we need to select n elements from c, and pair each with an a, to maximize the sum of |a_i - c_j|.

This seems similar to the assignment problem in optimization, where we want to maximize the sum of pairwise differences.

But m can be up to 2e5, and t can be up to 100, so we need an efficient solution.

Let me think about sorting.

If I sort a in ascending order and c in descending order, and pair a[i] with c[i], that might give a high sum of differences.

Wait, in the first example, sorted a: [1,2,4,6], sorted c in descending order: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pairing a[0]=1 with c[0]=7: difference 6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: difference 3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3: difference 1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3: difference 3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, which is less than 16.

But in the sample, they paired a[0]=6 with c[0]=1: difference 5

a[1]=1 with c[1]=5: difference 4

a[2]=2 with c[2]=7: difference 5

a[3]=4 with c[3]=2: difference 2

Total D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, their pairing is better.

This suggests that just sorting a and c in opposite orders and pairing them directly isn't always optimal.

Maybe I need to select which c's to use and in what order more carefully.

Let me consider that I need to select a subset of c of size n, and arrange them in a way that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

Perhaps I should consider for each a_i, what c_j would give the maximum |a_i - c_j|, but I can't choose the same c_j for multiple a_i.

Wait, that's the assignment problem.

But with large n and m, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort c in ascending order.

- Then, for each a_i, find the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, without reusing c_j.

But again, this seems like the assignment problem.

An alternative idea: since we can arrange c in any order, maybe I can select the c's and pair them in a way that the sum is maximized.

Wait, perhaps I can sort a and c, and then pair the smallest a with the largest c, the second smallest a with the second largest c, and so on.

Let me try this in the first example.

sorted a: [1,2,4,6]

sorted c in descending order: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Pair a[0]=1 with c[0]=7: difference 6

a[1]=2 with c[1]=5: difference 3

a[2]=4 with c[2]=3: difference 1

a[3]=6 with c[3]=3: difference 3

Total D=6+3+1+3=13, which is less than 16.

So, this isn't optimal.

Another idea: maybe I should sort a and c, and then for each a_i, choose the c_j that is farthest from a_i, without reusing c_j.

But in practice, this is similar to the previous approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to select c's that are as different as possible from a's.

Let me consider that the maximum possible D is achieved when each c_i is as far as possible from the corresponding a_i.

To maximize the sum, I should pair small a_i with large c_j and large a_i with small c_j.

Wait, that's what I did earlier.

Another thought: maybe I should consider the maximum and minimum in c, and pair them accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can select the largest and smallest elements from c to pair with appropriate a_i's.

Let me consider that.

In the first example:

a = [6,1,2,4]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3]

sorted a: [1,2,4,6]

sorted c: [1,2,3,3,5,7]

To maximize D, perhaps pair smallest a with largest c, and largest a with smallest c.

So, pair a=1 with c=7: difference 6

a=2 with c=5: difference 3

a=4 with c=3: difference 1

a=6 with c=1: difference 5

Total D=6+3+1+5=15, which is still less than 16.

But in the sample, they achieved 16 by pairing a=6 with c=1: difference 5

a=1 with c=5: difference 4

a=2 with c=7: difference 5

a=4 with c=2: difference 2

Total D=5+4+5+2=16.

So, their pairing is different.

This suggests that it's not just about pairing smallest a with largest c, but maybe a more nuanced approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the c's that I'm going to use, and then arrange them in a way that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

But selecting which c's to use is also important.

Wait, perhaps I can select the c's that allow me to maximize the differences.

Another idea: since I can arrange c in any order, maybe I should consider all permutations of c and choose the one that maximizes the sum of |a_i - c_i|.

But that's not practical for large n.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort c in ascending order.

- Then, for each a_i, find the c_j that maximizes |a_i - c_j|, without reusing c_j.

But again, this is similar to what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand their approach.

In the reference solution:

- They sort a in ascending order.

- They sort c in descending order.

- Then, they iterate through a and c, choosing at each step the c_j that maximizes the difference with a_i.

- They keep track of two pointers, one starting from the beginning of c (largest elements since c is sorted descending) and one starting from the end of c (smallest elements).

- For each a_i, they choose the c_j that gives the larger difference: either the current largest c_j or the current smallest c_j.

- They add the maximum of these two differences to the total D.

- They move the pointer accordingly: if they choose the largest c_j, they move to the next largest; if they choose the smallest c_j, they move to the next smallest.

This seems like a greedy approach.

Let me see if this works with the first example.

a = [6,1,2,4] sorted ascending: [1,2,4,6]

c = [3,5,1,7,2,3] sorted descending: [7,5,3,3,2,1]

Initialize pointers: i=0 (pointing to c=7), j=1 (pointing to c=5)

For a[0]=1:

Option 1: |1 - 7| = 6

Option 2: |1 - 1| = 0

Choose 6, add to D, move i to 1 (c=5)

D=6

For a[1]=2:

Option 1: |2 - 5| = 3

Option 2: |2 - 1| = 1

Choose 3, add to D, move i to 2 (c=3)

D=6+3=9

For a[2]=4:

Option 1: |4 - 3| = 1

Option 2: |4 - 1| = 3

Choose 3, add to D, move j to 2 (c=2)

D=9+3=12

For a[3]=6:

Option 1: |6 - 3| = 3

Option 2: |6 - 2| = 4

Choose 4, add to D, move j to 3 (c=1)

D=12+4=16

Total D=16, which matches the sample.

Okay, this seems to work.

So, the approach is:

- Sort a in ascending order.

- Sort c in descending order.

- Initialize two pointers: i=0 (start of c, largest elements) and j=1 (end of c, smallest elements).

- For each a_k in sorted a, choose the c_j that gives the maximum difference |a_k - c_j|, where c_j is either c[i] (largest remaining) or c[m-1-j] (smallest remaining).

- Add this maximum difference to D.

- Move the pointer accordingly: if chose largest, move i forward; if chose smallest, move j forward.

This seems to be a greedy algorithm that works for this problem.

Let me see if this works for other test cases.

Take the second example:

n=3, m=4

a=[1,1,1]

c=[1,1,1,1]

sorted a: [1,1,1]

sorted c descending: [1,1,1,1]

Initialize i=0 (c=1), j=1 (c=1)

For a[0]=1:

Option 1: |1-1|=0

Option 2: |1-1|=0

Choose 0, add to D, move i to 1 (c=1)

D=0

For a[1]=1:

Option 1: |1-1|=0

Option 2: |1-1|=0

Choose 0, add to D, move i to 2 (c=1)

D=0+0=0

For a[2]=1:

Option 1: |1-1|=0

Option 2: |1-1|=0

Choose 0, add to D, move j to 2 (c=1)

D=0+0+0=0

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=5, m=5

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

c=[1,2,3,4,5]

sorted a: [1,2,3,4,5]

sorted c descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Initialize i=0 (c=5), j=1 (c=4)

For a[0]=1:

Option 1: |1-5|=4

Option 2: |1-1|=0

Choose 4, add to D, move i to 1 (c=4)

D=4

For a[1]=2:

Option 1: |2-4|=2

Option 2: |2-1|=1

Choose 2, add to D, move i to 2 (c=3)

D=4+2=6

For a[2]=3:

Option 1: |3-3|=0

Option 2: |3-1|=2

Choose 2, add to D, move j to 2 (c=2)

D=6+2=8

For a[3]=4:

Option 1: |4-3|=1

Option 2: |4-2|=2

Choose 2, add to D, move j to 3 (c=1)

D=8+2=10

For a[4]=5:

Option 1: |5-1|=4

Option 2: |5-1|=4

Choose 4, add to D, move i to 3 (c=1)

D=10+4=14

But the sample output for this test case is 12, but according to this approach, it's 14.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output. Let me check the sample input and output again.

Looking back at the sample input:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

1 2 3 4 5

Output: 12

But according to this approach, D=14, which is higher than 12.

Wait, perhaps the approach is not correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in applying the approach.

Wait, in the sample input, m=5, n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5], c=[1,2,3,4,5]

sorted a: [1,2,3,4,5]

sorted c descending: [5,4,3,2,1]

Following the approach:

Initialize i=0 (c=5), j=1 (c=4)

For a[0]=1:

Option 1: |1-5|=4

Option 2: |1-1|=0

Choose 4, add to D, move i to 1 (c=4)

D=4

For a[1]=2:

Option 1: |2-4|=2

Option 2: |2-1|=1

Choose 2, add to D, move i to 2 (c=3)

D=4+2=6

For a[2]=3:

Option 1: |3-3|=0

Option 2: |3-1|=2

Choose 2, add to D, move j to 2 (c=2)

D=6+2=8

For a[3]=4:

Option 1: |4-2|=2

Option 2: |4-1|=3

Choose 3, add to D, move j to 3 (c=1)

D=8+3=11

For a[4]=5:

Option 1: |5-1|=4

Option 2: Since j=3, which is m=5, so c[m-1-j]=c[5-1-3]=c[1]=2

Wait, the code has c[m - j], but in zero-indexing, it's c[m - 1 - j].

So, m=5, j=3, c[m-1-j]=c[5-1-3]=c[1]=2

Option 1: |5-1|=4

Option 2: |5-2|=3

Choose 4, add to D, move i to 3 (c=1)

D=11+4=15

But the sample output is 12, which is less than 15.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there is a constraint that we cannot choose c_j that has been already used.

In the approach, we need to ensure that each c_j is used only once.

In the above steps, I assumed that c_j are not reused, but perhaps there is an overlap.

Wait, in the approach described in the reference solution, they have:

for k in range(len(a)):

t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])

t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])

if t2 > t1:

j += 1

else:

i += 1

ans += max(t1, t2)

So, in the above example:

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

c = [5,4,3,2,1]

Initialize i=0, j=1

k=0:

t1 = |1-5|=4

t2 = |5-1|=4

Choose max(4,4)=4, since t1 == t2, choose to increment i to 1

D=4

k=1:

t1 = |2-4|=2

t2 = |4-2|=2

Choose max(2,2)=2, t1 == t2, increment i to 2

D=4+2=6

k=2:

t1 = |3-3|=0

t2 = |3-3|=0

Choose max(0,0)=0, t1 == t2, increment i to 3

D=6+0=6

k=3:

t1 = |4-2|=2

t2 = |2-1|=1

Choose max(2,1)=2, t1 > t2, increment i to 4

D=6+2=8

k=4:

t1 = |5-1|=4

t2 = since j=5, c[m - j] = c[5 - 5]=c[0]=5, but perhaps index error here.

Wait, len(c) - j would be 5 - 5 = 0, so c[0]=5

t2 = |1 - 5|=4

Choose max(4,4)=4, t1 == t2, increment i to 5

D=8+4=12

Which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, D=12.

In my earlier manual calculation, I think I misapplied the algorithm.

So, the reference solution seems correct.

Thus, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
