Alright, I've got this problem to check if a given password is strong based on specific conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the conditions for a strong password are:

1. It should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there should be another letter or the string ends).

3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each with a password of length n, where n is between 1 and 20, and the password consists only of lowercase letters and digits.

Looking at the provided program:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case, it reads n and the password.

- It calls func_1(n, password) and prints the result.

Now, let's look into func_1:

- It separates the password into letters and digits.

- It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order and if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

- It also checks that no digit comes after a letter in the password.

- If all these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

Let's see if this aligns with the problem requirements.

Condition 1: Only lowercase letters and digits.

- The problem states that the password will consist only of lowercase letters and digits, so we don't need to handle invalid characters. We can assume that the input will always meet this condition.

Condition 2: No digit should come after a letter.

- This means that all letters must appear before any digits in the password.

- In other words, once a digit appears, no letters should follow it.

- The program checks this by iterating through the password and ensuring that no letter is followed by a digit.

Condition 3: Digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

- The program collects all digits and checks if they are sorted.

Condition 4: Letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

- Similarly, the program collects all letters and checks if they are sorted.

Seems straightforward. But let's think about potential edge cases to ensure the program handles them correctly.

Edge Case 1: Password with only letters.

- For example, "aaa".

- Letters are sorted, no digits present.

- Should return 'YES'.

Edge Case 2: Password with only digits.

- For example, "111".

- Digits are sorted, no letters present.

- Should return 'YES'.

Edge Case 3: Password with letters followed by digits.

- For example, "a1".

- Letters are sorted, digits are sorted, and no digit comes after a letter.

- Should return 'YES'.

Edge Case 4: Password with digits followed by letters.

- For example, "1a".

- Even if letters and digits are sorted within their groups, a digit comes before a letter, which is allowed only if no letter comes after a digit.

- In this case, '1' is followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit, but according to condition 2, it's forbidden for a digit to come after a letter, which might be confusing.

Wait a minute, condition 2 says: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- This means that if a letter appears before a digit, it's acceptable, but a digit should not appear before a letter if there are letters after digits.

- In other words, all letters must come before any digits in the password.

- So, "1a" should be invalid because 'a' comes after '1', violating condition 2.

- But actually, in "1a", '1' comes before 'a', which is allowed, but according to condition 2, there should be no digit after a letter.

- Wait, condition 2 is phrased as: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- So, in "1a", 'a' comes after '1', which is a letter coming after a digit, but condition 2 is about digits coming after letters.

- Hmm, maybe I need to rephrase it.

- Let's look back: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- So, if a letter is present, any digit after that letter is invalid.

- In "1a", '1' is followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit, but condition 2 is about digits after letters.

- Wait, condition 2 is: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- In "1a", '1' is a digit followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit.

- According to condition 2, it's forbidden for a digit to come after a letter.

- But in "1a", 'a' comes after '1', which is a letter coming after a digit.

- So, is "1a" allowed or not?

- Wait, the condition says: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- In "1a", '1' is a digit that comes after 'a', which is not the case; '1' comes before 'a'.

- Wait, no: 'a' comes after '1'.

- The condition is: no digit should come after a letter.

- In "1a", 'a' is after '1', but '1' is not coming after 'a'; '1' is before 'a'.

- So, in "1a", there is no digit coming after a letter; the digit comes before the letter.

- Therefore, "1a" should be valid.

- But according to the problem's example, in testcase 5, "011679" is 'YES', which is digits only, and in testcase 4, "ac123" is 'NO', which has letters followed by digits, but according to the explanation, it's 'NO' because a digit comes after a letter, which is not allowed.

- Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter", meaning that after any letter, there should not be any digit.

- So, in "ac123", 'c' is followed by '1', which is a digit after a letter, hence invalid.

- In "1a", '1' is followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit, which is allowed, because the condition禁止的是digit coming after a letter, which doesn't happen in "1a".

- Wait, no: "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- So, if a letter is present, no digit should come after it.

- In "ac123", 'c' is followed by '1', which is a digit after a letter, hence invalid.

- In "1a", '1' is followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit, which is allowed, because the condition only forbids digits after letters, not letters after digits.

- So, "1a" should be valid, but "ac123" is invalid.

- Wait, but in the example, "1a" is 'NO', which contradicts this.

- Wait, no: in the example, testcase 5 is "011679", which is 'YES', and testcase 4 is "ac123", which is 'NO'.

- But according to the above reasoning, "1a" should be 'YES', but in the example, it's not present.

- Wait, the example doesn't include "1a", so maybe I need to consider it's not in the example.

- But to make sure, let's consider "1a".

- According to the condition, "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- In "1a", '1' is followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit, which is allowed.

- So, "1a" should be 'YES'.

- But in the program, func_1 checks that for each position, if it's a letter followed by a digit, return 'NO'.

- So, in "1a", '1' is a digit followed by 'a', which is a letter.

- So, in the loop, i=0, password[0]='1', which is a digit, password[1]='a', which is a letter.

- Since password[0].isalpha() is False, so it doesn't check anything.

- Then, it checks if letters are sorted and digits are sorted.

- In "1a", letters are 'a', which is sorted, digits are '1', which is sorted.

- So, it should return 'YES'.

- But according to the problem's logic, "1a" should be 'YES', as it's allowed.

- Wait, but in the problem's example, "ac123" is 'NO' because a digit comes after a letter.

- So, "ac123" has letters 'a','c' followed by digits '1','2','3'.

- In "ac123", 'c' is followed by '1', which is a digit after a letter, which violates condition 2.

- Hence, 'NO'.

- In "1a", '1' is followed by 'a', which is a letter after a digit, which is allowed.

- So, 'YES'.

- Therefore, the program seems to handle this correctly.

Another edge case: "a1"

- Letters 'a', digits '1', and no digit comes after a letter.

- Should be 'YES'.

"1a"

- Letters 'a', digits '1', and no digit comes after a letter.

- Should be 'YES'.

"abc123"

- Letters 'a','b','c', digits '1','2','3', and no digit comes after a letter.

- Should be 'YES'.

"abc321"

- Letters 'a','b','c' (sorted), digits '3','2','1' (not sorted).

- Should be 'NO'.

"123abc"

- Letters 'a','b','c' (sorted), digits '1','2','3' (sorted), and no letter comes after a digit.

- Should be 'YES'.

"123cba"

- Letters 'c','b','a' (not sorted), digits '1','2','3' (sorted).

- Should be 'NO'.

"a1b2"

- Letters 'a','b' (sorted), digits '1','2' (sorted), but 'a' followed by '1', '1' followed by 'b', 'b' followed by '2'.

- Since '1' is followed by 'b', which is a letter after a digit, but according to condition 2, it's forbidden for a digit to come after a letter, not vice versa.

- So, in "a1b2", 'a' is followed by '1', and 'b' is followed by '2'.

- There is no digit coming after a letter; '1' comes after 'a', and '2' comes after 'b'.

- According to condition 2, there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

- In "a1b2", '1' comes after 'a', and '2' comes after 'b'.

- So, it violates condition 2.

- Hence, should be 'NO'.

But according to the program:

- It separates letters: ['a','b']

- Digits: ['1','2']

- Checks if letters are sorted: 'a','b' → yes

- Digits are sorted: '1','2' → yes

- Then, it checks for each position if a letter is followed by a digit.

- In "a1b2", position 0: 'a' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → return 'NO'

- So, correctly returns 'NO'.

Another case: "abc123"

- Letters 'a','b','c' (sorted), digits '1','2','3' (sorted)

- 'c' is followed by '1', which is a digit after a letter → should return 'NO'

- Program will iterate through positions:

- 0: 'a' followed by 'b' → both letters

- 1: 'b' followed by 'c' → both letters

- 2: 'c' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → return 'NO'

- Correctly returns 'NO'

Another case: "123abc"

- Letters 'a','b','c' (sorted), digits '1','2','3' (sorted)

- '3' followed by 'a' → letter after digit, but no digit after letter

- Program checks:

- 0: '1' followed by '2' → both digits

- 1: '2' followed by '3' → both digits

- 2: '3' followed by 'a' → digit followed by letter → allowed

- 3: 'a' followed by 'b' → both letters

- 4: 'b' followed by 'c' → both letters

- So, no letter is followed by a digit → returns 'YES'

Seems correct.

Another case: "a1"

- Letters 'a', digits '1'

- 'a' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → 'NO'

- Program will return 'NO'

Wait, but according to condition 2, there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

- In "a1", '1' comes after 'a', which is a digit after a letter → should be 'NO'

- Program returns 'NO' correctly.

Another case: "1a"

- Letters 'a', digits '1'

- '1' followed by 'a' → digit followed by letter → allowed

- Program checks:

- 0: '1' followed by 'a' → digit followed by letter → allowed

- Returns 'YES'

Correct.

Another case: "ab12"

- Letters 'a','b', digits '1','2'

- 'b' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → 'NO'

- Program returns 'NO'

Correct.

Another case: "12ab"

- Letters 'a','b', digits '1','2'

- '2' followed by 'a' → digit followed by letter → allowed

- Program returns 'YES'

Correct.

Another case: "a2b1"

- Letters 'a','b', digits '2','1'

- Letters are 'a','b' (sorted), digits are '1','2' (not sorted)

- 'b' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → 'NO'

- Program returns 'NO'

Correct.

Seems like the program handles various cases correctly.

Now, looking back at the provided program:

def func_1(n, password):

letters = []

digits = []

for ch in password:

if ch.isdigit():

digits.append(ch)

else:

letters.append(ch)

if letters != sorted(letters):

return 'NO'

if digits != sorted(digits):

return 'NO'

for i in range(len(password) - 1):

if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():

return 'NO'

return 'YES'

Wait a second, in the last loop:

for i in range(len(password) - 1):

if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():

return 'NO'

This checks if any letter is followed by a digit, and if so, returns 'NO'.

But according to the problem, "there should be no digit that comes after a letter".

- Which means, no digit should appear after any letter in the password.

- In other words, all letters must come before any digits.

- So, if there is any position where a letter is followed by a digit, it's invalid.

- Hence, this check seems correct.

Wait, but in the earlier example, "1a" should be 'YES', because '1' is followed by 'a', which is allowed.

- In this loop, when i=0, password[0]='1' (digit), password[1]='a' (letter) → password[i].isalpha() is False, so it doesn't trigger the return 'NO'.

- So, it proceeds to check if letters are sorted and digits are sorted.

- Since letters ['a'] are sorted and digits ['1'] are sorted, it returns 'YES'.

- Correct.

Another example, "a1"

- letters=['a'], digits=['1']

- letters are sorted, digits are sorted

- In the loop, i=0, password[0]='a' (letter), password[1]='1' (digit) → return 'NO'

- Correct.

So, the program seems to handle this correctly.

But let's think about another case: "abc123"

- letters=['a','b','c'], digits=['1','2','3']

- letters are sorted, digits are sorted

- In the loop:

- i=0: 'a' followed by 'b' → both letters → continue

- i=1: 'b' followed by 'c' → both letters → continue

- i=2: 'c' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → return 'NO'

- Correct, because a digit comes after a letter.

Another case: "123abc"

- letters=['a','b','c'], digits=['1','2','3']

- letters are sorted, digits are sorted

- In the loop:

- i=0: '1' followed by '2' → both digits → continue

- i=1: '2' followed by '3' → both digits → continue

- i=2: '3' followed by 'a' → digit followed by letter → allowed

- i=3: 'a' followed by 'b' → both letters → continue

- i=4: 'b' followed by 'c' → both letters → continue

- So, it returns 'YES'

- Correct.

Another case: "a1b2c3"

- letters=['a','b','c'], digits=['1','2','3']

- letters are sorted, digits are sorted

- In the loop:

- i=0: 'a' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → return 'NO'

- Correct, because digits are coming after letters.

Another case: "1a2b3c"

- letters=['a','b','c'], digits=['1','2','3']

- letters are sorted, digits are sorted

- In the loop:

- i=0: '1' followed by 'a' → digit followed by letter → allowed

- i=1: 'a' followed by '2' → letter followed by digit → return 'NO'

- Correct, because 'a' followed by '2' is a digit coming after a letter.

Another case: "abc"

- letters=['a','b','c'], digits=[]

- letters are sorted, digits are sorted (trivially)

- No digit comes after a letter

- Returns 'YES'

Correct.

Another case: "123"

- letters=[], digits=['1','2','3']

- letters are sorted (trivially), digits are sorted

- No letter comes after a digit

- Returns 'YES'

Correct.

Another case: "aaabbbccc111222333"

- letters=['a','a','a','b','b','b','c','c','c'], which are sorted

- digits=['1','1','1','2','2','2','3','3','3'], which are sorted

- In the loop:

- Check each position:

- 'a' followed by 'a' → continue

- 'a' followed by 'b' → continue

- 'b' followed by 'b' → continue

- 'b' followed by 'c' → continue

- 'c' followed by '1' → letter followed by digit → return 'NO'

- Correct, because a digit comes after a letter.

Seems like the program handles this correctly.

But let's think about a case where letters and digits are interspersed differently.

Case: "a1b2c3"

- As above, returns 'NO'

Case: "1a2b3c"

- As above, returns 'NO'

Case: "123abc"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "abc123"

- Returns 'NO'

Case: "1a2b3c"

- Returns 'NO'

Case: "a1b2c3"

- Returns 'NO'

Case: "123abc"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "abc"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "123"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "a"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "1"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: ""

- But n >=1, so empty string not possible

Case: "aa"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "ab"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "ba"

- Returns 'NO', because letters are not sorted

Correct.

Case: "11"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "12"

- Returns 'YES'

Case: "21"

- Returns 'NO', because digits are not sorted

Correct.

Seems comprehensive.

Now, is there any mistake in the program?

Let's check the implementation.

def func_1(n, password):

letters = []

digits = []

for ch in password:

if ch.isdigit():

digits.append(ch)

else:

letters.append(ch)

if letters != sorted(letters):

return 'NO'

if digits != sorted(digits):

return 'NO'

for i in range(len(password) - 1):

if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():

return 'NO'

return 'YES'

Seems correct.

But wait, the problem says: "all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order."

- The program checks if the letters are sorted and digits are sorted separately.

- Also, ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

- Which aligns with the problem's requirements.

Potential issue: If the password has letters followed by digits, it's invalid, which is correct.

Another potential issue: If the password has digits followed by letters, it's valid, provided letters and digits are sorted within their groups.

- The program handles this correctly.

Another potential issue: If the password has mixed letters and digits without proper ordering.

- The program checks both the sorting within groups and the positioning of digits not coming after letters.

Seems solid.

I think the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given password is strong based on specific conditions. The conditions are:

1. The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. There should be no digit that comes after a letter (i.e., after each letter, there should be another letter or the string ends).
3. All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Approach

1. **Separation and Sorting Check**:
    - Separate the password into letters and digits.
    - Check if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
    - Check if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Positional Check**:
    - Ensure that no digit comes after a letter in the password.

3. **Output Decision**:
    - If all checks pass, the password is strong ('YES'); otherwise, it is not ('NO').

## Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

## Explanation

- **Step 1**: Read the number of test cases, `t`.
- **Step 2**: For each test case, read the password length, `n`, and the password itself.
- **Step 3**: Use the function `func_1` to check if the password meets the criteria:
  - Collect all letters and digits into separate lists.
  - Ensure letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - Ensure no digit comes after any letter in the password.
- **Step 4**: Print 'YES' if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise 'NO'.

This approach efficiently checks the required conditions by leveraging list operations and iterative checks, ensuring the solution is both clear and effective.
