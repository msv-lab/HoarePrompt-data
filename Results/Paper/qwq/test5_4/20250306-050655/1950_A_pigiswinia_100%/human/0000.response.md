Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given three digits, a, b, and c, and I need to determine if they form a stair, a peak, or neither. A stair is defined as a < b < c, and a peak is a < b > c. Got it.

First, I need to understand the input and output formats. The input starts with an integer t, which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, there's a line with three digits a, b, and c, each ranging from 0 to 9.

My task is to read these test cases and for each one, print "STAIR" if a < b < c, "PEAK" if a < b > c, and "NONE" otherwise.

Let me look at the example to make sure I understand:

Input:

7

1 2 3

3 2 1

1 5 3

3 4 1

0 0 0

4 1 7

4 5 7

Output:

STAIR

NONE

PEAK

PEAK

NONE

NONE

STAIR

Okay, so for the first test case, 1 < 2 < 3, which is a stair, so "STAIR".

Second test case, 3 > 2 > 1, which doesn't match either condition, so "NONE".

Third test case, 1 < 5 > 3, which is a peak, so "PEAK".

Fourth test case, 3 < 4 > 1, which is also a peak, so "PEAK".

Fifth test case, 0 == 0 == 0, which doesn't match either condition, so "NONE".

Sixth test case, 4 > 1 < 7, which doesn't match either condition, so "NONE".

Seventh test case, 4 < 5 < 7, which is a stair, so "STAIR".

Seems straightforward. Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it correctly implements this logic.

The program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())

if a < b < c:

print('STAIR')

elif a < b > c:

print('PEAK')

else:

print('NONE')

So, it defines a function func(), reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, reads three integers a, b, c.

Then, it checks if a < b < c, and if so, prints "STAIR".

Else, it checks if a < b > c, and if so, prints "PEAK".

Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

Looking back at the problem statement, this seems to match exactly what's required.

Let me think if there are any edge cases that this might not handle correctly.

Consider a = b = c = 0, which is the fifth test case, should print "NONE", which it does, because neither a < b < c nor a < b > c is true.

Another case: a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, same as above.

a = 1, b = 2, c = 2, this should be "NONE", because a < b == c is not a stair or a peak.

a = 2, b = 1, c = 3, this is not a stair (2 < 1 < 3 is false) nor a peak (2 < 1 > 3 is false), so "NONE".

a = 0, b = 9, c = 5, this should be "PEAK" since 0 < 9 > 5.

a = 3, b = 4, c = 4, this should be "NONE", because a < b == c is not a stair or a peak.

a = 5, b = 4, c = 3, this should be "NONE", since 5 < 4 < 3 is false and 5 < 4 > 3 is false.

Seems like the program handles these cases correctly.

Another thing to consider is the constraints: a, b, c are digits from 0 to 9, so no need to worry about very large numbers or negative numbers.

Also, since they are digits, no need to worry about non-integer inputs, as the problem specifies digits.

The input format is straightforward: first t, then t lines each with three integers.

The program reads input using input() and splits it correctly.

I think this should work as expected.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
