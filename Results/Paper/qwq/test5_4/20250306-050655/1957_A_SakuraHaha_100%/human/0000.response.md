Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks with various lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with the condition that each polygon is made up of sticks of the same length and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. So, for example, an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length, a square has four, a pentagon has five, and so on.

Given that, the key point here is that each polygon must have all sides of the same length, and each stick can only be used in one polygon. Also, sticks cannot be broken, so each side of a polygon must be exactly one stick.

My task is to maximize the number of such polygons I can form simultaneously.

Looking at the example provided:

- In the first test case, there's only one stick, which isn't enough to form any polygon since a polygon needs at least three sides.

- In the second test case, there are two sticks of the same length, but again, that's not enough to form a polygon because you need at least three sides.

- In the third test case, there are six sticks: two of length 2 and four of length 3. The solution says you can form one polygon, presumably a square using four sticks of length 3.

- In the fourth test case, there are nine sticks: four of length 2 and five of length 4. The solution says you can form two polygons: a pentagon with five sticks of length 2 and a square with four sticks of length 4.

From this, it seems that for each unique stick length, I can form as many polygons as possible given the number of sticks of that length, but each polygon requires at least three sticks of the same length.

Wait, but in the third test case, there are four sticks of length 3, which can form one square, but in the fourth test case, there are five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4, and the solution is two polygons: one pentagon and one square.

So, it's not just about forming the maximum number of polygons from each stick length separately, but rather combining polygons of different sizes as long as they don't share sticks.

But actually, since sticks of different lengths are used for different polygons, and no stick is used in more than one polygon, I can consider each unique stick length separately and see how many polygons I can form from them independently, then sum those up.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right based on the example. In the fourth test case, you have sticks of lengths 2 and 4, and you can form one pentagon from the five sticks of length 2 and one square from the four sticks of length 4, totaling two polygons.

So, it seems that for each unique stick length, I can form polygons using as many sticks of that length as possible, given that each polygon requires a certain number of sticks (at least 3 for a triangle, 4 for a square, etc.), and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

But in the third test case, there are two sticks of length 2 and four of length 3. The solution chooses to form one square from the four sticks of length 3, ignoring the two sticks of length 2, which are not enough to form a polygon.

So, the strategy seems to be: for each unique stick length, determine how many polygons I can form from the sticks of that length, given that each polygon requires at least 3 sticks of that length, and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

But in the fourth test case, there are five sticks of length 2 and four of length 4. You can form one pentagon from the five sticks of length 2 and one square from the four sticks of length 4, totaling two polygons.

Wait, but what if I tried to form a different combination? For example, could I form two squares, one from four sticks of length 2 and one from four sticks of length 4, ignoring the extra stick of length 2? But no, because a square requires four sticks of the same length, and I have only four sticks of length 2 (but I have five), so I could form one square from four sticks of length 2 and another square from four sticks of length 4, but that would leave one stick of length 2 unused. But the problem allows unused sticks, as long as the number of polygons is maximized.

But in this case, forming a pentagon from five sticks of length 2 and a square from four sticks of length 4 uses all sticks and forms two polygons, which seems better than forming two squares and leaving one stick unused.

Wait, but in terms of maximizing the number of polygons, forming two squares would give me two polygons as well, but the example output is 2, which matches forming one pentagon and one square.

So, perhaps the number of polygons is maximized by forming as many polygons as possible, regardless of their size, as long as no stick is used in more than one polygon.

But in the fourth test case, forming one pentagon and one square uses all sticks and forms two polygons, which is the same number as forming two squares (using four sticks of length 2 and four of length 4), but in the latter case, one stick of length 2 would be left unused.

But the problem doesn't specify that we have to use all sticks, just that no stick is used in more than one polygon.

So, in terms of maximizing the number of polygons, forming two squares would also give me two polygons, but the example shows that forming one pentagon and one square is acceptable, also resulting in two polygons.

So, perhaps in this case, both approaches yield the same number of polygons.

But let's consider another scenario. Suppose I have six sticks of length 2: I could form two triangles (each triangle requires three sticks), resulting in two polygons, or I could form one hexagon, which would be one polygon. So, in this case, forming smaller polygons allows me to maximize the number of polygons.

Wait, but in that case, forming two triangles uses six sticks to make two polygons, while forming one hexagon uses the same six sticks to make one polygon. So, to maximize the number of polygons, I should prefer forming smaller polygons.

But, in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, I can form one square, which is one polygon, or I could form one triangle with three sticks and have one stick left unused, which would give me one polygon anyway.

But the example chooses to form one square, which is one polygon, which seems better than forming one triangle and leaving one stick unused.

Wait, but in that case, both approaches give the same number of polygons, so it doesn't matter.

In the fourth test case, forming one pentagon and one square uses all sticks and forms two polygons, while forming two squares would also use eight sticks and leave one stick unused, still forming two polygons.

So, in terms of maximizing the number of polygons, both approaches yield the same result.

Perhaps the key is to form as many smallest possible polygons as we can, given the sticks available, without leaving any sticks that could form an additional polygon.

But in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, forming one square is better than forming one triangle and leaving one stick unused, because in both cases, only one polygon is formed.

Wait, but if I have four sticks of length 3, I can form one square, which is one polygon, or I can form one triangle and have one stick left, which is still one polygon.

So, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same.

But perhaps the problem is to maximize the number of polygons, and in cases where multiple approaches yield the same number of polygons, either approach is acceptable.

Given that, perhaps the general strategy is: for each unique stick length, determine how many polygons I can form from the sticks of that length, given that each polygon requires at least three sticks, and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

Then, sum up the number of polygons that can be formed from each stick length.

But in the provided code, it seems to be doing something different.

Looking at the code:

- It reads the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case, it calls func_1().

- In func_1(), it reads n, the number of sticks, and then the list of stick lengths, a.

- It initializes ans to 0.

- It creates a dictionary cnt to count the occurrences of each stick length.

- Then, for each count in cnt.values(), it adds x // 3 to ans, where x is the count.

- Finally, it prints ans.

So, the code is essentially, for each unique stick length, taking the floor division of the count by 3 and adding that to the answer.

This suggests that it's trying to form triangles as much as possible from the sticks of each length, since a triangle requires 3 sticks.

But in the example, in the fourth test case, it forms a pentagon (5 sticks) and a square (4 sticks), which is not just forming triangles.

So, this seems inconsistent with the approach suggested by the code.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to maximize the number of polygons by forming the smallest possible polygons, which would be triangles, requiring 3 sticks each.

So, for each stick length, it calculates how many triangles it can form from the sticks of that length, and sums those up.

But in the third test case, with four sticks of length 3, it would calculate 4 // 3 = 1, which matches forming one square (which is acceptable, as a square is a polygon).

But in the fourth test case, with five sticks of length 2, 5 // 3 = 1, and with four sticks of length 4, 4 // 3 = 1, totaling 2 polygons, which matches the example output.

So, perhaps this approach works in this case.

But is this general? Let's consider another example.

Suppose I have seven sticks of length 2.

According to the code, 7 // 3 = 2, so it would say I can form two triangles, using 6 sticks, and have one stick left unused.

But alternatively, I could form one triangle and one quadrilateral, using 3 + 4 = 7 sticks, forming two polygons.

But according to the code, it would only count 2 polygons from 7 // 3 = 2, which matches the alternative approach.

Wait, but in this case, forming one triangle and one quadrilateral uses all seven sticks to form two polygons, which is the same as forming two triangles and leaving one stick unused.

So, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same.

But perhaps forming larger polygons is not necessary, as long as the number of polygons is maximized.

Wait, but in this case, forming a quadrilateral uses more sticks than a triangle, but results in the same number of polygons.

So, to maximize the number of polygons, it's better to form smaller polygons.

Hence, the code's approach of forming as many triangles as possible makes sense, because triangles use the fewest sticks per polygon.

In the earlier example, with seven sticks, forming two triangles uses six sticks and leaves one unused, but still gives two polygons, which is the same as forming one triangle and one quadrilateral.

So, in terms of the number of polygons, it's the same.

Hence, the code's approach seems valid.

Another example: suppose I have six sticks of length 2.

According to the code, 6 // 3 = 2, so it can form two triangles.

Alternatively, I could form two triangles and leave none unused, or form one hexagon, which is one polygon, which is worse in terms of the number of polygons.

Or form one square and one triangle, which is two polygons, same as forming two triangles.

So, again, the code's approach matches the maximum number of polygons.

Another example: suppose I have three sticks of length 2 and three sticks of length 3.

According to the code, (3 // 3) + (3 // 3) = 1 + 1 = 2, so it can form two polygons.

Indeed, I can form one triangle from the sticks of length 2 and one triangle from the sticks of length 3, totaling two polygons.

Alternatively, I could form one triangle from three sticks of length 2 and another triangle from three sticks of length 3, same as above.

So, again, the code's approach works.

Another example: suppose I have four sticks of length 2 and four sticks of length 3.

According to the code, (4 // 3) + (4 // 3) = 1 + 1 = 2, so it can form two polygons.

Indeed, I can form one square from four sticks of length 3 and one triangle from three sticks of length 2, leaving one stick of length 2 unused, totaling two polygons.

Alternatively, I could form one triangle from three sticks of length 2 and one triangle from three sticks of length 3, leaving one stick of length 3 unused, still totaling two polygons.

So, again, the code's approach matches the maximum number of polygons.

Hence, it seems that the code's method of dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (using floor division) and summing up the quotients gives the correct maximum number of polygons.

But why does this work?

Because the smallest polygon requires three sticks, so the maximum number of polygons I can form from sticks of a particular length is the floor division of the count of those sticks by 3.

By summing this over all unique stick lengths, I get the total maximum number of polygons.

This approach ensures that I'm forming as many small polygons as possible, which aligns with maximizing the count.

Hence, the given code seems to be correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{2} \]
