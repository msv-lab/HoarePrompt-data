Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given multiple test cases, each consisting of a number of sticks with different lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with the condition that each polygon is made up of sticks of the same length and no stick is used in more than one polygon.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all interior angles equal. So, for example, an equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length, a square has four, a pentagon has five, and so on.

Given that, the key point here is that each polygon must have all sides of the same length, and each stick can only be used in one polygon. Also, sticks cannot be broken, so each side of a polygon must be exactly one stick.

So, for each unique stick length, I can potentially form one or more polygons, but each polygon requires a certain number of sticks of that length, depending on the number of sides of the polygon.

Wait a minute, the problem says "regular polygons", which can have any number of sides, as long as all sides are equal. So, I could make triangles, squares, pentagons, etc., as long as I have enough sticks of the same length.

But the goal is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily the number of sides or anything else. So, I need to strategy that allows me to form as many separate polygons as possible, given the sticks I have.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should group the sticks by their lengths because each polygon must be made of sticks of the same length.

So, I'll create a frequency count of each unique stick length.

Once I have that, for each group of sticks of the same length, I need to determine how many polygons I can make from that group.

Now, the number of polygons I can make from a group depends on how many sticks I have in that group and how many sticks are needed for each polygon.

But wait, a polygon with k sides requires k sticks of the same length. So, for a given group with frequency f, the maximum number of polygons I can make is f // k, where k is the number of sides of the polygon.

But the problem allows me to choose polygons with any number of sides, as long as all sides are equal. So, for a given group, I can choose to make polygons with different numbers of sides.

Wait, but I need to maximize the total number of polygons, not necessarily the number of polygons from each group.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a group with f sticks of the same length.

I can make as many polygons as possible from these f sticks, each polygon requiring at least 3 sticks (since a polygon must have at least 3 sides).

So, the maximum number of polygons I can make from f sticks is f // 3.

Because each polygon needs at least 3 sticks.

Wait, but actually, if I make polygons with more sides, I'll use more sticks per polygon, which would allow me to make fewer polygons.

But since I want to maximize the number of polygons, I should make as many small polygons as possible, each using the minimal number of sticks, which is 3.

So, making triangles would allow me to make the maximum number of polygons for a given number of sticks.

Wait, but is that always true?

Let's say I have 6 sticks of the same length.

If I make two triangles, I use 6 sticks to make 2 polygons.

Alternatively, if I make one quadrilateral, I use 4 sticks for one polygon, and have 2 sticks left over, which isn't enough to make another polygon.

So, in this case, making triangles allows me to make more polygons.

Similarly, if I have 7 sticks:

- Making two triangles would use 6 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 1 stick left over.

- Making one quadrilateral would use 4 sticks, making 1 polygon, with 3 sticks left over, which can make another triangle, totaling 2 polygons again.

So, in both cases, making as many triangles as possible gives me the maximum number of polygons.

Wait, but in the second scenario, making one quadrilateral and one triangle also gives me 2 polygons.

But making two triangles also gives me 2 polygons.

So, in this case, it's the same.

But if I have, say, 8 sticks:

- Making two triangles uses 6 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 2 sticks left over.

- Making one quadrilateral uses 4 sticks, making 1 polygon, with 4 sticks left over, which can make another quadrilateral, totaling 2 polygons.

- Alternatively, making one quadrilateral and one triangle uses 4 + 3 = 7 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 1 stick left over.

So, again, the maximum number of polygons is 2.

But is there a better way?

Wait, maybe making only quadrilaterals.

With 8 sticks, I can make two quadrilaterals, using 8 sticks, making 2 polygons.

Alternatively, making two triangles uses 6 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 2 sticks left over.

So, in this case, making quadrilaterals is better because I use more sticks into polygons.

Wait, but the goal is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily using all sticks.

So, in this case, making two quadrilaterals uses more sticks but gives the same number of polygons as making two triangles with fewer sticks.

So, in terms of maximizing polygons, it's the same.

But perhaps there are cases where making larger polygons allows for more polygons.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps making smaller polygons allows for more polygons.

Let's consider 9 sticks:

- Making three triangles uses 9 sticks, making 3 polygons.

- Making two quadrilaterals uses 8 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 1 stick left over.

So, in this case, making triangles is better.

Wait, but what if I make one quadrilateral and one pentagon?

That would use 4 + 5 = 9 sticks, making 2 polygons.

Still less than making three triangles.

So, making smaller polygons seems better for maximizing the number of polygons.

Wait, but in the case of 8 sticks:

- Making two quadrilaterals uses 8 sticks, making 2 polygons.

- Making two triangles uses 6 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 2 sticks left over.

- Making one quadrilateral and one triangle uses 4 + 3 = 7 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 1 stick left over.

So, in this case, making two quadrilaterals is better in terms of using more sticks, but the number of polygons is the same as making two triangles.

So, perhaps always making triangles gives the maximum number of polygons.

But perhaps there are cases where making larger polygons allows for more polygons.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps in some cases, making larger polygons is necessary.

But in general, making as many triangles as possible seems to maximize the number of polygons.

Let me think about another example.

Suppose I have 10 sticks.

- Making three triangles uses 9 sticks, making 3 polygons, with 1 stick left over.

- Making two quadrilaterals uses 8 sticks, making 2 polygons, with 2 sticks left over.

- Making one quadrilateral and one hexagon uses 4 + 6 = 10 sticks, making 2 polygons.

So, making triangles gives more polygons.

Another example: 12 sticks.

- Making four triangles uses 12 sticks, making 4 polygons.

- Making three quadrilaterals uses 12 sticks, making 3 polygons.

So, making triangles gives more polygons.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the strategy should be, for each group of sticks of the same length, to make as many triangles as possible.

Therefore, for each group with frequency f, the number of polygons is f // 3.

Then, sum this over all groups to get the total number of polygons.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that polygons must have at least 3 sides, but there is no upper limit on the number of sides.

So, in theory, I could make polygons with any number of sides, as long as it's at least 3.

But as we saw in the examples, making triangles allows for the maximum number of polygons.

So, this seems to be the optimal strategy.

Now, looking back at the reference program, it seems to implement exactly this logic.

It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list of stick lengths.

Then, it counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.

Then, for each frequency in the dictionary, it adds f // 3 to the answer.

Finally, it prints the answer.

This seems correct based on the logic I just derived.

But to be thorough, let's check against the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

4

1

1

2

1 1

6

2 2 3 3 3 3

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Sample Output:

0

0

1

2

Let's verify each test case.

First test case:

n = 1

a = [1]

There's only one stick, which is not enough to form any polygon (since at least 3 sticks are needed). So, output should be 0. Correct.

Second test case:

n = 2

a = [1, 1]

Two sticks of length 1, which is still not enough to form a polygon. So, output should be 0. Correct.

Third test case:

n = 6

a = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]

Group by length:

- Length 2: 2 sticks

- Length 3: 4 sticks

For length 2: 2 // 3 = 0 polygons

For length 3: 4 // 3 = 1 polygon

Total: 0 + 1 = 1 polygon. Correct.

Fourth test case:

n = 9

a = [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4]

Group by length:

- Length 2: 5 sticks

- Length 4: 4 sticks

For length 2: 5 // 3 = 1 polygon

For length 4: 4 // 3 = 1 polygon

Total: 1 + 1 = 2 polygons. Correct.

So, the sample inputs and outputs match the expected results based on the logic.

Additionally, in my earlier examples, this logic also produced the correct maximum number of polygons.

Therefore, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{ \text{The program is correct.} }\]
