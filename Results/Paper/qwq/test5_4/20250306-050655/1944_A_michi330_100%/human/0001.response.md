Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

There are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. So, it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n(n-1)/2.

Everule lives on island 1 and wants to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit, assuming Dominater acts optimally to prevent Everule from reaching as many islands as possible.

First, I need to understand the setup. With n islands and all pairs connected by bridges, Everule can reach any island from island 1 through some path of bridges.

Dominater can destroy up to k bridges to limit Everule's reach. The goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can still reach from island 1.

I need to think about how Dominater can destroy k bridges to best restrict Everule's movement.

In graph terms, this is about connecting nodes in a graph where edges can be removed.

Let me think about small values of n and k to get an intuition.

Take n=2, k=0.

- Islands 1 and 2 are connected by one bridge.

- Dominater can't destroy any bridges (k=0).

- So, Everule can reach island 2.

- Total islands Everule can visit: 2.

n=2, k=1.

- There's only one bridge between 1 and 2.

- Dominater can destroy this bridge (since k=1).

- Now, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- Total islands: 1.

n=3, k=1.

- Islands 1,2,3.

- Bridges: 1-2, 1-3, 2-3.

- If Dominater destroys one bridge, say 1-2.

- Everule can still reach island 2 via 1-3 and 3-2.

- So, Everule can still reach all islands.

- Wait, no. If Dominater destroys 1-2 and 1-3, Everule is isolated.

- But k=1, so can only destroy one bridge.

- If destroy 1-2, Everule can still go 1-3-2.

- If destroy 1-3, similar path 1-2-3.

- If destroy 2-3, Everule can still go 1-2 and 1-3.

- So, with k=1, Everule can still reach all islands.

n=3, k=2.

- Destroy two bridges.

- To isolate island 1, need to destroy all bridges connected to it, which is n-1=2 bridges.

- So, destroy 1-2 and 1-3.

- Now, Everule can only stay on island 1.

- So, minimum islands Everule can visit is 1.

n=4, k=1.

- Islands 1,2,3,4.

- Bridges: all pairs.

- If Dominater destroys one bridge, say 1-2.

- Everule can still reach island 2 via other paths, like 1-3-2 or 1-4-2.

- So, Everule can still reach all islands.

- It seems that with k=1, it's not possible to isolate any island completely.

n=4, k=2.

- Destroy two bridges.

- To isolate island 1, need to destroy all its connections, which is n-1=3 bridges.

- Since k=2 < 3, can't isolate island 1 completely.

- But maybe can isolate one other island.

- For example, destroy 1-2 and 1-3.

- Then, Everule can still reach island 2 via 1-4-2, and island 3 via 1-4-3.

- So, still can reach all islands.

- Seems that with k=2, can't isolate any island completely.

n=4, k=3.

- Destroy three bridges.

- To isolate island 1, need to destroy its 3 connections.

- So, destroy 1-2, 1-3, 1-4.

- Now, Everule is isolated on island 1.

- Minimum islands Everule can visit: 1.

n=5, k=10.

- n=5, total bridges = 10.

- k=10, so can destroy all bridges.

- Then, all islands are isolated.

- Everule can only visit island 1.

- So, minimum islands: 1.

n=5, k=3.

- Total bridges: 10.

- Destroy 3 bridges.

- To minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, Dominater should try to isolate as many islands as possible from island 1.

- But, to isolate one island, say island 2, need to destroy all bridges connecting island 2 to island 1 and to other islands that could provide a path to island 1.

- Wait, but other islands can still connect through multiple paths.

- It's complex.

- Maybe better to think in terms of connecting components.

- In a complete graph, to split it into multiple components, need to remove enough bridges.

- The number of bridges to remove to split the graph into c components is at least (n - c).

- Because, in a tree (minimally connected graph), there are n-1 edges.

- So, to have c components, need at least n - c bridges to remove.

- But in a complete graph, there are more edges, so it's not directly applicable.

- Wait, maybe I need to recall some graph theory.

- In a complete graph with n nodes, to split it into c components, the minimal number of edges to remove is (n - c).

- Because, a connected graph with n nodes has at least n-1 edges (a tree).

- So, to have c components, you need at least c*(n/c -1) edges, but I'm not sure.

- Let me think differently.

- Suppose I want to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

- Everule starts from island 1.

- To minimize the islands Everule can reach, Dominater should try to isolate island 1 from as many other islands as possible.

- To completely isolate island 1, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges connected to island 1, which is n-1 bridges.

- If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 completely by destroying all its bridges.

- Then, Everule can only visit island 1.

- If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely.

- In this case, Everule can still reach island 1 and some other islands through remaining bridges.

- But Dominater can try to isolate some other islands from island 1.

- For example, in n=4, k=2.

- Dominater can destroy 2 bridges.

- To isolate one island from island 1, say island 2, Dominater needs to destroy all bridges between island 2 and island 1, and between island 2 and other islands that can connect to island 1.

- But in a complete graph, it's hard to isolate one island unless you destroy enough bridges.

- Maybe it's not possible with k < n-1.

- Wait, in n=4, k=2.

- Dominater destroys 2 bridges.

- If Dominater destroys 1-2 and 1-3, then Everule can still reach island 2 via 1-4-2, and island 3 via 1-4-3.

- So, can't isolate island 2.

- Similarly, destroying any two bridges doesn't seem to isolate any island completely from island 1.

- Hence, with k < n-1, Everule can reach all islands.

- Only when k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 completely.

- So, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is:

- If k >= n-1, then 1.

- Else, n.

- Wait, but in the example given:

n=5, k=3.

- n-1=4.

- k=3 < 4.

- So, according to this, Everule can reach all n=5 islands.

- But in the sample input, for n=5, k=3, the output is 5.

- Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5, k=10, output is 1.

- Which matches k >= n-1=4.

- For k=3 <4, output is 5.

- So, seems like the rule is:

- If k >= n-1, output 1.

- Else, output n.

- That matches the examples.

- So, the program provided seems to implement this logic.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

This matches the logic I derived.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
