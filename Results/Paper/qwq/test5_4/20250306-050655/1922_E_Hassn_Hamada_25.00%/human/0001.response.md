Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about finding an array of integers that has at most 200 elements, and the number of increasing subsequences in this array should be exactly X, where X is a given integer between 2 and 10^18. If such an array doesn't exist, I need to output -1. There are multiple test cases, up to 1000 of them.

First, I need to understand what an increasing subsequence is. From the problem statement, it's a sequence obtained by removing some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing. Also, even if two subsequences have the same values but come from different positions in the array, they are considered different.

So, for example, if the array is [1, 2, 3], the increasing subsequences are:

- Empty subsequence

- [1]

- [2]

- [3]

- [1,2]

- [1,3]

- [2,3]

- [1,2,3]

That's a total of 8 increasing subsequences. Similarly, for [1, 2], there are 4 increasing subsequences: empty, [1], [2], and [1,2].

Wait a minute, for an array of length n, where all elements are distinct and in increasing order, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n, because each subset is an increasing subsequence, including the empty one.

But in our problem, X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60. So, if n=60, 2^n=1.1529215e+18, which is larger than 10^18. But n can be at most 200, which is way more than enough.

However, the array doesn't have to be strictly increasing; it can have any integers, including duplicates and negatives. The subsequences need to be strictly increasing, though.

So, the challenge is to construct an array with at most 200 elements such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

First, I need a way to calculate the number of increasing subsequences for a given array. That seems computationally expensive if done naively, especially since n can be up to 200 and X up to 10^18.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the number of increasing subsequences.

Suppose I have an array a1, a2, ..., an.

I need to count the number of subsequences where a_{i1} < a_{i2} < ... < a_{ik} for some k >=1, plus the empty subsequence.

But since the empty subsequence is always present, the total number of increasing subsequences is 1 (for the empty one) plus the number of non-empty increasing subsequences.

So, if I can find a way to make the number of non-empty increasing subsequences equal to X-1, that would solve the problem.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is a very large number, so the array needs to be constructed in a way that allows for a large number of increasing subsequences without making n too large.

Wait, but n is at most 200, which should be sufficient since 2^200 is way larger than 10^18.

But I need to make sure that the array is constructed in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

I recall that in a sequence where elements are non-decreasing, the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty subsequence). But in this problem, the array can have any order, and duplicates are allowed.

But perhaps I can construct the array in a specific way to control the number of increasing subsequences.

Let me consider a simple case.

If the array is strictly increasing, like [1,2,3,...,n], then the number of increasing subsequences is 2^n - 1 (excluding the empty one), plus 1 for the empty one, so total 2^n.

So, for n=1, X=2: [1] has subsequences: empty and [1]. So X=2.

For n=2, X=4: [1,2] has subsequences: empty, [1], [2], [1,2].

So, for a strictly increasing array, X=2^n.

So, if X is a power of 2, I can just create a strictly increasing array of length n, where 2^n = X.

But X starts from 2, so n starts from 1.

But X can be up to 10^18, which is 2^60, so n up to 60 would suffice.

But n can be up to 200, which is more than enough.

But the problem allows duplicates and non-increasing sequences.

Wait, but if I introduce duplicates, the number of increasing subsequences changes.

For example, consider [1,1].

The increasing subsequences are:

- empty

- [1]

- [1]

- [1,1] (but [1,1] is not strictly increasing, so it should not be counted.

Wait, the problem says strictly increasing, so [1,1] is not a valid increasing subsequence.

So, for [1,1], the increasing subsequences are:

- empty

- [1]

- [1]

So, total X=3.

Wait, but according to the problem, subsequences are different based on their positions, so [1] appears twice, even though their values are the same.

But in terms of being strictly increasing, [1,1] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, for [1,1], X=3.

Similarly, for [1,2,1], the increasing subsequences are:

- empty

- [1]

- [2]

- [1]

- [1,2]

- [1,1] (not strictly increasing)

So, X=5.

Wait, but [1,1] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, X=5 for [1,2,1].

This seems to match the example in the problem.

Wait, in the example:

For X=2: output [0]

For X=5: output [0,1,0]

For X=13: [2,2,3,4,2]

For X=37: [-1,-1,0,0,2,3,-1]

So, in the X=5 case, [0,1,0] has X=5 increasing subsequences.

Let me verify:

- empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0]

- [0,1]

So, total X=5.

Yes, that matches.

Now, I need a way to construct such arrays for any given X between 2 and 10^18.

First, I need to understand how the number of increasing subsequences is calculated for a general array.

Let me think recursively.

Suppose I have an array a1, a2, ..., an.

The number of increasing subsequences ending with ai is equal to the sum of the number of increasing subsequences ending with aj for all j < i and aj < ai, plus one (the subsequence consisting of only ai).

So, dp[i] = 1 + sum(dp[j] for all j < i if a[j] < a[i])

Then, the total number of non-empty increasing subsequences is sum(dp[i] for all i).

Plus one for the empty subsequence.

So, total X = 1 + sum(dp[i] for all i)

This seems manageable.

But for n=200, computing dp[i] for all i would be O(n^2), which for t=1000 and n=200 would be 1000 * 200^2 = 40,000,000 operations, which is acceptable for Python.

But constructing the array for each X is the challenge.

I need to find an array for each X such that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that X can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to construct such arrays without brute-forcing.

I need to find a pattern or a formula that allows me to construct the array based on X.

Looking back at the simple case where the array is strictly increasing, X=2^n.

But X can be any number between 2 and 10^18, not necessarily a power of 2.

So, perhaps I can represent X-1 in binary, since 2^n corresponds to X=2^n, and then combine these to get the desired X.

Wait, let's think in terms of binary representation.

Suppose I have X-1 in binary.

Each bit in X-1 corresponds to including or excluding a certain power of 2.

Maybe I can construct the array by combining smaller arrays that correspond to powers of 2.

Wait, let's consider building the array incrementally.

Start with an array that has X=1 (only the empty subsequence), and then add elements to increase X.

But starting from X=1 doesn't make sense because X starts from 2.

Wait, X=1 would be only the empty subsequence, but according to the problem, X starts from 2, which includes at least the empty subsequence and one non-empty subsequence.

Wait, in the problem, X is the total number of increasing subsequences, including the empty one.

So, X=2 means one non-empty increasing subsequence plus the empty one.

For X=2, the array [0] has two increasing subsequences: empty and [0].

Similarly, X=3 would be [0,1], which has empty, [0], [1], and [0,1], but that's X=4.

Wait, no, [0,1] has X=4.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my understanding.

Wait, in the example, for X=2, output is [0], which has X=2.

For X=5, output is [0,1,0], which has X=5.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, [0,1,0] should have X=5:

- empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0]

- [0,1]

Yes, that's correct.

But [0,1] should have X=4:

- empty

- [0]

- [1]

- [0,1]

Yes.

So, in general, for an array with duplicates, the number of increasing subsequences can be controlled.

I need a way to construct the array such that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

I need to find a way to represent X as 1 plus the sum of some values that correspond to the non-empty increasing subsequences.

I need a smarter way to construct the array.

Looking at the example for X=5: [0,1,0]

Let me compute the number of increasing subsequences:

- empty: 1

- [0]: two possibilities, first and third element

- [1]: one possibility, second element

- [0,1]: one possibility, first and second element

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Yes.

Similarly, for X=13: [2,2,3,4,2]

Let's list all increasing subsequences:

- empty: 1

- [2]: two possibilities (first and second elements)

- [3]: one possibility (third element)

- [4]: one possibility (fourth element)

- [2,3]: two possibilities (first to third, second to third)

- [2,4]: two possibilities (first to fourth, second to fourth)

- [3,4]: one possibility (third to fourth)

- [2,3,4]: two possibilities (first to third to fourth, second to third to fourth)

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 13.

Yes, that matches.

So, the idea is to construct the array in such a way that the contributions of different subsequences add up to X-1 (excluding the empty subsequence).

I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider building the array by adding elements in a specific order.

Suppose I start with an array of length 0: X=1 (only empty subsequence).

Then, when I add an element, say 'a', the new subsequences are:

- the empty subsequence (already existed)

- [a]

So, X becomes 2.

Then, if I add another element 'b':

- if b > a, then new subsequences are [b] and [a,b]

- if b < a, then new subsequences are [b]

- if b == a, then [b], but since it's not strictly increasing, [a,b] is not allowed.

Wait, but duplicates are allowed as long as the subsequences are strictly increasing.

So, if I add b < a, then [b] is a new subsequence, and any subsequences that could be extended with b are those that ended with some c < b.

But since b < a and assuming a is the only element before, and b < a, then [b] is added, but [a,b] is not allowed because it's not strictly increasing.

So, total X would be:

- previous X=2

- plus [b]: X+=1

- plus [a,b] if b > a: but in this case b < a, so no.

So, X=3.

Similarly, if I add b == a, then [b] is added, and again [a,b] is not allowed.

So, X=3.

Wait, but in the earlier example, [0,1,0] has X=5, which is 1 (empty) + 2 ([0]) + 1 ([1]) + 1 ([0,1]) + 1 ([0]).

Wait, seems like adding duplicates can help increase X without necessarily adding new unique values.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider building a tree-like structure where each element can have children that are greater than itself.

Wait, but building a tree structure might not be straightforward in code.

Another idea: use the binary representation of X-1 to determine which elements to include.

Wait, perhaps not directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence where each element is smaller than the next, i.e., strictly increasing.

Then, X=2^n.

But X can be any number up to 10^18, so I can represent X-1 in binary, and then construct the array accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X-1 to determine how to construct the array.

Let me consider that X-1 can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

For example, if X-1 = 5, which is 101 in binary, corresponding to 4 + 1.

So, perhaps I can construct parts of the array that contribute 1 and 4 to the total number of increasing subsequences.

But I need to think carefully about how adding elements affects the total count.

Let me consider building the array in levels, where each level corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X-1.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, the number of increasing subsequences can be related to the number of ways to choose elements in a certain order.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider the following strategy:

1. Start with an array that has X=1 (only the empty subsequence).

2. Add elements one by one, each time increasing X by a certain amount.

3. Choose the elements in such a way that the increase in X matches the binary representation of the desired X-1.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation to determine how many times to duplicate certain elements.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different angle.

Suppose I have a sequence where some elements are duplicated, and others are increasing.

I need to find a way to control the number of increasing subsequences.

Let me consider building blocks that correspond to certain X values, and then combine them.

For example, a single element gives X=2.

Two elements, a < b, give X=4.

Two elements, a == b, give X=3.

Similarly, three elements: a < b < c give X=8.

a < b == c give X=6.

a == b < c give X=5.

a == b == c give X=4.

Wait, let's verify:

- a < b < c: X=8 (empty, [a], [b], [c], [a,b], [a,c], [b,c], [a,b,c])

- a < b == c: X=6 (empty, [a], [b], [c], [a,b], [a,c])

- a == b < c: X=5 (empty, [a], [b], [a,c], [b,c])

- a == b == c: X=4 (empty, [a], [b], [c])

Wait, in the last case, since [a,b], [a,c], [b,c] are not strictly increasing if a == b == c, so only the single elements and the empty set.

So, X=4.

This seems consistent.

So, perhaps I can build the array by repeating elements in a specific way to control X.

But I need a systematic way to achieve any X.

Let me consider the minimal array length required for a given X.

Since n can be up to 200, and X can be up to 10^18, which is about 2^60, n=60 would suffice for X=2^60.

But I need to handle any X up to 10^18, not just powers of 2.

I need a way to represent X-1 as a sum of certain values corresponding to the non-empty increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of binary representation, where each bit corresponds to including or excluding a certain power of 2.

But I need to map this to the array construction.

Let me consider building the array level by level.

Suppose I start with an array of one element, say [0], which has X=2.

Then, to get X=3, I can add another 0, making [0,0], which has X=3.

Wait, but earlier I thought [0,0] has X=3.

Wait, but in the example, for X=5, they used [0,1,0], which has X=5.

So, perhaps adding a new element that is larger than some previous elements can increase X by a certain amount.

Let me try to find a pattern.

Suppose I have an array of k elements, all equal, say [a,a,a,...,a]. Then, the increasing subsequences are:

- empty

- [a] (chosen from any of the k positions)

So, total X=1 + k.

So, for k=1: X=2

k=2: X=3

k=3: X=4

and so on.

Similarly, if I have [a,a,b], where a < b.

Then, increasing subsequences are:

- empty

- [a] (from any of the two a's)

- [b]

- [a,b] (from first a and b, and second a and b)

So, X=1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6.

Wait, but earlier for [0,1,0], which is [0,1,0], X=5.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, for [0,1,0]:

- empty: 1

- [0]: two possibilities (first and third elements)

- [1]: one possibility (second element)

- [0,1]: two possibilities (first to second, third to second)

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, but the example says X=5.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, [0,1]: from first 0 and second 1: [0,1]

And from third 0 and second 1: [0,1]

But in the example, it's claimed to be X=5.

Wait, maybe in the example, they consider only unique subsequences based on their values and positions.

Wait, the problem says that even if two subsequences have the same elements but come from different positions, they are considered different.

So, for [0,1,0], the increasing subsequences are:

- empty

- [0] (first 0)

- [0] (third 0)

- [1] (second 1)

- [0,1] (first 0 and second 1)

- [0,1] (third 0 and second 1)

Total X=6, but the example shows X=5.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example or in my understanding.

Wait, looking back at the example:

Input:

4

2

5

13

37

Output:

1

0

3

0 1 0

5

2 2 3 4 2

7

-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

For X=5, the output is [0,1,0], which should have X=6 according to my calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts only unique value sets, not considering positions.

But the problem clearly states that if two subsequences consist of the same elements but correspond to different positions, they are considered different.

So, [0,1,0] should have X=6, but the example shows X=5.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps subsequences that are not strictly increasing are not counted.

Wait, [0,1,0] has [0,0] which is not strictly increasing, but I already excluded that.

Wait, but [0,1] appears twice, which is allowed since they are from different positions.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the example.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting.

Let me list all possible subsequences for [0,1,0]:

- empty

- [0] (first)

- [1] (second)

- [0] (third)

- [0,1] (first and second)

- [0,1] (third and second)

- [0,0] (first and third), but not strictly increasing, so excluded.

So, total X=5.

Wait, perhaps I missed that [0,0] is not strictly increasing, so it's not counted.

So, X=5.

I must have miscounted earlier.

Yes, [0,0] is not strictly increasing, so it's not considered.

Hence, X=5 for [0,1,0].

Got it.

So, in general, when counting increasing subsequences, only those that are strictly increasing are considered, and different positions lead to different subsequences even if values are the same.

So, I need a way to construct the array such that the number of strictly increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that, I need an algorithm to construct such an array for any X between 2 and 10^18.

I need to find a way to represent X-1 (since X includes the empty subsequence) as a sum of certain values that correspond to the non-empty increasing subsequences.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with an empty array, which has X=1.

- Add elements one by one, each time increasing X by a certain amount.

- Choose each new element to be larger than some previous elements and smaller than others to control the increase in X.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in binary representation, any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

Similarly, perhaps I can represent X-1 as a sum of certain values corresponding to the contributions of different elements or groups of elements in the array.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that in a strictly increasing array, X=2^n.

Then, for arrays that are not strictly increasing, X is less than 2^n.

But X can be any number up to 2^60, which is fine.

But I need a way to adjust X by adding elements in a specific way.

Let me consider that each new element I add can potentially double the number of increasing subsequences, similar to adding a new element to a strictly increasing array.

But if I add an element that is not larger than all previous elements, it won't double the number.

Wait, perhaps I can control the increase in X by choosing where to place duplicates or smaller elements.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I need to find a way to represent X-1 as a sum of certain values that correspond to the number of non-empty increasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of binary trees or something similar to build the array.

But that might be too complicated.

Let me consider the following plan:

- Represent X-1 in binary.

- Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to including or excluding a certain power of 2 in the sum.

- Construct the array by combining smaller arrays that correspond to these powers of 2.

But I need to define how these smaller arrays are constructed and combined.

This seems promising, but I need to formalize it.

Let me try to define a function that, given X-1, constructs the array.

I'll try to implement it recursively.

Suppose I have a function that takes X-1 and builds the array.

If X-1 is 0, then the array is empty, but X=1, which is not allowed since X starts from 2.

So, for X=2, X-1=1, which is 1 in binary.

I can start with an array of one element, say [0], which has X=2.

For X=3, X-1=2, which is 10 in binary.

I can add another element that is equal to the first, say [0,0], which has X=3.

For X=5, X-1=4, which is 100 in binary.

I can add an element larger than the previous ones, say [0,0,1], which should have X=6, but in the example, [0,1,0] has X=5.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't straightforward.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I build the array level by level, where each level corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of X-1.

At each level, I can decide whether to include a new element based on the bit.

But I need to define this more clearly.

Let me consider that each new element I add can potentially increase X by a certain amount, depending on how it's placed relative to the previous elements.

Wait, perhaps I can add elements in a way that each new element doubles the number of increasing subsequences, similar to adding a new element to a strictly increasing array.

But in reality, adding a new element that is larger than all previous elements will double the number of increasing subsequences, because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element.

Wait, let's formalize this.

If I have an array of length n with X increasing subsequences, and I add a new element that is larger than all previous elements, then the new number of increasing subsequences will be 2*X.

Because for each existing subsequence, I can choose to include or exclude the new element, and since it's larger than all previous, including it will still keep the subsequence increasing.

Similarly, if I add an element that is smaller than or equal to some previous elements, it will only allow adding it as a single-element subsequence or extending certain subsequences.

This seems promising.

So, if I want to represent X-1 in binary, I can think of building the array by successively adding elements that double the number of non-empty increasing subsequences.

Wait, let's see.

Start with an empty array: X=1.

Add one element, say 0: X=2 (empty and [0]).

Add another element, say 1, which is larger than 0: X=4 (empty, [0], [1], [0,1]).

Add another element, say 2, larger than 1: X=8 (empty, [0], [1], [2], [0,1], [0,2], [1,2], [0,1,2]).

And so on.

So, each time I add a new element larger than all previous, X doubles.

Similarly, if I add an element that is not larger than all previous, X increases by a smaller amount.

So, if I want to represent X-1 in binary, I can decide where to add elements that double X and where to add elements that add smaller increments.

Wait, perhaps I can use the binary representation of X-1 to determine how many times to double X and where to add smaller increments.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that each bit in the binary representation corresponds to adding an element that doubles X or adds a smaller increment.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of building a binary tree, where each level corresponds to a bit in the binary representation.

But I need to map this to the array construction.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me try to implement a function that, given X-1, constructs the array recursively.

Here's an idea:

- Find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to X-1.

- Let's say 2^k <= X-1.

- Then, build a strictly increasing subarray of length k, which gives 2^k increasing subsequences.

- Subtract 2^k from X-1.

- Recurse with the remaining X-1.

- Combine the new subarray with the previous one appropriately.

But I need to ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

This seems promising.

Let me try an example.

Take X=5.

X-1=4, which is 2^2=4.

So, build a strictly increasing subarray of length 2: [0,1], which has X=4.

But we need X=5, so add X-1=4.

Wait, in this case, 2^2=4, but we need X=5.

So, subtract 4 from X-1, leaving X-1=0.

Then, the total X is 4 + 1=5.

But how do I adjust the array to account for the remaining X-1?

Wait, perhaps I need to add an additional element that contributes the remaining part.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I need to find a way to construct the array such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly X.

Given that
