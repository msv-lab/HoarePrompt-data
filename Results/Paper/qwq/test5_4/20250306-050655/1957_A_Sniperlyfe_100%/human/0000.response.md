Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have multiple test cases, each with a certain number of sticks of different lengths, and I need to figure out the maximum number of regular polygons I can make from these sticks, with the condition that each polygon is made up of sticks of the same length, and no stick is used in more than one polygon. Also, sticks can't be broken, so I have to use them as they are.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. A regular polygon has all sides of equal length and all angles equal. So, for each polygon, all its sides are the same length. That means, for any given stick length, I can use multiple sticks of that length to form one or more polygons, but each polygon made from that length will require a specific number of sticks based on the number of sides of the polygon.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the number of sides for the polygons. Does that mean I can make polygons with any number of sides, as long as all sides are equal? Well, polygons have at least 3 sides, right? So, the smallest regular polygon is a triangle, which has 3 sides. Then there are squares with 4 sides, pentagons with 5 sides, and so on.

So, for each unique stick length, I need to see how many polygons I can make using sticks of that length. And since I can make polygons with different numbers of sides, I need to decide how many sides each polygon will have based on the number of sticks available for that length.

But, the problem is to maximize the number of polygons, not necessarily the number of sides or anything else. So, I need to maximize the total number of polygons, regardless of their size.

Let me think about this. For a given stick length, say I have k sticks of that length. I can make one polygon with k sides, but that would only count as one polygon. Or, I could make two polygons with, say, m and k-m sides, but both m and k-m need to be at least 3. Wait, but that might not always be better.

Wait, no. If I make one polygon with k sides, that's one polygon. If I make two polygons with m and k-m sides, that's two polygons, which is better than one, but only if both m and k-m are at least 3. Similarly, I could split it into more polygons if possible.

So, for a given k, the number of sticks of a certain length, I need to maximize the number of polygons I can make from those k sticks, with each polygon having at least 3 sides.

This sounds like a classic optimization problem where I need to partition k into as many parts as possible, each part being at least 3.

Well, the simplest way to maximize the number of polygons is to make as many triangles as possible, since triangles have the smallest number of sides.

So, for each stick length, I can divide the number of sticks by 3, taking the integer division, and that would give me the number of triangles I can make from those sticks.

Then, the total number of polygons would be the sum of these values across all stick lengths.

Wait, but is this always optimal? Let's consider an example.

Suppose I have 6 sticks of the same length. If I make two triangles, that's two polygons. Alternatively, I could make one quadrilateral and one triangle, that's also two polygons. Or, I could make one hexagon, which is one polygon. So, making two triangles gives me the maximum number of polygons.

Another example: 7 sticks of the same length. If I make two triangles and one quadrilateral, that's three polygons. Alternatively, I could make one triangle and one quadrilateral, that's two polygons. So, two triangles and one quadrilateral is better.

Wait, but with 7 sticks, I can make two triangles (using 6 sticks) and have one stick left over, which can't form a polygon. So, the maximum is two polygons.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, for k sticks of the same length, I would do k // 3 to get the number of triangles I can make, which would be 7 // 3 = 2, which matches the maximum number of polygons I can make.

Similarly, for k=4, I can make one quadrilateral, which is one polygon, and 4 // 3 = 1, which matches.

For k=5, I can make one triangle and one quadrilateral, that's two polygons, and 5 // 3 = 1, which is less than that.

Wait, hold on. For k=5, 5 // 3 = 1, but I can actually make two polygons: one triangle and one quadrilateral. Wait, but that would use 3 + 4 = 7 sticks, but I only have 5 sticks. So, that's not possible.

Wait, I must have miscalculated. With 5 sticks, I can make one triangle (3 sticks) and have 2 sticks left, which is not enough for another polygon. So, only one polygon can be made, which matches 5 // 3 = 1.

Similarly, for k=6, 6 // 3 = 2, which matches making two triangles.

For k=7, 7 // 3 = 2, which matches making two triangles and having one stick left over.

For k=8, 8 // 3 = 2, which could be two triangles and have two sticks left over, or one triangle and one pentagon.

But one triangle (3 sticks) and one pentagon (5 sticks) would use up all 8 sticks, making two polygons, which matches 8 // 3 = 2.

So, it seems that for any k, doing k // 3 gives the maximum number of polygons I can make from sticks of that length.

Is there any case where this doesn't hold?

Let's try k=9.

9 // 3 = 3, which would correspond to making three triangles.

Alternatively, I could make one triangle and one hexagon, that's two polygons.

Or, one quadrilateral and one pentagon, that's two polygons.

Or, three triangles, which is three polygons.

So, three is better.

Another case: k=10.

10 // 3 = 3.

I can make three triangles (using 9 sticks) and have one stick left over.

Alternatively, two triangles and one quadrilateral (3+3+4=10), that's three polygons.

Alternatively, one triangle and one heptagon (3+7=10), that's two polygons.

So, three polygons is better.

Another case: k=11.

11 // 3 = 3.

I can make three triangles (9 sticks) and have two sticks left over.

Alternatively, two triangles and one quadrilateral (3+3+4=10), with one stick left over.

Or, one triangle and one octagon (3+8=11), which is two polygons.

So, three polygons is better.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but let's think about k=12.

12 // 3 = 4.

I can make four triangles, using all 12 sticks.

Alternatively, three triangles and one quadrilateral (3+3+3+4=13), which is more than I have.

Wait, 3+3+3+4=13, but I only have 12 sticks, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps two triangles and two quadrilaterals: 3+3+4+4=14, which is more than 12.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps one triangle, one quadrilateral, and one pentagon: 3+4+5=12, which is three polygons.

But 12 // 3 = 4, which is better.

So, making four triangles is better.

Wait, but in this case, four triangles use exactly 12 sticks, so that's optimal.

Similarly, for k=13, 13 // 3 = 4, so four triangles use 12 sticks, with one left over.

Alternatively, three triangles and one quadrilateral: 3+3+3+4=13, which is four polygons.

Wait, but 13 // 3 = 4, which matches.

Another option: two triangles and two quadrilaterals: 3+3+4+4=14, which is more than 13.

So, three triangles and one quadrilateral is the only way to use all 13 sticks, making four polygons, which matches 13 // 3 = 4.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, it seems that for any k, doing k // 3 gives the maximum number of polygons I can make from sticks of that length.

So, in the function func_1, it seems to be implementing this logic.

It first counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary called freq.

Then, it sums up, for each stick length, the value of (v // 3), where v is the frequency of that stick length.

This should give the total maximum number of polygons that can be made.

Wait, but in the example provided:

Input:

4

1

1

2

1 1

6

2 2 3 3 3 3

9

4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output:

0

0

1

2

Let's verify this.

First test case:

n=1, arr=[1]

So, only one stick of length 1.

Can't make any polygon, since polygons need at least 3 sides.

So, output 0, which matches.

Second test case:

n=2, arr=[1,1]

Two sticks of length 1.

Still can't make any polygon, since need at least 3 sticks.

So, output 0, which matches.

Third test case:

n=6, arr=[2,2,3,3,3,3]

So, frequencies:

Length 2: 2 sticks

Length 3: 4 sticks

For length 2: 2 // 3 = 0 polygons

For length 3: 4 // 3 = 1 polygon

Total: 0 + 1 = 1, which matches the output.

Fourth test case:

n=9, arr=[4,2,2,2,2,4,2,4,4]

Frequencies:

Length 2: 5 sticks

Length 4: 4 sticks

For length 2: 5 // 3 = 1 polygon

For length 4: 4 // 3 = 1 polygon

Total: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the output.

Seems correct.

But wait, in the note for the fourth test case, it says:

"In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a square of side length 4 ."

Which corresponds to using 5 sticks of length 2 and 4 sticks of length 4, which matches the calculation of 5 // 3 = 1 and 4 // 3 = 1, total 2 polygons.

So, it seems consistent.

But is there any case where this approach would fail?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have k=3 sticks of the same length. I can make one triangle, which is one polygon, and 3 // 3 = 1, which matches.

If k=4, I can make one quadrilateral, which is one polygon, and 4 // 3 = 1, which matches.

If k=5, I can make one triangle and one quadrilateral, but as I saw earlier, that would require 3+4=7 sticks, which is more than 5. So, actually, I can only make one polygon with k=5, which is either a pentagon or a triangle with two sticks left over. So, only one polygon, which matches 5 // 3 = 1.

Similarly, for k=6, I can make two triangles, which is better than one quadrilateral and one triangle.

So, it seems that always doing k // 3 gives the maximum number of polygons.

Is there a mathematical justification for this?

Yes, because to maximize the number of polygons, I need to minimize the number of sticks used per polygon. The smallest polygon uses 3 sticks, so making as many triangles as possible minimizes the sticks per polygon, thus maximizing the number of polygons.

Any polygon with more than 3 sides uses more sticks, which would reduce the total number of polygons I can make.

So, mathematically, dividing the number of sticks by 3 and taking the floor gives the maximum number of polygons.

Therefore, the function func_1 seems to be correctly implementing this logic.

It counts the frequency of each stick length, then for each length, it adds v // 3 to the total, where v is the frequency of that length.

This should give the correct total number of polygons.

I don't see any flaws in this approach.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{ \text{True} } \]
