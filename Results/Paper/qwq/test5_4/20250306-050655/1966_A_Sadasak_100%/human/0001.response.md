Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. I can perform an operation any number of times, where I choose k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number I choose. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. So, essentially, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 each time I perform this operation, since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

But it's not just about reducing the total number of cards; I have to consider that the cards I'm replacing must have the same number.

I need to think about how to minimize the total number of cards. That probably means performing as many operations as possible to reduce the card count as much as possible.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the hand. If a number appears f times, and f is at least k, then I can perform the operation on those f cards.

Wait, but in one operation, I can only choose k cards with the same number. So, if a number appears f times, where f >= k, I can perform floor(f / k) operations on them, each time reducing the total count by 1 (since I replace k cards with k-1 cards).

Wait, actually, each operation reduces the total count by 1, because k - (k-1) = 1.

But I need to be careful: after performing some operations on a group of cards with the same number, the frequency of that number changes.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have a number that appears f times, and f >= k. I can perform the operation on k of those cards, replacing them with k-1 cards of any number. But those k-1 new cards can be of any number, including the same number or different numbers.

Wait, but the problem says "each of which can have any number you choose". So, I can choose the numbers for those k-1 new cards freely.

This introduces some flexibility. For example, if I have multiple numbers with frequencies >= k, I can choose to replace k cards of one number with k-1 cards of another number, potentially allowing me to perform more operations in the future.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me consider the total number of cards. Initially, it's n. Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, since I replace k cards with k-1 cards.

So, the maximum number of operations I can perform is n - m, where m is the minimum number of cards I can have in the end.

Wait, that's not quite right. Because I can't necessarily perform operations until I have only one card, depending on the frequencies.

Let me think in terms of the frequencies. For each number, I can perform operations on its frequency, as long as the frequency is at least k.

But since I can choose the numbers of the new cards freely, I might be able to create new cards with frequencies that allow more operations.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should look for an invariant or some property that remains the same during the operations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a mathematical problem.

Let's consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, provided that there exists a number with frequency at least k.

But I can choose to replace k cards of the same number with k-1 cards of any number, potentially creating new frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum frequency.

If the maximum frequency is less than k, then I can't perform any more operations, so the minimum number of cards is the current total.

But if the maximum frequency is at least k, I can perform an operation to reduce the total by 1, and possibly adjust frequencies.

This suggests that I can keep performing operations as long as there's at least one number with frequency >= k.

So, the minimum number of cards I can have is the total number minus the number of times I can perform the operation.

But how many times can I perform the operation? As many times as there are numbers with frequency >= k.

Wait, no. Each operation reduces the total by 1, and I can perform operations as long as there's at least one number with frequency >= k.

This seems similar to finding the maximum number of times I can remove k cards from some group with frequency >=k, replacing them with k-1 cards, which might be added to other groups.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

If k > n, meaning k is larger than the number of cards I have, then I can't perform any operations, so the minimum number of cards is n.

Another extreme case: if k = 2, and I have multiple pairs of the same numbers, I can keep performing operations to reduce the total number of cards.

Wait, let's look at the sample input and output to get some intuition.

First sample input:

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

Output: 2

From the explanation, it seems that with 5 cards and k=3, I can perform one operation by selecting three 4's, replacing them with two cards of any number, say two 4's again. Then I have two 4's and two 1's left, totaling four cards. Then, I can select three cards: two 4's and one 1, but they don't all have the same number, so I can't perform another operation. Wait, but in the explanation, they have a sequence that leads to two cards.

Wait, perhaps I misread the operation: I have to select k cards with the same number, not necessarily the same number among themselves.

Wait, no, the problem says: "Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number."

So, they must all have the same number.

In the first sample, I have five cards: 4,1,1,4,4.

So, frequencies: 4 appears three times, 1 appears twice.

With k=3, I can select three 4's and replace them with two cards of any number, say two 4's.

Then I have two 4's and two 1's, totaling four cards.

Now, can I perform another operation? I have two groups: two 4's and two 1's.

Since k=3, I need to have at least three cards of the same number to perform another operation.

But neither 4 nor 1 has three cards, so I can't perform any more operations.

But the sample output is 2, so perhaps there's a better sequence of operations.

Wait, maybe instead of replacing three 4's with two 4's, I can replace them with two 1's.

Then, I would have two 1's and two 1's, totaling four 1's.

Then, since I have four 1's, which is greater than or equal to k=3, I can perform another operation: select three 1's and replace them with two 1's.

Now, I have two 1's.

Since I have only two 1's, which is less than k=3, I can't perform any more operations.

So, the minimum number of cards is 2.

Ah, that makes sense.

So, by strategically choosing the numbers for the new cards, I can set them to an existing number or a new number to potentially enable more operations.

In this case, by choosing to create two 1's instead of two 4's, I was able to perform an additional operation.

So, the key is to maximize the number of operations, which reduces the total number of cards as much as possible.

To do that, I should aim to keep having groups of k cards with the same number by strategically choosing the numbers for the new cards.

Now, how do I generalize this?

I need to find a way to maximize the number of operations I can perform, each reducing the total number of cards by 1.

The minimum number of cards is n minus the maximum number of operations I can perform.

So, I need to find the maximum number of operations possible.

But how?

Let me consider the frequencies of the numbers.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm for m different numbers.

Each operation reduces one of these frequencies by k and increases another frequency by k-1.

Wait, no: I replace k cards of one number with k-1 cards of another number.

So, the frequency of the first number decreases by k, and the frequency of the second number increases by k-1.

So, it's like f_i -= k and f_j += (k-1), for some i and j.

Wait, but I can choose j to be a new number not present before, or an existing one.

This seems like a system of inequalities or some kind of flow where I'm adjusting frequencies.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of the maximum frequency.

If the maximum frequency is >=k, I can perform an operation, reducing the total by 1, and potentially adjusting frequencies.

But I need to consider that performing an operation can affect other frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a greedy algorithm where I always perform operations on the highest frequency.

But I need to ensure that after performing an operation, I still have some group with frequency >=k to perform further operations.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the standard greedy algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem, where I always pick the item with the highest value per weight.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm.

Each operation consists of selecting one of these frequencies (say f_i >=k), then setting f_i := f_i - k, and choosing another frequency f_j (which could be new, i.e., currently 0), and set f_j := f_j + (k-1).

The goal is to maximize the number of operations, which is equivalent to minimizing the final number of cards.

Each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1, as k - (k-1) =1.

So, total operations = n - final number of cards.

I need to maximize the number of operations, which minimizes the final number of cards.

But how to maximize the number of operations?

I need to keep performing operations as long as there's at least one frequency >=k.

But since I can choose to decrease any frequency >=k and increase any other frequency by k-1.

This seems like I can choose which frequencies to adjust.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of times I can subtract k from some frequency and add k-1 to another.

This seems like I can model it as a graph where nodes represent frequencies, and edges represent possible operations.

But that might be overcomplicating.

Let me consider that each operation consumes k cards from one pile and creates k-1 cards in another pile.

So, it's like having a system where I can transfer k cards from one pile to another, but only k-1 arrive due to some loss.

Wait, actually, it's k cards are removed and k-1 are added elsewhere.

So, net loss of 1 card per operation.

But I need to maximize the number of operations, which is n - final number of cards.

So, to minimize the final number of cards, I need to maximize the number of operations.

Each operation requires that at least one pile has at least k cards.

So, as long as there's at least one pile with >=k cards, I can perform an operation, reducing the total by 1.

So, the minimum number of cards is the minimum number where no pile has >=k cards.

In other words, all piles have <k cards.

So, the minimum number of cards is the sum of ceiling(fi / (k-1)) * (k-1), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of ceil(fi / (k-1)) * (k-1).

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a pile with fi cards.

Each operation on this pile can reduce fi by k and add k-1 to another pile.

But it's not necessarily tied to a single pile; I can spread the k-1 cards to different piles.

This complicates things.

Maybe I should look for an invariant.

An invariant would be something that remains unchanged throughout the operations.

But I'm not sure what that is here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of cards modulo (k-1).

Wait, maybe.

Let me consider the total number of cards modulo (k-1).

Suppose n = q*(k-1) + r, where 0 <= r < k-1.

If r == 0, then perhaps the minimum number of cards is 0.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the second sample input:

1 10

7

Output:1

So, n=1, k=10.

I have one card, and k=10.

I can't perform any operations because I don't have 10 cards of the same number.

So, the minimum number of cards is 1.

Another sample input:

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

Output:1

So, n=7, k=2.

I have frequencies:

4:1, 2:2, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

So, only 2 appears twice.

So, I can perform one operation: select two 2's, replace them with one card of any number, say 2.

Now, I have frequencies:

2:1, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

No number appears twice or more, so I can't perform any more operations.

But the sample output is 1, which would require performing more operations.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace two different numbers.

Wait, no, the operation requires selecting k cards with the same number.

So, in this case, only 2's can be selected for the operation.

Wait, but the sample output is 1, so perhaps there's a way to reduce it further.

Wait, maybe I can perform the operation differently.

Initially: 4,2,1,100,5,2,3.

Frequencies: 2:2, others:1.

Operation: select two 2's, replace them with one card, say choose to create one 2.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, others:1.

No number has frequency >=2, so can't perform any more operations.

But sample output is 1, which suggests that there's a way to end up with only one card.

How is that possible?

Wait, maybe instead of replacing two 2's with one 2, I replace them with one of another number, say one 1.

Then, frequencies: 2:0, 1:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Now, I have two 1's. Since k=2, I can perform another operation: select two 1's, replace them with one card, say one 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

No number has frequency >=2, so I can't perform any more operations.

Total cards: 1 (1) +1 (100) +1 (5) +1 (3) =4.

But the sample output is 1, so there must be a better sequence.

Wait, maybe I can replace two 2's with one 1 and one 100, or something.

But the problem says each of the k-1 new cards can have any number I choose.

So, I can choose different numbers for each of the k-1 cards.

Wait, but in the operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, and I can choose the numbers for those k-1 cards independently.

So, in the above case, when I replace two 2's with one 1 and one 100, then frequencies become: 2:0, 1:2, 100:2, 5:1, 3:1.

Now, I have two numbers with frequency >=2: 1 and 100.

I can perform another operation on, say, two 1's: replace them with one 1.

Now, frequencies: 1:1, 100:2, 5:1, 3:1.

Then, perform another operation on two 100's: replace them with one 100.

Now, frequencies: 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

No number has frequency >=2, so I can't perform any more operations.

Total cards: 1 (1) +1 (100) +1 (5) +1 (3) =4.

Still not matching the sample output of 1.

Wait, maybe I can choose to replace two 2's with one 1 and one 2.

Then, frequencies: 2:1, 1:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Now, I have two 1's. Perform an operation on two 1's: replace them with one 1.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

No number has frequency >=2, so can't perform more operations.

Again, total cards: 5.

Still not matching the sample output of 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look at the sample explanation again.

In the second example case, which is n=1, k=10, with card 7.

Since n < k, I can't perform any operations, so the minimum number of cards is 1.

In the third example case, n=7, k=2, with cards 4,2,1,100,5,2,3.

Output:1

So, how can I end up with only one card?

Perhaps by carefully choosing which cards to replace.

Let me try a different approach.

Start with 4,2,1,100,5,2,3.

Frequencies: 2:2, others:1.

Operation 1: select two 2's, replace with one 2 and one 1.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 2: select two 1's, replace with one 1 and one 100.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:2, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 3: select two 100's, replace with one 100 and one 2.

Now, frequencies: 2:2, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 4: select two 2's, replace with one 2 and one 5.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:1, 5:2, 3:1.

Operation 5: select two 5's, replace with one 5 and one 3.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:2.

Operation 6: select two 3's, replace with one 3 and one 1.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 7: select two 1's, replace with one 1 and one 100.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:2, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 8: select two 100's, replace with one 100 and one 2.

Now, frequencies: 2:2, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 9: select two 2's, replace with one 2 and one 5.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:1, 5:2, 3:1.

Operation 10: select two 5's, replace with one 5 and one 3.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:2.

Operation 11: select two 3's, replace with one 3 and one 1.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 12: select two 1's, replace with one 1 and one 100.

Now, frequencies: 2:1, 1:1, 100:2, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 13: select two 100's, replace with one 100 and one 2.

Now, frequencies: 2:2, 1:1, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

This seems like I'm going in circles. I need a better strategy.

Perhaps I should aim to consolidate all cards into one number.

Let's try that.

Start with 4,2,1,100,5,2,3.

Operation 1: select two 2's, replace with one 2 and one 4.

Now, cards: 4,2,1,100,5,2,4,3.

Wait, but the operation is to replace k cards with k-1 cards of any numbers.

So, selecting two 2's, replacing them with, say, two 1's.

Then, cards: 4,1,1,100,5,4,3.

Now, frequencies: 1:3, 4:2, 100:1, 5:1, 3:1.

Operation 2: select three 1's, replace with two 1's.

Wait, but k=2, so I need to select two cards with the same number.

Wait, k=2.

So, select two 1's, replace with one 1.

Now, cards: 4,1,100,5,4,3.

Frequencies: 4:2,1:1,100:1,5:1,3:1.

Operation 3: select two 4's, replace with one 4.

Now, cards: 1,100,5,4,3.
