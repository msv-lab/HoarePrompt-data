Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a game where I'm at point 0 on a straight line, and there are n monsters at different positions, each with some health. Every second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, decreasing their health by 1 per bullet. After I shoot, any monster with health 0 or less dies. Then, all living monsters move one step closer to me. If any monster reaches me, I lose. The question is whether I can eliminate all monsters before any of them reaches me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I shoot up to k bullets at any monsters I choose, targeting any of them, possibly multiple bullets at the same monster.

2. Monsters with health <= 0 die.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

The goal is to ensure that no monster reaches me (reaches position 0) before I can eliminate them all.

Given that, I need to devise a strategy to分配我的子弹，使得在任何怪物到达我之前，我能够消灭所有怪物。

Let's think about the constraints and what they imply.

Constraints:

- t (number of test cases): 1 <= t <= 3 * 10^4

- n (number of monsters per test case): 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5

- k (maximum bullets per second): 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9

- a_i (health of each monster): 1 <= a_i <= 10^9

- x_i (positions of monsters): -n <= x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n <= n, x_i != 0

Additional constraint: sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

Given these constraints, especially with t up to 30,000 and n up to 300,000 per test case, but with the sum of n over all test cases <= 3 * 10^5, it suggests that per test case operations should be O(n log n) at worst, since t * O(n log n) should be manageable within time limits.

Now, thinking about the problem.

Each monster has a position x_i and health a_i. Monsters move towards me by 1 unit each second. So, the time they have before reaching me is equal to their initial distance from me, which is |x_i| seconds.

Wait, no. Since they move 1 unit closer each second, the time they take to reach me is |x_i| seconds. So, they will reach me in |x_i| seconds if not eliminated before that.

Hence, for each monster, I have to ensure that it is eliminated within |x_i| seconds.

But I can shoot up to k bullets per second, and each bullet can target any monster, reducing its health by 1.

So, for each monster, to eliminate it, I need to shoot it a_i times. Since I can shoot up to k bullets per second, the minimum time to eliminate one monster is ceil(a_i / k) seconds.

But, I have to consider that multiple monsters are moving towards me simultaneously, and I have to allocate my bullets optimally across them to ensure that no monster reaches me before I've eliminated it.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's think differently.

Perhaps I should consider the monsters that are closest to me first, because they have less time before they reach me.

So, maybe I should sort the monsters based on their distance from me, in ascending order.

Let's sort the monsters based on |x_i|, from smallest to largest.

Then, for each monster in this order, calculate the time available to eliminate it, which is its distance |x_i|.

But I need to make sure that while I'm eliminating this monster, I'm also taking into account the time it takes to eliminate previous monsters.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the latest time at which I can start eliminating a monster.

For example, for a monster at position x_i, I have |x_i| seconds before it reaches me.

To eliminate it, I need to spend ceil(a_i / k) seconds on it.

So, I need to ensure that ceil(a_i / k) <= |x_i|.

But this might not be sufficient because I might be eliminating multiple monsters simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the total bullet shots allocated to all monsters do not exceed the available time.

But it's not that straightforward because I can shoot k bullets per second, distributed among any monsters.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total health I need to shoot over time.

Let's consider the monsters sorted by their distance from me, i.e., sorted by |x_i| in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, the time available to eliminate it is its distance |x_i|.

And the bullets needed to eliminate it are a_i.

But since I can shoot k bullets per second, I can distribute my bullets among the monsters in any way each second.

I need to make sure that for each monster, the cumulative bullets shot at it reach a_i within its available time.

But keeping track of bullet distribution per second for each monster seems complicated.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let's consider the monsters in order of their distance, from smallest to largest |x_i|.

For each monster, I need to eliminate it within |x_i| seconds.

And during these |x_i| seconds, I can shoot k bullets per second.

But I also have to consider that while I'm eliminating this monster, I might need to start eliminating other monsters that have smaller |x_i|.

Wait, no. Actually, since I'm considering monsters in increasing order of |x_i|, I can think of the time line where I have to eliminate closer monsters first.

But it's still confusing.

Let me try to find a different approach.

Suppose I consider the time axis from t=0 to t=max(|x_i|) over all monsters.

Each second, I can shoot up to k bullets, which can be distributed among any of the living monsters.

Monsters move closer by 1 unit each second, so their distance decreases by 1 each second.

When a monster's distance reaches 0, if it's still alive, I lose.

So, for each monster, I need to ensure that it's eliminated before its distance reaches 0.

Given that, perhaps I can simulate over time, deciding each second how to allocate my k bullets.

But with n up to 3*10^5 and t up to 3*10^5, simulation is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can think in terms of the cumulative bullets needed over time.

Let me consider the monsters sorted by their distance |x_i| in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, I need to allocate a_i bullets to it before time |x_i|.

And each second, I can allocate up to k bullets to any monsters that have not yet reached me.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total bullets needed up to each time step.

Let's try to formalize this.

Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

Let’s say the sorted distances are d_1 <= d_2 <= ... <= d_n.

For each monster i, I need to allocate a_i bullets to it before time d_i.

At each time t, I can allocate up to k bullets.

So, up to time t, the total bullets I can allocate is sum_{s=1 to t} k = k * t.

But I need to make sure that for each monster i, sum of a_j for j where d_j <= t >= k * t.

Wait, that might not be precise.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a timeline from t=0 to t=max(d_i).

At each time t, I can allocate up to k bullets to any monsters that have d_j > t (monsters that haven't yet reached me).

Wait, no. Actually, at time t, monsters with d_j <= t have already reached me, so I need to have eliminated them before this time.

Wait, let's clarify:

- At time t=0, all monsters are at their initial positions x_i.

- Each second, I shoot bullets, then monsters move closer by 1.

- So, at time t=1, monsters are at x_i - 1 if x_i > 0, or x_i +1 if x_i <0.

- Generally, at time t, monsters are at x_i - t*sign(x_i).

Wait, more accurately, since they move closer by 1 each second, their distance from me decreases by 1 each second.

So, their distance at time t is max(|x_i| - t, 0).

They reach me when distance becomes 0.

Hence, each monster i will reach me at time t = |x_i|.

Therefore, I need to eliminate monster i before time t = |x_i|.

That is, I need to have allocated at least a_i bullets to monster i by time t = |x_i| - 1.

Because at time t = |x_i|, the monster reaches me, so I need to have eliminated it by then.

Wait, more precisely, I need to have allocated a_i bullets to monster i by time t = |x_i| -1, because at time t = |x_i| -1, the monster is at distance 1, and after that second, it reaches me.

But, in that second t = |x_i| -1, I can shoot bullets at it, and if I reduce its health to <=0, it dies before it reaches me.

Hence, for each monster i, I need to have allocated a_i bullets to it by time t = |x_i| -1.

But, I can allocate bullets to multiple monsters each second, up to k bullets per second.

So, across all seconds from t=0 to t=max(|x_i|)-1, I need to allocate bullets to monsters such that for each monster, sum of bullets allocated to it by time t = |x_i| -1 >= a_i.

This sounds like a scheduling problem where I need to ensure that the cumulative allocation meets the requirements for each monster before their deadlines (|x_i| -1).

To solve this, perhaps I can use a greedy approach.

Sort the monsters by their |x_i| in ascending order.

Then, process them one by one, ensuring that the bullets allocated to them are done within their available time.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to scheduling jobs with deadlines.

In such problems, a common approach is to sort jobs by their deadlines and try to schedule them as late as possible.

But in this case, since I can shoot multiple bullets per second, and allocate them to any monsters, it's a bit different.

Let me think in terms of the total bullets needed over time.

If I sort the monsters by their |x_i| in ascending order, then for each monster, I know the time by which I need to eliminate it.

So, for the monster with the smallest |x_i|, I need to eliminate it by time |x_i| -1.

Then, for the next monster, I need to eliminate it by its |x_i| -1, and so on.

But since the monsters are sorted by |x_i|, and |x_i| are increasing, their deadlines are also increasing.

Hence, I can consider processing them in order, accumulating the total bullets needed over time.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the cumulative bullets needed by each deadline and check if it's possible given the k bullets per second.

Let me try to formalize this.

Sort the monsters by |x_i| in ascending order.

Let’s denote s as the sorted list of (|x_i|, a_i).

Initialize total_bullets_used = 0

For each monster in this sorted order:

time_available = |x_i| -1  # the time by which this monster needs to be eliminated

bullets_needed = a_i  # bullets needed to eliminate this monster

If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > k * time_available:

It's impossible, because even if I allocate all k bullets per second to this monster, I can't accumulate enough bullets by the deadline.

Else:

Allocate the bullets needed for this monster, i.e., total_bullets_used += bullets_needed

Wait, but this assumes that the previous monsters have been taken care of in the earlier time steps.

Is this correct?

Wait, maybe not entirely.

Because, the total_bullets_used is the cumulative bullets used up to the current time.

But in reality, bullets are allocated per second, and at each second, up to k bullets can be allocated.

So, the total bullets used up to time t should not exceed k * t.

Hence, for each monster, by its deadline t = |x_i| -1, the cumulative bullets allocated should be at least the sum of a_j for all monsters with |x_j| <= |x_i|.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the cumulative a_i and compare it with k * t for each t.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=3, k=2

a=[1,2,3]

x=[-1,2,3]

So, |x|=[1,2,3]

Sort monsters by |x_i|: monster 1 (|x|=1, a=1), monster 2 (|x|=2, a=2), monster 3 (|x|=3, a=3)

For monster 1:

time_available =1 -1=0

bullets_needed=1

But k * time_available =2 *0=0

So, 0 >=1? No, which would suggest impossibility, but the sample output is YES.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in calculating time_available.

Let's think again.

At time t=0:

- Monsters at positions -1,2,3

- I can shoot up to 2 bullets.

- After shooting, monsters move closer.

At time t=1:

- Monsters at positions -1+1=0, 2-1=1, 3-1=2

- Wait, monsters move closer by 1 each second.

- So, monster at -1 moves to 0, monster at 2 moves to 1, monster at 3 moves to 2.

- But in the first step, I can shoot up to 2 bullets.

- If I shoot 1 bullet at monster 1 (a=1), it dies immediately.

- Then, at time t=1, monster 1 is already dead, monsters 2 and 3 are at positions 1 and 2.

At time t=1:

- Shoot 2 bullets at monster 2 (a=2), reduce its health to 0, so it dies.

- Then, at time t=2, monster 3 is at position 2-1=1.

- Shoot 2 bullets at monster 3 (a=3), reduce its health to 1.

At time t=2:

- Monster 3 has health 1, which is >0, so it's still alive.

- It moves to position 1-1=0.

- So, it reaches me at time t=2.

But according to the sample output, it's YES, which suggests I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I need to continue shooting monster 3.

At time t=3:

- Monster 3 is at position 0 (already reached me), but I've been shooting it since t=1.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is flawed.

Let me try another strategy.

Let's consider that for each monster, I need to allocate a_i bullets to it before or at the time it reaches me.

But I can allocate bullets to it at any time before it reaches me.

So, for monster i, it reaches me at time t=|x_i|.

Hence, I need to allocate a_i bullets to it within the first |x_i| -1 seconds.

But I can allocate bullets to multiple monsters each second.

So, across all seconds t from 0 to T-1, where T is the maximum |x_i|, I need to ensure that the total bullets allocated to all monsters up to each time t does not exceed k * t.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the cumulative bullets needed by each time step and ensure that it doesn't exceed k * t up to that step.

Let me try to formalize this.

First, sort the monsters by their |x_i| in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, the time available to eliminate it is t = |x_i| -1.

So, for each monster, I need to allocate its a_i bullets within the first t seconds.

Hence, I can iterate through the monsters in order of increasing |x_i|, keeping track of the total bullets needed by each deadline t = |x_i| -1.

I need to ensure that at each step, the total bullets allocated does not exceed k * t.

Wait, perhaps I can accumulate the bullets needed for all monsters up to each t.

Let me try with the first test case.

n=3, k=2

monsters:

1: |x|=1, a=1

2: |x|=2, a=2

3: |x|=3, a=3

Sort by |x_i|: 1,2,3

For monster 1:

t=1-1=0

bullets_needed=1

But k*t=2*0=0

1 > 0, so impossible.

But according to the sample, it's possible.

Hence, my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that at time t=0, I can shoot up to k bullets, and monsters move after that.

So, at t=0, I shoot 1 bullet at monster 1 (a=1), so it dies immediately.

Then, at t=1, monster 1 is already dead, monsters 2 and 3 move closer.

At t=1, I shoot 2 bullets at monster 2 (a=2), reducing its health to 0, so it dies.

At t=2, monster 3 is at position 1, and I shoot 2 bullets at it (a=3), reducing its health to 1.

At t=3, monster 3 is at position 0, but I need to have eliminated it by then.

Wait, but at t=2, I've only reduced its health to 1, so I need to shoot it again at t=2 and t=3.

At t=2: shoot 2 bullets at monster 3 (a=3-2=1)

At t=3: shoot 2 bullets at monster 3 (but it only needs 1 more to be eliminated)

So, by t=3, I've eliminated it.

But in the sample explanation, it seems that they manage to eliminate all monsters by t=3.

Hence, perhaps my earlier approach is missing something.

Let me consider a different strategy.

Suppose I sort the monsters by their |x_i| in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, I calculate the latest time by which I need to have eliminated it, which is t = |x_i| -1.

Then, I need to allocate a_i bullets to it by this time.

But I can allocate bullets in any order, so I need to make sure that the total bullets allocated up to each time t do not exceed k * t.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the maximum bullets required per second over all possible time steps.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a schedule where I allocate bullets to monsters over time.

At each second t, I can allocate up to k bullets to any monsters that haven't reached me yet.

I need to make sure that by the time a monster reaches me, I have allocated enough bullets to eliminate it.

This sounds like a resource allocation problem over time, where the resource is the number of bullets I can shoot per second.

To solve this efficiently, perhaps I can use a priority queue or some sorted structure to manage the monsters based on their deadlines.

But given the constraints, I need something more efficient.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

In the given code:

- For each test case, read n and k, then read healths and positions.

- Create a list of monsters as tuples (position, health), sorted by |position|.

- Initialize total_bullets_used = 0

- For each monster in this sorted order:

- Get position and health.

- Calculate distance = |position|

- time_available = distance (I think this is incorrect; according to earlier reasoning, it should be distance -1)

- bullets_needed = health

- If total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:

- It's impossible, break and output NO

- Else:

- total_bullets_used += bullets_needed

- After processing all monsters, if all are successfully allocated, output YES

Wait, in the code, time_available is set to distance, but in my earlier reasoning, it should be distance -1, because the monster reaches me at time distance.

Hence, perhaps the code has a mistake.

But according to the sample input and output, it's giving YES for the first case.

In the first sample:

n=3, k=2

a=[1,2,3]

x=[-1,2,3]

sorted by |x|: [(-1,1), (2,2), (3,3)]

total_bullets_used starts at 0

First monster: distance=1, bullets_needed=1

Check if 0 +1 >1: 1 >1 is False, so allocate, total_bullets_used=1

Second monster: distance=2, bullets_needed=2

Check if 1+2 >2: 3>2 is True, so it's impossible, output NO

But according to the sample, it's YES.

Hence, there's a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the time_available should be distance -1, as I thought earlier.

Let me adjust the code accordingly.

Modify the code to set time_available = distance -1

Then, for the first sample:

First monster: distance=1, time_available=0

bullets_needed=1

Check if 0 +1 >0: 1>0 is True, which is okay, allocate, total_bullets_used=1

Second monster: distance=2, time_available=1

bullets_needed=2

Check if 1+2 >1: 3>1 is True, which is not okay, so impossible, output NO

But according to the sample, it's YES.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the cumulative bullets needed should be compared to k * time_available.

In the code, it's comparing total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available

But time_available is the time by which the bullets need to be allocated.

But I need to ensure that the total bullets allocated up to that time do not exceed k * time_available.

Hence, the condition should be total_bullets_used + bullets_needed <= k * time_available

If this holds, then allocate; else, it's impossible.

In the first sample:

k=2

First monster: time_available=0

bullets_needed=1

Check if 0 +1 <= 2*0: 1 <=0 is False, so impossible, which contradicts the sample output.

Hence, this approach is wrong.

Let me try another approach.

Let's consider that at each second, I can shoot up to k bullets at any monsters.

I need to distribute these bullets in a way that minimizes the time to eliminate monsters.

But since monsters are moving towards me, I need to prioritize eliminating those that are closer first.

Wait, perhaps I should prioritize eliminating monsters based on their distance.

But I need a more systematic way.

Let me consider the maximum number of bullets required per second across all time steps.

That is, for each time t, calculate the total bullets needed to eliminate all monsters that reach me at or before time t.

Then, ensure that in any second, the total bullets needed do not exceed k.

But this might not be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the cumulative bullets needed up to each time t and ensure that it doesn't exceed k * t.

This sounds similar to the earlier approach but with a correction.

Let me try again with the first sample.

n=3, k=2

monsters:

1: |x|=1, a=1, reaches at t=1

2: |x|=2, a=2, reaches at t=2

3: |x|=3, a=3, reaches at t=3

At t=0:

- Monsters at positions -1,2,3

- I can shoot up to 2 bullets.

- Suppose I shoot 1 bullet at monster 1, reducing its health to 0, and 1 bullet at monster 3, reducing its health to 2.

- Monster 1 dies.

At t=1:

- Monsters 2 and 3 move closer.

- Positions: monster 2 at 1, monster 3 at 2.

- Shoot 2 bullets at monster 2, reducing its health to 0, so it dies.

- Monster 3: shoot 2 bullets
