Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Dmitry has n cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100. He has a favorite cube, which is at position f. He throws all the cubes on the table, and each cube shows some value a_i. Then, he arranges these cubes in non-increasing order of their values, meaning from largest to smallest. If two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order relative to each other.

After sorting, he removes the first k cubes. The question is whether his favorite cube is among the removed ones.

First, I need to understand what "non-increasing order" means. It means that the cubes are sorted such that the cube with the highest value is first, then the next highest, and so on. If there are cubes with the same value, their order relative to each other is unspecified.

Given that, the position of the favorite cube after sorting depends on its value and how it compares to the other cubes' values.

Let me think about how to determine if the favorite cube is removed or not.

I need to consider the value of the favorite cube and how many cubes have values greater than or equal to it.

If I can figure out the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting, I can determine whether it could be among the first k removed cubes.

Let's denote:

- favorite_value = a[f-1] (since indices are 1-based)

- count_same = number of cubes with value equal to favorite_value

- count_greater = number of cubes with value greater than favorite_value

With this information, I can determine the possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting.

The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order, so the cubes with higher values come first.

The cubes with values greater than favorite_value will always be before those with favorite_value.

The cubes with favorite_value can be arranged in any order among themselves.

So, the positions of the favorite cube can range from count_greater + 1 to count_greater + count_same.

Because there are count_greater cubes with higher values, the cubes with favorite_value start from position count_greater + 1.

Among the count_same cubes with the same value, the favorite cube can be in any of those positions.

So, the possible positions of the favorite cube are from count_greater + 1 to count_greater + count_same.

Now, Dmitry removes the first k cubes. So, if the position of the favorite cube is between 1 and k, it is removed; otherwise, it is not.

Therefore, if the earliest possible position (count_greater + 1) is less than or equal to k, and the latest possible position (count_greater + count_same) is also less than or equal to k, then the favorite cube is always removed.

If the earliest possible position is greater than k, then the favorite cube is never removed.

If the earliest possible position is less than or equal to k and the latest possible position is greater than k, then it's possible for the favorite cube to be either removed or not, depending on its exact position.

So, based on this logic, we can categorize the output into "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE".

Let me summarize:

- If count_greater + 1 <= k and count_greater + count_same <= k, then "YES"

- If count_greater + 1 > k, then "NO"

- Else, "MAYBE"

Wait, let's verify this.

Case 1: count_greater + 1 <= k and count_greater + count_same <= k

This means that even the last cube with favorite_value is at position count_greater + count_same, which is still <= k, so all such cubes are removed. Hence, "YES".

Case 2: count_greater + 1 > k

This means that the earliest possible position of the favorite cube is greater than k, so it is never removed. Hence, "NO".

Case 3: count_greater + 1 <= k < count_greater + count_same

This means that some cubes with favorite_value are removed (those with positions <=k), and some are not. Since the favorite cube could be in any of these positions, it's possible for it to be removed or not. Hence, "MAYBE".

Seems correct.

Now, let's see how to implement this.

I need to read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, f, k

- Read the list a of n integers

- Find favorite_value = a[f-1]

- Count the number of cubes with value > favorite_value (count_greater)

- Count the number of cubes with value == favorite_value (count_same)

- Determine the possible positions of the favorite cube:

- Earliest position: count_greater + 1

- Latest position: count_greater + count_same

- Check if earliest position <= k and latest position <= k: "YES"

- Else if latest position < earliest position <= k: "MAYBE"

- Else: "NO"

Wait, actually, since earliest position is count_greater + 1 and latest position is count_greater + count_same, and positions are from 1 to n.

So, in code:

if count_greater + count_same <= k:

print("YES")

elif count_greater + 1 > k:

print("NO")

else:

print("MAYBE")

This should cover all cases.

Let me think about some examples to verify.

Example 1:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]

favorite_value = a[1] = 3

count_greater: number of cubes with value > 3, which is 1 (the cube with 4)

count_same: number of cubes with value == 3, which is 3

So, earliest position: 1 + 1 = 2

latest position: 1 + 3 = 4

k=2

So, 2 <= 2 and 4 > 2, hence "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Example 2:

n=5, f=5, k=3

a = [4,2,1,3,5]

favorite_value = a[4] = 5

count_greater: number of cubes with value >5, which is 0

count_same: number of cubes with value ==5, which is 1

earliest position: 0 +1 =1

latest position: 0 +1=1

k=3

Since 1 <=3, and 1<=3, but wait, in this case, it's "YES" in the sample output.

Wait, according to my logic, if earliest <=k and latest <=k, then "YES"

Here, earliest=1, latest=1, k=3, so 1<=3, hence "YES"

Correct.

Another sample:

n=5, f=5, k=2

a = [5,2,4,1,3]

favorite_value=5

count_greater:0

count_same:1

earliest=1, latest=1

k=2

Since 1<=2, "YES"

But in the sample output, it's "NO"

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, looking back at the sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

Output: NO

Wait, according to my logic, it should be "YES", but sample output is "NO"

Hmm, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, maybe I need to consider stable sorting, but the problem says "non-increasing order", and if two cubes have the same value, they can be in any order.

Wait, but in this case, with a=[5,2,4,1,3], sorted non-increasingly could be [5,4,3,2,1], so favorite cube is at position 1, which is removed since k=2, so it's removed.

But the sample output is "NO", which contradicts my logic.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input and output.

Wait, checking the sample input and output:

Input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

Output:

NO

Wait, but according to the sorting [5,4,3,2,1], favorite cube is at position 1, which is removed (since k=2), so it should be "YES"

But the sample output is "NO", which suggests that in this case, the favorite cube is not removed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when sorting, cubes with the same value can be in any order.

Wait, in this example, a=[5,2,4,1,3], sorted non-increasingly is [5,4,3,2,1], favorite cube is at position 1, which is removed.

But sample output is "NO", which suggests that in some arrangements, it's not removed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the problem is that after sorting, the first k cubes are removed, but if there are multiple cubes with the same value, their relative order is undefined.

So, in the third sample input:

5 5 2

5 2 4 1 3

favorite cube is the fifth cube, which has value 3.

After sorting, possible arrangements:

[5,4,3,2,1]

In this case, favorite cube (3) is at position 3, which is not among the first k=2 removed cubes.

Hence, it's not removed.

Another possible arrangement could be [5,4,3,3,2], but in this input, there is only one 3.

Wait, a=[5,2,4,1,3], so values are 5,2,4,1,3

So, sorted non-increasingly: [5,4,3,2,1]

Favorite cube is the one with value 3, which is at position 3, which is not among the first k=2 removed cubes.

Hence, "NO"

Wait, I think I misread the favorite cube's value earlier.

Wait, a=[5,2,4,1,3], f=5, so favorite cube is the fifth one, which has value 3.

After sorting, [5,4,3,2,1], favorite cube is at position 3, which is not among the first k=2 removed cubes.

Hence, "NO"

But according to my earlier logic, I had:

count_greater: number of cubes with value >3, which are 5 and 4, so count_greater=2

count_same: number of cubes with value ==3, which is 1

So, earliest position: 2+1=3

latest position: 2+1=3

k=2

Since earliest position 3 > k=2, hence "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if count_greater + count_same <=k, then "YES", which in this case, 2+1=3 <=2 is False, so "NO"

Hence, my initial logic seems correct.

Wait, but in the first example, with n=5, f=2, k=2, a=[4,3,3,2,3], favorite_value=3, count_greater=1 (only 4), count_same=3, earliest=2, latest=4, k=2

So, 2<=2 and 4>2, hence "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

Output: YES

In this case, favorite cube is the fifth one, value=5

count_greater=0, count_same=1

earliest=1, latest=1, k=3

Since 1<=3, "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

10 1 1

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

favorite_value=1, count_greater=0, count_same=10

earliest=1, latest=10, k=1

So, 1<=1 and 10>1, hence "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

1 1 1

42

favorite_value=42, count_greater=0, count_same=1

earliest=1, latest=1, k=1

Hence, "YES"

Which matches the sample output.

Seems like my logic is consistent with the sample inputs.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

favorite_value = a[f - 1]

same_value_count = 0

for value in a:

if value == favorite_value:

same_value_count += 1

greater_count = 0

for value in a:

if value > favorite_value:

greater_count += 1

if greater_count >= k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

In my earlier reasoning, I had:

- If count_greater + count_same <=k: "YES"

- Elif count_greater +1 >k: "NO"

- Else: "MAYBE"

But in the provided program, it's:

- If greater_count >=k: "YES"

- Elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k: "NO"

- Else: "MAYBE"

Wait, this seems different from my logic.

Wait, in the program, it's checking if greater_count >=k: "YES"

But in my logic, it's count_greater + count_same <=k: "YES"

These are different conditions.

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first sample input:

n=5, f=2, k=2

a=[4,3,3,2,3]

favorite_value=3

count_greater=1 (only 4)

count_same=3

According to my logic:

count_greater + count_same =1+3=4 <=k=2? No, 4>2, so not "YES"

count_greater +1=2 <=k=2 and count_greater + count_same=4 >2, so "MAYBE"

Which matches the sample output.

But according to the program's condition:

if greater_count >=k: "YES" -> 1>=2? No

elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k: 1+3=4 <=2? No

else: "MAYBE"

Which matches.

Wait, but in my earlier example where n=5, f=5, k=2, a=[5,2,4,1,3]

favorite_value=3

count_greater=2 (5 and 4)

count_same=1

According to my logic:

count_greater + count_same=3 <=k=2? No

count_greater +1=3 <=k=2? No

Hence, "NO"

Which matches the sample output.

According to the program:

if greater_count >=k: 2>=2? Yes, so "YES"

But sample output is "NO"

Wait, this is inconsistent.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it gave the correct output, but in this one, it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back at the program:

if greater_count >=k:

print('YES')

elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k:

print('NO')

else:

print('MAYBE')

In the second sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

favorite_value=5

count_greater=0

count_same=1

greater_count=0

0 >=3? No

0 +1 <=3? Yes, so "NO"

But sample output is "YES"

Wait, contradiction again.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the logic in the program.

Wait, maybe the program has a mistake.

Let me think differently.

If greater_count >=k, then favorite cube is always removed, because even if it's at position greater_count +1, which is >k, but the program says "YES" if greater_count >=k.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the program has a mistake.

Let me consider the positions again.

If greater_count is the number of cubes with value > favorite_value, then the positions of the favorite cube range from greater_count +1 to greater_count + same_value_count.

Now, if greater_count +1 <=k and greater_count + same_value_count <=k, then all possible positions of the favorite cube are <=k, so it's always removed: "YES"

If greater_count +1 >k, then the favorite cube is never removed: "NO"

Else, it's "MAYBE"

Hence, the correct conditions are:

if greater_count + same_value_count <=k: "YES"

elif greater_count +1 >k: "NO"

else: "MAYBE"

But in the provided program, it's:

if greater_count >=k: "YES"

elif greater_count + same_value_count <=k: "NO"

else: "MAYBE"

Which is incorrect, as shown in the sample input.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first sample input, it gave "MAYBE", which is correct, but in the second sample input, it would give "NO" instead of "YES"

Wait, in the second sample input:

5 5 3

4 2 1 3 5

greater_count=0, same_value_count=1

0 >=3? No

0 +1 <=3? Yes, so "NO"

But sample output is "YES"

Hence, inconsistency.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
