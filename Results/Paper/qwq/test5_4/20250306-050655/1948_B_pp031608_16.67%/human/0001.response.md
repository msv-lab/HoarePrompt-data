Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation allows me to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position instead. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what operations are allowed and how they affect the array. The operation essentially breaks down a number into its individual digits if it's greater than or equal to 10. So, for numbers less than 10, they remain as they are unless another number nearby is operated on.

I need to check if, after any sequence of such operations, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let me consider the examples provided:

1. Input: [12, 3, 45, 67]

   - If I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

   - If I apply the operation to 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67], which is not sorted.

   - If I apply the operation to 12 first, getting [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

   So, in this case, it's possible.

2. Input: [12, 28, 5]

   - If I apply the operation to 12, it becomes [1, 2, 28, 5]. Not sorted.

   - If I apply the operation to 28, it becomes [12, 2, 8, 5]. Not sorted.

   - If I apply the operation to 12 and then to 28, it becomes [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. Still not sorted.

   - If I apply the operation to 28 first, getting [12, 2, 8, 5], then apply to 12, getting [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. Still not sorted.

   - It seems like no matter what operations I perform, I can't get a sorted array.

3. Input: [0, 0]

   - Already sorted.

So, based on these examples, I need a general approach to determine if such a sequence of operations can lead to a sorted array.

Let me think about how to model this problem.

First, I need to consider all possible sequences of operations. However, since the array length can be up to 50, and each operation can split a number into its digits, the potential size of the array after operations could be larger.

But checking all possible sequences of operations would be computationally expensive and not feasible for this problem's constraints.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider that the operation allows me to split any number >=10 into its digits. So, in a way, I can think of each number as a potential sequence of digits, and I can choose to either keep it as is or split it into digits.

My goal is to have a final array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.

So, for each position in the array, I have a choice: keep the number as is or split it into digits. I need to make these choices in such a way that the resulting array is sorted.

This sounds like a decision problem where I need to choose for each element whether to split it or not, and check if the resulting array is sorted.

However, with n up to 50, and each element having two choices (split or not), the total number of possibilities is 2^n, which is 2^50. That's way too large to compute.

Therefore, I need a different approach.

Maybe I can think about the array as a sequence of digits, where each number can be represented as one or more digits, depending on whether I choose to split it or not.

Wait, but numbers less than 10 are single digits, and numbers >=10 can be split into their individual digits.

So, perhaps I can consider each number as a sequence of digits, and I can choose to either keep it as a single number or split it into multiple digits.

Then, I need to interleave these choices to form a final array that is sorted.

This seems complex to implement directly.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I try to build the sorted array step by step, deciding for each position whether to take the number as is or split it into digits.

I need to ensure that at each step, the chosen elements are in non-decreasing order.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where I keep track of the previous element and decide for the current element whether to keep it or split it based on the previous choice.

But maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that splitting a number into digits always results in smaller or equal values compared to the original number.

For example, splitting 12 gives 1 and 2, both of which are less than or equal to 12.

Similarly, splitting 45 gives 4 and 5, which are less than 45.

So, splitting a number can only help in making the array sorted if the split digits are smaller than the next element or the previous elements.

Wait, but in some cases, splitting might not help, as seen in the second example.

I need a way to model this.

Perhaps I can think of the array as a list of possible digit sequences and see if there's a way to choose these sequences such that the entire flattened list is sorted.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start from the first element and decide whether to split it or not.

- If I choose not to split it, then the next element must be greater than or equal to it, considering whether it's split or not.

- If I choose to split it, then I need to consider each digit and ensure that they are less than or equal to the next elements, which may also be split or not.

This seems too recursive and complex for implementation.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after all possible operations, the array will consist of only single-digit numbers, since I can keep splitting any number >=10 into its digits.

Wait, but I can choose to keep some numbers intact if they are less than 10 or if splitting them doesn't help.

But in theory, I can split any number >=10 into its digits, so the final array would consist only of single-digit numbers.

But that's not necessarily true because I can choose not to split numbers <10, and also choose not to split some numbers >=10.

Wait, but the problem allows me to perform the operation any number of times, including zero.

So, the final array can have a mix of single-digit numbers and numbers >=10, depending on my choices.

But if I choose to split all numbers >=10, then the final array will consist only of single-digit numbers.

In that case, checking if the array is sorted would be straightforward.

But the problem allows me to choose which numbers to split and which to keep intact.

So, it's not just about splitting all numbers; I can choose selectively.

This makes it more complicated.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can consider the minimal possible array after operations.

That is, if I split all numbers >=10, I get an array of single-digit numbers, and I can check if that array is sorted.

If it is sorted, then certainly I can achieve a sorted array.

But if it's not sorted, does that mean I can't achieve a sorted array?

Wait, no. Because I have the choice to keep some numbers intact and split others.

So, even if splitting all numbers doesn't give a sorted array, there might be another combination of splitting some and keeping others intact that results in a sorted array.

Therefore, splitting all numbers is just one possibility, but not the only one.

So, if splitting all numbers gives a sorted array, then definitely the answer is YES.

But if it's not sorted, I still need to check other possibilities.

This seems time-consuming.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the following idea:

- For each position in the array, consider the number there.

- If the number is >=10, I can choose to either keep it as is or split it into its digits.

- I need to choose for each such number whether to split it or not, such that the resulting array is sorted.

- To check all possible combinations, which is 2^k where k is the number of elements >=10, is still too large for n=50.

Wait, but n is up to 50, and k could be up to 50, so 2^50 is too big.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the constraints.

The numbers are between 0 and 99, inclusive.

So, they are at most two digits.

Also, the array length is small, up to 50.

Maybe I can model this as a graph where each node represents a possible state for an element (split or not), and edges represent the compatibility between consecutive elements.

Then, checking for a path through the graph where each step respects the sorted order would indicate that it's possible.

But implementing such a graph might be too time-consuming.

Is there a simpler way?

Let me consider that splitting a number >=10 into digits can only help in making the array sorted if the digits are smaller than or equal to the next element or larger than or equal to the previous element.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and whenever I find a number that is larger than the next number, and that number is >=10, I can split it and see if that helps in making the array sorted.

Similarly, I can check if splitting the next number helps.

This seems like a greedy approach.

But I need to think carefully about whether this would work.

Let me try this approach with the first example:

[12, 3, 45, 67]

- Start with index 0: 12 and 3.

  - 12 > 3, so I need to split 12.

  - Splitting 12 gives [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

- So, in this case, it works.

Second example:

[12, 28, 5]

- Start with index 0: 12 and 28.

  - 12 <= 28, so move to index 1.

- Index 1: 28 and 5.

  - 28 > 5, so I need to split 28.

  - Splitting 28 gives [12, 2, 8, 5].

  - Now, check again:

    - 12 and 2: 12 > 2, so I need to split 12.

    - Splitting 12 gives [1, 2, 2, 8, 5].

    - Now, check:

      - 1 <= 2 <= 2 <= 8 <= 5? No, because 8 > 5.

      - So, still not sorted.

  - Maybe I should split 5 instead, but 5 is less than 10, so I can't split it.

  - Alternatively, maybe I should split 12 first.

    - Split 12 first: [1, 2, 28, 5].

    - Then, 28 > 5, so split 28: [1, 2, 2, 8, 5].

    - Still not sorted.

  - It seems like no matter what I do, I can't sort this array.

Third example:

[0, 0]

- Already sorted.

So, in the first and third cases, it's possible, and in the second, it's not.

Now, let's see if the greedy approach I'm thinking of would work.

The approach is:

- Iterate through the array from left to right.

- For each position i, check if a[i] <= a[i+1].

- If not, and a[i] >=10, split a[i] into its digits and insert them in place.

- Then, recheck the new array.

- Repeat this process until the array is sorted or no more operations can be performed.

But in the second example, even after splitting, the array isn't sorted, and there are no more operations that can be performed.

So, this approach seems to work for these cases.

But I need to think about whether this is always correct.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the array is [15, 2, 30, 4].

- Check 15 and 2: 15 > 2, so split 15: [1, 5, 2, 30, 4].

- Now, check 5 and 2: 5 > 2, so split 5: but 5 is less than 10, can't split.

  - Wait, 5 is less than 10, so I can't split it.

  - So, I can't do anything here. The array isn't sorted.

- But maybe I should have split 30 instead.

  - Original array: [15, 2, 30, 4].

  - Split 30: [15, 2, 3, 0, 4].

  - Now, check: 15 > 2, so it's still not sorted.

- Alternatively, split 15 first: [1, 5, 2, 30, 4].

  - Still, 5 > 2.

  - Can't split 5, so can't sort.

- So, in this case, it's impossible to sort the array.

Now, consider another array: [13, 20, 25].

- Check 13 and 20: 13 <= 20, okay.

- Check 20 and 25: 20 <= 25, okay.

- So, already sorted.

- But what if I split 13: [1, 3, 20, 25], which is still sorted.

- Splitting 20: [13, 2, 0, 25], which is not sorted.

- Splitting 25: [13, 20, 2, 5], which is not sorted.

- So, in this case, the array is already sorted without splitting, which is fine.

Another example: [20, 15, 25].

- 20 > 15, which is not sorted.

- I can split 20: [2, 0, 15, 25].

- Now, 0 < 15, which is okay.

- So, [2, 0, 15, 25] is not sorted.

- Alternatively, split 15: [20, 1, 5, 25].

- Now, 20 > 1, which is not okay.

- So, seems like can't sort this array.

Wait, but maybe there's another way.

- Split both 20 and 15: [2, 0, 1, 5, 25].

- Which is not sorted.

- So, can't sort this array.

So, my approach seems to be working for these cases.

But I need to think about whether this is always correct.

Is there a case where the greedy approach would fail?

Let me think of a case where splitting a number later in the array affects earlier decisions.

Suppose the array is [15, 25, 2].

- Check 15 and 25: 15 <= 25, okay.

- Check 25 and 2: 25 > 2, so I need to split 25: [15, 2, 5, 2].

- Now, check 15 and 2: 15 > 2, which is not okay.

- So, split 15: [1, 5, 2, 5, 2].

- Now, check: 1 <= 5 <= 2 <= 5 <= 2, which is not sorted.

- So, can't sort this array.

Another approach: maybe I need to consider splitting numbers in a different order.

But in this case, no matter what I do, it seems impossible to sort the array.

So, my initial greedy approach seems to work for these cases.

But to be thorough, let's think about a more complex case.

Suppose the array is [19, 20, 21].

- 19 <= 20 <= 21, already sorted, so no need to split.

- If I split 19: [1, 9, 20, 21], which is sorted.

- So, in this case, it's still sorted after splitting.

Another case: [19, 2, 21].

- 19 > 2, not sorted.

- Split 19: [1, 9, 2, 21].

- Now, 1 <= 9 <= 2 <= 21, which is not sorted.

- Can't split 2 since it's <10.

- So, can't sort this array.

Seems consistent.

Another case: [10, 11, 12].

- 10 <= 11 <= 12, already sorted.

- Splitting any of them would result in [1, 0, 11, 12] or [10, 1, 1, 2] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2], which are not sorted.

- So, best to keep them as is.

So, in this case, the array is already sorted.

Hence, the answer is YES.

From these observations, it seems that the greedy approach of iterating through the array and splitting numbers when necessary could work.

But I need to think about the implementation details.

In the given program, there's a function func_1 that checks if the list is sorted.

The main logic is in the loop where it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element, and if the previous element is >=10, it splits it into digits and inserts them back into the list.

Then, it repeats this process until the list is sorted or no more operations can be performed.

But in the code, it seems to perform the operation only once for each position, which might not be sufficient if multiple operations are needed.

Wait, let's look at the code again.

The code is:

for p in range(1, len(list1)):

if not func_1(list1):

if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:

a = list1[p - 1]

list1.pop(p - 1)

list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

list1.insert(p, a % 10)

This loop iterates from the second element to the end, and for each position, if the previous element is greater than the current one and the previous element is >=10, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.

However, this operation is done only once for each position, but in reality, multiple operations might be needed.

For example, in the first example:

[12, 3, 45, 67]

- Check 12 and 3: 12 > 3, so split 12 into 1 and 2.

- New list: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

- So, in this case, one operation suffices.

But what if we have a case where multiple operations are needed?

For example: [25, 3, 40]

- Check 25 and 3: 25 > 3, so split 25 into 2 and 5.

- New list: [2, 5, 3, 40]

- Now, check 5 and 3: 5 > 3, so split 5: but 5 <10, can't split.

- So, can't sort this array.

But in this code, it seems to perform the operation only once for each position.

Wait, no. The loop is structured in a way that it checks the condition for each position from 1 to len(list1)-1, but it doesn't repeatedly perform operations until no more operations are needed.

In the code, it's written as:

for p in range(1, len(list1)):

if not func_1(list1):

if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:

a = list1[p - 1]

list1.pop(p - 1)

list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

list1.insert(p, a % 10)

So, it checks if the list is not sorted, then for each position, if the previous element is greater than the current one and >=10, it splits it.

However, this seems like it only performs one split operation per position, but in reality, we might need to perform multiple splits to achieve a sorted array.

For example, consider [25, 30, 4]:

- First, check 25 and 30: 25 <= 30, okay.

- Check 30 and 4: 30 > 4, so split 30 into 3 and 0.

- New list: [25, 3, 0, 4]

- Now, check 25 and 3: 25 > 3, so split 25 into 2 and 5.

- New list: [2, 5, 3, 0, 4]

- Now, check 5 and 3: 5 > 3, can't split 5 since it's <10.

- So, can't sort this array.

But in the code, it seems to perform only one split operation for each position.

Hence, it might not be sufficient.

Perhaps I need to repeatedly perform these operations until no more operations are needed or until the list is sorted.

So, maybe I need to put this in a while loop, continuing to perform operations until no more operations are possible.

Let me try to adjust the code accordingly.

I can do something like:

while True:

    changed = False

    for p in range(1, len(list1)):

        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:

            a = list1[p - 1]

            list1.pop(p - 1)

            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)

            list1.insert(p, a % 10)

            changed = True

            break  # Stop after the first split operation

    if not changed or func_1(list1):

        break

Then, after the loop, check if the list is sorted.

This seems better because it repeatedly performs operations until no more operations are needed.

But in the original code, it's not structured this way.

It seems to perform a single pass and split elements where necessary, then check if the list is sorted.

This might not be sufficient in all cases.

Hence, the original code might not be correct.

But perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me consider the first example again.

[12, 3, 45, 67]

- Check 12 and 3: 12 > 3, split 12 into 1 and 2.

- New list: [1, 2, 3, 45, 67], which is sorted.

- So, in one operation, it's sorted.

Hence, for this case, the original code works.
