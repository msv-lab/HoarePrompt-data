Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n containers of water lined up, each with some amount of water in them. The goal is to make sure that all containers have the same amount of water, and I can only pour water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index. Also, it's given that the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by n, which means it's possible to have an equal distribution in theory.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what operations are allowed. The key point here is that I can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a higher one, and I can do this any number of times, choosing any i and j where i < j. This means that water can only move from left to right in the line of containers.

Given that, I need to figure out if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by only moving water from left to right.

Let me think about what this implies. If I can only move water from left to right, then each container can only receive water from the containers to its left, and it can send water to the containers to its right.

To make all containers equal, I need to make sure that each container has the average amount of water, which is the total sum divided by n. Since it's given that the sum is divisible by n, the average will be an integer.

So, the target amount for each container is sum(nums) // n.

Now, I need to check if it's possible to reach this target for each container by only moving water rightwards.

Let me consider the first container. It has nums[0]. If nums[0] is less than the target, then I need to add water to it from the containers to its left. But wait, there are no containers to its left since it's the first one. So, if nums[0] is less than the target, it's impossible to add water to it because I can't pour water from a container with a higher index into it. Therefore, for the first container, nums[0] must be at least the target.

Wait, actually, since I can only pour water from lower indices to higher indices, the first container can only keep its water or pour it to the right, but I can't add water to it from elsewhere. So, if nums[0] is less than the target, I can't make it equal to the target because I can't add water to it. Hence, nums[0] must be at least the target.

Similarly, for the second container, nums[1], it can receive water from the first container but can't receive from any container to its right. So, the total water available in the first two containers must be at least twice the target, because both should end up with the target amount.

Generalizing this, for the first k containers, the total water must be at least k times the target. Because each of these k containers needs to have at least the target amount, and I can't bring water from beyond these k containers to the left.

So, to check if it's possible, I need to iterate through the containers from left to right, keeping a running sum of the water, and at each step, ensure that the running sum is at least the target multiplied by the number of containers so far.

If this condition holds for all prefixes of the array, then it's possible to make all containers equal. Otherwise, it's not.

Let me think about an example to verify this.

Take the third test case from the example:

n = 5

nums = [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]

Sum = 4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 15

Target = 15 / 5 = 3

Now, check prefixes:

- First container: 4 >= 3*1 => 4 >= 3 → OK

- First two containers: 4 + 5 = 9 >= 3*2 = 6 → OK

- First three containers: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11 >= 3*3 = 9 → OK

- First four containers: 4 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 12 >= 3*4 = 12 → OK

- All five containers: 15 >= 15 → OK

Since all these conditions are satisfied, it's possible to make all containers equal to 3.

Another example from the test case:

n = 2

nums = [1, 3]

Sum = 4, target = 2

Check prefixes:

- First container: 1 >= 2 → No → So, 'NO'

This matches the sample output.

Another one:

n = 3

nums = [1, 2, 3]

Sum = 6, target = 2

Check prefixes:

- First container: 1 >= 2 → No → 'NO'

Again, matches the sample output.

One more:

n = 7

nums = [6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]

Sum = 28, target = 4

Check prefixes:

- 6 >= 4 → OK

- 6+5=11 >= 8 → OK

- 6+5+5=16 >= 12 → OK

- 6+5+5+1=17 >= 16 → OK

- 6+5+5+1+3=20 >= 20 → OK

- 6+5+5+1+3+4=24 >= 24 → OK

- 6+5+5+1+3+4+4=28 >= 28 → OK

So, 'YES'

This seems to work.

Now, looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):

n = len(nums)

total = sum(nums)

if total % n != 0:

return 'NO'

mean = total // n

curr = 0

for i in range(n):

curr += nums[i] - mean

if curr < 0:

return 'NO'

return 'YES'

First, it checks if the total sum is divisible by n, which is already given in the problem, so that condition is redundant, but it doesn't harm.

Then, it calculates the mean (target) and initializes curr to 0.

It iterates through the array, accumulating nums[i] - mean into curr.

If curr ever becomes negative, it returns 'NO'

Otherwise, 'YES'

This seems to be implementing the prefix sum check I described earlier.

Let me see why this works.

curr represents the cumulative difference from the target.

If curr is negative at any point, it means that the total water in the first i containers is less than i*mean, which violates the condition I outlined earlier.

Hence, returning 'NO' in that case is correct.

If curr remains non-negative throughout, it means that at every step, the total water in the first i containers is at least i*mean, which satisfies the condition for making all containers equal.

Therefore, the program is correct.

I can confirm this with the sample inputs and outputs provided.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in each of the `n` containers equal by only pouring water from a container with a lower index to one with a higher index.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We have `n` containers arranged in a line, each containing a certain amount of water.
   - We can only pour water from a container at position `i` to a container at position `j` if `i < j`.
   - The total sum of water across all containers is divisible by `n`, ensuring that an equal distribution is mathematically possible.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To achieve equal distribution, each container should have the average amount of water, which is `sum(a) / n`.
   - Given the constraint that water can only be poured from left to right, each prefix sum of the containers must be sufficient to meet the required average up to that point.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the target amount of water each container should have: `target = sum(a) // n`.
   - Maintain a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target.
   - If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it means that we don't have enough water in the preceding containers to reach the target in the current container, hence it is impossible.

### Solution Code

```python
def can_equalize_water(a):
    n = len(a)
    total = sum(a)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    target = total // n
    curr_sum = 0
    for num in a:
        curr_sum += num - target
        if curr_sum < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(can_equalize_water(nums))
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check**:
   - Ensure the total sum is divisible by `n`. If not, return 'NO'. This is given in the problem, but it's included for completeness.

2. **Calculate Target**:
   - Compute the target amount of water each container should have: `target = sum(a) // n`.

3. **Running Sum Check**:
   - Initialize `curr_sum` to 0.
   - For each container from left to right, adjust `curr_sum` by adding `num - target`.
   - If `curr_sum` becomes negative at any point, return 'NO' because it's impossible to meet the target.
   
4. **Final Check**:
   - If the loop completes without `curr_sum` becoming negative, return 'YES'.

This approach ensures that we are always able to meet the target water level in each container by only moving water from left to right.
