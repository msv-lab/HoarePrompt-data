Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, and I need to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that each a_i is between 1 and 10^9, and for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, I need to make sure that the first element a_1 is within the same range.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means here. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions. The problem says that if there are multiple possible a arrays, I can output any one of them.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

4

2 4 1

3

1 1

6

4 2 5 1 2

2

500

3

1 5

Output:

3 5 4 9

2 5 11

5 14 16 5 11 24

501 500

2 7 5

So, for the first test case, n=4 and x=[2,4,1], and the corresponding a is [3,5,4,9]. Let's verify this:

- 5 mod 3 = 2 → matches x_2=2

- 4 mod 5 = 4 → matches x_3=4

- 9 mod 4 = 1 → matches x_4=1

Looks good.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such an array a for any given x.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to start from a_1 and then determine each a_i based on x_i and a_{i-1}.

Given that x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}, I can express a_i as:

a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i

Where k is some integer.

This is because when you divide a_i by a_{i-1}, you get a quotient k and a remainder x_i.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i.

My goal is to find suitable values for a_1 and then for each a_i based on a_{i-1} and x_i.

But I need to choose a_1 first. What should a_1 be?

Looking back at the example, for n=4 and x=[2,4,1], they chose a_1=3.

Then a_2 = 5, which is 3*1 + 2 = 5 (k=1)

a_3 = 4, which is 5*0 + 4 = 4 (k=0)

a_4 = 9, which is 4*2 + 1 = 9 (k=2)

So, different k's were chosen for different steps.

But choosing k=1 for all steps might not always work.

Maybe I can choose k=1 for all steps to simplify things.

Let's try that.

So, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's see if this works for the first test case.

Given x=[2,4,1]:

- a1=3

- a2=a1 + x2=3+2=5

- a3=a2 + x3=5+4=9

- a4=a3 + x4=9+1=10

But in the example, a4=9, not 10. So, their choice was different.

Wait, in the example, a3=4, which is not equal to a2 + x3=5+4=9. So, their choice of k was different.

So, choosing k=1 for all steps doesn't necessarily work.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the constraints.

Each a_i must be between 1 and 10^9.

Also, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

I need to ensure that for each i, a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

One way to ensure this is to choose a_i such that a_i >= x_i and a_i - x_i is divisible by a_{i-1}.

Because a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, and I can choose k to make a_i as large as I want, but I need to keep it within 10^9.

But perhaps starting with a small a1 and then building up is possible.

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

while t:

t = t - 1

n = int(input())

line = input('')

T = list(map(int, line.split()))

a = [1000]

for i in range(1, n):

a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])

result = ' '.join(map(str, a))

print(result)

So, in this program, they set a1=1000, and then for each subsequent a_i, they set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, but in the first test case, a1=3, not 1000. So, is this correct?

Wait, perhaps they choose a1=1000 to make sure it's large enough.

But in the example, a1=3 worked.

So, is a1=1000 always sufficient?

Let me see.

In the first test case, with a1=1000, then:

a2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002

a3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006

a4 = 1006 + 1 = 1007

Now, check:

a2 mod a1 = 1002 mod 1000 = 2, which matches x2=2

a3 mod a2 = 1006 mod 1002 = 4, which matches x3=4

a4 mod a3 = 1007 mod 1006 = 1, which matches x4=1

So, this also works.

But in the example, they chose a1=3, which is smaller.

So, both a1=3 and a1=1000 work.

So, perhaps choosing a1 >= x2 is sufficient.

Wait, in the first test case, x2=2, and a1=3 >= x2=2.

In general, does a1 need to be >= x2?

Let me think.

If a1 > x2, then a2 = a1 + x2, so a2 mod a1 = x2, which is correct.

If a1 <= x2, then a2 = a1 + x2, and a2 mod a1 = (a1 + x2) mod a1 = x2 mod a1.

But since a1 <= x2, x2 mod a1 is x2 - a1*floor(x2/a1).

If a1 <= x2 < 2*a1, then x2 mod a1 = x2 - a1.

But in this case, x2 - a1 < a1, which may not match x2.

Wait, no, x2 mod a1 is x2 - a1*floor(x2/a1).

But I need a2 mod a1 = x2.

Wait, if a1 <= x2, then a2 = a1 + x2, and a2 mod a1 = x2 mod a1.

But x2 mod a1 is x2 - a1*floor(x2/a1), which is not necessarily equal to x2 unless x2 < a1.

Wait, if x2 < a1, then x2 mod a1 = x2, which is what we need.

But if x2 >= a1, then x2 mod a1 < a1, but it's not equal to x2.

So, choosing a1 <= x2 could cause problems.

Therefore, to ensure that a2 mod a1 = x2, we need x2 < a1.

Therefore, a1 should be greater than x2.

So, a1 should be greater than x2.

In the first test case, x2=2, so a1=3 > 2 works.

In the program, a1=1000, which is greater than any x2 up to 500, since x_i <=500.

So, choosing a1 = x2 + 1 would work, but in the program, they chose a1=1000, which is larger than any x2.

This ensures that a1 > x2, and hence a2 mod a1 = x2.

Similarly, a3 mod a2 = x3, and so on.

So, this seems correct.

But in the example, they chose a1=3, which is greater than x2=2.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n=3, x=[1,1]

Output: 2 5 11

Here, a1=2 > x2=1, so a2=2+1=3, but in the output, a2=5.

Wait, hold on.

In the example, a1=2, a2=5, a3=11.

But according to the program, if a1=1000, then a2=1000 +1=1001, a3=1001+1=1002.

Then:

a2 mod a1 =1001 mod 2=1, which matches x2=1

a3 mod a2=1002 mod 1001=1, which matches x3=1

But in the example, they chose a1=2, a2=5, a3=11.

Let's check:

a2 mod a1 =5 mod 2=1, matches x2=1

a3 mod a2=11 mod 5=1, matches x3=1

So, both choices work.

But the program chooses a1=1000, which is larger than any x2, ensuring a1 > x2.

So, the program's choice of a1=1000 is safe.

But in the example, they chose a1=2, which is smaller, but still greater than x2=1.

Wait, but in the third test case:

n=6, x=[4,2,5,1,2]

Output:5 14 16 5 11 24

Here, a1=5, x2=4, so a1=5 > x2=4, which is fine.

In the fourth test case:

n=2, x=[500]

Output:501 500

Here, a1=501 > x2=500, which is fine.

In the fifth test case:

n=3, x=[1,5]

Output:2 7 5

Here, a1=2 > x2=1, which is fine.

So, in all examples, a1 > x2 holds.

Therefore, choosing a1 > x2 is sufficient.

The program chooses a1=1000, which is greater than any x_i since x_i <=500.

Therefore, the program's choice is safe.

But is there any constraint that a_i should be as small as possible?

The problem doesn't specify that, so any a_i within 1 to 10^9 is acceptable as long as it satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, choosing a1=1000 and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n is correct.

This ensures that a_i > x_i and a_i - x_i is divisible by a_{i-1}, hence a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
