Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to find the final score of the game based on their optimal plays. Let's break this down step by step.

First, understanding the game:

- There's an array `a` of size `n`, and Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

- Players take turns, with Alice going first.

- On Alice's turn, she picks an element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- On Bob's turn, he picks an element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, but doesn't add it to `c`.

- The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is the MEX of `c`, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

- Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, the goal is to find what the MEX of `c` will be if both play optimally.

Let me think about how MEX is calculated. MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it. For example:

- MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3.

- MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2.

- MEX of [1, 2, 3] is 0.

Given that, Alice wants the MEX to be as large as possible, which means she wants `c` to contain as many of the smaller non-negative integers as possible, in order.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to disrupt Alice's efforts by removing elements that could help her achieve a higher MEX.

Since Alice can choose which elements to add to `c`, and Bob can choose which elements to remove, their choices will impact the final composition of `c`.

Let's consider the total number of moves:

- There are `n` elements, and each turn removes one element from `a`.

- Since Alice starts, she will have ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob will have floor(n/2) turns.

Wait, no. Let's think again:

- Total turns: `n`.

- Alice moves on 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., turns.

- Bob moves on 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc., turns.

So, if `n` is odd, Alice has one more move than Bob.

Now, since only Alice adds to `c`, and Bob just removes from `a`, the final `c` will have ceil(n/2) elements.

But Bob can influence which elements are available for Alice to choose from.

Wait, but Bob can choose any element to remove, not necessarily the one Alice would pick.

So, Bob can remove elements that Alice wants, forcing her to pick less desirable elements.

Alice, knowing this, will have to strategize accordingly.

This seems like a game where both players are playing optimally, so I need to find a way to simulate their decisions or find a pattern that leads to the optimal MEX.

Let me consider some examples to understand the behavior.

Example 1:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

Output:

2

Explanation:

A possible game:

- Alice picks 1 → a=[0,0,1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0 → a=[0,1], c=[1]

- Alice picks 0 → a=[1], c=[1,0]

- Bob picks 1 → a=[], c=[1,0]

MEX of [1,0] is 2.

But is this the optimal outcome?

Wait, maybe there are other possibilities.

Another game:

- Alice picks 0 → a=[0,1,1], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1 → a=[0,1], c=[0]

- Alice picks 1 → a=[0], c=[0,1]

- Bob picks 0 → a=[], c=[0,1]

Again, MEX is 2.

Seems consistent.

Example 2:

Input:

4

0 1 2 3

Output:

1

Possible game:

- Alice picks 0 → a=[1,2,3], c=[0]

- Bob picks 1 → a=[2,3], c=[0]

- Alice picks 2 → a=[3], c=[0,2]

- Bob picks 3 → a=[], c=[0,2]

MEX of [0,2] is 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1 → a=[0,2,3], c=[1]

- Bob picks 0 → a=[2,3], c=[1]

- Alice picks 2 → a=[3], c=[1,2]

- Bob picks 3 → a=[], c=[1,2]

MEX is 0.

But the output is 1, so the first scenario is better for Alice.

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize, so he would choose the second option.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Example 3:

Input:

2

1 1

Output:

0

Possible game:

- Alice picks 1 → a=[1], c=[1]

- Bob picks 1 → a=[], c=[1]

MEX of [1] is 0.

No other options.

So, in this case, MEX is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the MEX depends on which numbers Alice can collect in `c`.

Given that Bob can remove elements that Alice might need, Alice needs to ensure she can collect the necessary numbers to maximize the MEX.

I need to find a way to determine the highest possible MEX that Alice can achieve, considering Bob's interference.

Let me think about the frequency of each number in the array.

Suppose I count how many times each number appears in `a`.

Let's say I have counts for each number from 0 to n-1.

Alice needs to collect numbers in order to maximize the MEX.

Bob will try to prevent Alice from collecting the numbers she needs.

So, for each number that Alice needs for the MEX sequence, she needs to have at least one instance of it in `c`.

But Bob can remove some of these instances.

I need to see how many times each number appears and how many times Alice can get them despite Bob's removals.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times a number appears and how many times Alice can pick it.

Since Alice gets to pick on ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob on floor(n/2) turns.

But Bob can choose to remove any element, including those that Alice needs.

So, for each number that Alice needs (starting from 0,1,2,...), I need to ensure that there are enough instances of it that Alice can pick at least one, even when Bob tries to remove them.

Let me formalize this.

Let’s say for a number `k`, if the number of times `k` appears in `a` is `cnt[k]`.

Then, the number of times Alice can pick `k` is ceil(cnt[k] / 2), because Bob can take floor(cnt[k] / 2).

Wait, that might be a way to look at it.

For each `k`, Alice can get at least ceil(cnt[k] / 2) instances of `k` into `c`.

But since MEX is about the smallest missing number, we don't care about multiple instances, just whether `k` is present or not in `c`.

So, for each `k`, we need to know if Alice can get at least one instance of `k` into `c`, despite Bob's attempts to remove it.

So, for a number `k`, if it appears at least once in `a`, Alice can pick it unless Bob removes all instances of it.

But Bob can remove floor(cnt[k] / 2) instances of `k`, and Alice can pick ceil(cnt[k] / 2) instances.

But since Alice only needs one instance of `k` to include it in `c`, as long as ceil(cnt[k] / 2) >= 1, she can include `k` in `c`.

Which means cnt[k] >= 2 * 1 = 2.

Wait, ceil(cnt[k] / 2) >= 1 when cnt[k] >= 2.

But if cnt[k] == 1, then ceil(1 / 2) = 1, which means Alice can pick it on her first turn.

Wait, no.

If cnt[k] == 1, and it's Alice's turn, she can pick it.

If it's Bob's turn, he can pick it and remove it.

So, for cnt[k] == 1, Alice can get `k` into `c` only if it's her turn when that element is available.

Wait, this seems more involved.

Let me think differently.

Imagine all the elements are in a pool.

Alice and Bob take turns picking elements, with Alice going first.

Alice wants to collect numbers in `c` to maximize MEX.

Bob wants to minimize MEX by either removing numbers Alice needs or by removing numbers that could help Alice.

But since Bob can remove any element, he can choose to remove elements that Alice wants.

So, for each number `k` that Alice needs for MEX, she needs to have a way to pick it before Bob can remove all instances of it.

I need to find the largest `k` such that Alice can ensure that `c` contains all numbers from 0 to k-1, and `k` is not in `c`.

Wait, actually, MEX is the smallest missing number, so to maximize MEX, Alice needs to collect as many of the smaller numbers as possible.

Bob will try to prevent Alice from collecting some of these numbers.

So, perhaps I need to find how many of the smallest numbers Alice can guarantee to collect, despite Bob's interference.

Let me consider the counts of each number.

Suppose I sort the numbers and consider the frequency of each number.

For each number `k`, starting from 0 upwards, I need to see if Alice can get at least one instance of `k` into `c`.

Given that Bob can remove floor(cnt[k]/2) instances, Alice can get ceil(cnt[k]/2) instances.

But since Alice only needs at least one instance of `k` to include it in `c`, as long as cnt[k] >= 1 and ceil(cnt[k]/2) >=1, which is always true for cnt[k] >=1, except when cnt[k] ==1 and Bob picks it.

Wait, no.

If cnt[k] ==1, and it's Alice's turn, she can pick it.

If it's Bob's turn, he can pick it and remove it.

So, for cnt[k] ==1, Alice can get `k` into `c` only if she picks it before Bob can remove it.

Given that Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice starting first, Alice can ensure that she picks it if it's still available on her turn.

But it depends on the order in which they pick.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the total number of turns and who gets to pick which elements.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the total number of elements and how many turns each player gets.

Total turns: `n`, Alice gets ceil(n/2) turns, Bob gets floor(n/2) turns.

Alice can pick ceil(n/2) elements to put into `c`.

Bob can remove floor(n/2) elements from `a`.

But Bob can choose which elements to remove, including those that Alice needs for a higher MEX.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice wants to collect as many of the smallest numbers as possible.

Bob wants to minimize MEX by preventing Alice from collecting some of these smallest numbers.

So, perhaps I need to find how many of the smallest numbers Alice can guarantee to collect, given that Bob can remove some elements.

Let me consider that Alice can collect ceil(cnt[k]/2) instances of `k`, and she needs at least one instance of `k` to include `k` in `c`.

So, for each `k`, if cnt[k] >=1 and ceil(cnt[k]/2) >=1, then Alice can include `k` in `c`.

But wait, ceil(1/2)=1, but if Bob picks it, it's removed.

So, for cnt[k]==1, Alice can only include `k` in `c` if she picks it before Bob can remove it.

Given that Alice and Bob alternate turns, with Alice starting first, Alice can pick it on her first turn.

Wait, but Bob can also pick it on his turn.

So, for cnt[k]==1, Alice can include `k` in `c` only if she picks it on her turn before Bob can remove it.

Given that Alice starts first, if there's only one instance of `k`, and it's available when it's Alice's turn, she can pick it.

But Bob can also pick it on his turn if it's available when it's his turn.

So, for cnt[k]==1, Alice can include `k` in `c` only if the single instance of `k` is picked on her turn.

Given that Alice and Bob alternate turns, and Alice starts first, Alice can pick every odd-numbered element (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.), and Bob picks every even-numbered element (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.).

So, for a single instance of `k`, if its position in the array is such that Alice picks it on her turn, she can include it in `c`.

But the array is being modified as elements are picked, so the positions change.

This seems too complicated to track.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose which element to pick, and Bob can choose which element to remove.

So, Alice can prioritize picking the smallest available numbers to maximize the MEX.

Bob, to minimize the MEX, would want to prevent Alice from getting certain small numbers.

So, perhaps I need to find the smallest number `k` such that Alice cannot guarantee to include `k` in `c`.

In other words, the MEX would be the smallest `k` for which Alice cannot ensure that `k` is in `c`.

Alternatively, the MEX would be the smallest `k` for which Bob can ensure that `k` is not in `c`.

I need to find the point where Bob can prevent Alice from including a particular `k` in `c`.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Then, for each `k` from 0 to n:

- Calculate how many times `k` appears in the array.

- Determine if Alice can pick at least one instance of `k` into `c`, despite Bob's removals.

If Alice can pick `k`, then `k` is in `c`, and we check the next `k`.

If Bob can prevent Alice from picking `k`, then that's the MEX.

But how does Bob prevent Alice from picking `k`?

If cnt[k] is the count of `k` in the array.

- Alice can pick ceil(cnt[k]/2) instances of `k`.

- Bob can pick floor(cnt[k]/2) instances of `k`.

But since Alice only needs at least one instance of `k`, she can pick it as long as ceil(cnt[k]/2) >=1.

Which is true whenever cnt[k] >=1.

Wait, but for cnt[k]==1, ceil(1/2)=1, which means Alice can pick it.

But in reality, if cnt[k]==1, and it's Bob's turn to pick it, Bob can remove it, preventing Alice from including it in `c`.

So, for cnt[k]==1, Alice can include `k` in `c` only if she picks it on her turn.

Given that Alice and Bob alternate turns, and Alice starts first, Alice can pick every odd-numbered element, and Bob picks every even-numbered element.

So, for cnt[k]==1, whether Alice can pick it depends on its position in the array.

But the array is being modified as elements are picked, so positions are not fixed.

This seems too tangled.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the total number of elements less than or equal to a certain `k`.

Let’s define, for each `k`, the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k`.

Then, Alice needs to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in `c` to have MEX `k`.

Bob will try to prevent this by removing some of these elements.

So, for each `k`, I need to see if Alice can collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in `c`.

To do this, I need to ensure that for each number from 0 to k-1, Alice can get at least one instance of it into `c`, despite Bob's removals.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through possible MEX values and find the smallest `k` where Alice cannot collect all numbers from 0 to k-1.

Wait, but MEX is the smallest missing number, so if `k` is the MEX, it means that all numbers less than `k` are present in `c`, and `k` is not.

So, I need to find the smallest `k` such that Alice cannot collect all numbers from 0 to k-1 in `c`.

But how do I determine that?

Let me consider the counts of each number from 0 to k-1.

For each `k`, sum up the counts of numbers from 0 to k-1.

Then, Alice needs to collect at least one of each of these numbers.

Given that Bob can remove floor(cnt / 2) for each number, Alice can collect ceil(cnt / 2).

But since she needs at least one of each, for each number from 0 to k-1, she needs ceil(cnt[k]/2) >=1.

Which means cnt[k] >=1.

But as discussed earlier, for cnt[k]==1, Alice can only get it if it's her turn when that element is available.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the total number of elements Alice can pick and how many of them are the necessary numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the minimal number of turns Alice needs to collect all numbers from 0 to k-1.

If she can collect all of them within her available turns, then MEX can be `k`.

But Bob can interfere by removing some of these numbers.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Given program:

def func():

T = int(input())

for _ in range(T):

S = int(input())

N = list(map(int, input().split()))

N.sort()

cur = -1

M = {}

for num in N:

if num > cur:

if num > cur + 1:

cur += 1

break

cur = num

M[cur] = 1

else:

M[cur] += 1

if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:

cur += 1

for i in range(cur):

if M[i] <= i:

cur = i

break

print(cur)

So, it reads the number of test cases T, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a.

It sorts the array a.

Then it initializes cur to -1 and an empty dictionary M.

Then it iterates through the sorted array:

- If num > cur, it checks if num > cur + 1. If so, it increments cur and breaks.

- Else, sets cur to num and sets M[cur] = 1.

- If num <= cur, it increments M[cur].

After that, it checks if the sum of M values equals S (the size of the array). If so, it increments cur.

Then, it iterates from 0 to cur-1 and if M[i] <= i, it sets cur to i and breaks.

Finally, it prints cur.

This seems... a bit convoluted.

I need to understand what this code is trying to do.

It sorts the array, then tries to build a frequency-like dictionary M, where keys are the numbers and values are some counts.

But the logic inside the loop is not clear to me.

Let me try to understand with an example.

Take the first example:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

After sorting: [0,0,1,1]

Initialize cur=-1, M={}

First num=0:

0 > -1 → 0 > 0? No.

So, cur=0, M[0]=1

Second num=0:

0 > -1 → 0 > 0? No.

So, M[0] +=1 → M[0]=2

Third num=1:

1 > 0 → 1 > 1? No.

So, cur=1, M[1]=1

Fourth num=1:

1 > 0 → 1 > 1? No.

So, M[1] +=1 → M[1]=2

Now, sum of M values: 2 + 2 = 4 == S=4

So, cur +=1 → cur=2

Then, for i in range(2):

i=0: M[0]=2 > 0

i=1: M[1]=2 > 1

No break, so print cur=2, which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Sorted: [0,1,2,3]

cur=-1, M={}

num=0: 0 > -1 → 0 > 0? No. cur=0, M[0]=1

num=1: 1 > 0 → 1 > 1? No. cur=1, M[1]=1

num=2: 2 > 1 → 2 > 2? No. cur=2, M[2]=1

num=3: 3 > 2 → 3 > 3? No. cur=3, M[3]=1

Sum of M values: 1+1+1+1=4==S=4

cur +=1 → cur=4

Then, for i in range(4):

i=0: M[0]=1 > 0?
