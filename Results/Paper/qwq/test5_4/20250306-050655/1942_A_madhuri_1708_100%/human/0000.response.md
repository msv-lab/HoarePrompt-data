Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find an array of length n, where each element is between 1 and 10^9, and exactly k out of its n cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of an array a is basically rotating the array so that the x-th element becomes the first one, and the rest follow in order. For example, if a = [1, 2, 3, 3], then the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: [1, 2, 3, 3]

- x=2: [2, 3, 3, 1]

- x=3: [3, 3, 1, 2]

- x=4: [3, 1, 2, 3]

And among these, only the first one is sorted.

So, the task is to create an array where exactly k of these shifts are sorted.

Let me think about the properties of such an array.

Case 1: k = 0

If k=0, that means none of the cyclic shifts should be sorted. So, the array itself shouldn't be sorted in any cyclic shift. That sounds tricky because even if the array is not sorted, some shifts might still be sorted by chance.

For example, if n=3 and k=0, and a=[2, 1, 3], then shifts are:

- [2,1,3] (not sorted)

- [1,3,2] (not sorted)

- [3,2,1] (sorted)

Wait, but in this case, one shift is sorted, which is not what we want for k=0. So, I need to make sure that no cyclic shift is sorted.

Another example: a=[2,3,1]

Shifts:

- [2,3,1] (sorted? 2<=3<=1? No)

- [3,1,2] (3<=1<=2? No)

- [1,2,3] (yes, sorted)

Again, one shift is sorted. So, it's hard to have k=0.

Wait, maybe if all elements are equal, all shifts are sorted.

No, if all elements are equal, say a=[1,1,1], then all shifts are sorted because 1<=1<=1.

But in this case, k=n, which is not what we want for k=0.

So, perhaps for k=0, it's impossible. But let's see what the code does.

Looking at the code:

if k >= 2:

if n == k:

print(*[k for j in range(k)])

else:

print('-1')

else:

print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])

So, if k >= 2, it checks if n == k, then prints an array with all elements equal to k, else prints -1.

For k=0, which is less than 2, it prints [1,2,3,...,n].

But according to the problem, for k=0, we need no cyclic shifts to be sorted. So, printing [1,2,3,...,n] would make one shift sorted (the array itself), which is not what we want.

Wait, but in the code, for k < 2, it prints [1,2,3,...,n], which for k=0, n=3, would be [1,2,3], which is sorted, so k=1, not k=0.

So, this seems incorrect for k=0.

But in the problem statement, the example for k=1 is n=3, k=1, and it prints [69420,69,420], which has one sorted shift.

But for k=0, I don't see an example. Probably, the code doesn't handle k=0 correctly.

Wait, in the problem's example, there's no case with k=0. The test cases given are:

3

2 2

3 1

3 2

Outputs:

1 1

69420 69 420

-1

So, for k=2 and n=2, it prints [1,1]

For n=3, k=1, prints [69420,69,420]

For n=3, k=2, prints -1

Looking back at the code, for k >=2:

- if n == k, print [k,k,...,k]

- else, print -1

For k <2 (i.e., k=1), print [1,2,3,...,n]

Wait, but in the first test case, n=2, k=2, it prints [1,1], which seems to work because all shifts are sorted since all elements are equal.

For n=3, k=1, it prints [1,2,3], but as I saw earlier, this would have one sorted shift, which is the array itself, and the other two are not sorted.

But according to the code, for k >=2, if n ==k, print [k,k,...,k], else -1.

For k <2, print [1,2,3,...,n]

But in the example, for n=3, k=2, it prints -1, meaning no such array exists.

Wait, but could there be an array of length 3 with exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts?

Let's think about it.

Suppose we have an array a = [1,1,2]

Its shifts are:

- [1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1] (not sorted)

So, only one sorted shift.

Another try: a = [1,1,1]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1]

- [1,1,1]

- [1,1,1]

All are sorted, so k=3, which is not what we want for k=2.

Another try: a=[1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2] (sorted)

- [2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Seems like it's impossible to have exactly k=2 sorted shifts for n=3.

Hence, the code correctly prints -1 for n=3, k=2.

Now, for k=1, it prints [1,2,3,...,n], which has exactly one sorted shift, which is the array itself.

But is there any other array that satisfies k=1?

For example, for n=3, k=1, the example prints [69420,69,420], which has one sorted shift.

So, the code seems to handle k=1 correctly by printing [1,2,3,...,n].

Wait, but earlier I thought that for k=1, it prints [1,2,3,...,n], which has only one sorted shift, which is fine.

But what about k=0? The code doesn't handle k=0 because k=0 is not >=2 and not <2, but k=0 is less than 2.

Wait, in the code, it's:

if k >=2:

if n ==k:

print [k,k,...,k]

else:

print -1

else:

print [1,2,3,...,n]

So, for k=1, it prints [1,2,3,...,n], which for n=3 is [1,2,3], which has one sorted shift, which is correct for k=1.

For k=0, it would also print [1,2,3,...,n], which would have one sorted shift, but we need k=0, meaning no sorted shifts.

Hence, the code is incorrect for k=0.

But in the problem statement, the test cases don't include k=0, so maybe the problem assumes k >=1.

Looking back at the problem statement:

1 <= k <= n <= 10^3

So, k starts from 1.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 1 <= k <= n, but in the example, k can be 1 up to n.

But k=0 is not allowed according to the constraints, so perhaps the code assumes k >=1.

Hence, for k=1, it prints [1,2,3,...,n], which has exactly one sorted shift.

For k >=2, it checks if n ==k, then prints [k,k,...,k], else -1.

In the example, for n=2, k=2, prints [1,1], which is correct because both shifts are sorted.

For n=3, k=1, prints [1,2,3], which has one sorted shift.

For n=3, k=2, prints -1, which is correct because it's impossible to have exactly two sorted shifts.

So, the code seems correct for these cases.

But what about other cases?

Let me think about n=1.

If n=1, k=1, then the only shift is the array itself, which must be sorted.

So, any single element array is sorted.

Hence, for n=1, k=1, any array with one element is fine.

The code would print [1], which is correct.

What about n=4, k=2?

According to the code, since k >=2 and n !=k (4 !=2), it would print -1.

Is that correct?

Let me see.

Is it possible to have n=4, k=2?

Let's try a=[1,1,1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another try: a=[1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Here, two sorted shifts: [1,1,2,2] and [2,2,1,1].

So, for n=4, k=2, this array satisfies the condition.

But according to the code, it would print -1 for n=4, k=2.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, for k >=2, if n ==k, print [k,k,...,k], else print -1.

For n=4, k=2, n !=k, so print -1.

But we just found an array that works for n=4, k=2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for n=3, k=2, it prints -1.

But in that case, is it possible to have such an array?

Let's see.

For n=3, k=2.

Try a=[1,1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Another try: a=[1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2] (sorted)

- [2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Another try: a=[1,1,1]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1] (sorted)

- [1,1,1] (sorted)

- [1,1,1] (sorted)

k=3, which is more than 2.

Seems like for n=3, it's impossible to have exactly k=2 sorted shifts.

Hence, the code correctly prints -1 for n=3, k=2.

But for n=4, k=2, it prints -1, whereas we found an array that works.

So, the code is too restrictive.

Let me think more generally.

What's the relationship between n and k for which such an array exists?

First, if k=0, as I thought earlier, it's impossible because at least one cyclic shift will be sorted if all elements are equal, or some shifts might be sorted depending on the array.

But according to the problem constraints, k >=1, so maybe we don't need to worry about k=0.

Wait, the problem says 1 <= k <= n, so k=0 is not allowed.

Hence, the minimal k is 1.

Now, for k=1, the code prints [1,2,3,...,n], which has exactly one sorted shift, which is the array itself.

That seems correct.

For k=n, meaning all cyclic shifts are sorted, the only way is if all elements are equal.

Because if all elements are equal, say a=[x,x,x,...,x], then all shifts are [x,x,x,...,x], which are sorted.

Hence, for k=n, printing [k,k,k,...,k] is correct.

But the code only does this when k >=2 and n ==k.

Wait, but for k=1 and n=1, it should also print [1], which it does, because for k <2, it prints [1,2,3,...,n].

But for k >=2 and n ==k, it prints [k,k,k,...,k].

For example, n=2, k=2, prints [2,2].

Which is correct, as both shifts are sorted.

But as we saw for n=4, k=2, it's possible to have exactly two sorted shifts with a=[1,1,2,2].

But the code prints -1 in this case.

Hence, the code is incomplete.

It seems that the code only considers two cases:

1. k >=2 and n ==k: print [k,k,k,...,k]

2. k <2: print [1,2,3,...,n]

Else, print -1.

But there are more possibilities.

For example, for k=1, printing [1,2,3,...,n] works, but there might be other arrays that also work.

For k=n, printing [k,k,k,...,k] works.

For other k, it's not clear.

I need a better understanding.

Let me think about the number of sorted cyclic shifts an array can have.

Suppose I have an array a.

The number of sorted cyclic shifts is equal to the number of starting positions x where the cyclic shift starting at x is sorted.

I need exactly k such positions.

One observation is that if the array is a non-decreasing sequence, then all its cyclic shifts are sorted only if the array is constant.

Otherwise, only the shifts that maintain the non-decreasing order are sorted.

But it's tricky to generalize.

Another approach is to consider the array as a circular sequence and find how many rotations make it sorted.

I recall that for a circular array, the number of sorted rotations is equal to the number of "increasing sequences" in the array.

But I need to recall the exact property.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the array decreases.

If the array decreases at m positions, then the number of sorted shifts is n - m.

Wait, not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array a.

I can concatenate a to itself, forming a[1], a[2], ..., a[n], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n].

Then, the x-th cyclic shift is a[x], a[x+1], ..., a[x+n-1].

So, to count the number of sorted cyclic shifts, I can滑动窗口大小为n，在这个长的序列上滑动，看有多少个窗口是 sorted 的。

But this seems computationally intensive for large n, but since n is up to 10^3, it's manageable.

But in this problem, I need to construct such an array.

So, perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula that relates n and k.

Looking back at the code, it seems to handle only specific cases:

- For k >=2 and n ==k, print [k,k,k,...,k]

- For k <2, print [1,2,3,...,n]

- Else, print -1

But as we've seen, for n=4, k=2, it's possible to have exactly two sorted shifts with a=[1,1,2,2], but the code prints -1.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

I need to find a more general solution.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For k=1, print [1,2,3,...,n], which has exactly one sorted shift.

- For k=n, print [x,x,x,...,x], where x is any number.

- For other k, it's more complicated.

I need to see if there exists an array with exactly k sorted shifts.

One idea is to have the array increase up to some point and then decrease.

For example, for n=4, k=2, a=[1,1,2,2] has two sorted shifts, as we saw earlier.

Similarly, for n=5, k=3, maybe a=[1,1,1,2,2], but let's check:

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

So, only two sorted shifts, not three.

Hence, this doesn't work.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, only two sorted shifts.

Not three.

Another try: a=[1,2,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [2,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,2,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,2,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

So, it's tricky to get exactly k sorted shifts for arbitrary k.

Perhaps only certain values of k are achievable for a given n.

For example, for n=4, k=2 is achievable, as we saw with a=[1,1,2,2].

But according to the code, it prints -1 for n=4, k=2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to handle this.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal k.

Minimal k is 1, which can be achieved by having a strictly increasing array, like [1,2,3,...,n], which has only one sorted shift.

Maximal k is n, achieved by having all elements equal.

Then, for intermediate k, it's not clear.

Perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible, and for other k, it's impossible.

But in the earlier example, for n=4, k=2 is possible with a=[1,1,2,2].

Hence, it's not just k=1 and k=n that are possible.

Hence, the code is incomplete.

I need to find a general way to construct an array with exactly k sorted shifts.

One approach is to have the array consist of k equal parts, each with increasing values.

Wait, not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the array and compute the number of sorted cyclic shifts.

I need to find an array where exactly k starting positions x make the cyclic shift sorted.

I can iterate over all possible starting positions and check if the cyclic shift is sorted.

But since n is up to 10^3 and t is up to 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3, it's feasible to construct such arrays.

But I need a smarter way to construct the array for given n and k.

Perhaps I can arrange the array such that there are exactly k starting positions where the cyclic shift is sorted.

One way to ensure that is to have the array values increase up to a certain point and then stay constant.

Wait, earlier attempts didn't work.

Let me try to find a pattern.

Suppose I have n and k, and I want exactly k sorted shifts.

I can try to construct an array where the first k elements are equal, and the remaining n-k elements are strictly larger.

Wait, no.

Let me try with n=4, k=2.

a=[1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Exactly two sorted shifts.

Similarly, for n=5, k=2.

a=[1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, exactly two sorted shifts.

Wait, but earlier I thought this would have only two sorted shifts, but according to the earlier attempt, it has two sorted shifts.

Wait, but for n=5, k=3, if I do a=[1,1,1,2,2], it has two sorted shifts, as seen earlier.

So, perhaps to have k sorted shifts, I need to set the first ceil(n/k) elements to one value, and the next ceil(n/k) elements to a higher value, and so on.

Wait, maybe.

Let me try for n=5, k=3.

Set ceil(5/3)=2.

So, first two elements to 1, next two to 2, and the last one to 3.

a=[1,1,2,2,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift, which is not enough.

Wait, but I wanted k=3 sorted shifts.

This approach doesn't work.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Not enough.

Another approach: perhaps have the array consist of k blocks, each block having the same value, and the blocks are in increasing order.

For example, for n=5, k=3, a=[1,1,2,2,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the block sizes.

For n=5, k=3, perhaps have blocks of sizes 2,2,1.

a=[1,1,2,2,3]

As above, only one sorted shift.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,3,3]

Same as above.

Still only one sorted shift.

Seems like this approach isn't working.

Perhaps I need to look for a different pattern.

Let me consider that for k=1, any array that is strictly increasing works, as only the array itself is sorted, and all other shifts are not sorted.

For k=n, any array where all elements are equal works, as all shifts are sorted.

For intermediate k, perhaps I can have the array consist of k equal elements, followed by n-k strictly larger elements.

Wait, no.

Let me try for n=4, k=2.

a=[1,1,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

Exactly two sorted shifts.

Similarly, for n=5, k=2.

a=[1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Again, exactly two sorted shifts.

For n=5, k=3.

If I set a=[1,1,2,2,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift.

Not enough.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,3,3] (sorted)

- [1,2,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [2,3,3,1,1] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,1,1,2,3] (not sorted)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe for k=3 and n=5, I need to have three blocks?

a=[1,2,3,3,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,3,3] (sorted)

- [2,3,3,3,1] (not sorted)

- [3,3,3,1,2] (not sorted)

- [3,3,1,2,3] (not sorted)

- [3,1,2,3,3] (not sorted)

Only one sorted shift again.

This is confusing.

Perhaps for k=3 and n=5, it's impossible.

Alternatively, maybe k must divide n for such an array to exist.

Wait, in the earlier example, for n=4, k=2, it's possible.

Similarly, for n=3, k=1, it's possible.

For n=3, k=3, it's possible with all elements equal.

For n=3, k=2, it's impossible, as we've seen.

Similarly, for n=5, k=5, possible.

n=5, k=1, possible.

n=5, k=2, possible.

n=5, k=3, impossible?

Wait, in n=4, k=2, possible.

n=4, k=1, possible.

n=4, k=4, possible.

n=4, k=3, is it possible?

Let's try a=[1,1,1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1] (sorted)

So, two sorted shifts.

Not three.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,2]

Same as above, two sorted shifts.

Another try: a=[1,1,1,2]

Same as above.

Seems like for n=4, k=3 is impossible.

Hence, perhaps only k=1,2,4 are achievable for n=4.

Similarly, for n=3, k=1,3 are achievable, k=2 is not.

For n=5, k=1,2,5 are achievable, k=3,4 are not.

So, perhaps k must be a divisor of n for it to be achievable.

Wait, for n=4, k=2 divides n, and it's achievable.

n=3, k=1 divides n, k=3 divides n.

n=5, k=1 divides n, k=5 divides n, k=2 divides n? 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which is not an integer.

Wait, but earlier, for n=5, k=2, it's achievable, but 2 does not divide 5.

Wait, 5 mod 2 is 1, not 0.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps k must be a divisor of 2n.

For n=5, k=2, 2n=10, which is divisible by 2.

For n=4, k=2, 2n=8, divisible by 2.

For n=3, k=1, 2n=6, divisible by 1.

For n=3, k=3, 2n=6, divisible by 3.

For n=4, k=4, 2n=8, divisible by 4.

But for n=5, k=3, 2n=10, which is not divisible by 3.

And earlier, for n=5, k=3, it seems impossible.

Similarly, for n=4, k=3, 2n=8, not divisible by 3, and it's impossible.

Hence, perhaps k must be a divisor of 2n for such an array to exist.

But I need to verify this.

For n=6, k=3, 2n=12, which is divisible by 3.

Is it possible?

Let's try a=[1,1,1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,1,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,1,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

Only two sorted shifts, not three.

Another try: a=[1,1,2,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,2,2,2,2] (sorted)

- [1,2,2,2,2,1] (not sorted)

- [2,2,2,2,1,1] (sorted)

- [2,2,2,1,1,2] (not sorted)

- [2,2,1,1,2,2] (not sorted)

- [2,1,1,2,2,2] (not sorted)

Only two sorted shifts again.

Seems like for n=6, k=3 is not achievable.

Hence, my assumption might be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps k must be a divisor of n.

Wait, for n=4, k=2, which divides n.

For n=5, k=5, which divides n.

For n=5, k=2, which does not divide n, but earlier it was achievable.

Wait, n=4, k=2 divides n.

n=5, k=5 divides n.

n=5, k=1 divides n.

n=5, k=2 does not divide n, but it's achievable with two sorted shifts.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

I need another approach.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal k.

Minimal k is 1, achievable by having a strictly increasing array.

Maximal k is n, achievable by having all elements equal.

For intermediate k, perhaps only certain k are achievable, but not all divisors of n.

I need to find a general rule.

Looking back at the code, it only handles k >=2 and n ==k, and k <2 separately.

But as we've seen, for k >=2, if n ==k, it prints [k,k,...,k], which is correct for k=n.

But for other k, it prints -1, which is incorrect, as there are cases where k !=n and k >=2, but an array exists.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

I need to find a general way to handle any k.

Perhaps I can generalize the approach used for k=1 and k=n.

For k=1, use a strictly increasing array.

For k=n, use all elements equal.

For other k, maybe have multiple blocks of equal elements, with increasing values between blocks.

But as seen earlier, this doesn't always work.

Alternatively, perhaps use the minimal number of distinct values to maximize k.

Wait, but I need to achieve exactly k sorted shifts.

This is getting complicated.

Given time constraints, I'll conclude that the provided code is incorrect because it doesn't handle all possible cases where an array exists for k >=2 and n !=k.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
