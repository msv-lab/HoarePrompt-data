Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should differ in at least one bit position from 1 to 31.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Since we're dealing with bits, it seems like we need to look at the binary representation of each number and ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit in any of the 31 least significant bits.

Wait, but the problem says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit." So, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits should be different. That sounds really strict. Essentially, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND should be zero for all bits from 1 to 31.

Hmm, is that correct? Let me think again. If two numbers have the same bit in any position from 1 to 31, they can't be in the same group. So, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND for bits 1 to 31 should be zero.

But actually, it's even stricter than that. The condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits are not equal. That means, for each bit position, if one number has a 1, the other must have a 0, and vice versa.

Wait, that sounds like the numbers in the same group should be pairwise exclusive in their bit patterns. In other words, no two numbers in the same group should have a 1 in the same bit position from 1 to 31.

But actually, it's not just that they don't have a 1 in the same position, but that for every position, their bits are different. So, it's more like they are complements of each other in each bit position.

But that can't be, because if two numbers are complements in all 31 bits, then they are unique in that group, but the problem allows multiple numbers in a group as long as this condition is satisfied.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of bitwise XOR. If two numbers have all bits different, their XOR would be all 1s, which is 2^31 - 1 for 31 bits.

But the condition is that for any pair of numbers in the group, for all bits from 1 to 31, the bits are not equal. That means, for each bit position, the bits are different between any two numbers in the group.

This sounds like, for any two numbers in the group, their XOR for bits 1 to 31 is all 1s, which is 2^31 - 1.

So, for any two numbers x and y in the group, x XOR y should be equal to (2^31 - 1).

Wait, but that can't be, because if I have three numbers in the group, say x, y, z, then x XOR y = 2^31 - 1, y XOR z = 2^31 - 1, and x XOR z = 2^31 - 1. But in reality, x XOR z would be (x XOR y) XOR (y XOR z) = (2^31 - 1) XOR (2^31 - 1) = 0, which contradicts the condition. So, it's impossible to have more than two numbers in a group if this condition must hold for every pair.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me read the problem again: "in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are not equal. That means, for each bit position, the bits are different between any two numbers in the group.

This seems too restrictive. It implies that for any two numbers in the group, their bitwise XOR for bits 1 to 31 is all 1s, which is 2^31 - 1.

But as I thought earlier, if I have more than two numbers, this condition cannot hold because of the transitive property of XOR.

Maybe the problem means that for any two numbers in the group, there exists at least one bit position from 1 to 31 where the bits are different. That would be a much weaker condition, and it would make the problem more manageable.

But the problem says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit." Which seems like for any two numbers, all bits from 1 to 31 are different.

Wait, but in the example, in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are placed in the same group. 0 in binary is all 0s, and 2147483647 is all 1s for the 31 least significant bits. So, their bits are all different, which satisfies the condition.

In the first test case, the numbers are 1, 4, 3, 4. Let's look at their binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

If we consider only the least significant bits, we can see that 1 and 3 have the same least significant bit, which is 1. So, they cannot be in the same group. Similarly, 4 and 4 have the same bits, so they cannot be in the same group unless it's allowed to have duplicates, but the problem says non-negative integers, which can have duplicates.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 4, meaning each number needs its own group.

Wait, but in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because their bits are all different.

So, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, there exists at least one bit position from 1 to 31 where the bits are different. That would allow 0 and 2147483647 to be in the same group because all their bits are different.

But in the first test case, since some numbers have at least one bit different, but apparently, it's requiring that for any pair, all bits are different, which would force each number to be in its own group.

Wait, but the problem says "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit." Which seems to mean that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal. So, for each bit position, the bits must be different.

But in the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4. Let's look at their binary representations for the first few bits:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

Comparing 1 and 4: bits are different in positions where 1 has 0 and 4 has 1, and vice versa.

Comparing 1 and 3: both have the least significant bit as 1, so they match in that bit position.

Comparing 4 and 4: all bits are the same.

So, in this case, to satisfy the condition, no two numbers can be in the same group because either they have some bits matching or they are duplicates.

Hence, each number needs its own group, which matches the first output of 4.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 have no matching bits, so they can be in the same group.

So, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, there is at least one bit position where their bits are different.

But in that case, in the first test case, 1 and 4 could be in the same group because they differ in multiple bit positions, but they also have some bits the same, like the least significant bit for 1 and 3.

Wait, no, the condition is more strict: for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal. Meaning, for every bit position, the bits must be different.

So, in other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise XOR for bits 1 to 31 must be all 1s, which is 2^31 - 1.

But as I thought earlier, this would mean that only two numbers can be in a group, and even then, only if their XOR is all 1s.

But in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because their XOR is all 1s.

But in the third test case, with five numbers, the output is 3, which suggests that it's possible to have more than two numbers in a group under certain conditions.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the condition.

Let me read the problem again carefully: "in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not matching. That is, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits are different between the two numbers.

But if that's the case, then only two numbers can be in the same group, and only if their XOR is all 1s.

But in the third test case, with five numbers, the output is 3, which suggests that more than two numbers can be in the same group.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, there exists at least one bit position from 1 to 31 where their bits are different.

That would be a much weaker condition, allowing more numbers in the same group.

But in the first test case, it's outputting 4, which would mean that each number needs its own group, suggesting that the condition is very strict.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it from a graph theory perspective.

Imagine each number as a node, and connect two nodes if they can be in the same group, i.e., their bits are all different.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the chromatic number of this graph, which is the minimum number of colors (groups) needed to color the graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color.

But computing the chromatic number is NP-hard, and with n up to 2e5, it's impossible to do that directly.

So, there must be a smarter way to approach this problem.

Let me consider the condition again: for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal.

That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bits are different.

This sounds like error-correcting codes, where codes are designed to differ in at least a certain number of bits.

But in this case, it's even stricter: they must differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

Wait, but that would mean that only two numbers can be in the same group: those that are complements of each other in all 31 bits.

But in the third test case, with five numbers, the output is 3, which doesn't align with that interpretation.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Let me look at the note again.

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need to place each number in its own group.

Wait, but in the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Let's look at their binary representations:

1: 001

4: 100

3: 011

4: 100

Comparing 1 and 4: different in bit positions where 1 has 0 and 4 has 1, and vice versa.

Comparing 1 and 3: same in the least significant bit.

Comparing 4 and 4: same in all bits.

So, to satisfy the condition, each number needs its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 have no matching bits, so they can be in the same group.

In the third test case, with five numbers, perhaps some of them can be grouped together while others cannot.

I need to find a way to group the numbers such that in each group, any two numbers have no matching bits from 1 to 31.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of the bitwise XOR.

If two numbers x and y are in the same group, then x XOR y should have all bits set from 1 to 31.

That is, x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Wait, but in the third test case, with five numbers, it's outputting 3, which suggests that there are three groups.

If I can find sets of numbers where any two numbers in the set have x XOR y equal to (1 << 31) - 1, then that set can be in the same group.

But again, as I thought earlier, with more than two numbers, this seems impossible because of the transitive property.

Wait, suppose I have three numbers x, y, z in the same group.

Then, x XOR y = (1 << 31) - 1

y XOR z = (1 << 31) - 1

Then, x XOR z = (x XOR y) XOR (y XOR z) = [(1 << 31) - 1] XOR [(1 << 31) - 1] = 0

But x XOR z should be (1 << 31) - 1, but here it's 0, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, it's impossible to have more than two numbers in the same group under this condition.

But in the third test case, the output is 3, which suggests that there are five numbers, and they are divided into three groups.

If each group can have at most two numbers, then three groups can hold up to six numbers, but here there are five numbers.

So, perhaps some groups have only one number.

But according to the earlier reasoning, only two numbers can be in the same group, and only if their XOR is all 1s.

But in that case, for five numbers, we would need at least three groups (since 2 groups can hold up to 4 numbers, and the fifth number goes into the third group).

But this seems too simplistic, and perhaps doesn't capture the full complexity of the problem.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some numbers can be placed in a group alone if they cannot be paired with any other number.

But according to the earlier reasoning, only two numbers can be in the same group, and only if their XOR is all 1s.

In that case, the minimal number of groups would be ceil(n/2), but in the first test case, n=4 and the output is 4, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps the condition is not that strictly pairwise; maybe it's that for any two numbers in the group, there exists at least one bit position from 1 to 31 where their bits are different.

That would be a much weaker condition, allowing more numbers in the same group.

In that case, the minimal number of groups would be the size of the largest set of numbers where any two have at least one bit different.

But that seems too broad, and doesn't align with the first test case's output.

I'm getting confused here.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I consider the 31-bit space, and each number occupies a point in this space.

The condition requires that for any two numbers in the same group, their bit patterns differ in all positions from 1 to 31.

Wait, no, the condition is that for any pair of numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal.

That is, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits are different between any two numbers in the same group.

This sounds like each group can contain at most one number, because for any two numbers, there exists at least one bit position where their bits are the same.

Wait, but in the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because all their bits are different.

So, perhaps only two numbers can be in the same group, and only if their XOR is all 1s.

In that case, the minimal number of groups required would be ceil(n/2), but in the first test case, n=4 and output=4, which suggests that some numbers cannot be paired.

Wait, maybe some numbers cannot be paired with any other number, hence they need their own group.

In the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Let's see:

- 1 and 4: their XOR is 5 (101), which is not all 1s for 31 bits.

- 1 and 3: XOR is 2 (010), not all 1s.

- 1 and 4: already checked.

- 3 and 4: XOR is 7 (111), not all 1s for 31 bits.

So, none of these pairs have XOR equal to all 1s for 31 bits. Therefore, each number needs its own group, which matches the output of 4.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 have XOR equal to all 1s, so they can be in the same group.

In the third test case, with five numbers, perhaps some pairs have XOR equal to all 1s, and others don't, leading to the need for three groups.

So, perhaps the approach is to find pairs of numbers whose XOR is equal to all 1s for bits 1 to 31, and group them together.

Then, the minimal number of groups would be ceil(n/2), but adjusted for the pairs that can be grouped together.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, but output=4, which suggests that no pairs can be grouped together.

In the second test case, n=2, output=1, which is ceil(2/2)=1.

In the third test case, n=5, output=3, which is ceil(5/2)=3.

But in the fourth test case, n=3, output=2.

Wait, ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

Fifth test case, n=4, output=2.

Wait, ceil(4/2)=2.

Sixth test case, n=4, output=3.

Wait, ceil(4/2)=2, but output is 3.

Hmm, that doesn't align.

Wait, maybe it's not simply ceil(n/2).

In the sixth test case, n=4, output=3.

So, perhaps there are constraints beyond just pairing numbers.

Maybe some numbers cannot be paired with any other number.

Wait, in the sixth test case, perhaps not all pairs have XOR equal to all 1s.

So, perhaps the approach is to find the maximum number of pairs that have XOR equal to all 1s, and then the remaining numbers would need their own groups.

But in the first test case, no pairs have XOR equal to all 1s, so each number needs its own group, totaling 4 groups.

In the second test case, one pair has XOR equal to all 1s, so one group.

In the third test case, perhaps there is one such pair, leaving three numbers to be in their own groups, totaling three groups.

Wait, but the output is 3 for n=5, which would suggest one pair and three singletons, totaling four groups, but the output is 3.

Hmm, maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of connected components where two numbers are connected if their XOR is not all 1s.

But that seems convoluted.

Let me consider the problem differently.

Suppose I consider the 31-bit space, and each number is a point in this space.

The condition requires that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal.

This is equivalent to saying that for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND for bits 1 to 31 is zero.

Wait, no.

Wait, if two numbers have the same bit in a position, their AND for that bit would be 1, which is not allowed.

But the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal.

That means, for every bit position, the bits are different between any two numbers in the group.

So, for any two numbers in the group, their bitwise XOR for bits 1 to 31 is all 1s.

Wait, but as I thought earlier, this leads to only two numbers can be in the same group, and only if their XOR is all 1s.

Given that, in the third test case with five numbers, output is 3, which would suggest that there are two pairs and one singleton, totaling three groups.

But in the sixth test case, n=4, output=3, which would suggest that there is one pair and two singletons.

But according to this logic, in the sixth test case, if there is one pair, it should be two groups, but the output is 3.

Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong.

Perhaps the condition is not that strictly pairwise.

Let me look at the problem again.

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not matching.

That is, for every bit position from 1 to 31, the bits are different between the two numbers.

This seems to imply that only two numbers can be in the same group, and only if their XOR is all 1s for bits 1 to 31.

But in the third test case, with five numbers, output is 3, which would suggest that there are two pairs and one singleton.

But according to this, it should be ceil(5/2)=3 groups.

Similarly, in the sixth test case, n=4, output=3, which would suggest that there is one pair and two singletons.

But according to the pairing logic, it should be two groups if two pairs are present.

Wait, perhaps not all pairs have XOR equal to all 1s.

So, perhaps in the sixth test case, only one pair has XOR equal to all 1s, and the other two numbers cannot be paired, so they need their own groups, totaling three groups.

That might make sense.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singletons plus the number of pairs that cannot be formed.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I consider each number and its complement, where the complement is defined as the number XOR (1 << 31) - 1.

Then, each number can be paired with its complement, since their XOR would be all 1s.

So, for each number, if its complement is present in the list, they can be put in the same group.

Otherwise, the number needs its own group.

So, the minimal number of groups would be the total number of singletons plus the number of pairs that can be formed.

Wait, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, actually, if a number and its complement are both present, they can be put in the same group.

Any other number cannot be put in that group because it would violate the condition.

So, for each pair of a number and its complement, they form one group.

Any number without its complement needs its own group.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of such pairs plus the number of numbers that do not have their complement present.

But in the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Let's compute their complements:

Assume 31-bit integers.

complement of 1: (1 << 31) - 1 - 1 = 2^31 - 2

complement of 4: 2^31 - 5

complement of 3: 2^31 - 4

complement of 4: same as above.

Now, none of these complements are present in the list, so each number needs its own group, totaling 4 groups.

In the second test case, 0 and 2^31 - 1 are present.

Their complements are:

complement of 0: 2^31 - 1

complement of 2^31 - 1: 0

So, they can be put in the same group.

Hence, one group.

In the third test case, with five numbers, perhaps two pairs can be formed, and one singleton, leading to three groups.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was two pairs and one singleton, but the output is 3.

Wait, perhaps it's one pair and three singletons, totaling four groups, but the output is 3.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of graph theory, where each number is a node, and edges connect numbers that can be grouped together.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 positions.

This sounds like finding the chromatic number of a graph where nodes are connected if they cannot be in the same group.

But as I thought earlier, computing chromatic number is NP-hard, and with n up to 2e5, it's not feasible.

So, there must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the bitwise XOR.

If two numbers x and y are in the same group, then x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

So, for each number, its complement (x XOR (1 << 31) - 1) should be in the list to be paired with it.

If it is, they can be in the same group.

Otherwise, the number needs its own group.

So, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of singletons (numbers without their complement present) plus the number of pairs that can be formed.

Wait, but in the third test case, with five numbers, output is 3.

Assuming that there is one pair and three singletons, which would require four groups, but the output is 3.

So, perhaps my understanding is still incorrect.

Wait, maybe multiple numbers can share a group if they are all pairwise matching the condition.

But earlier, I thought that only two numbers can be in the same group, but that seems conflicting with the third test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in a group, all numbers must satisfy the condition with each other.

So, for any two numbers in the group, their XOR must be equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But as I thought earlier, with three numbers, this is impossible unless they are all equal, which isn't the case here.

Wait, suppose we have three numbers where each pair has XOR equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

But as I saw earlier, that leads to a contradiction.

So, it's impossible to have more than two numbers in the same group under this condition.

Therefore, the minimal number of groups is ceil(n/2), but in the first test case, n=4 and output=4, which suggests that some numbers cannot be paired.

So, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs that can be formed plus the number of singletons.

But in the first test case, n=4, output=4, which would suggest that there are no pairs, only singletons.

In the second test case, n=2, output=1, which would suggest one pair.

In the third test case, n=5, output=3, which would suggest one pair and three singletons.

But according to the output, it's 3, which could be one pair and three singletons, requiring four groups, but the output is 3.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Perhaps, in some cases, more than two numbers can be in the same group under certain conditions.

But I can't see how.

Wait, maybe if a number is zero, and another number is its complement, and a third number is zero again, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some numbers can be in the same group if they are all zero.

But zero and zero would violate the condition because all their bits are the same.

Wait, in the seventh test case, n=4, input is 0 0 2147483647 2147483647, output is 2.

So, two groups.

How is that possible?

Group 1: 0 and 2147483647

Group 2: 0 and 2147483647

But wait, 0 and 0 cannot be in the same group because their bits are all the same.

Similarly, 2147483647 and 2147483647 cannot be in the same group for the same reason.

So, perhaps the groups are:

Group 1: 0 and 2147483647

Group 2: 0 and 2147483647

But in this case, each group has two numbers, but 0 and 0 cannot be in the same group, so this is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the groups are:

Group 1: 0 and 2147483647

Group 2: 0 and 2147483647

But as I said, 0 and 0 cannot be in the same group because their bits are all the same.

This violates the condition.

So, perhaps the output should be 4, but according to the sample input, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Wait, let's look at the problem statement again: "in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are not equal.

In the case of 0 and 0, all bits are equal, so they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 2147483647 and 2147483647 have all bits equal, so they cannot be in the same group.

Therefore, in the seventh test case, we need at least four groups, one for each number.

But according to the sample input, the output is 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "each number must fall into exactly one group."

And the condition is: "in any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1st to 31st bit."

Wait, perhaps the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, there exists at least one bit position from 1 to 31 where their bits are different.

That would be a much weaker condition, allowing more numbers in the same group.

In that case, for the seventh test case, 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because their bits are all different.

Similarly, another 0 and another 2147483647 can be in the same group, but since they are duplicates, perhaps the problem allows multiple groups to have the same pair.

But according to the sample input, the output is 2, which suggests that two groups are sufficient.

So, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of unique pairs needed to accommodate all numbers.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of matching numbers with their complements.

So, for each number, if its complement is present, they can be put in the same group.

If not, the number needs its own group.

In the seventh test case, we have two 0s and two 2147483647s.

Since 0 and 2147483647 are complements, we can pair one 0 with one 2147483647 in one group, and the other 0 with the other 2147483647 in the second group.

Hence, two groups.

This aligns with the sample output.

Similarly, in the first test case, none of the numbers have their complements present, so each number needs its own group, totaling four groups.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements and are present, so they can be put in one group.

In the third test case, with five numbers, perhaps two pairs can be formed, and one number is left as a singleton, totaling three groups.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was one pair and three singletons, but according to this, it's two pairs and one singleton.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the specific numbers in the third test case to see how many such pairs can be formed.

But given time constraints, I'll proceed with this understanding.

So, the approach is:

- For each number, compute its complement as (1 << 31) - 1 - number.

- If the complement is present in the list, pair them into one group.

- If a number doesn't have its complement present, it needs its own group.

- Count the number of such pairs and singletons to get the minimal number of groups.

But in practice, since we might have multiple occurrences of numbers, we need to handle duplicates carefully.

For example, in the seventh test case, we have two 0s and two 2147483647s.

We can pair one 0 with one 2147483647, and the other 0 with the other 2147483647, resulting in two groups.

Similarly, in the first test case, none of the numbers have their complements present, so each number needs its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements and are present, so they can be put in one group.

This seems consistent with the sample inputs and outputs.

Hence, the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs that can be formed (each pair forming one group) plus the number of singletons (each needing their own group).

To implement this efficiently, we can use a frequency map:

- Compute the complement for each number.

- For each number, if its complement is present in the frequency map, decrement both their counts and increment the pair count.

- For numbers with remaining positive counts, they need their own groups.

But since n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, it should be manageable.

Wait, t is up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so per test case, n can be up to 2e5, but cumulatively across all test cases, it's 2e5.

Hence, overall time complexity should be O(n).

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):

res = 0

count = {}

for num in a:

if num not in count:

count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

res += 1

else:

count[num] -= 1

return res

So, in func_1:

- Initialize res to 0.

- Initialize an empty dictionary count.

- For each number num in a:

- If num is not in count:

- Increment count of (num ^ (1 << 31) - 1) by 1.

- Increment res by 1.

- Else:

- Decrement count of num by 1.

- Return res.

Wait, this seems incorrect.

If num is not in count, it adds num ^ (1 << 31) - 1 to count and increments res.

If num is in count, it decrements the count of num.

But this doesn't seem to correctly handle pairing numbers with their complements.

It seems to be trying to count the number of singletons, but the logic is flawed.

In the seventh test case, with a = [0,0,2147483647,2147483647], the program would do:

- num=0: not in count, so count[2147483647] = 1, res=1

- num=0: in count, so count[0] -=1 (but count[0] was not set yet, so it's None, but get defaults to 0, so count[0] = -1, res remains 1

- num=2147483647: in count, since count[2147483647]=1, so count[2147483647] -=1, res remains 1

- num=2147483647: in count, count[2147483647]=0, so count[2147483647] -=1, res remains 1

Hence, res=1, but the sample output is 2.

This indicates that the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the code.

Let me trace it again.

Initialize count as empty.

Process num=0:

- 0 not in count, so count[2147483647] = 1 (since 0 ^ (2^31 -1) = 2^31 -1)

- res +=1 -> res=1

Process num=0:

- 0 in count, so count[0] -=1 -> but count[0] was not set, so count.get(0,0) = 0, then 0-1 = -1, so count[0] = -1

- res remains 1

Process num=2147483647:

- 2147483647 in count, since count[2147483647]=1

- count[2147483647] -=1 -> count[2147483647]=0

- res remains 1

Process num=2147483647:

- 2147483647 in count, count[2147483647]=0

- count[2147483647] -=1 -> count[2147483647]=-1

- res remains 1

Hence, res=1, but the correct output is 2.

This shows that the program is incorrect.

Another way to see it is that the logic doesn't correctly pair numbers with their complements.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
