Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there's a secret permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries where I compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d). The goal is to find the pair with the maximum XOR using these comparisons.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR gives me the bits that are set in either number.

My task is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To do that, I need p_i and p_j to differ in the highest possible significant bits.

I need to think about how the OR operation can help me compare the magnitude of the numbers in the permutation. Since OR combines the set bits from both numbers, comparing (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d) can give me some information about the relative sizes of p_a, p_b, p_c, and p_d.

Maybe I can find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation by comparing ORs of different pairs. But wait, since it's a permutation of 0 to n-1, all values are unique, so finding the max and min might help.

Let me consider the properties of OR and XOR:

- OR of two numbers is at least as large as each individual number.

- XOR of two numbers can be larger or smaller depending on their bit differences.

I need to find a way to compare the XOR of different pairs using the OR operation.

Looking at the reference solution, it seems to be finding some kind of candidate for the maximum XOR by first finding a candidate for the maximum value using OR comparisons.

Let me try to understand the reference solution step by step.

In the main loop for each test case:

1. Read n.

2. Initialize ans1 to 0.

3. For i from 1 to n-1:

a. Ask a query comparing (p_ans1 OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_i). Since p_ans1 OR p_ans1 is just p_ans1, and p_i OR p_i is p_i, this is effectively comparing p_ans1 with p_i.

b. If p_ans1 < p_i, set ans1 to i.

So, this loop seems to be finding the index of the maximum value in the permutation, because it's comparing each p_i with the current maximum and updating ans1 if a larger p_i is found.

Wait, but in a permutation, p_i are unique, so this should correctly find the index of the maximum p_i.

Next:

4. Set mx to 0 and v to [0].

5. For i from 1 to n-1:

a. Ask a query comparing (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1).

b. If (p_mx OR p_ans1) < (p_i OR p_ans1), set mx to i and reset v to [i].

c. If (p_mx OR p_ans1) == (p_i OR p_ans1), append i to v.

So, here it's comparing (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1). Since ans1 has the index of the maximum p_i, p_ans1 is the largest value.

OR-ing p_mx with p_ans1 and comparing it with p_i OR p_ans1 seems like a way to compare p_mx and p_i, but I need to think carefully about what this comparison tells me.

Given that p_ans1 is the maximum p_i, OR-ing it with another p_i will set all bits that are set in either.

If p_mx OR p_ans1 < p_i OR p_ans1, then p_i must have some bit set that p_mx doesn't have, because p_ans1 is already the maximum.

Wait, no. Since p_ans1 is the maximum, OR-ing with p_mx or p_i will set all bits from p_ans1 and any additional bits from p_mx or p_i.

If p_mx OR p_ans1 < p_i OR p_ans1, that means there's at least one bit in p_i that's set and not in p_mx.

Hence, p_i has a higher value than p_mx in terms of binary representation.

Wait, but p_ans1 is the maximum, so p_i OR p_ans1 would just be p_ans1 if p_i <= p_ans1, but since p_ans1 is the maximum, p_i OR p_ans1 is always p_ans1.

Wait a minute, that can't be right. If p_i is less than p_ans1, then p_i OR p_ans1 would still be p_ans1, but if p_i has some higher bits set that p_ans1 doesn't have, which is impossible because p_ans1 is the maximum.

Wait, no. Since p_ans1 is the index of the maximum p_i, p_i cannot be greater than p_ans1, because p_ans1 is the maximum.

Wait, p_ans1 is the index of the maximum p_i, so p_i <= p_ans1 for all i.

Therefore, p_i OR p_ans1 would be p_ans1 for all i, because p_ans1 is the maximum.

So, comparing (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1) is comparing p_ans1 with p_ans1, which should always be equal.

But in the reference solution, it's checking if (p_mx OR p_ans1) < (p_i OR p_ans1), which should never happen because p_i OR p_ans1 is always p_ans1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look back.

Earlier, ans1 is set to the index of the maximum p_i.

Then, mx is set to 0, and v is set to [0].

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

- Compare (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1).

- If (p_mx OR p_ans1) < (p_i OR p_ans1), set mx to i and reset v to [i].

- If (p_mx OR p_ans1) == (p_i OR p_ans1), append i to v.

But as I thought, since p_ans1 is the maximum, p_i OR p_ans1 should be p_ans1 for all i.

Hence, (p_mx OR p_ans1) should always be equal to (p_i OR p_ans1), which is p_ans1.

Therefore, the condition (p_mx OR p_ans1) < (p_i OR p_ans1) should never be true.

But in the example provided in the problem, with n=4 and p=[0,3,1,2], let's see what happens.

First, find ans1, which should be the index of the maximum p_i, which is 1 (p_1=3).

Then, set mx=0, v=[0].

For i=1:

Compare (p_0 OR p_1) with (p_1 OR p_1), which is (0 OR 3)=3 and (3 OR 3)=3, so "=".

Append 1 to v, v=[0,1].

For i=2:

Compare (p_0 OR p_1)=3 with (p_2 OR p_1)=(1 OR 3)=3, so "=", append 2 to v, v=[0,1,2].

For i=3:

Compare (p_0 OR p_1)=3 with (p_3 OR p_1)=(2 OR 3)=3, so "=", append 3 to v, v=[0,1,2,3].

Then, set mx=v[0]=0.

Then, find the maximum in v by comparing (p_ans OR p_ans) with (p_v[i] OR p_v[i]), which is just comparing p_ans with p_v[i].

So, compare p_0 with p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3.

p_0=0 < p_1=3, so ans=1.

Then p_1=3 > p_2=1, ans remains 1.

p_1=3 > p_3=2, ans remains 1.

So, ans=1.

Then, print "! 1 0", which is p_1=3 and p_0=0, whose XOR is 3 XOR 0=3.

But in the example, the expected output is "! 3 2", which is p_3=2 and p_2=1, whose XOR is 3.

Both are correct since 3 is the maximum possible XOR.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should have compared p_0 OR p_1 with p_i OR p_1, which is 3 with 3 for all i, so v would include all indices.

Then, it finds the maximum in v, which is index 1 (p_1=3).

Then, it prints "! 1 0", which is correct.

But in the example output, it's "! 3 2", which is also correct.

So, multiple pairs can achieve the maximum XOR.

But according to my earlier reasoning, v should include all indices, and then it selects the maximum among them, which is ans1 itself.

Wait, but in the reference solution, after finding v, it sets mx=v[0], ans=v[0], and then compares p_ans with p_v[i] for each i in v.

So, it's finding the maximum p_v[i] in v.

But in the example, v includes all indices, and the maximum p_v[i] is p_1=3.

Hence, ans=1.

So, it prints "! 1 0", which is correct.

But in the example output, it's printing "! 3 2", which is also correct.

So, both are acceptable.

Hence, the reference solution seems to be working.

But I'm still a bit confused about the purpose of the second loop.

Let me try to rephrase the steps.

1. Find ans1, the index of the maximum p_i.

2. For each i, compare (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1).

- Since p_ans1 is the maximum, p_i OR p_ans1 is p_ans1 for all i.

- So, (p_mx OR p_ans1) is p_ans1 for current mx.

- Comparing p_ans1 with p_ans1, it's always "=".

- Hence, v includes all i.

3. Then, find the maximum p_i in v, which is ans1 itself.

4. Print "! ans ans1", which is the pair (ans1, ans1), but that would give p_ans1 XOR p_ans1 = 0, which is not maximum.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, in the reference solution, it's printing "! ans ans1", but in the example, it's printing "! 3 2", which is different.

Wait, perhaps I misread the reference solution.

Looking back, it's printing '! ans ans1'.

In the example, ans is 3 and ans1 is 2, giving p_3 XOR p_2 = 2 XOR 1 = 3.

Wait, p_3 is 2 and p_2 is 1 in the example.

So, ans=3 and ans1=2.

How did ans become 3?

Looking back, after v includes all indices [0,1,2,3], it sets mx=v[0]=0.

Then, compares p_ans with p_v[i] for each i in v.

- Compare p_0 with p_0: equal, ans remains 0.

- Compare p_0 with p_1: p_0=0 < p_1=3, so ans=1.

- Compare p_1 with p_2: p_1=3 > p_2=1, ans remains 1.

- Compare p_1 with p_3: p_1=3 > p_3=2, ans remains 1.

Hence, ans=1.

So, it should print "! 1 0", but in the example output, it's printing "! 3 2".

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the reference solution code:

print('!', ans, ans1)

In the example, it's printing "! 3 2", which corresponds to i=3 and j=2.

But according to my earlier steps, ans should be 1 and ans1 should be 0.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the example explanation.

Wait, perhaps the reference solution is correct and I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps ans1 is not necessarily the index of the maximum p_i.

Wait, in the first loop, it's comparing p_ans1 with p_i directly by comparing (p_ans1 OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_i), which is just comparing p_ans1 with p_i.

Hence, it's finding the index of the maximum p_i.

In the second loop, it's comparing (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1).

Given that p_ans1 is the maximum p_i, p_i OR p_ans1 is p_ans1 for all i.

Hence, (p_mx OR p_ans1) is p_ans1, and (p_i OR p_ans1) is p_ans1 for all i.

Hence, all comparisons should be "=".

Hence, v includes all i.

Then, it finds the maximum p_i in v, which is p_ans1.

Then, it prints "! ans ans1", which is the pair (ans, ans1), where ans is the index of the maximum p_i in v, which is ans1.

Hence, it's printing the pair (ans1, ans1), which would give p_ans1 XOR p_ans1 = 0, which is not the maximum.

But in the example, it's printing "! 3 2", which is p_3=2 and p_2=1, giving XOR=3.

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in how ans and ans1 are being used.

Wait, perhaps ans and ans1 are supposed to be different.

Looking back at the code:

ans1 is the index of the maximum p_i.

Then, v includes all i where (p_mx OR p_ans1) == (p_i OR p_ans1), which is all i since p_i OR p_ans1 is p_ans1 for all i.

Then, it finds the maximum p_i in v, which is p_ans1.

Hence, ans is ans1.

Then, it prints "! ans ans1", which is (ans1, ans1), which is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the purpose of the second loop is to find another index that, when XORed with p_ans1, gives the maximum value.

But that doesn't make sense because p_ans1 is the maximum p_i, and to maximize XOR, we need to find p_j that differs the most from p_ans1.

But OR comparisons might not directly help in finding such a p_j.

Maybe I need to consider the bits from highest to lowest and try to set the bits where possible.

Wait, but the reference solution seems different.

Alternatively, maybe I need to find the minimum and maximum values and see their XOR.

But that might not necessarily give the maximum XOR.

Wait, perhaps the maximum XOR is between the minimum and maximum values in the permutation.

In the example, p_0=0 and p_1=3, their XOR is 3, which is the maximum possible for n=4, since 3 is 11 in binary, and 0 is 00, XOR is 11 which is 3.

For n=4, the maximum possible XOR is 3.

Similarly, for n=2, it's 1 XOR 0 = 1.

So, perhaps finding the minimum and maximum values and XORing them gives the maximum XOR.

Is that always the case?

Let's consider n=3, p=[0,1,2].

Possible XORs:

0 XOR 1 = 1

0 XOR 2 = 2

1 XOR 2 = 3

So, the maximum is 3, which is between 1 and 2.

But according to my earlier assumption, between min=0 and max=2, XOR is 2, which is less than 3.

Hence, my assumption is wrong.

So, finding min and max doesn't always give the maximum XOR.

Hence, the reference solution must be doing something else.

Wait, perhaps the reference solution is finding two maximum values that differ as much as possible in their higher bits.

But I'm still not sure.

Looking back at the reference solution:

- It finds ans1 as the index of the maximum p_i.

- Then, it considers all i where (p_mx OR p_ans1) == (p_i OR p_ans1), which, as I thought, is all i.

- Then, it finds the maximum p_i in v, which is p_ans1.

- Hence, it's choosing (ans1, ans1), which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, it's choosing (3,2), which is correct.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, maybe ans1 is not the index of the maximum p_i, but something else.

Wait, in the code, ans1 is initialized to 0, and then for i from 1 to n-1, it compares p_ans1 with p_i and updates ans1 if p_ans1 < p_i.

Hence, ans1 is indeed the index of the maximum p_i.

Then, in the second loop, it sets mx to 0, v to [0].

For each i from 1 to n-1, it compares (p_mx OR p_ans1) with (p_i OR p_ans1).

If (p_mx OR p_ans1) < (p_i OR p_ans1), it sets mx to i and resets v to [i].

Else if equal, appends i to v.

Given that p_ans1 is the maximum p_i, p_i OR p_ans1 is p_ans1 for all i.

Hence, (p_mx OR p_ans1) is p_ans1, and (p_i OR p_ans1) is p_ans1 for all i.

Hence, all comparisons are "=", and v includes all i.

Then, it sets mx to v[0], which is 0, and ans to v[0], which is 0.

Then, it compares p_ans with p_v[i] for each i in v to find the maximum p_v[i], which is p_ans1.

Hence, ans becomes ans1.

Then, it prints "! ans ans1", which is (ans1, ans1), which is incorrect.

But in the example, it's printing "! 3 2", which suggests that ans=3 and ans1=2.

Wait, perhaps in the example, ans1=1 (index of p=3), and then v includes all indices, and then it finds ans=3.

Wait, I need to trace the example step by step.

Given n=4, p=[0,3,1,2].

First loop:

ans1=0

Compare p_0 OR p_0 =0 with p_1 OR p_1=3: 0 < 3, so ans1=1

Compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_2 OR p_2=1: 3 > 1, ans1 remains 1

Compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_3 OR p_3=2: 3 > 2, ans1 remains 1

Hence, ans1=1

Then, set mx=0, v=[0]

For i=1:

Compare (p_0 OR p_1)=0 OR 3=3 with (p_1 OR p_1)=3: "=", append 1 to v, v=[0,1]

For i=2:

Compare (p_0 OR p_1)=3 with (p_2 OR p_1)=1 OR 3=3: "=", append 2 to v, v=[0,1,2]

For i=3:

Compare (p_0 OR p_1)=3 with (p_3 OR p_1)=2 OR 3=3: "=", append 3 to v, v=[0,1,2,3]

Then, set mx=v[0]=0, ans=0

Compare p_0 OR p_0=0 with p_0 OR p_0=0: "=", ans remains 0

Compare p_0 OR p_0=0 with p_1 OR p_1=3: 0 < 3, ans=1

Compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_2 OR p_2=1: 3 > 1, ans remains 1

Compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_3 OR p_3=2: 3 > 2, ans remains 1

Hence, ans=1

Then, print "! 1 0"

But in the example, it's printing "! 3 2"

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the reference solution.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says:

"In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 | p_2) = (0 | 1) =1 < (p_3 | p_1) = (2 | 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 | p_1) = (3| 3)= 3 = (p_2 | p_3) = (1 | 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 | p_2) = (3 | 1) = 3 > (p_0 | p_3) = (0|2)=2 .

The answer i=3 and j=2 is valid: (p_3 ⊕ p_2)=(2⊕1)=3 is indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i ⊕ p_j . Another valid answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 , the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n=2 , so p is either [0,1] or [1,0] . In any case, p_0 ⊕ p_1=1 is maximum possible."

Hence, in the first test case, the jury's response suggests that p=[0,3,1,2], and the expected output is "! 3 2"

But according to the reference solution, it's printing "! 1 0", which corresponds to p_1=3 and p_0=0, whose XOR is 3, which is correct.

Hence, both "! 1 0" and "! 3 2" are acceptable since both give XOR=3, which is the maximum.

Hence, the reference solution is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find a pair of indices in a secret permutation that maximizes their bitwise XOR value, using a limited number of queries that compare bitwise OR operations.

### Approach

1. **Finding the Index of the Maximum Value:**
   - We iterate through the permutation to find the index of the maximum value by comparing each element with the current maximum using the OR operation.

2. **Finding Candidates for the Second Index:**
   - We then find indices that, when combined with the maximum value using OR, give comparable results. This helps in filtering potential candidates for the second index.

3. **Selecting the Optimal Pair:**
   - From the filtered candidates, we select the pair that gives the maximum XOR value.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        ans1 = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)
            if x == '<':
                ans1 = i
        mx = 0
        v = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            x = func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)
            if x == '<':
                v = []
                mx = i
                v.append(i)
            elif x == '=':
                v.append(i)
        mx = v[0]
        ans = v[0]
        for i in range(1, len(v)):
            x = func_1(ans, ans, v[i], v[i])
            if x == '>':
                ans = v[i]
        print('!', ans, ans1)

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    return input().strip()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Index of the Maximum Value:**
   - We start by assuming the first element is the maximum and iterate through the array, comparing each element with the current maximum using the OR operation. If we find an element that is greater, we update our maximum index.

2. **Finding Candidates for the Second Index:**
   - We then compare the OR of the current maximum with another element to filter potential candidates that could give us the maximum XOR when paired with the maximum value.

3. **Selecting the Optimal Pair:**
   - From the filtered candidates, we select the pair that gives the highest XOR value and output the indices of this pair.

This approach ensures that we stay within the query limits and efficiently find the required pair of indices.
