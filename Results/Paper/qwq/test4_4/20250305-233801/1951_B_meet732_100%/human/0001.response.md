Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand it step by step.

So, there are n cows with unique ratings, each in their initial positions from 1 to n. The tournament works by starting with a match between the first two cows, and then the winner continues to match against the next cow in line, and so on, until all cows have been matched. The winner of each match is the one with the higher rating.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with any other cow only once or choose not to swap at all.

First, I need to simulate the tournament to see how many wins my cow can get in its initial position and then see if swapping it to another position can improve that count.

Let's look at the example provided:

Test case 1:

n = 6, k = 1

ratings = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

So, cow k=1 has rating 12.

The matches proceed as follows:

1. Match between cow 1 (12) and cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

2. Match between cow 1 (12) and cow 3 (14): cow 3 wins.

Tournament ends here for cow 1. So, cow 1 wins only 1 match.

But the problem says it's optimal to do nothing, which matches this outcome.

Test case 2:

n = 6, k = 5

ratings = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

Cow k=5 has rating 12.

If we swap cow 5 with cow 3 (rating 727), then:

New order: [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

Matches:

1. Match between cow 1 (7) and cow 2 (2): cow 1 wins.

2. Match between cow 1 (7) and cow 3 (12): cow 3 wins.

3. Match between cow 3 (12) and cow 4 (10): cow 3 wins.

4. Match between cow 3 (12) and cow 5 (727): cow 5 wins.

So, cow 3 wins 2 matches.

Wait, but in the explanation, they swapped cow 5 to position 3, making the new order [7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13], and cow 3 (now my cow) wins 2 matches.

But in this case, cow k=5 is now in position 3, and we're tracking its wins.

I need to make sure I understand that.

Another test case:

n=2, k=2

ratings=[1000000000, 1]

So, cow k=2 has rating 1.

Matches:

1. Match between cow 1 (1000000000) and cow 2 (1): cow 1 wins.

Tournament ends. Cow 2 wins 0 matches.

It's clear that if I don't swap, cow k=2 stays and loses immediately.

If I swap cow 2 with cow 1, then cow 2 (rating 1) is in position 1, and cow 1 (rating 1000000000) is in position 2.

Matches:

1. Match between cow 1 (1) and cow 2 (1000000000): cow 2 wins.

Tournament ends. Cow 1 (my cow, now in position 2) wins 1 match.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 0. So perhaps I misread.

Wait, no, the sample output is 0 for this case, meaning that even after swapping, my cow doesn't win any matches.

Wait, but in my simulation, if I swap cow 2 with cow 1, then cow 2 (rating 1) is in position 1 and cow 1 (rating 1000000000) is in position 2.

Match 1: cow 1 (1) vs cow 2 (1000000000): cow 2 wins.

So, cow 1 (my cow, rating 1000000000) wins 1 match.

But the sample output is 0, which contradicts my simulation.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood which cow is mine after swapping.

Wait, k=2 means I own cow 2, which after swapping, is now in position 1 with rating 1.

So, in this case, cow 1 (rating 1) vs cow 2 (rating 1000000000): cow 2 wins.

Then, cow 2 (rating 1000000000) vs cow 3 (doesn't exist), so tournament ends. Cow 1 (my cow, rating 1) didn't win any matches.

So, sample output is 0, which matches this.

I see, so I need to be careful about which cow I own after swapping.

Now, I need to find a general way to maximize the number of wins for my cow k.

First, let's think about the tournament structure.

The tournament is a sequence of matches where:

- The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2.

- The winner of the first match plays against cow 3.

- The winner of that plays against cow 4.

- And so on, until all cows have been matched.

Essentially, it's a single elimination tournament where the winner continues.

Now, I want to position my cow k in such a way that it wins as many matches as possible before losing.

Since the cow with the higher rating always wins, I need to place my cow in a position where it faces weaker cows as much as possible.

Optionally, I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow once or choose not to swap.

So, I need to decide whether to swap and, if so, with which cow, to maximize the number of wins for my cow.

Let's consider the initial position.

In the initial position, cow k is in position k.

I need to see how many wins it can get from there.

Then, consider swapping it with some other cow j, and see how many wins it can get in position j.

I need to choose the option that gives the maximum number of wins.

Now, how to compute the number of wins for a given position.

Given that the tournament is a sequence of matches where the winner continues, the number of wins for a cow in a particular position is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that come before it in the sequence.

Wait, perhaps not exactly.

Actually, it's more about how many cows with lower ratings it can defeat before facing a stronger cow.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings in the sequence starting from its position.

But it's not that straightforward because the sequence progresses by matching the winner against the next cow.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow, say position p.

Then, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows between position 1 and p (exclusive) that have lower ratings than my cow, provided that my cow wins all those matches.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure, the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2.

The winner of that matches against cow 3.

The winner of that matches against cow 4.

And so on, until cow n.

So, the matches are sequential, with the winner continuing to the next match.

Therefore, for my cow to participate in as many matches as possible, it needs to be in a position where it can win against the previous winner.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a tournament tree.

But in this case, it's a specific kind of tournament where it's a linear sequence, not a binary tree.

Let me try to simulate it with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=6, k=1, ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

Cow k=1 has rating 12.

Matches:

1. Cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

2. Cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14): cow 3 wins.

Tournament ends for cow 1 after 1 win.

If I swap cow 1 with cow 3 (rating 14):

New order: [14,10,12,11,8,3]

Matches:

1. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

2. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 3 (12): cow 1 wins.

3. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 4 (11): cow 1 wins.

4. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 5 (8): cow 1 wins.

5. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 6 (3): cow 1 wins.

So, cow 1 wins all 5 matches.

But cow k=1 originally had rating 12, not 14, so if I swap, my cow (original k=1, rating 12) is now in position 3.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, if I swap cow k=1 (rating 12) with cow 3 (rating 12), then the ratings remain the same, which doesn't make sense because all ratings are unique.

Wait, in the first test case, ratings are [12,10,14,11,8,3], all unique.

Wait, but cow k=1 has rating 12, and cow 3 has rating 14.

If I swap cow k=1 with cow 3, then:

New order: [14,10,12,11,8,3]

Now, my cow is in position 3, with rating 12.

Matches:

1. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

2. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 3 (12): cow 1 wins.

3. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 4 (11): cow 1 wins.

4. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 5 (8): cow 1 wins.

5. Cow 1 (14) vs cow 6 (3): cow 1 wins.

So, my cow in position 3 (rating 12) didn't win any matches.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's optimal to do nothing, which gives 1 win.

So, swapping doesn't help in this case.

Another way to think about it is that in the initial position, my cow k=1 can win against cow 2 (10), but loses to cow 3 (14).

If I swap with cow m, then my cow k=1 (now in position m) will have to win against the previous winner.

I need to find a position where my cow can win as many matches as possible before losing.

I think a better approach is to find the maximum number of consecutive cows with lower ratings before my cow's position, considering that the winner progresses.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place my cow.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings than my cow, provided that the winner reaches p.

But it's not that simple because the winner is determined by the highest rating among the previous matches.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the path my cow takes in the tournament.

Given that the tournament is a sequence of matches where the winner continues, I need to position my cow such that it faces the weakest possible opponents.

In other words, I want to place my cow as early as possible in the sequence, but only if the cows before it have lower ratings.

Wait, but the first match is between cow 1 and cow 2.

The winner of that matches against cow 3, and so on.

So, to maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to place it in a position where it can win against the previous winner and continue winning as much as possible.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Find the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve without swapping.

2. Find the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve by swapping with each possible cow j.

3. Choose the maximum among these options.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, this approach is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings than my cow, provided that the winner reaches p.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings than my cow, minus the number of cows before p that have higher ratings than my cow.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Let me think about it differently.

In the tournament, the winner of each match is the cow with the higher rating.

So, the tournament continues until a cow with a higher rating than my cow is encountered.

Therefore, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it in the sequence that have lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before reaching my cow.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that the tournament is equivalent to a sequence of matches where the winner is the cow with the highest rating among all cows that have participated so far.

Wait, no.

Actually, in each match, the winner is the one with the higher rating between the two cows in that match.

So, the winner of each match has the higher rating among all cows that have participated so far.

Wait, no.

Wait, suppose we have cows with ratings [a1, a2, a3, ..., an].

The first match is between a1 and a2. The winner is max(a1, a2).

Then, the winner matches against a3. The winner is max(max(a1, a2), a3).

And so on, until all cows have been matched.

Therefore, the final winner is the cow with the maximum rating.

But I need to see how many matches my cow can win, not necessarily win the entire tournament.

Wait, in this setup, each cow can participate in at most one match.

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, in this tournament structure, once a cow loses, it's out of the tournament.

But in this problem, it seems that once a cow loses, it's out, and the winner continues to the next match.

So, it's a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match proceeds to the next match.

Therefore, the number of matches a cow can win is equal to its position in the sorted order of ratings minus one.

Wait, no.

Wait, in a single-elimination tournament with n participants, each participant can win up to log2(n) matches, but that's in a binary tournament tree.

In this case, it's a linear tournament where the winner continues to face the next cow.

So, for my cow, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of cows with lower ratings between the current position and the previous higher-rated cow.

Something like that.

This seems similar to calculating the number of cows that can be defeated before facing a stronger one.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to calculating the number of elements that are smaller than the current element and are before it, until a larger element is encountered.

This sounds like it can be modeled using some stack or prefix calculations.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote that for each position i, the number of wins for the cow in position i is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings, provided that there is no cow with a higher rating between them and the current cow.

Wait, no.

Actually, in this tournament structure, the number of wins for a cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it in the sequence and have not been defeated by a higher-rated cow earlier.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where my cow is placed.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings than my cow, provided that none of them have been defeated by a higher-rated cow before reaching my cow.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This seems similar to calculating the number of cows that my cow can defeat in a sequence.

Let me consider that my cow can win against all cows with lower ratings that are before it, until it encounters a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows before it with lower ratings, ignoring any higher-rated cows that would have defeated them earlier.

This is still confusing.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can precompute for each position, the maximum rating among the cows that have participated up to that point.

Then, for my cow, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of cows before my cow that have lower ratings and are not part of a previous match where a higher-rated cow won.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think about it in terms of the actual tournament progression.

Suppose I have the sequence of cows in order, and I simulate the tournament.

I need to see how many matches my cow can win, depending on its position.

Optionally, I can swap my cow with one other cow to optimize this.

Given the constraints on time, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case.

But since t can be up to 10^4 and n up to 10^5, total operations would be up to 10^9, which is too slow.

Therefore, I need a smarter approach, perhaps O(n) per test case.

Wait, the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5, so O(n) per test case is acceptable.

Wait, the problem states that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and t <= 10^4.

So, O(n) per test case is acceptable.

Now, back to the problem.

I need to maximize the number of wins for my cow k.

I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow or do nothing.

I need to find the best position for my cow to maximize its wins.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that it can defeat before facing a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position, the number of cows with lower ratings before it, considering the higher-rated cows.

This sounds like calculating, for each cow, the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it and not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This can be done using a prefix maximum array.

Let me try to formalize it.

For each position i, keep track of the maximum rating seen so far.

Then, for my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before p with lower ratings than my cow, provided that they are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before reaching my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate, for each position, the number of cows before it with lower ratings and higher than all cows between them and position p.

This is getting too involved.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where my cow is placed.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings than my cow and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow's turn.

In other words, my cow can only win against cows that have lower ratings and are not already defeated by a higher-rated cow.

This seems similar to calculating, for each cow, the number of cows before it with lower ratings that are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This can be computed using a stack or by keeping track of the maximum rating seen so far.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each position, the number of cows before it with lower ratings that are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

Let me try to implement this idea.

First, I need to iterate through the sequence and keep track of the maximum rating seen so far.

For each cow, if its rating is higher than the maximum seen so far, it can defeat all previous cows.

Otherwise, it can only defeat the cows with lower ratings that have not been defeated yet.

This seems tricky to implement efficiently.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not part of a previous match where a higher-rated cow won.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow's turn.

This seems similar to calculating, for each cow, the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This can be done using a prefix array that keeps track of the maximum rating seen so far.

Let me try to formalize it.

Initialize a variable max_so_far to 0.

Initialize a list wins of size n, all zeros.

Iterate through the cows from left to right:

if a[i] > max_so_far:

wins[i] = i  # can defeat all previous cows

else:

wins[i] = upper_bound of a[i] in a[0..i-1]

Wait, no.

Actually, for each cow i, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before it.

This is equivalent to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This can be calculated using a stack to keep track of the cows that are still alive in the tournament.

Wait, perhaps using a stack is a good idea.

Let me try to implement this.

Use a stack to keep track of the cows that have not been defeated yet.

Initialize an empty stack.

Iterate through the cows from left to right:

while stack is not empty and stack.top() < a[i]:

pop from stack

wins[i] = number of pops

push a[i] onto stack

Then, for each cow i, wins[i] is equal to the number of cows popped when processing cow i.

But I'm not sure if this directly applies to the problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of cows that my cow can defeat before being defeated.

Let me consider that for my cow to win k matches, it needs to defeat k cows with lower ratings before facing a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings before it, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, for each position p, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before p with lower ratings than my cow, until a cow with a higher rating is encountered.

This can be computed for each position by finding the number of cows before it with lower ratings that are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This sounds similar to the number of cows that can be defeated in a sequence.

Let me try to implement this.

For each position p, compute the number of cows before p with lower ratings and higher than all cows between them and p.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings, provided that there is no cow with a higher rating between them and my cow.

This can be computed using a stack to keep track of the cows that are potential opponents for my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to find, for each cow, the number of cows before it with lower ratings that are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings, minus the number of cows before it that have higher ratings than my cow.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of cows before it with lower ratings that are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This is similar to finding the number of cows that my cow can defeat directly.

But in reality, my cow can defeat all the cows before it with lower ratings, provided that none of them have been defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow's turn.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where my cow is placed.

Then, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before p with lower ratings that are weaker than all cows between them and p.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of cows before p with lower ratings that are not stronger than any cow between them and p.

This is still confusing.

Let me try to look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

In the first sample input:

n=6, k=1, ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

My cow is in position 1, rating 12.

It wins against cow 2 (10), loses to cow 3 (14).

So, number of wins is 1.

If I swap cow 1 with cow 3 (14), then my cow is in position 3 with rating 12.

The sequence is now [14,10,12,11,8,3]

Matches:

1. 14 vs 10: 14 wins.

2. 14 vs 12: 14 wins.

3. 14 vs 11: 14 wins.

4. 14 vs 8: 14 wins.

5. 14 vs 3: 14 wins.

So, my cow in position 3 with rating 12 didn't win any matches.

If I swap cow 1 with cow 4 (11), then sequence is [11,10,14,12,8,3]

Matches:

1. 11 vs 10: 11 wins.

2. 11 vs 14: 14 wins.

3. 14 vs 12: 14 wins.

4. 14 vs 8: 14 wins.

5. 14 vs 3: 14 wins.

So, my cow in position 4 with rating 12 wins against cow 3 (14)? Wait, no.

Wait, in this sequence, my cow is in position 4 with rating 12.

The matches are:

1. Cow 1 (11) vs cow 2 (10): cow 1 wins.

2. Cow 1 (11) vs cow 3 (14): cow 3 wins.

3. Cow 3 (14) vs cow 4 (12): cow 3 wins.

4. Cow 3 (14) vs cow 5 (8): cow 3 wins.

5. Cow 3 (14) vs cow 6 (3): cow 3 wins.

So, my cow in position 4 with rating 12 didn't win any matches.

Similarly, swapping with other cows doesn't seem beneficial.

Therefore, in this case, it's better to do nothing and have 1 win.

In the second sample input:

n=6, k=5, ratings=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

My cow is in position 5, rating 12.

If I swap cow 5 with cow 3 (727), then sequence becomes [7,2,12,10,727,13]

Matches:

1. 7 vs 2: 7 wins.

2. 7 vs 12: 12 wins.

3. 12 vs 10: 12 wins.

4. 12 vs 727: 727 wins.

5. 727 vs 13: 727 wins.

So, my cow in position 3 with rating 12 wins 2 matches.

Hence, the output is 2.

In the third sample input:

n=2, k=2, ratings=[1000000000,1]

My cow is in position 2, rating 1.

If I don't swap, matches:

1. Cow 1 vs cow 2: cow 1 wins.

So, my cow wins 0 matches.

If I swap cow 2 with cow 1, sequence becomes [1,1000000000]

Matches:

1. Cow 1 vs cow 2: cow 2 wins.

So, my cow in position 1 with rating 1000000000 wins 1 match.

But according to the sample output, it's 0, which suggests that perhaps the problem considers that my cow is the one with index k, and if I swap, my cow moves to the swapped position with its own rating.

Wait, in this case, k=2 has rating 1, and if I swap with cow 1, cow 2 has rating 1000000000, and cow 1 has rating 1.

Then, matches:

1. Cow 1 (1) vs cow 2 (1000000000): cow 2 wins.

So, cow 2 (my cow, rating 1000000000) wins 1 match.

But the sample output is 0, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"You are the owner of cow k. ... As an acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do nothing."

So, you can choose to swap your cow with another cow's position, meaning your cow goes to that position, and the other cow goes to your original position.

Or, you can choose to do nothing.

Then, in the third sample input, n=2, k=2, ratings=[1000000000,1]

If you do nothing:

Matches:

1. Cow 1 (1000000000) vs cow 2 (1): cow 1 wins.

Your cow (k=2, rating 1) wins 0 matches.

If you swap cow 2 with cow 1:

New sequence: [1,1000000000]

Matches:

1. Cow 1 (1) vs cow 2 (1000000000): cow 2 wins.

Your cow (k=2, now in position 1 with rating 1) wins 0 matches.

Wait, but in this case, my cow is in position 1 with rating 1, and it loses to cow 2 (rating 1000000000).

So, my cow doesn't win any matches.

Hence, the sample output is 0.

I must have misread it earlier.

So, in this case, even after swapping, my cow doesn't win any matches.

Hence, the maximum number of wins is 0.

Got it.

So, now I need to find, for each possible swap (including not swapping), the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve.

I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place my cow.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings than my cow and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This seems similar to calculating, for each position p, the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow's turn.

This can be precomputed using a prefix array that keeps track of the maximum rating seen so far.

Let me try to formalize it.

Initialize a variable max_so_far = 0

Initialize a list wins[n]

Iterate through the cows from left to right:

if a[i] > max_so_far:

wins[i] = i  # can defeat all previous cows

else:

wins[i] = upper_bound of a[i] in a[0..i-1]

Wait, no.

Actually, for each position p, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow.

This can be calculated by finding the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This can be done using a stack to keep track of the cows that are still alive in the tournament.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Use a stack to keep track of the cows that have not been defeated yet.

Initialize an empty stack.

Initialize a list wins[n]

Iterate through the cows from left to right:

while stack is not empty and stack.top() < a[i]:

pop from stack

wins[i] += number of pops

push a[i] onto stack

Then, for each position p, wins[p] is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

But I'm not sure if this directly gives the number of wins for my cow.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Let me consider that for each position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow.

This can be calculated by keeping track of the maximum rating seen so far.

Let me try to implement this.

Initialize max_so_far = 0

Initialize a list wins[n]

for each position p from 1 to n:

if a[p-1] > max_so_far:

wins[p] = p

max_so_far = a[p-1]

else:

wins[p] = number of cows before p with a[i] < a[p-1] and a[i] > all a[j] for j between the previous max and p.

This is getting too involved.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the length of the longest prefix of cows with lower ratings that are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

This seems similar to calculating the number of cows that my cow can defeat in sequence before facing a stronger cow.

This can be calculated by finding the number of cows before p with lower ratings and higher than all cows between them and p.

This is similar to calculating the number of cows that are weaker than my cow and not already defeated by a stronger cow.

This seems too complicated to compute efficiently for large n.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that are before it and not defeated by a higher-rated cow.

This can be calculated by finding, for each position p, the number of cows before p with lower ratings that are greater than the maximum rating of the cows between the previous higher-rated cow and p.

This is getting too involved.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings before it, minus the number of cows with higher ratings between them and my cow.

This can be calculated using prefix minimums and suffix maximums.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the previous higher-rated cow for each position.

Yes, that sounds promising.

Let me define for each position p, the position of the previous cow with a higher rating.

This can be computed using a stack.

Then, for each position p, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows between the previous higher-rated cow and p that have lower ratings than my cow.

This seems manageable.

Let me formalize it.

Compute for each position p, the position of the previous cow with a higher rating than a[p-1]. Let's call this prev_higher[p].

Then, the number of wins for my cow at position p is equal to p - prev_higher[p] - 1, provided that a[i] < a[p-1] for all i in (prev_higher[p], p).

But I need to ensure that a[p-1] > a[i] for all i in (prev_higher[p], p).

Since prev_higher[p] is the position of the previous cow with a higher rating, and a[p-1] is greater than all a[i] for i in (prev_higher[p], p), then the number of wins is p - prev_higher[p] - 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament structure, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow.

So, it's equal to p - prev_higher[p] - 1, assuming that a[p-1] > a[i] for all i in (prev_higher[p], p).

But in reality, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

Hence, it's p - prev_higher[p] - 1.

Wait, but in the first sample input, for p=1, prev_higher[1] = -1 (no previous higher-rated cow), so wins[1] = 1 - (-1) - 1 = 1, which matches the first sample where my cow wins 1 match.

For p=3, prev_higher[3] = 1 (cow 1 has rating 12 > cow 3's rating 14), which is not correct because cow 3 has rating 14 > cow 1's rating 12.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the definition.

Let me define prev_higher[p] as the position of the previous cow with a rating higher than a[p-1].

Then, for p=3, a[2]=14, which is higher than a[1]=12, so prev_higher[3]=0 (assuming 0-based indexing).

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first sample input:

n=6, k=1, ratings=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

Compute prev_higher for each position:

- p=1: no previous higher-rated cow, prev_higher[1]=-1

- p=2: a[1]=10 < a[0]=12, prev_higher[2]=1

- p=3: a[2]=14 > a[0]=12, prev_higher[3]=-1

- p=4: a[3]=11 < a[2]=14, prev_higher[4]=3

- p=5: a[4]=8 < a[2]=14, prev_higher[5]=3

- p=6: a[5]=3 < a[2]=14, prev_higher[6]=3

Then, for my cow at p=1, prev_higher[1]=-1, so wins[1] = 1 - (-1) -1 =1, which matches the sample.

For p=3, prev_higher[3]=-1, wins[3]=3 - (-1) -1 =3, but in reality, if my cow is in position 3 with rating 14, it would win against cows 1 and 2, but in the sample, when swapping cow 1 and cow 3, the sequence is [14,10,12,11,8,3], and cow 1 (14) wins against cow 2 (10), then against cow 3 (12), then against cow 4 (11), then against cow 5 (8), then against cow 6 (3). So, my cow in position 3 with rating 12 wins 0 matches.

Wait, this contradicts my earlier assumption.

Hence, my assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, this approach is flawed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow before my cow.

This seems too vague to implement efficiently.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not part of a previous match where a higher-rated cow won.

This is similar to calculating, for each position p, the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not defeated by a higher-rated cow.

This can be calculated using a segment tree or prefix sums, but it's still too slow for the constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings, provided that there are at most one cow with a higher rating before it.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before p that have lower ratings and are not blocked by a higher-rated cow.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the position where my cow can be placed such that there are as many weaker cows before it as possible, while minimizing the number of stronger cows before it.

But this is still not concrete enough.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings, minus the number of cows before it that have higher ratings than my cow.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the position where the number of cows before it with lower ratings is maximized, and there is at most one cow with a higher rating before it.

But in the first sample input, for p=3, there are two cows before it with lower ratings (12 and 10), but cow 1 has rating 12 < cow 3's rating 14, which is not correct because cow 1's rating is actually lower than cow 3's.

Wait, cow 1 has rating 12, cow 3 has rating 14, so cow 1's rating is lower than cow 3's.

Wait, in the first sample input, cow 1 has rating 12, cow 2 has 10, cow 3 has 14.

If I place my cow (rating 12) at position 3, then the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings than my cow's rating.

Cow 1 has rating 12, which is equal to my cow's rating, so it's not lower.

Wait, ratings are unique, so perhaps I need to consider strictly lower ratings.

Wait, in the first sample input, ratings are [12,10,14,11,8,3], all unique.

So, for p=3, my cow has rating 14.

Wait, but in the swap, if I swap cow 1 (rating 12) with cow 3 (rating 14), then my cow is in position 3 with rating 12, and cow 3 is in position 1 with rating 14.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings, provided that the maximum rating among the cows before it is less than my cow's rating.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the tournament, my cow can only win against cows that have lower ratings than itself and are not already defeated by a higher-rated cow.

This seems too involved to compute directly.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows before it that have lower ratings and are not part of a previous match where a higher-rated cow won.

This is similar to calculating, for each position p, the number
