Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n, and he wants to find a number x using binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps on the permutation before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the array so that after the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically requires a sorted array. But here, we're supposed to apply binary search on an unsorted array, which seems tricky. The algorithm described is a bit unusual too. It initializes l to 1 and r to n+1, which is different from the standard binary search where l is 0 and r is n-1.

Let me try to understand the binary search algorithm provided:

1. While r - l != 1:

a. Calculate m as floor((r + l) / 2)

b. If p_m <= x, set l = m

c. Else, set r = m

So, it's adjusting the search range based on whether p_m is less than or equal to x.

The goal is to end up with p_l equal to x after this search. It's guaranteed that two swaps are sufficient, so I need to figure out how to swap elements to achieve this.

Let me think about what the binary search does. In a sorted array, binary search efficiently finds the position where x would be located. But here, the array isn't sorted, and I can make up to two swaps to adjust the positions.

I need to ensure that after the binary search, p_l is equal to x. So, I need to manipulate the array such that after the search process, l points to x.

One approach could be to place x in a position where the binary search algorithm will end up with l pointing to it. But since the array isn't sorted, I need to think differently.

Let me consider the positions that the binary search will check. In a binary search, the indices checked are determined by the mid calculations based on l and r.

Given that l starts at 1 and r at n+1, and m is floor((r + l)/2), the first m would be floor((1 + n+1)/2) = floor((n+2)/2).

For example, if n=6, m=4.

Then, depending on whether p_m <= x or not, it adjusts l or r.

Wait, but the array is unsorted, so p_m could be anything.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look at the examples provided.

Looking at the first test case:

n=6, x=3

arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

pos of 3 is at index 2 (0-based)

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=floor((1+7)/2)=4

p_4=4, which is >3, so r=4

Now, l=1, r=4

m=floor((1+4)/2)=2

p_2=3, which is <=3, so l=2

Now, check if r - l ==1: r=4, l=2 => 2 !=1, so continue

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_3=4, which is >3, so r=3

Now, l=2, r=3

Check if r - l ==1: 1 ==1, stop

So, p_l = p_2 =3, which equals x=3

So, no swaps needed.

Second test case:

n=6, x=5

arr=[3,1,6,5,2,4]

pos of 5 is at index 3

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=floor((1+7)/2)=4

p_4=5, which equals x=5, so l=4

Check r - l ==1: r=7, l=4 =>3 !=1, continue

m=floor((4+7)/2)=5

p_5=2, which is <=5, so l=5

Check r - l ==1: r=7, l=5 =>2 !=1, continue

m=floor((5+7)/2)=6

p_6=4, which is <=5, so l=6

Check r - l ==1: r=7, l=6 =>1 ==1, stop

p_l = p_6=4, which is not equal to x=5

So, need to perform swaps.

Output says 1 swap: 3 4

So, swap indices 2 and 3 (0-based): swap p_2=6 and p_3=5

New array: [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Binary search:

l=1, r=7

m=4

p_4=6 >5, r=4

l=1, r=4

m=2

p_2=5 ==5, l=2

Check r - l ==1: 2 !=1, continue

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_3=6 >5, r=3

l=2, r=3

Check r - l ==1: 1 ==1, stop

p_l = p_2=5, which equals x=5

So, one swap sufficed.

Another test case:

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

pos of 1 is at index 4

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=floor((1+6)/2)=3

p_3=4 >1, r=3

l=1, r=3

m=floor((1+3)/2)=1

p_1=3 >1, r=1

l=1, r=1

Wait, r - l ==0, which is not 1, so maybe the loop stops when r - l ==1

Wait, in the code provided, it's while r - l !=1

So, l=1, r=1: r - l =0 !=1, so exit

p_l = p_1=3 !=1

So, need to perform swaps.

Output: 2 swaps: swap 2 and 4, then swap 1 and 5

Let's see:

First swap: indices 1 and 5 (0-based): swap p_1=5 and p_5=1

New array: [3,1,4,2,5]

Second swap: indices 0 and 3: swap p_0=3 and p_3=2

New array: [2,1,4,3,5]

Binary search:

l=1, r=6

m=3

p_3=4 >1, r=3

l=1, r=3

m=2

p_2=1 <=1, l=2

Check r - l ==1: r=3, l=2 =>1 ==1, stop

p_l = p_2=1, which equals x=1

So, two swaps sufficed.

From these examples, it seems that by swapping elements, I can adjust the array so that the binary search ends up with p_l equal to x.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it does.

It reads t test cases.

For each test case, it reads n and x, then reads the permutation array.

It finds the position pos of x in the array.

Then it initializes low and high for the binary search.

It simulates the binary search, keeping track of the indices checked.

Finally, if p_l equals x, it prints 0 (no swaps needed), else it prints 1 and swaps low+1 with pos+1.

Wait, but in the second test case, it only performed one swap, which was enough.

But in the third test case, it would need two swaps.

So, maybe this program isn't always correct.

Wait, let's see.

In the second test case, it would perform one swap: swap low+1 (which is 2) with pos+1 (which is 4), which is what was done in the example.

In the third test case, it would perform one swap: swap low+1 (which is 2) with pos+1 (which is 5), but in the example, two swaps were performed.

So, perhaps one swap isn't always sufficient.

Wait, but the problem says that two swaps are always sufficient, but doesn't require minimizing the number of swaps.

So, the program should output up to two swaps.

But in this program, it only performs one swap if necessary.

Wait, in the code, if p_l equals x, it prints 0, else prints 1 and swaps low+1 with pos+1.

But in the third test case, after one swap, p_l might not equal x, so maybe it needs to perform another swap.

But the program only performs one swap in that case.

So, perhaps it's incorrect.

Looking back at the examples, in the third test case, two swaps were performed, but according to this program, it would only perform one swap.

So, perhaps it's not always correct.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me look at the program again.

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n - 1)

st = set()

while low + 1 < high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

So, it finds the position of k in the array, simulates the binary search to find low, and if arr[low] equals k, it prints 0, else it prints 1 and swaps low+1 with pos+1.

But, in the third test case, after one swap, arr[low] might not equal k, so it's incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to verify this.

Let's take the third test case:

n=5, x=1

arr=[3,5,4,2,1]

pos of 1 is 4

Binary search:

l=0, r=5

m=floor((0+5)/2)=2

p_2=4 >1, r=2

l=0, r=2

m=floor((0+2)/2)=1

p_1=5 >1, r=1

l=0, r=1

Check r - l ==1: 1 ==1, stop

p_l = p_0=3 !=1

So, need to perform swaps.

The program would perform one swap: swap low+1=1 and pos+1=5

So, swap arr[0] and arr[4]: [1,5,4,2,3]

Now, binary search:

m=floor((0+5)/2)=2

p_2=4 >1, r=2

m=floor((0+2)/2)=1

p_1=5 >1, r=1

Check r - l ==1: 1 ==1, stop

p_l = p_0=1, which equals x=1

So, in this case, one swap sufficed.

But in the original output, two swaps were performed.

So, perhaps one swap is enough in this case, and the program is correct.

Wait, but in the third test case, the output shows two swaps, while the program only performs one swap.

So, maybe the program is correct, and one swap is sufficient, but the example shows two swaps.

But the problem says "don't need to minimize the number of operations," so performing two swaps instead of one is acceptable.

So, perhaps the program is correct, as long as it performs up to two swaps to achieve the goal.

Wait, but in this case, it performs only one swap, which is acceptable.

So, maybe it's correct.

Let me think about another test case.

Consider n=3, x=2

arr=[3,2,1]

pos of 2 is 1

Binary search:

l=0, r=4

m=floor((0+4)/2)=2

p_2=1 <2, l=2

Check r - l ==1: 2 !=1, continue

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_3=2 ==2, l=3

Check r - l ==1: 1 ==1, stop

p_l = p_3=2, which equals x=2

So, no swaps needed.

But the output shows 1 swap: 1 3

Which swaps arr[0] and arr[2]: [1,2,3]

Then, binary search would end up with l=1, p_1=2, which equals x=2.

So, in this case, no swaps are needed, but the program would output 1 swap.

Wait, according to the program:

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low +1, pos +1)

In this case, arr[low]=2 ==x=2, so it would print 0, which matches the last test case in the example.

Wait, in the example, for the last test case, the output is:

1

1 3

But according to the program, it should print 0.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Looking back at the example output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

So, for the last test case, it's performing one swap: 1 3

But according to the program, it should print 0 in this case.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the program.

Looking back at the program:

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n - 1)

st = set()

while low + 1 < high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low + 1, pos + 1)

So, in the last test case, n=3, x=2, arr=[3,2,1]

pos=1

Binary search:

low=0, high=3

m=floor((0+3)/2)=1

p_1=2 <=2, low=1

Check r - l ==1: 2 !=1, continue

m=floor((1+3)/2)=2

p_2=1 <2, low=2

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_2=1 !=2, so it would print 1 and swap low+1=3 with pos+1=2

So, swap arr[2] and arr[1]: [3,1,2]

Then, binary search:

low=0, high=3

m=1

p_1=1 <=2, low=1

m=floor((1+3)/2)=2

p_2=2 <=2, low=2

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_2=2 ==2

So, after one swap, it works.

But in the example, it performed one swap:1 3, which is swap arr[0] and arr[2]: [1,2,3]

Then, binary search would end up with low=1, p_1=2 ==2.

So, both ways work.

So, perhaps the program is correct, as it performs up to one swap to make arr[low] equal to x.

Wait, but in the third test case, the program would perform one swap, but in the example, it performed two swaps.

So, is one swap sufficient in all cases?

According to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient, but the program seems to perform only one swap when necessary.

So, perhaps one swap is sufficient in some cases, and two swaps are needed in others.

But the program only performs one swap.

Wait, but in the third test case, performing one swap seems to be enough, according to my earlier calculation.

So, maybe the program is correct.

Wait, but in the example, two swaps were performed, while one swap sufficed.

So, perhaps performing extra swaps doesn't affect the correctness, as long as arr[low] equals x after the swaps.

So, the program seems correct, as it ensures that after at most one swap, arr[low] equals x.

Wait, but the problem allows up to two swaps.

So, perhaps in some cases, one swap isn't enough.

Wait, but the program only performs one swap.

Is there any case where one swap isn't enough?

Wait, according to the problem, two swaps are always sufficient, but one swap might not be enough in some cases.

So, is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try to find such a case.

Suppose n=4, x=3, arr=[1,4,2,3]

pos of 3 is 3

Binary search:

low=0, high=4

m=floor((0+4)/2)=2

p_2=2 <=3, low=2

m=floor((2+4)/2)=3

p_3=3 <=3, low=3

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_3=3 ==3

So, no swaps needed.

Another case: n=4, x=2, arr=[1,3,4,2]

pos of 2 is 3

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=4 >2, high=2

low=0, high=2

m=1

p_1=3 >2, high=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_0=1 !=2

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the program, it would swap low+1=1 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[0] and arr[3]: [2,3,4,1]

Then, binary search:

m=2

p_2=4 >2, high=2

m=1

p_1=3 >2, high=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_0=2 ==2

So, one swap sufficed.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try n=5, x=3, arr=[5,1,2,4,3]

pos of 3 is 4

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=2 <=3, low=2

m=floor((2+5)/2)=3

p_3=4 >3, high=3

low=2, high=3

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_2=2 !=3

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the program, swap low+1=3 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[2] and arr[4]: [5,1,3,4,2]

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=3 <=3, low=2

m=floor((2+5)/2)=3

p_3=4 >3, high=3

low=2, high=3

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_2=3 ==3

So, one swap sufficed.

Seems like in all these cases, one swap is enough.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me think of n=4, x=2, arr=[4,1,3,2]

pos of 2 is 3

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=3 >2, high=2

low=0, high=2

m=1

p_1=1 <=2, low=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_1=1 !=2

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the program, swap low+1=2 and pos+1=4

Swap arr[1] and arr[3]: [4,2,3,1]

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=3 >2, high=2

m=1

p_1=2 <=2, low=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_1=2 ==2

So, again, one swap sufficed.

Hmm.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try n=5, x=2, arr=[3,5,4,1,2]

pos of 2 is 4

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=4 >2, high=2

low=0, high=2

m=1

p_1=5 >2, high=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_0=3 !=2

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the program, swap low+1=1 and pos+1=5

Swap arr[0] and arr[4]: [2,5,4,1,3]

Binary search:

m=2

p_2=4 >2, high=2

m=1

p_1=5 >2, high=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_0=2 ==2

So, again, one swap sufficed.

Wait, maybe in all cases, one swap is enough.

But the problem says two swaps are always sufficient, implying that one swap might not be enough in some cases.

But in all my attempts, one swap sufficed.

Is there a specific case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try n=6, x=3, arr=[4,5,6,1,2,3]

pos of 3 is 5

Binary search:

m=3

p_3=1 <3, low=3

m=floor((3+6)/2)=4

p_4=2 <3, low=4

Check r - l ==1:2 ==1, stop

p_low = p_4=2 !=3

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the program, swap low+1=5 and pos+1=6

Swap arr[4] and arr[5]: [4,5,6,1,3,2]

Binary search:

m=3

p_3=1 <3, low=3

m=floor((3+6)/2)=4

p_4=3 <=3, low=4

Check r - l ==1:2 ==1, stop

p_low = p_4=3 ==3

So, one swap sufficed.

Still.

Is there a case where one swap isn't enough?

Let me try n=7, x=4, arr=[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

pos of 4 is 6

Binary search:

m=3

p_3=7 >4, high=3

low=0, high=3

m=1

p_1=6 >4, high=1

Check r - l ==1:1 ==1, stop

p_low = p_0=5 !=4

So, need to perform swaps.

According to the program, swap low+1=1 and pos+1=7

Swap arr[0] and arr[6]: [4,6,7,1,2,3,5]

Binary search:

m=3

p_3=1 <4, low=3

m=floor((3+7)/2)=5

p_5=3 <4, low=5

Check r - l ==1:2 ==1, stop

p_low = p_5=3 !=4

So, after one swap, p_low != x, so need another swap.

So, in this case, one swap isn't enough.

But according to the program, it only performs one swap.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, what should be done in this case?

I need to perform two swaps to make p_low equal to x.

So, the program needs to be modified to perform up to two swaps if necessary.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because there are cases where one swap isn't enough, and the program doesn't handle performing two swaps.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given Python program correctly solves the problem of finding a number \( x \) in a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) using a modified binary search algorithm, with the ability to perform up to two swaps on the permutation.

## Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) and
