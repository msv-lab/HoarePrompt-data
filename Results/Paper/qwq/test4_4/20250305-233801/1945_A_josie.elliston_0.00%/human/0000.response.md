Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and there are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

First, I need to understand the preferences:

- Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent.

- Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

- Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, I should return -1.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the introverts are straightforward. Each one needs their own tent. So, the number of tents required for introverts is simply 'a'.

Next, extroverts need tents with exactly three people, and they must be with two others. So, for each extrovert, we need to have two other people (which can be universals or other extroverts) in the same tent.

Wait, but if an extrovert is in a tent, the tent must have exactly three people, and at least one of them is the extrovert himself, so the other two must be either universals or extroverts.

But, if there are multiple extroverts, can they share a tent together? For example, if there are three extroverts, can they all be in the same tent? Let's see.

If three extroverts are in one tent, that satisfies the condition for each extrovert, since each one is with two others. So, in that case, one tent can accommodate three extroverts.

Similarly, if there are, say, four extroverts, we would need two tents: one with three extroverts and one with one extrovert. But wait, a single extrovert cannot be in a tent alone; they need to be with two others. So, in this case, it's impossible to accommodate four extroverts because the remaining one extrovert cannot be satisfied alone. Hence, in such a scenario, we should return -1.

So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / 3), but only if there are enough people to fill the tents appropriately.

But, we also have universals who are flexible. They can fill in the tents as needed.

So, perhaps, the universals can be used to fill the tents with extroverts to satisfy the condition.

Let's formalize this.

First, calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: a tents.

Then, for extroverts, we need to have ceil(b / 3) tents, but each of these tents must have exactly three people, with at least one extrovert per tent.

Wait, no. Actually, the condition is that any tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

But, a tent can also have only universals, with one, two, or three of them.

So, the total number of people is a + b + c.

The total number of tents needed is at least a (for introverts) plus ceil((b + c) / 3), but we need to ensure that the extroverts' conditions are met.

Wait, maybe it's better to first assign the introverts their own tents, and then deal with the extroverts and universals.

So, after assigning a tents for introverts, we have b extroverts and c universals left to be placed into tents, with each tent holding up to 3 people, and any tent with at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, the remaining people are b extroverts and c universals, to be placed into tents of up to 3 people, with the constraint that any tent having at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

Moreover, universals are flexible, so they can fill in as needed.

So, I need to group the b extroverts and c universals into tents, where:

- Each tent has up to 3 people.

- If a tent has at least one extrovert, it must have exactly three people.

- Universals can be in tents with 1, 2, or 3 people.

My aim is to minimize the number of tents.

This sounds like a problem of grouping people with certain constraints.

Let me consider the extroverts first since they have stricter requirements.

Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.

So, for b extroverts, they require b "pairs" of others (since each extrovert needs two others in their tent).

But, these "others" can be either universals or other extroverts.

Wait, but if a tent has three extroverts, that satisfies all three extroverts' requirements, since each is with two others.

Similarly, a tent with two extroverts and one universal also satisfies both extroverts' requirements.

Or a tent with one extrovert and two universals.

But, a tent cannot have only one extrovert and one universal, because the extrovert needs two others.

So, in summary, for extroverts, the possible tent compositions are:

- Three extroverts.

- Two extroverts and one universal.

- One extrovert and two universals.

In all these cases, the tent has exactly three people, and the extroverts are with two others.

The universals can be in any tent composition, including being alone or with one or two others.

So, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts placed in tents with three people.

But, since extroverts need to be in tents with exactly three people, and universals can fill in as needed, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

However, I need to ensure that there are enough universals to fill the tents appropriately.

Let's calculate the number of universals required.

If I have b extroverts, and I group them into tents of three, then for each tent of three extroverts, I don't need any universals.

For tents with two extroverts, I need one universal.

For tents with one extrovert, I need two universals.

So, the number of universals needed is equal to the number of tents with two extroverts times one plus the number of tents with one extrovert times two.

My aim is to minimize the number of tents, which means maximizing the number of tents with three extroverts.

So, let's see.

Let’s denote the number of tents with three extroverts as t3.

The number of tents with two extroverts as t2.

The number of tents with one extrovert as t1.

Then, we have:

t3 + t2 + t1 = total number of tents for extroverts.

And,

3 * t3 + 2 * t2 + 1 * t1 = b (since each t3 tent takes three extroverts, each t2 takes two, and each t1 takes one).

Also, the number of universals needed is:

u = 1 * t2 + 2 * t1.

My aim is to minimize t3 + t2 + t1, which is equivalent to minimizing the number of tents.

To minimize t3 + t2 + t1, given that 3 * t3 + 2 * t2 + t1 = b, and u = t2 + 2 * t1 <= c.

This seems like an optimization problem.

But perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let’s consider that to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize t3, the number of tents with three extroverts.

So, set t3 as large as possible, then set t2, and then t1.

Let me try to express this mathematically.

Let’s set t3 = floor(b / 3).

Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 3 * t3.

Then, set t2 = floor((b - 3 * t3) / 2).

Then, t1 = b - 3 * t3 - 2 * t2.

Then, the total number of tents is t3 + t2 + t1.

But, we need to ensure that the number of universals required, u = t2 + 2 * t1, is less than or equal to c.

Wait, but this might not be the most efficient way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I group as many extroverts as possible into tents of three.

So, t3 = floor(b / 3).

Then, the remaining extroverts are b % 3.

If b % 3 == 0, then t3 = b / 3, and t2 = t1 = 0.

If b % 3 == 1, then t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1, and t2 = 1, and t1 = 0.

Wait, no.

Wait, if b % 3 == 1, then after taking as many t3 as possible, we have one extrovert left.

But, one extrovert needs two others, so we need to have t1 = 1, which requires two universals.

Alternatively, we can adjust the previous t3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts, considering the universals available.

Let me consider that each tent for extroverts requires:

- If it's a t3 tent, it requires 3 extroverts and 0 universals.

- If it's a t2 tent, it requires 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

- If it's a t1 tent, it requires 1 extrovert and 2 universals.

So, the total number of extroverts used is 3 * t3 + 2 * t2 + t1 = b.

The total number of universals used is t2 + 2 * t1 <= c.

The total number of tents is t3 + t2 + t1.

Our aim is to minimize t3 + t2 + t1, given that 3 * t3 + 2 * t2 + t1 = b and t2 + 2 * t1 <= c.

This seems like a linear programming problem, but since we're dealing with integers and possibly large values (up to 1e9), we need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps there's a way to express t3 + t2 + t1 in terms of b and c.

Let me think about the minimal number of tents for extroverts.

If we maximize t3, then t3 = floor(b / 3), and the remaining extroverts are b % 3.

If b % 3 == 0, then t3 = b / 3, and t2 = t1 = 0.

If b % 3 == 1, then we can set t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1, and t2 = 1, and t1 = 0.

Wait, let's see:

With t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1, we have 3 * (floor(b / 3) - 1) extroverts in t3 tents.

Then, the remaining extroverts are b - 3 * (floor(b / 3) - 1) = b - 3 * floor(b / 3) + 3 = (b % 3) + 3.

But b % 3 == 1, so it's 1 + 3 = 4 extroverts left.

Then, with t2 = 1, that takes 2 extroverts, leaving 2 extroverts.

Then, t1 = 1 for the remaining 2 extroverts.

Wait, but t1 requires 1 extrovert and 2 universals, but we have 2 extroverts left, which doesn't fit.

This seems messy.

Maybe a better approach is to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts, considering the universals as a resource to fill in.

Let’s consider that the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

Each of these tents will have:

- If the tent has three extroverts, it uses 3 extroverts and 0 universals.

- If the tent has two extroverts and one universal, it uses 2 extroverts and 1 universal.

- If the tent has one extrovert and two universals, it uses 1 extrovert and 2 universals.

Our aim is to minimize the total number of tents, which is a (for introverts) plus the number of tents for extroverts and universals.

But, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents that have three people.

So, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, then use tents with two extroverts and one universal, and finally, if needed, use tents with one extrovert and two universals.

But, we need to ensure that the number of universals required does not exceed c.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s compute the minimal number of tents for extroverts and universals.

Define:

- Let t = ceil(b / 3). This is the minimal number of tents needed for extroverts if we ignore the universal constraints.

But, we need to ensure that the universals are sufficient to fill the tents appropriately.

Now, in these t tents, some will have three extroverts (using 3 extroverts and 0 universals), some will have two extroverts and one universal (using 2 extroverts and 1 universal), and some will have one extrovert and two universals (using 1 extrovert and 2 universals).

Our aim is to minimize t, which is ceil(b / 3), and ensure that the universals required do not exceed c.

Wait, but ceil(b / 3) is the minimal number of tents needed for extroverts, assuming we have enough universals to fill the tents.

So, perhaps the approach is:

- Compute t = ceil(b / 3).

- Compute the number of universals required based on how the tents are filled.

- Adjust based on the available c universals.

But, to minimize t, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts, which don't require any universals.

So, let’s compute:

- Let t3 = floor(b / 3).

- Let remaining_b = b - 3 * t3.

- Then, if remaining_b == 0, then t = t3, and u_required = 0.

- If remaining_b == 1, then we can't have a tent with just one extrovert; we need at least two others with him. So, we need to have t1 = 1, which requires two universals. So, t = t3 + 1, and u_required = 2.

- But, wait, if remaining_b == 1, we can adjust by reducing t3 by 1 and making t2 = 1 and t1 = 0.

Wait, let's see:

If t3 = floor(b / 3), and remaining_b = b % 3.

If remaining_b == 0, then t = t3, u_required = 0.

If remaining_b == 1, then we can set t3 = t3 - 1, t2 = 1, t1 = 0.

Because, t3 - 1 tents with three extroverts, and one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

Wait, but if t3 = floor(b / 3), and remaining_b = 1, then b = 3 * t3 + 1.

If we set t3 = t3 - 1, then we have t3 - 1 tents with three extroverts, using 3 * (t3 - 1) extroverts.

Then, remaining extroverts = b - 3 * (t3 - 1) = 3 * t3 + 1 - 3 * (t3 - 1) = 3 * t3 + 1 - 3 * t3 + 3 = 4.

Then, with t2 = 1, that takes 2 extroverts, leaving 2 extroverts.

Then, t1 = 1 for the remaining 2 extroverts.

Wait, but t1 requires 1 extrovert and 2 universals.

So, in total:

t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1

t2 = 1

t1 = 1

Total tents: t3 - 1 + 1 + 1 = t3 + 1

Universals required: t2 * 1 + t1 * 2 = 1 * 1 + 1 * 2 = 3

But, in this case, we have t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1, which might not be non-negative.

Wait, perhaps this isn't the right approach.

Let me look for a better way.

I recall that in similar problems, it's useful to compute the remainder when b is divided by 3.

So, let’s set t = ceil(b / 3). This is the minimal number of tents needed for extroverts.

Now, the number of universals required is equal to t - floor(b / 3).

Because:

- For each full tent of three extroverts, we don't need any universals.

- For each tent that isn't full (i.e., has two or one extrovert), we need one or two universals, respectively.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the number of universals required based on the remainder.

Let’s consider:

- If b % 3 == 0, then t = b / 3, and u_required = 0.

- If b % 3 == 1, then t = ceil(b / 3) = floor(b / 3) + 1.

In this case, we can have t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1 tents with three extroverts.

Then, t2 = 1 tent with two extroverts and one universal.

And t1 = 1 tent with one extrovert and two universals.

Wait, but t3 = floor(b / 3) - 1 might be negative.

This seems complicated.

Maybe a better way is to compute the minimal number of tents t = ceil(b / 3).

Then, the number of universals required is t - floor(b / 3).

Wait, in the case where b % 3 == 0, u_required = 0.

When b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2.

When b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1.

Let’s verify this.

Case 1: b % 3 == 0

- t = b / 3

- u_required = 0

Case 2: b % 3 == 1

- t = ceil(b / 3) = floor(b / 3) + 1

- u_required = 2

Case 3: b % 3 == 2

- t = ceil(b / 3) = floor(b / 3) + 1

- u_required = 1

Let’s check with some examples.

Example 1:

b = 1

t = ceil(1 / 3) = 1

u_required = 2

Because the single extrovert needs two universals.

Example 2:

b = 2

t = ceil(2 / 3) = 1

u_required = 1

Because we can have one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

Example 3:

b = 3

t = ceil(3 / 3) = 1

u_required = 0

Because we can have one tent with three extroverts.

Example 4:

b = 4

t = ceil(4 / 3) = 2

u_required = 2

Because we can have one tent with three extroverts and one tent with one extrovert and two universals.

Wait, but in this case, u_required = 2.

Alternatively, we can have two tents with two extroverts and one universal each, but that would require two universals as well.

So, in general, it seems that:

- If b % 3 == 0, u_required = 0

- If b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2

- If b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1

Wait, but in the case where b = 4, which is b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2, as in the example above.

Similarly, for b = 5:

t = ceil(5 / 3) = 2

We can have one tent with three extroverts and one tent with two extroverts and one universal.

So, u_required = 1.

Wait, but according to the earlier rule, for b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1.

Wait, but b = 5 % 3 = 2, so u_required = 1.

Wait, but in the earlier example with b = 4, which is b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2.

Wait, but in b = 5, which is b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If b % 3 == 0, u_required = 0

- If b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2

- If b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1

But in the case of b = 4, which is b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2.

For b = 5, b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1.

For b = 6, b % 3 == 0, u_required = 0.

Seems consistent.

So, generalizing, u_required = 2 if b % 3 == 1, else 1 if b % 3 == 2, else 0.

Wait, but in the case where b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2.

In other words, u_required = ceil(b / 3) - floor(b / 3).

Wait, no.

Wait, ceil(b / 3) = floor(b / 3) + (1 if b % 3 != 0 else 0)

So, u_required seems to be related to b % 3.

Wait, perhaps u_required = (b % 3 == 1) ? 2 : (b % 3 == 2) ? 1 : 0.

Yes, that seems accurate.

So, in code, it would be something like:

if b % 3 == 0:

u_required = 0

elif b % 3 == 1:

u_required = 2

else:

u_required = 1

Then, to check if it's possible, we need u_required <= c.

If yes, then the total number of tents is a (for introverts) + ceil(b / 3) (for extroverts and some universals).

But, wait, the universals can also be used to fill tents on their own.

So, after assigning the necessary universals to satisfy the extroverts, the remaining universals can be placed in tents on their own or shared with others.

But, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of universals placed in tents with extroverts.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, we calculate u_required based on the extroverts' tents, and ensure that c >= u_required.

Then, the remaining universals, c - u_required, can be placed in their own tents or shared with others.

But, since our aim is to minimize the number of tents, we should place as many universals as possible in the extroverts' tents to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, u_required is the number of universals needed to satisfy the extroverts' tents.

Then, the remaining universals can be placed in their own tents, either alone, in pairs, or in triples.

But, since our aim is to minimize the number of tents, we should place as many universals as possible in tents that already have extroverts, but in this problem, the extroverts' tents must have exactly three people if they contain at least one extrovert.

So, in other words, any tent with extroverts must have exactly three people, but tents with only universals can have 1, 2, or 3 people.

So, after satisfying the extroverts' tents, the remaining universals can be placed in tents of up to three people.

Hence, the number of additional tents needed for the remaining universals is ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

Therefore, the total number of tents is a (for introverts) + t (for extroverts and some universals) + ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

But, in the earlier approach, we have t = ceil(b / 3), and u_required based on b % 3.

But, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of tents is a (for introverts) + ceil((b + c) / 3).

But, we need to ensure that the extroverts' conditions are met.

Wait, no, because the extroverts need to be in tents with exactly three people, but the universals can be in tents with fewer people.

So, perhaps it's better to first assign the introverts their own tents, then group the extroverts and universals into tents of up to three people, with the constraint that any tent with at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as:

- The total number of tents is a (for introverts) plus the number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals.

- For the extroverts and universals, we need to group them into tents of up to three people, with the condition that any tent with at least one extrovert has exactly three people.

- Moreover, we need to minimize the number of tents.

This seems similar to covering the extroverts with tents of three people, and using the universals to fill in as needed.

I recall a similar problem where we need to cover items with containers of fixed sizes, with some constraints.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of universals required to satisfy the extroverts.

Let’s define that.

Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.

These two others can be extroverts or universals.

So, for b extroverts, they collectively need 2 * b "slots" with others.

But, each universal can fill in for two extroverts (since one universal can be in a tent with two extroverts).

Wait, no.

Actually, each universal can be in a tent with up to two extroverts.

Wait, but in terms of slots:

Each extrovert needs two slots with others.

Each universal can provide up to two slots (since they can be in a tent with up to two extroverts).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of graph theory, where extroverts need to be connected to two others, and universals can connect to up to two extroverts.

But, that might be overcomplicating.

Let me try to find a formula.

Suppose we have b extroverts and c universals.

We need to satisfy that each extrovert is paired with two others.

This is similar to covering the extroverts with triples, where each triple contains at least one extrovert.

But, this seems complicated for large values of b and c.

Perhaps a better approach is to compute the minimal number of tents needed for extroverts, considering the universals as a resource to fill in.

So, as earlier, t = ceil(b / 3).

Then, compute the number of universals required based on b % 3.

As established:

- If b % 3 == 0, u_required = 0

- If b % 3 == 1, u_required = 2

- If b % 3 == 2, u_required = 1

Then, if c >= u_required, the total number of tents is a + t + ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

But, since the remaining universals can be placed in tents of up to three people, the number of additional tents needed for them is ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

Hence, total tents = a + t + ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

But, perhaps there's a way to combine this.

Wait, but in the initial approach, t already includes some universals.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute t = ceil(b / 3), and then u_required based on b % 3, and then the remaining universals are c - u_required.

Then, these remaining universals can be placed in their own tents, requiring ceil((c - u_required) / 3) tents.

Hence, total tents = a + t + ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

But, we need to make sure that c - u_required >= 0.

So, if c < u_required, it's impossible, and we should return -1.

Otherwise, total tents = a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

But, considering that a is the number of tents for introverts, which are already accounted for, and t is the number of tents for extroverts and some universals, and the remaining universals need their own tents.

Wait, but in reality, the t tents for extroverts might already include some universals.

But, in this approach, u_required is the number of universals needed to satisfy the extroverts' tents.

So, perhaps it's better to calculate t = ceil(b / 3), and u_required based on b % 3.

Then, if c >= u_required, the total number of tents is a + t + ceil((c - u_required) / 3).

Otherwise, it's impossible.

Let me verify this with an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

Compute t = ceil(2 / 3) = 1

u_required = 1 (since 2 % 3 == 2)

Then, c - u_required = 3 - 1 = 2

ceil(2 / 3) = 1

Total tents = 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts and some universals) + 1 (remaining universals) = 3

Which matches the first test case.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

t = ceil(4 / 3) = 2

u_required = 2 (since 4 % 3 == 1)

c - u_required = 1 - 2 = -1 < 0, so impossible, output -1

Which matches the second test case.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2

t = ceil(4 / 3) = 2

u_required = 2

c - u_required = 2 - 2 = 0

ceil(0 / 3) = 0

Total tents = 1 + 2 + 0 = 3

Which matches the third test case.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the second test case, a = 1, b = 4, c = 1

t = ceil(4 / 3) = 2

u_required = 2

c - u_required = -1 < 0, so impossible.

Correct.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1

t = ceil(1 / 3) = 1

u_required = 2 (since 1 % 3 == 1)

c - u_required = 1 - 2 = -1 < 0, impossible.

Which matches the fourth test case.

Another test case:

a = 1, b = 3, c = 2

t = ceil(3 / 3) = 1

u_required = 0

c - u_required = 2 - 0 = 2

ceil(2 / 3) = 1

Total tents = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

Which matches the fifth test case.

Another test case:

a = 19, b = 7, c = 18

t = ceil(7 / 3) = 3

u_required = 1 (since 7 % 3 == 1)

c - u_required = 18 - 1 = 17

ceil(17 / 3) = 6

Total tents = 19 + 3 + 6 = 28

Which matches the sixth test case.

Seems consistent.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

So, in code, we can implement this logic.

But, in the given code, it's implemented slightly differently.

Let’s look at the provided code.

The code defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 calls func_1 with extroverts and universals, and then adds the number of introverts.

If func_1 returns None, it returns -1.

Looking at func_1:

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:

if extroverts % 3 != 0:

if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:

return None

return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

This seems different from my earlier approach.

Let’s see.

It checks if extroverts % 3 != 0, and if so, checks if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3.

If yes, return None, else return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3).

Wait, in my earlier approach, I had u_required based on extroverts % 3.

Let’s see:

- If extroverts % 3 == 0, u_required = 0

- If extroverts % 3 == 1, u_required = 2

- If extroverts % 3 == 2, u_required = 1

So, in func_1, if extroverts % 3 != 0, and extroverts % 3 + universals < 3, return None.

Else, return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

Wait, in my earlier approach, u_required is 2 when extroverts % 3 == 1, and 1 when extroverts % 3 == 2.

So, in func_1, if extroverts % 3 == 1, and universals < 2 (since 1 + universals < 3 => universals < 2), then return None.

Similarly, if extroverts % 3 == 2, and universals < 1 (since 2 + universals < 3 => universals < 1), return None.

Else, return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

Which matches my earlier u_required calculations.

Because, u_required is 2 when extroverts % 3 == 1, and 1 when extroverts % 3 == 2.

Hence, if universals < u_required, return None, else return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

Then, func_2 simply adds the number of introverts tents to this value.

So, total tents = introverts + ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3), provided that universals >= u_required.

Else, return -1.

Which aligns with my earlier approach.

Hence, the given code seems correct.

But, to be thorough, let's verify with some test cases.

Test case 1:

a=1, b=2, c=3

func_1(2,3):

2 % 3 == 2, which is not 0.

2 % 3 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3, so return ceil((2+3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Then, func_2 = a + ret = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the first test case.

Test case 2:

a=1, b=4, c=1

func_1(4,1):

4 % 3 == 1, which is not 0.

1 % 3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so return None

Hence, func_2 returns -1, which matches the second test case.

Test case 3:

a=1, b=4, c=2

func_1(4,2):

4 % 3 == 1

1 + 2 = 3 >= 3, so return ceil((4+2)/3) = ceil(6/3) = 2

Then, func_2 = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the third test case.

Test case 4:

a=1, b=1, c=1

func_1(1,1):

1 % 3 == 1

1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so return None

Hence, func_2 returns -1, which matches the fourth test case.

Test case 5:

a=1, b=3, c=2

func_1(3,2):

3 % 3 == 0, so return ceil((3+2)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2

Then, func_2 = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the fifth test case.

Test case 6:

a=19, b=7, c=18

func_1(7,18):

7 % 3 == 1

1 + 18 = 19 >= 3, so return ceil((7+18)/3) = ceil(25/3) = 9

Then, func_2 = 19 + 9 = 28, which matches the sixth test case.

Test case 7:

a=0, b=0, c=0

func_1(0,0):

0 % 3 == 0, so return ceil(0/3) = 0

Then, func_2 = 0 + 0 = 0, which matches the seventh test case.

Test case 8:

a=7, b=0, c=0

func_1(0,0):

0 % 3 == 0, so return ceil(0/3) = 0

Then, func_2 = 7 + 0 = 7, which matches the eighth test case.

Test case 9:

a=0, b=24, c=0

func_1(24,0):

24 % 3 == 0, so return ceil(24/3) = 8

Then, func_2 = 0 + 8 = 8, which matches the ninth test case.

Test case 10:

a=1000000000, b=1000000000, c=1000000000

func_1(1000000000,1000000000):

1000000000 % 3 == 1

1 + 1000000000 = 1000000001 >= 3, so return ceil((1000000000 + 1000000000)/3) = ceil(2000000000/3) = 666666667

Then, func_2 = 1000000000 + 666666667 = 1666666667, which matches the tenth test case.

All test cases match, so the code seems correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tents required for a group of participants with specific preferences for tent occupancy. The participants include introverts, extroverts, and universals, each with different requirements for their tent arrangements.

### Approach

1. **Introverts:** Each introvert needs their own tent.
2. **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must share a tent with exactly two other people.
3. **Universals:** These participants can adapt to any tent arrangement: alone, with one other, or with two others.

We aim to minimize the total number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences.

### Solution Code

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

# Example usage
for line in '1 2 3\n1 4 1\n1 4 2\n1 1 1\n1 3 2\n19 7 18\n0 0 0\n7 0 0\n0 24 0\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000'.splitlines():
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, line.split(' '))
    print('line:', line)
    print('ret:', func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))
```

### Explanation

1. **Introverts' Tents:** Each introvert requires one tent exclusively for themselves.
2. **Extroverts' Tents:** Extroverts must be in tents with exactly three people, including themselves. Thus, we calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts using ceiling division.
3. **Universals' Flexibility:** Universals can fill in tents with extroverts or be in their own tents. We ensure that there are enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' tent requirements.
4. **Minimum Tents Calculation:** We compute the minimum number of tents required by summing the tents needed for introverts and the adjusted tents for extroverts and universals.

This approach ensures that all preferences are met while minimizing the number of tents used.
