Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they're playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find the sum of the array after both have played optimally.

First, I need to understand the interactions between Alice and Bob. Alice goes first and removes up to k elements. She wants the sum to be as large as possible, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? That way, the remaining elements are as large as possible. But, Bob will then multiply up to x elements by -1, and he wants to minimize the sum. So, he'll probably multiply the largest positive elements by -1 to make them negative, thus reducing the sum.

Wait, but Bob can only multiply up to x elements by -1. So, if Alice removes some elements, Bob can choose to flip up to x of the remaining elements. I need to consider how their actions interact.

Let me think about this step by step.

1. Alice removes up to k elements to maximize the sum.

2. Bob then multiplies up to x elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

I need to find the sum after both have played optimally.

I should consider that Alice knows what Bob will do, and Bob knows how Alice will play. So, Alice needs to remove elements in a way that, even after Bob flips up to x elements, the sum is maximized.

This sounds like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum, considering that Bob will minimize it given her choices.

Let me think about a strategy.

First, if Alice removes the smallest elements, Bob can flip the largest remaining elements to negative, which might not be optimal for Alice.

Alternatively, maybe Alice should remove some elements in such a way that the elements Bob can flip are minimized in their impact.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider sorting the array in descending order. That way, the largest elements are first, and the smallest are last.

If Alice removes the smallest elements, that is, the last k elements, then Bob can flip the first x elements to negative.

But, perhaps Alice can do better by removing some larger elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

Wait, but if Alice removes larger elements, the sum would be smaller, which contradicts her goal of maximizing the sum.

So, maybe removing the smallest elements is indeed the way to go.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements. Then, Bob can flip up to x of the remaining elements to negative.

To minimize the sum, Bob should flip the largest x remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no. If Bob flips the largest x elements to negative, the sum decreases by twice the value of those elements because they go from positive to negative.

So, the sum after Bob's move would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Yes, that makes sense.

But, maybe Alice can do better by removing some elements that would be flipped by Bob.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that Bob would flip.

Let me think about an example.

Take the second test case from the example:

n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: 3,1,2,4

Sorted descending: 4,3,2,1

If Alice removes the smallest element, which is 1, then the remaining elements are 4,3,2.

Bob can flip one of them to negative. To minimize the sum, he should flip the largest one, which is 4, to -4.

So, the sum is -4 + 3 + 2 = 1.

But according to the example, the output is 2, which is different. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the example, the output is 2 for this case. So, perhaps Alice shouldn't remove the smallest element.

Wait, in the explanation, it says that Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, resulting in 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

But according to the problem, Alice can remove up to k=1 elements. So, she has the option to remove one element.

If she removes 1, the sum is -4 + 3 + 2 = 1.

If she doesn't remove any elements, the sum is 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2.

So, Bob will choose to flip 4 to -4 in both cases.

But 2 is larger than 1, so Alice should choose not to remove any elements.

Wait, but according to the problem, Alice wants to maximize the sum, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, in this case, Alice has two options:

- Remove 1: sum = -4 + 3 + 2 = 1

- Remove nothing: sum = 3 + 1 + 2 -4 = 2

- Remove another element, say 2: sum = 3 +1 -4 = 0

- Remove 3: sum =1 +2 -4 = -1

So, the best for Alice is to remove nothing, resulting in a sum of 2.

Therefore, Alice needs to choose the option that maximizes the sum after Bob's move.

So, in this case, not removing any elements is better than removing any single element.

Alright, so perhaps Alice should not always remove the smallest elements.

This complicates things.

Let me think of another approach.

Suppose Alice removes s elements, where s can be from 0 to k.

Then, Bob will flip up to x elements from the remaining n - s elements.

To minimize the sum, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements.

So, for each possible s (from 0 to k), Alice can choose which s elements to remove.

But since the array can be large (n up to 2e5), and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula.

Suppose I sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

If Alice removes s elements, she removes the last s elements.

Then, Bob will flip the first x elements to negative.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it was better for Alice not to remove any elements, even though removing the smallest element seemed logical.

So, perhaps I need to consider different scenarios.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove any s elements, where s <= k.

To maximize the sum after Bob's move, she needs to maximize the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, more precisely, the sum after Bob's move is:

sum of remaining elements - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Because flipping the x largest positive elements to negative reduces the sum by twice their value.

So, the final sum is sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x.

Alice wants to maximize this sum by choosing which s elements to remove (s <= k).

So, she needs to choose s elements to remove such that sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x is maximized.

This seems tricky.

Let me see if I can find a way to compute this efficiently.

First, sort the array in descending order: a1 >= a2 >= ... >= an.

If Alice removes the last s elements, the remaining elements are a1 to a(n-s).

Then, Bob will flip the first x of these to negative.

So, the sum would be sum(a(s+1) to a(n)) - sum(a1 to ax) - sum(a(x+1) to a(s)).

Wait, no.

Wait, if Bob flips the first x elements to negative, then the sum is:

sum(a(s+1) to a(n)) - sum(a(s+1) to a(s+x)) - sum(a(s+x+1) to a(n)).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

If Alice removes s elements, the remaining array is a1 to a(n-s).

Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements, which are a1 to ax, to negative.

So, the sum after Bob's move is:

sum(a(s+1) to a(n)) - sum(a(s+1) to a(s+x)) - sum(a(s+x+1) to a(n)).

Wait, no.

Wait, if Bob flips the first x remaining elements to negative, then:

The sum becomes:

sum(a(s+1) to a(n)) - 2 * sum(a(s+1) to a(s+x)).

Because he flips a(s+1) to a(s+x) to negative.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Bob flips a(s+1) to a(s+x) to negative, then:

The sum is:

- a(s+1) - ... - a(s+x) + a(s+x+1) + ... + a(n).

Wait, no.

Wait, originally, the remaining array is a(s+1) to a(n).

Bob multiplies up to x of them by -1.

To minimize the sum, he should multiply the x largest remaining elements by -1.

Since the array is sorted descending, that would be a(s+1) to a(s+x).

So, the sum becomes:

- a(s+1) - ... - a(s+x) + a(s+x+1) + ... + a(n).

Wait, but in the earlier example, it was 3 +1 +2 -4 = 2.

Wait, in that case, s=0, x=1.

So, remaining elements: 4,3,2,1.

Bob flips 4 to -4.

Sum: 3 +1 +2 -4 = 2.

Yes, matching the example.

So, in general, for s removed elements, the sum after Bob's move is:

sum(a(s+1) to a(n)) - 2 * sum(a(s+1) to a(s+x)).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the sum is:

sum(a(s+1) to a(n)) - 2 * sum(a(s+1) to a(s+x)).

Alice wants to choose s (0 <= s <= k) to maximize this sum.

So, I need to compute, for each s from 0 to k, the sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(a[s+1:s+x]), and choose the maximum among these.

Since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to optimize this.

First, sort the array in descending order.

Compute prefix sums.

Let me define prefix[s] = sum(a[s+1] to a(n)).

And prefix_x[s] = sum(a[s+1] to a(s+x)).

Then, the sum for each s is prefix[s] - 2 * prefix_x[s].

I need to compute this for s from 0 to k, and take the maximum.

To compute prefix[s], I can precompute prefix sums.

Similarly, for prefix_x[s], I can compute the sum of a[s+1] to a[s+x].

Given that the array is sorted descending, a[s+1] to a[s+x] are the largest x elements in the remaining array.

Wait, but x can be up to n, and n is up to 2e5, so I need an efficient way to compute these sums.

Let me think about how to compute prefix[s] and prefix_x[s] efficiently.

If I have the sorted array, I can compute the prefix sums in O(n).

Let me define prefix_sum[i] = sum(a[1] to a[i]).

Then, prefix[s] = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s].

Similarly, prefix_x[s] = prefix_sum(s+x) - prefix_sum(s).

Wait, but I need to handle cases where s+x > n.

In that case, prefix_x[s] should be prefix_sum(n) - prefix_sum(s).

Wait, no.

Wait, if s + x > n, then prefix_x[s] = prefix_sum(n) - prefix_sum(s).

Otherwise, prefix_x[s] = prefix_sum(s+x) - prefix_sum(s).

So, I can define:

prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[1] = a1

prefix_sum[2] = a1 + a2

...

prefix_sum[n] = a1 + a2 + ... + an

Then, prefix[s] = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

prefix_x[s] = prefix_sum[min(s+x, n)] - prefix_sum[s]

So, the sum for each s is:

prefix[s] - 2 * prefix_x[s] = (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) - 2 * (prefix_sum[min(s+x, n)] - prefix_sum[s])

Simplify:

= prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum(s+x) + 2 * prefix_sum[s]

= prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum(s+x)

Wait, but this only holds if s + x <= n.

If s + x > n, then prefix_x[s] = prefix_sum(n) - prefix_sum(s)

So, sum for s is:

prefix[s] - 2 * prefix_x[s] = (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) - 2 * (prefix_sum(n) - prefix_sum(s)) = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum(n) + 2 * prefix_sum(s) = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

So, for s + x <= n:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum[s+x]

For s + x > n:

sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

Alice chooses s from 0 to k to maximize sum_s.

So, I need to compute for each s from 0 to k:

if s + x <= n:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum[s+x]

else:

sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

Then, take the maximum over s from 0 to k.

This seems efficient, as computing prefix_sum takes O(n), and for each s, computing sum_s is O(1).

Given that t is up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, total time should be acceptable.

Now, I need to implement this logic.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, x.

b. Read the array a of n integers.

c. Sort a in descending order.

d. Compute prefix_sum[0..n], where prefix_sum[i] = sum(a[1] to a[i]).

e. Initialize a variable max_sum to store the maximum sum_s.

f. For s from 0 to k:

i. If s + x <= n:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum[s+x]

ii. Else:

sum_s = -prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s]

iii. If sum_s > max_sum, set max_sum = sum_s

g. Print max_sum.

This should work.

Wait, but in the second test case, with n=4, k=1, x=1, a=[3,1,2,4], sorted descending: [4,3,2,1]

prefix_sum:

prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[1] = 4

prefix_sum[2] = 4+3=7

prefix_sum[3] = 7+2=9

prefix_sum[4] = 9+1=10

For s=0:

s + x = 0 +1 =1 <=4

sum_s = 10 + 0 - 2*4 = 10 - 8 = 2

For s=1:

s + x =1 +1=2 <=4

sum_s =10 +4 -2*7=10+4-14=0

So, max_sum is 2, which matches the example.

Another test case: n=1, k=1, x=1, a=[1]

sorted: [1]

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=1

s=0:

s+x=0+1=1<=1

sum_s=1 +0 -2*1=1-2=-1

s=1:

s+x=1+1=2>1

sum_s=-1 +0=-1

max_sum=-1

But in the example, it's 0.

Wait, in the first test case, with n=1, k=1, x=1, a=[1], the output is 0.

But according to this, it's -1.

So, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the problem statement.

Looking back, it says "remove up to k elements", meaning that s can be from 0 to k.

But in the first test case, if s=1, meaning remove 1 element, then the remaining sum is 0, and Bob can't flip anything because there are no elements left.

Wait, the problem says "remove up to k elements", and "multiply up to x elements by -1".

So, if s=k=1, remove 1 element, then the array is empty, and Bob can't flip anything.

So, the sum is 0, which is better than -1.

So, in my earlier calculation, for s=1, sum_s should be 0, not -1.

Wait, in my formula, for s=1, s+x=1+1=2>1, so sum_s=-prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s]=-1 +0=-1, which is incorrect.

But in reality, if s=1, the array is empty, so sum is 0.

So, I need to adjust the formula for the case when s >= n - x.

Wait, no.

Wait, when s + x > n, it means that Bob can flip all remaining elements.

But if s >= n - x, then s + x >= n, meaning Bob can flip all remaining elements.

Wait, more carefully:

If s + x >= n, then Bob can flip all remaining elements.

So, sum_s = sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(a[s+1:n])

= - sum(a[s+1:n])

= - (prefix_sum(n) - prefix_sum(s))

Which matches my earlier formula: -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

But in the case where s >= n, meaning no elements are left, the sum should be 0.

Wait, but s cannot be greater than n.

s is from 0 to k, and k <= n.

So, s can be up to k, which is up to n.

If s >= n, then the array is empty, and sum is 0.

So, in the formula, when s + x >= n, sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

But if s >= n, then sum_s should be 0.

So, I need to handle the case when s >= n separately.

Wait, more precisely, when s >= n, the array is empty, and sum is 0.

But in the formula, when s >= n, sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

But prefix_sum(s) for s > n is undefined.

So, I need to adjust the formula.

Let me define prefix_sum[s] = 0 for s >= n.

But even then, for s >= n, sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + 0 = -prefix_sum(n)

Which is not correct; it should be 0.

So, I need to handle s >= n differently.

Wait, perhaps I should define prefix_sum[s] = 0 for s > n.

And for s >= n - x, sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

But in the case s >= n, sum_s should be 0.

So, perhaps I need to set sum_s = 0 when s >= n.

Wait, but s cannot be greater than n, since s is from 0 to k, and k <= n.

So, when s = n, the array is empty, sum_s = 0.

When s < n:

if s + x <= n:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum[s+x]

else:

sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

Yes, and when s = n, sum_s = 0.

So, in code, after computing sum_s for s from 0 to k, if s = n, set sum_s = 0.

But since k <= n, and s <= k, I need to ensure that when s = n, sum_s = 0.

Wait, but s can be up to k, which is up to n.

So, in the loop from s=0 to s=k, if s = n, set sum_s = 0.

But in practice, s can be from 0 to k, and k <= n.

So, s can be up to n.

But in the problem constraints, n >=1, so s can be up to n.

So, in the code, for s from 0 to k:

if s == n:

sum_s = 0

elif s + x <= n:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s] - 2 * prefix_sum[s+x]

else:

sum_s = -prefix_sum(n) + prefix_sum(s)

Then, take the maximum sum_s over s from 0 to k.

This should work.

Let's verify with the first test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1, a=[1]

sorted: [1]

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=1

for s=0:

s + x =0+1=1 <=1:

sum_s=1 +0 -2*1= -1

for s=1:

s == n, sum_s=0

max_sum = max(-1, 0) = 0, which matches the example.

Good.

Another test case: n=4, k=1, x=1, a=[3,1,2,4]

sorted: [4,3,2,1]

prefix_sum[0]=0

prefix_sum[1]=4

prefix_sum[2]=7

prefix_sum[3]=9

prefix_sum[4]=10

s=0:

sum_s=10 +0 -2*4=2

s=1:

sum_s=-10 +4= -6

But according to earlier reasoning, when s=1, the array is [1,2,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=1+2-4=-1.

But according to the formula, sum_s=-10 +4=-6, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, in the formula, for s=1, s + x=1+1=2<=4, so sum_s=10 +4 -2*7=10+4-14=0

Wait, but in reality, sum should be 3+1+2-4=2, but according to the formula, it's 0.

Wait, no, if s=0, sum_s=10 +0 -2*4=2

if s=1, sum_s=10 +4 -2*7=0

But in reality, if s=1, Alice removes one element, say 1, then the array is [3,2,4], Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=3+2-4=1

But according to the formula, sum_s=0, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Let me re-examine the formula.

sum_s = sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(a[s+1:s+x])

In this case, s=1, a[s+1:n]=[3,2,4], sum=9

sum of a[s+1:s+x]=[3,2], sum=5

So, sum_s=9 - 2*5= -1

But according to the formula, sum_s=10 +4 -2*7=10+4-14=0

Wait, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, sum_s = sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(a[s+1:s+x])

In terms of prefix_sum:

sum(a[s+1:n]) = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

sum(a[s+1:s+x]) = prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s], if s+x <=n

Else, sum(a[s+1:n]) = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

So, sum_s = (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) - 2 * (prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s]) if s + x <=n

Else, sum_s = (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) - 2 * (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) = -prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s]

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, for s=1, x=1, s+x=2<=4

sum_s = (10 -4) - 2*(7-4) =6 -6=0

But in reality, sum should be 3+2-4=1

Wait, inconsistency here.

Perhaps my assumption about which elements Bob flips is incorrect.

Wait, if Alice removes s=1, the smallest element, which is 1, the array becomes [4,3,2]

Bob can flip up to x=1 element, which is 4 to -4

Sum: -4 +3 +2=1

But according to the formula, sum_s=0

So, the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, sum_s = sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(top x elements in a[s+1:n])

In this case, a[s+1:n]=[4,3,2], top x=1 is 4, so sum_s=4+3+2 -2*4=3+2=5-8=-3

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, no, Bob will flip the largest x elements to negative.

So, in this case, sum_s = sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(a[s+1:s+x])

But in reality, sum_s=3+2-4=1

According to the formula: sum_s = (4+3+2) - 2*(4+3)=9-14=-5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob flips the x largest remaining elements.

So, in the array [4,3,2], Bob flips the largest x=1 element, which is 4 to -4.

So, sum_s= -4 +3 +2=1

But according to the formula, sum_s= sum(a[s+1:n]) - 2 * sum(a[s+1:s+x])=9-2*7= -5

Which is not matching.

So, perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after Alice removes s elements, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum will be sum of all remaining elements except the x largest, minus the sum of the x largest.

Because the x largest are flipped to negative.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum after Bob's move = sum of remaining elements - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Yes, that makes sense.

Because flipping the x largest to negative is equivalent to subtracting twice their sum from the total sum of remaining elements.

So, sum_s = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

Which is what I had earlier.

But in this example, sum_remaining=4+3+2=9, sum_top_x=4, so sum_s=9-8=1, which matches the expected sum.

Wait, in this case, the formula gives sum_s=9-8=1, which matches the expected sum.

But earlier, using prefix_sum, I had sum_s=10 +4 -2*7=0, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in translating the formula to prefix_sum.

Let me re-express sum_s in terms of prefix_sum.

sum_s = sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x

sum_remaining = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

sum_top_x = prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s], if s+x <=n

Else, sum_top_x = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

So, sum_s = (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) - 2 * (prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s]) if s+x <=n

Else, sum_s = (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) - 2 * (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) = -prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s]

Wait, but in the example, s=1, x=1, n=4

sum_s = (10 -4) - 2*(7 -4) =6 -6=0

But according to the correct sum, it's 1.

Wait, discrepancy here.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum_top_x is the sum of the x largest elements in the remaining array.

But in the sorted descending array, a[s+1] to a(n), the top x are a[s+1] to a[s+x]

So, sum_top_x = sum(a[s+1] to a[s+x])

Hence, sum_s = sum(a[s+1] to a(n)) - 2 * sum(a[s+1] to a[s+x])

Which, in terms of prefix_sum, is:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * (prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s]) if s + x <=n

Else:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) = -prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s]

But in the example, s=1, x=1, n=4

sum_s =10 -4 -2*(7-4)=6-6=0

But actual sum is 3+2-4=1

Wait, inconsistency here.

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that after Alice removes s elements, the remaining array is a[s+1] to a(n].

Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum should be sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

But in the example, sum_remaining=4+3+2=9, sum_top_x=4, sum_s=9-8=1, which matches.

But according to the formula using prefix_sum, sum_s=10-4-2*(7-4)=6-6=0, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in how I'm using prefix_sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me index the array from 1 to n.

prefix_sum[i] = sum(a[1] to a[i])

So, sum(a[s+1] to a[n]) = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

sum(a[s+1] to a[s+x]) = prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s], if s + x <=n

Else, sum(a[s+1] to a[n]) = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]

So, sum_s = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * (prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s]) if s + x <=n

Else:

sum_s = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * (prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s]) = -prefix_sum[n] + prefix_sum[s]

But in the example, s=1, x=1, n=4

sum_s=10-4-2*(7-4)=6-6=0

But actual sum is 3+2-4=1

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when s + x <=n, sum_s = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[s] - 2 * (prefix_sum[s+x] - prefix_sum[s])

But in the example, a=[4,3,2,1], sorted descending.

s=1, x=1

sum_remaining=3+2+1=6

sum_top_x=3

sum_s=6-6=0

But actual sum should be 3+2-4=1

Wait, confusion here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after removing s=1, the remaining array is [4,3,2], and Bob flips the top x=1 element, which is 4 to -4, so sum is -4+3+2=1

But according to the formula, sum_s= sum_remaining - 2 * sum_top_x =6-6=0

Which doesn't match.

So, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum_remaining is sum(a[s+1:n]), which is 3+2+1=6

But in reality, after removing s=1, the array is [4,3,2], sum=9, not 6.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, a=[4,3,2,1], s=1, remove a[1]=4, remaining [3,2,1], sum=6

Bob flips the top x=1 element, which is 3 to -3, sum=-3+2+1=0

Which matches the formula sum_s=6-6=0

But in the earlier example, it was sum=0, which matches.

Wait, but in the earlier reasoning, it was sum=1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, k=1, x=1, a=[3,1,2,4]

sorted descending:
