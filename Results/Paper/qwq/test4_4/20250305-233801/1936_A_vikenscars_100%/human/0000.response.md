Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries where I compare the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR sets a bit if it's set in either number.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ as much as possible in their higher bits.

Given that I have a permutation, all p_k are unique, and I need to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

Now, thinking about how to approach this with the queries allowed. Each query lets me compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d). I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the relative values of p_i.

One idea is to find the maximum value in the permutation using these queries, and then find the value that, when XORed with this maximum, gives the highest possible value.

Wait, but XOR isn't directly related to the magnitude of the numbers; it's about the bit differences.

Let me think differently. If I can sort the permutation or at least find the two numbers that differ the most in their bit patterns, that would help.

But sorting would require too many queries if done naively.

Given that n can be up to 10^4 and t up to 10^3, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^4, I need an efficient approach.

Let's consider the properties of XOR. The maximum possible XOR would be achieved if the two numbers have as many differing bits as possible.

For example, if n is 4, numbers are 0,1,2,3. Their binary representations are 00, 01, 10, 11. The maximum XOR would be between 0 and 3, which is 3.

Wait, but in this case, 2 XOR 3 is also 1, which is less than 3. So 0 XOR 3 is indeed maximum.

Similarly, for n=2, numbers are 0 and 1. XOR is 1, which is the maximum possible.

So, in general, to maximize XOR, I need to find two numbers whose binary representations differ in the highest possible number of bits.

But how to find such a pair using only comparisons of ORs?

Maybe I can find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation and see their XOR.

Wait, but that might not give the maximum XOR. For example, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], max is 3, min is 0, XOR is 3. But if I take 1 and 2, XOR is 3 as well.

So, in this case, it works.

But is this general?

Wait, in n=3, p=[0,1,2], 0 XOR 2 = 2, 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is higher.

Wait, hold on, 1 XOR 2 is 3, which is higher than 0 XOR 2, which is 2.

So, in this case, taking the max and min doesn't give the highest XOR.

Hmm, so my initial approach might be flawed.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to find the two numbers that differ the most in their highest bits.

Binary search comes to mind, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from highest to lowest and decide which bits should be different in the two numbers.

But I need to do this using only comparisons of ORs.

This is tricky.

Let's consider that OR of two numbers is the bitwise OR, which sets a bit if it's set in either number.

So, (p_a OR p_b) compared to (p_c OR p_d) tells me something about which pair has more high bits set.

But I need to relate this to XOR, which is about differing bits.

This seems a bit indirect.

Maybe I can find the maximum OR possible and then find another number that differs from it as much as possible.

Wait, but I need to maximize XOR, not OR.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for two numbers, their XOR is maximized when their highest bits differ.

So, if I can find the two numbers with the highest bits in different positions, that would help.

But I need a way to identify such numbers using only comparisons of ORs.

This is challenging.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

In the reference solution, there's a function func_2(n) that seems to implement the logic.

First, it initializes max_item_idx to 0.

Then, it iterates through the list from index 1 to n-1, comparing (p_max_item_idx OR p_max_item_idx) with (p_i OR p_i), which is essentially comparing p_max_item_idx with p_i, since x OR x is x.

So, it's finding the maximum p_i by comparing individual elements.

That makes sense. It's finding the maximum element in the permutation.

Then, it sets pair_idx to this max_item_idx.

Next, it iterates through all indices again, comparing (p_max_item_idx OR p_pair_idx) with (p_max_item_idx OR p_i).

If (p_max_item_idx OR p_pair_idx) < (p_max_item_idx OR p_i), it sets pair_idx to i.

Also, if they are equal, it compares (p_pair_idx OR p_pair_idx) with (p_i OR p_i), and if p_i is greater, set pair_idx to i.

This seems like it's trying to find a p_pair_idx that, when ORed with p_max_item_idx, is as large as possible.

But wait, OR is used here, and we're trying to maximize XOR.

Is this the right approach?

Let me think about what this code is doing.

First part: find the maximum p_i by comparing individual elements.

Second part: find a p_j such that (p_max_item_idx OR p_j) is maximized, and if there are ties, choose the larger p_j.

Is this equivalent to maximizing p_max_item_idx XOR p_j?

Not necessarily.

For example, take n=4, p=[0,1,2,3].

Max p_i is 3.

Now, (3 OR 0)=3, (3 OR 1)=3, (3 OR 2)=3, (3 OR 3)=3.

So, any p_j would give (3 OR p_j)=3.

Then, in the second part, since all (3 OR p_j) are equal to 3, it would choose the largest p_j, which is 3.

But 3 XOR 3 is 0, which is not the maximum XOR.

The maximum XOR is 3 XOR 0 = 3 or 1 XOR 2 = 3.

So, in this case, the code would output (3,3) with XOR 0, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, it should output any pair that maximizes XOR.

But here, it's outputting a pair with XOR 0, which is not maximum.

So, is this code incorrect?

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

After finding max_item_idx, which is 3 in this case, it sets pair_idx to 3.

Then, it iterates through all i from 0 to n-1:

- Compares (p_max_item_idx OR p_pair_idx) with (p_max_item_idx OR p_i).

Since p_max_item_idx is 3, and (3 OR 3)=3, and (3 OR any p_i)=3, so (3 OR 3) == (3 OR p_i), which is "=".

So, it goes to the else if ans1 == '=':

compares (p_pair_idx OR p_pair_idx) with (p_i OR p_i).

That is, (3 OR 3) vs (p_i OR p_i).

So, for i=0: (3 OR 3)=3 vs (0 OR 0)=0 -> ">" -> do nothing.

i=1: 3 vs 1 -> ">".

i=2: 3 vs 2 -> ">".

i=3: 3 vs 3 -> "=" -> do nothing.

So, pair_idx remains 3.

Thus, it outputs (3,3), which is incorrect.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, it seems to work.

Wait, in the example, n=4, p=[0,3,1,2].

Let's see:

First, find max_item_idx:

Compare p0=0 with p1=3: 0 < 3 -> max_item_idx=1.

Then compare p1=3 with p2=1: 3 > 1 -> max_item_idx stays 1.

Then compare p1=3 with p3=2: 3 > 2 -> max_item_idx stays 1.

So, max_item_idx=1 (p1=3).

Then, set pair_idx=1.

Now, iterate through i=0 to 3:

i=0:

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p1 OR p0)=3 OR 0=3 -> "=".

Now, compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p0 OR p0)=0 -> ">" -> do nothing.

i=1:

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p1 OR p1)=3 -> "=".

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p1 OR p1)=3 -> "=" -> do nothing.

i=2:

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p1 OR p2)=3 OR 1=3 -> "=".

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p2 OR p2)=1 -> ">" -> do nothing.

i=3:

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p1 OR p3)=3 OR 2=3 -> "=".

Compare (p1 OR p1)=3 vs (p3 OR p3)=2 -> ">" -> do nothing.

So, pair_idx remains 1.

Thus, it outputs (1,1), which is p1=3 XOR p1=3=0, which is incorrect.

But in the sample input, it outputs "! 3 2", which is correct.

Wait, perhaps there's something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, in the sample input, the output is "! 3 2", but according to this code, it would output "! 1 1", which is incorrect.

Hence, this code is incorrect.

So, the answer should be Correctness: **False**

But let's see if there's any scenario where it works.

Take n=2, p=[0,1].

Find max_item_idx: compare p0=0 and p1=1 -> max_item_idx=1.

Set pair_idx=1.

Iterate through i=0 to 1:

i=0:

Compare (p1 OR p1)=1 vs (p1 OR p0)=1 OR 0=1 -> "=".

Compare (p1 OR p1)=1 vs (p0 OR p0)=0 -> ">" -> do nothing.

i=1:

Compare (p1 OR p1)=1 vs (p1 OR p1)=1 -> "=".

Compare (p1 OR p1)=1 vs (p1 OR p1)=1 -> "=" -> do nothing.

So, pair_idx remains 1.

Output "! 1 1", which is p1=1 XOR p1=1=0, but the correct answer is p0=0 XOR p1=1=1.

Hence, again incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find a pair of indices in a secret permutation that maximizes their bitwise XOR value, using at most 3n queries. The given program attempts to solve this by first identifying the maximum element in the permutation and then selecting a pair that maximizes the bitwise OR with this maximum element. However, this approach is flawed, as it may not always yield the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Approach

1. **Identify the Maximum Element:**
   - The program starts by finding the maximum element in the permutation by comparing individual elements using the OR operation. Since `p_a OR p_b` for `a = b` is just `p_a`, comparing `(p_a OR p_a)` with `(p_b OR p_b)` effectively compares `p_a` and `p_b`.

2. **Selecting the Pair:**
   - Once the maximum element is identified, the program tries to find another element that, when combined with the maximum element using OR, gives the highest possible value. Additionally, if there are ties, it selects the element with the highest individual value.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    func_2(n)

def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    request = f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}'
    print(request, flush=True)
    return input()

def func_2(n):
    max_item_idx = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans = func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)
        if ans == '<':
            max_item_idx = i
    pair_idx = max_item_idx
    for i in range(n):
        ans1 = func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)
        if ans1 == '<':
            pair_idx = i
        elif ans1 == '=':
            ans2 = func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)
            if ans2 == '>':
                pair_idx = i
    print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation, comparing each element with the current `max_item_idx` using the OR operation on the same indices (`p_a OR p_a` vs. `p_b OR p_b`). This effectively compares the values of `p_a` and `p_b`.
   - If an element is found to be greater than the current `max_item_idx`, it updates `max_item_idx` to this new index.

2. **Selecting the Pair:**
   - After identifying the maximum element, the program attempts to find another element that, when combined with the maximum element using OR, gives the highest possible value.
   - It iterates through all indices again, comparing `(p_max_item_idx OR p_pair_idx)` with `(p_max_item_idx OR p_i)`. If the new combination is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - If the combinations are equal, it compares the individual values of `p_pair_idx` and `p_i` to decide whether to update `pair_idx`.

### Correctness

**Correctness: False**

- **Issue with XOR Maximization:**
  - The approach focuses on maximizing the bitwise OR with the maximum element, which does not necessarily maximize the bitwise XOR.
  - XOR is maximized when the bits of the two numbers differ as much as possible, whereas OR is maximized when bits are set to 1 regardless of differences.

- **Example Failure:**
  - For `n=4` with permutation `[0,3,1,2]`:
    - Maximum element is `3` at index `1`.
    - Comparing `(p1 OR p1)=3` with `(p1 OR p0)=3`, `(p1 OR p2)=3`, and `(p1 OR p3)=3`.
    - All comparisons yield equal OR values, leading to selecting the pair `(1,1)` with XOR `0`, whereas the maximum XOR is `3` from pairs `(0,3)` or `(1,2)`.

- **Alternative Approach:**
  - A correct approach would involve determining the highest bit where the elements differ, starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, using queries to compare OR values strategically to deduce the bit patterns.

### Conclusion

The given program incorrectly assumes that maximizing the bitwise OR with the maximum element will also maximize the bitwise XOR. This leads to incorrect results in scenarios where the XOR is maximized by pairs that do not necessarily have the highest OR values with the maximum element. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
