Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n cards numbered from 1 to n, and he wants to lay them down in a specific order. The order is based on this process:

1. First, lay down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

2. Then, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number, again from smallest to largest.

3. Next, lay down all cards that are three times an odd number, and so on.

And this continues until all cards are laid down. I need to find out what the k-th card is in this sequence.

Okay, let's try to understand this with the example provided. For n=7 and k from 1 to 7, the order is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4. Let's see why:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice an odd number: 2 (which is 2*1), 6 (which is 2*3)

- Three times an odd number: None in this case, since 3*1=3 is already in the odd numbers, and 3*3=9 is greater than 7.

- Four times an odd number: 4 (which is 4*1)

- And so on.

So, the sequence is first all odds, then all numbers that are twice an odd, then four times, and so forth.

Now, the problem is to find the k-th card in this sequence for possibly up to 10^5 test cases, with n up to 10^9 and k up to n.

First thoughts:

- We need an efficient way to compute this, especially since n can be up to 10^9, which means we can't iterate through all numbers for each test case.

- We need a way to determine, for a given k and n, what the k-th number in this ordering is.

Let me try to find a pattern or a formula that can help me directly compute the k-th number without iterating through all the numbers.

Observations:

1. The numbers are being grouped based on how many times an odd number is multiplied by 2.

- Group 0: odd numbers themselves (1*1, 1*3, 1*5, etc.)

- Group 1: twice an odd number (2*1, 2*3, 2*5, etc.)

- Group 2: four times an odd number (4*1, 4*3, 4*5, etc.)

- Group 3: eight times an odd number (8*1, 8*3, 8*5, etc.)

- And so on.

2. Each group corresponds to numbers that are multiples of 2^i times an odd number, where i starts from 0 upwards.

3. The groups are ordered by increasing i, and within each group, the numbers are ordered by increasing odd multiplier.

4. Importantly, each number can only appear in one group because once it's included in a group, it's "used up."

Given that, I need a way to quickly determine which group the k-th number falls into and then find the specific number within that group.

Let's think about how many numbers are in each group.

For a given group i, which corresponds to numbers that are multiples of 2^i but not multiples of 2^{i+1}, the number of such numbers up to n is floor(n / 2^i) - floor(n / 2^{i+1}).

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see:

- Total multiples of 2^i up to n: floor(n / 2^i)

- Total multiples of 2^{i+1} up to n: floor(n / 2^{i+1})

- So, the numbers that are multiples of 2^i but not 2^{i+1} are floor(n / 2^i) - floor(n / 2^{i+1})

Yes, that seems right.

So, for each group i, the number of elements is floor(n / 2^i) - floor(n / 2^{i+1}).

And the groups are ordered by increasing i.

Wait, but in the problem, the groups are ordered by increasing i, but within each group, the numbers are ordered by increasing odd multiplier.

So, for group i, the numbers are 2^i * 1, 2^i * 3, 2^i * 5, etc., as long as 2^i * odd <= n.

But not all of these will necessarily be present, since some may have been used in earlier groups.

Wait, no. Actually, each number can only be in one group because once it's included in a group, it's "used up."

But according to the problem statement, Vladislav cannot use a card again once it's laid down.

So, indeed, each number is used only once, in the first group it qualifies for.

Wait, but actually, no. The problem says:

"First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 2 multiplied by an odd number).

Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 3 multiplied by an odd number).

Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 4 multiplied by an odd number).

And so on, until all cards are laid down."

Wait a minute, but in the example, for n=7, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Let's see:

- Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7

- Twice an odd number: 2 (2*1), 6 (2*3)

- Three times an odd number: 3*1=3 (already in odds), 3*3=9 (>7), so none

- Four times an odd number: 4*1=4

- So, sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4

But according to the problem, it's:

First, all odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

Then, all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.

Then, all cards that are three times an odd number from smallest to largest.

And so on.

So, in this process, a number like 3 is already included in the first group (odds), so it's not included again in the "twice an odd" group.

Similarly, 6 is included in the "twice an odd" group, but 3 is already used, so 6 is included.

Wait, but 3 is already used in the first group, so 6 is still included because it's twice an odd, even though 3 is already used.

Wait, but in the sequence, 6 comes after 3.

Wait, in the sequence for n=7:

1,3,5,7,2,6,4

So, first all odds: 1,3,5,7

Then, twice odds: 2,6

Then, four times odds: 4

No three times odds are included because 3 is already used, and 9 is beyond n=7.

So, in general, for a given multiple of odds, we include numbers that are m * odd, where m is a power of 2, in increasing order of m.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

First, all odd-numbered cards.

Then, all cards that are twice an odd number.

Then, all cards that are three times an odd number.

Then, all cards that are four times an odd number.

And so on.

But in the example, for n=7, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Which corresponds to:

- m=1: 1,3,5,7

- m=2: 2,6

- m=4: 4

No m=3, because 3 is already used in m=1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 2 multiplied by an odd number)."

Then, "all cards that are three times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 3 multiplied by an odd number)."

Then, "all cards that are four times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 4 multiplied by an odd number)."

And so on.

So, it's grouping by m=1, m=2, m=3, m=4, etc., in that order.

Within each m, the numbers are m*1, m*3, m*5, ..., as long as m*(2k+1) <= n.

But, once a number is used in an earlier m, it's not used again in a later m.

So, in m=1, we have 1,3,5,7.

In m=2, we have 2,6.

In m=3, we have 3*1=3 (already used in m=1), 3*3=9 (>7), so none.

In m=4, we have 4*1=4.

So, the sequence is 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Wait, but in this sequence, 3 is already used in m=1, so in m=3, 3 is skipped because it's already used.

Similarly, in m=2, 6 is included because it wasn't used before.

So, the general approach is:

- For m=1, include all odd numbers.

- For m=2, include all numbers that are 2*odd, excluding those already included in m=1.

- For m=3, include all numbers that are 3*odd, excluding those already included in earlier m's.

- And so on.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it seems like for each m, it includes all numbers that are m*odd, regardless of whether they were included earlier.

But according to the example, it's skipping numbers that were already included.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem statement again carefully.

"First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.

Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 2 multiplied by an odd number).

Next, he lays down all cards that are three times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 3 multiplied by an odd number).

Next, he lays down all cards that are four times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e., 4 multiplied by an odd number).

And so on, until all cards are laid down.

Once Vladislav puts a card down, he cannot use that card again."

So, it's clear that once a card is laid down, it's removed from consideration for subsequent m's.

So, for m=1, include all odd numbers.

For m=2, include all numbers that are 2*odd, but only those that weren't included in m=1.

Similarly, for m=3, include all numbers that are 3*odd, but only those not included in earlier m's.

And so on.

So, in the sequence, each number appears exactly once, in the first m for which m*odd equals that number.

Given that, I need to find the k-th number in this ordering.

Given the constraints (t up to 5*10^4, n up to 10^9), I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, observe that each m corresponds to a power of 2 multiplied by an odd number.

Wait, no, m can be any positive integer, and for each m, we consider m*odd numbers, excluding those already used in earlier m's.

But, perhaps there's a better way to think about this.

Wait, perhaps we can think in terms of the highest odd divisor of each number.

For any number x from 1 to n, we can write x as x = m * t, where t is the highest odd divisor of x, and m is a power of 2.

For example:

- x=1: m=1, t=1

- x=2: m=2, t=1

- x=3: m=1, t=3

- x=4: m=4, t=1

- x=5: m=1, t=5

- x=6: m=2, t=3

- x=7: m=1, t=7

- x=8: m=8, t=1

- x=9: m=1, t=9

And so on.

In this representation, m is always a power of 2, and t is odd.

Now, the problem's ordering corresponds to ordering the numbers first by m, in increasing order of m, and within each m, ordering by t in increasing order.

Wait, but according to the problem, it's:

- First, m=1, t=1,3,5,7,...

- Then, m=2, t=1,3,5,7,...

- Then, m=3, t=1,3,5,7,...

- Then, m=4, t=1,3,5,7,...

- And so on.

But in reality, m is a power of 2, as per the highest power of 2 dividing x.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing m with something else.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that every number x can be uniquely expressed as x = m * t, where t is the largest odd divisor of x, and m is a power of 2.

For example:

- x=1: m=1, t=1

- x=2: m=2, t=1

- x=3: m=1, t=3

- x=4: m=4, t=1

- x=5: m=1, t=5

- x=6: m=2, t=3

- x=7: m=1, t=7

- x=8: m=8, t=1

- x=9: m=1, t=9

And so on.

Now, the problem's ordering seems to be:

- First, all x where m=1, ordered by t: 1,3,5,7,9,...

- Then, all x where m=2, ordered by t: 2,6,10,14,...

- Then, all x where m=4, ordered by t: 4,12,20,28,...

- Then, all x where m=8, ordered by t: 8,24,40,56,...

- And so on.

Wait, but in the example for n=7, it's 1,3,5,7,2,6,4.

Which corresponds to:

- m=1: t=1,3,5,7 → x=1,3,5,7

- m=2: t=1,3 → x=2,6

- m=4: t=1 → x=4

- No higher m since n=7.

So, the sequence is ordered by increasing m, and within each m, by increasing t.

Now, m is a power of 2: m=1,2,4,8,16,...

Given that, I can think of the ordering as first all numbers where m=1 (i.e., odd numbers), then m=2, then m=4, and so on, each time considering t as odd numbers in increasing order.

So, to find the k-th number in this sequence, I need to:

1. Determine which m group the k-th number falls into.

2. Within that m group, find the t that corresponds to the position k.

But I need to accumulate the counts of numbers in each m group until I reach or surpass k.

Given that, I can iterate over m=1,2,4,8,... and for each m, calculate how many numbers belong to that m group, i.e., how many t exist such that m*t <= n and t is odd.

Since t is odd, the number of such t is floor(n / m) // 2, because for every m, the odd t's are 1,3,5,... up to floor(n / m).

Wait, no.

Actually, for a given m, the possible t's are the odd numbers t where m*t <= n.

So, t can be 1,3,5,... up to floor(n / m).

The number of such t's is floor((floor(n / m) + 1) / 2).

Wait, let's think carefully.

Given m, t is odd and m*t <= n.

So, t <= floor(n / m).

And t is odd, so t can be 1,3,5,... up to the largest odd number less than or equal to floor(n / m).

The number of odd numbers up to some value k is floor((k + 1) / 2).

Therefore, for a given m, the number of t's is floor((floor(n / m) + 1) / 2).

So, for each m in the sequence 1,2,4,8,..., I can compute the number of t's, accumulate them, and see where k falls.

Once I find the m group where k is located, I can then find the specific t within that group.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let m = 1,2,4,8,... as long as m <= n.

For each m, let count_m = floor((floor(n / m) + 1) / 2)

Then, the cumulative count up to m is sum of count_m for all m up to that point.

I need to find the smallest m such that the cumulative count >= k.

Once I have that m, I can find the position of k within that m group.

Let's say cumulative_count_before_m is the sum of count_m for m's before the current m.

Then, the position within the m group is k - cumulative_count_before_m.

Then, I can find the t that corresponds to that position in the m group.

Since t's are 1,3,5,... up to floor(n / m), I can find t = 2*(position - 1) + 1.

Then, the number is x = m * t.

This seems like a plan.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 10^9 and t up to 5*10^4.

So, for each test case, I need to iterate over m=1,2,4,8,... until m > n, compute count_m, accumulate, find where k falls, and then compute x.

However, since m doubles each time, the number of m's is logarithmic in n, specifically log2(n), which is up to around 30 for n=10^9.

So, for each test case, I can iterate up to 30 times, which is acceptable.

Let me try to write some pseudocode.

For each test case:

Read n and k

Initialize m = 1

Initialize cumulative_count = 0

Initialize a list to store (m, count_m)

While m <= n:

t_max = floor(n / m)

count_m = floor((t_max + 1) / 2)

Add (m, count_m) to the list

cumulative_count += count_m

if cumulative_count >= k:

break

m *= 2

Now, find the m group where k is located.

Let's say the list is [(m1, count1), (m2, count2), ..., (mi, counti)]

Find the smallest i such that sum(count1 to counti) >= k.

Then, the m group is mi.

Then, the position within the m group is k - sum(count1 to counti-1)

Then, t = 2*(position - 1) + 1

Then, x = m * t

Print x

Wait, but in the list, the counts are accumulated.

So, I need to find the first i where cumulative_count >= k.

Then, m = m_i

Then, position = k - sum(count1 to counti-1)

Then, t = 2*(position - 1) + 1

Then, x = m * t

Yes.

Let me try this with the example n=7, k=1

m=1, t_max=7, count_m=4 (since (7+1)/2=4)

cumulative_count=4 >=1, so m=1, position=1, t=1, x=1*1=1 → correct.

k=2:

m=1, count_m=4 >=2, position=2, t=3, x=1*3=3 → correct.

k=5:

cumulative_count for m=1 is 4, which is less than 5.

m=2, t_max= floor(7/2)=3, count_m=2 (since (3+1)/2=2)

cumulative_count=4+2=6 >=5, so m=2, position=5-4=1, t=1, x=2*1=2 → correct.

k=7:

cumulative_count for m=1 is 4, for m=2 is 6, for m=4 is floor(7/4)=1, count_m=1 (since (1+1)/2=1)

cumulative_count=6+1=7 >=7, m=4, position=7-6=1, t=1, x=4*1=4 → correct.

Seems right.

Now, let's consider another example, n=1, k=1

m=1, t_max=1, count_m=1, cumulative_count=1 >=1, m=1, position=1, t=1, x=1*1=1 → correct.

n=34, k=14

Let's compute m=1: t_max=34, count_m=17

cumulative=17 >=14 → m=1, position=14, t=2*13 +1=27, x=1*27=27 → but according to the sample output, it's 27, so correct.

Wait, but 27 is less than 34, so it should be included.

Yes, seems correct.

Another test: n=84, k=19

m=1: t_max=84, count_m=42

cumulative=42 >=19 → m=1, position=19, t=2*18 +1=37, x=1*37=37 → matches the sample output.

Last one: n=1000000000, k=1000000000

m=1: t_max=1000000000, count_m=500000000

cumulative=500000000 <1000000000

m=2: t_max=500000000, count_m=250000000

cumulative=750000000 <1000000000

m=4: t_max=250000000, count_m=125000000

cumulative=875000000 <1000000000

m=8: t_max=125000000, count_m=62500000

cumulative=937500000 <1000000000

m=16: t_max=62500000, count_m=31250000

cumulative=968750000 <1000000000

m=32: t_max=31250000, count_m=15625000

cumulative=984375000 <1000000000

m=64: t_max=15625000, count_m=7812500

cumulative=992187500 <1000000000

m=128: t_max=7812500, count_m=3906250

cumulative=1000000000 >=1000000000

So, m=128, position=1000000000 - 992187500 = 7812500

t=2*(7812500 -1) +1=15625000 -1=1562499
