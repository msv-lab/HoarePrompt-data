Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are three friends playing chess together, and in each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario isn't possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's possible in terms of points distribution. Each game can either have a winner and a loser, or it can be a draw. So, in each game, the total points awarded are either 2 (if one wins) or 2 (if it's a draw). Wait, that seems off. In a win-loss scenario, the winner gets 2 and the loser gets 0, so total points added are 2. In a draw, both get 1, so total points added are 2 again. So, regardless of whether it's a win or a draw, each game adds exactly 2 points to the total sum of all players' points.

Given that, the total sum of p1 + p2 + p3 must be even, because each game contributes 2 points to the total. So, if p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, it's impossible, and we should return -1. That makes sense.

Looking at the sample input, there's a case where p1=0, p2=0, p3=0. Total sum is 0, which is even, so it's possible, and since no games were played, there were no draws, so the answer is 0.

Another case: p1=0, p2=1, p3=1. Total sum is 2, which is even. To achieve p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, it must be that there was one game between player 2 and player 3, and it was a draw. So, one draw, which matches the sample output of 1.

Next, p1=1, p2=1, p3=1. Total sum is 3, which is odd, so it's impossible, and the sample output is -1.

Then, p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. Total sum is 4, which is even. Is this possible? Let's see. If there are two games: in the first game, players 2 and 3 play and have a draw, giving each 1 point. In the second game, players 1 and 2 play, and player 2 wins, giving player 2 an additional 2 points and player 1 0. So, player 1 has 0+1=1, player 2 has 1+2=3, player 3 has 1+0=1. Wait, that doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe another arrangement: players 1 and 2 play and have a draw, so p1=1, p2=1. Then, players 1 and 3 play, and player 3 wins, so p1=1+0=1, p3=1+2=3, p2=1. But that doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. Alternatively, if players 2 and 3 play and player 3 wins, then p2=1+0=1, p3=1+2=3, p1=1. Again, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe only one game was played between players 2 and 3, with player 3 winning: p2=0+0=0, p3=0+2=2, p1=1. Wait, but p1 started with 1, which might not be possible. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's consider that the total number of games played is (p1 + p2 + p3)/2, since each game adds 2 points to the total sum. So, for p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, total sum is 4, so total games are 2.

In two games, we need to distribute the points such that p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Option 1: First game between p1 and p2, draw: p1=1, p2=1. Second game between p1 and p3, p3 wins: p1=1+0=1, p3=0+2=2, p2=1. This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2. So, in this case, there was one draw (first game), and one win (second game). So, maximum draws is 1, but the sample output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's a way to have two draws. Let's try: First game between p1 and p2, draw: p1=1, p2=1. Second game between p1 and p3, draw: p1=1+1=2, p3=0+1=1, p2=1. But that gives p1=2, p2=1, p3=1, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Alternatively, first game between p1 and p3, draw: p1=1, p3=1. Second game between p2 and p3, draw: p2=1, p3=1+1=2, p1=1. That gives p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches. And in this case, there are two draws. So, the maximum number of draws is 2, which matches the sample output.

Okay, so in this case, it's possible to have two draws.

Moving on to p3=3, p2=3, p3=3. Total sum is 9, which is odd, so it's impossible, and the sample output is -1, which makes sense.

Next, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5. Total sum is 12, which is even. Is this possible? Let's see.

Total games played: 12/2 = 6 games.

I need to distribute these games among the three pairs: p1 vs p2, p1 vs p3, and p2 vs p3.

Let me denote the number of games between p1 and p2 as g12, between p1 and p3 as g13, and between p2 and p3 as g23.

Each game can be either a win or a draw, so for each game, points are distributed accordingly.

Let me define:

- For g12 games between p1 and p2:

- Let d12 be the number of draws, and w12 be the number of wins for p1.

- So, p1 gets d12*1 + w12*2 from these games.

- p2 gets d12*1 + (g12 - d12 - w12)*2 + w12*0.

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Let me consider the total points each player gets from all games.

Let me denote:

- Let d be the total number of draws.

- Let w be the total number of wins (i.e., games that are not draws).

Then, total points are: 2*d + 2*w = p1 + p2 + p3.

But since each game contributes 2 points, regardless of win or draw, this equation is always satisfied, as p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(d + w).

What I need is to maximize d, the number of draws.

But I need to ensure that the points each player has can be achieved given the number of games they played against each other.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should look for constraints that limit the number of draws.

Let me consider the maximum possible draws.

In the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, we saw that d=2 is possible.

In another sample input where p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, the output is 6, which would mean all 6 games were draws.

Wait, but in that case, each draw gives 1 point to each player, so 6 draws would give each player 6 points, but p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, which doesn't match. So, perhaps not all games can be draws.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of individual player's points.

Let me consider that for each player, their total points come from the sum of points they get from each game they played.

Each player plays against each of the other two players in some number of games.

Let me denote:

- g12: number of games between p1 and p2.

- g13: number of games between p1 and p3.

- g23: number of games between p2 and p3.

Then, the total number of games is g12 + g13 + g23.

Each game contributes 2 points to the total sum, so p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(g12 + g13 + g23).

For each pair, in their g12 games, they can have some number of draws and some number of wins.

Let me denote:

- d12: number of draws in g12 games.

- w12: number of wins for p1 in g12 games.

- Similarly, d13, w13 for g13 games.

- d23, w23 for g23 games.

Then, p1 = d12*1 + d13*1 + w12*2 + w13*2.

Similarly,

p2 = d12*1 + d23*1 + w12*0 + w23*2.

p3 = d13*1 + d23*1 + w13*0 + w23*0.

Wait, that seems off for p3. If p3 plays against p1 in g13 games, with d13 draws and w13 wins for p1, so p3 would have losses in those w13 games.

Similarly, p3 plays against p2 in g23 games, with d23 draws and w23 wins for p2.

So, p3's points should be d13*1 + d23*1 + (g23 - d23 - w23)*0.

Wait, perhaps I need to define w13 as wins for p1 against p3, so losses for p3.

Similarly, w23 as wins for p2 against p3.

So, p3's points would be d13*1 + d23*1 + (g13 - d13)*0 + (g23 - d23 - w23)*0.

Wait, this seems messy.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the total points for each player come from their games against the other two players.

So, p1's points come from games against p2 and games against p3.

Similarly for p2 and p3.

Let me think about the maximum number of draws.

To maximize the number of draws, I need as many games as possible to end in draws.

But, the points each player has might constrain how many draws can occur.

For example, if a player has an odd number of points, then at least one of their games must be a draw, because wins and losses contribute even numbers to their points.

Wait, a win gives 2 points, a loss gives 0, and a draw gives 1.

So, if a player has an odd number of points, they must have at least one draw.

If a player has an even number of points, they could have all wins and losses, but draws would have to be even in number to keep the total points even.

Wait, no, since each draw adds 1 point, multiple draws can make the total points odd or even depending on the number of draws.

Wait, no, 1 point per draw, so if a player has an odd number of points, they must have an odd number of draws, and if they have an even number of points, they must have an even number of draws.

But, it's more complicated because draws affect multiple players.

Wait, maybe I should consider the total number of draws.

Each draw involves two players, each getting 1 point.

Each win involves two players, with one getting 2 points and the other 0.

So, perhaps I can set up equations based on the points.

Let me denote:

- d12: number of draws between p1 and p2.

- d13: number of draws between p1 and p3.

- d23: number of draws between p2 and p3.

- w12: number of wins for p1 in games against p2.

- w21: number of wins for p2 in games against p1.

- w13: number of wins for p1 in games against p3.

- w31: number of wins for p3 in games against p1.

- w23: number of wins for p2 in games against p3.

- w32: number of wins for p3 in games against p2.

But this seems too complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of total draws.

Let me denote d as the total number of draws across all games.

Each draw involves two players, each getting 1 point.

So, total points from draws: 2*d.

Let me denote w as the total number of wins (i.e., non-draw games).

Each win involves one player getting 2 points and the other getting 0.

So, total points from wins: 2*w.

Total points: 2*d + 2*w = p1 + p2 + p3.

But since p1 + p2 + p3 = 2*(d + w), this equation is always satisfied, given that p1 + p2 + p3 is even.

So, this doesn't give me new information.

I need to find a way to maximize d, the total number of draws.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible end in draws, without violating the individual players' points.

To maximize d, I should minimize w, the number of wins.

The minimal w is 0, but sometimes it's necessary to have some wins to reach the players' points.

Wait, in the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, total points is 4, so total games are 2.

If both games are draws, then each player involved in the draws gets 1 point per draw.

If both games are between p2 and p3, then p2 and p3 each get 1+1=2, and p1 gets 0, which doesn't match p1=1.

Alternatively, if one game is between p1 and p2, draw: p1=1, p2=1.

Second game between p1 and p3, draw: p1=1+1=2, p3=1.

But that doesn't match p1=1, p3=2.

Alternatively, first game between p1 and p3, draw: p1=1, p3=1.

Second game between p2 and p3, draw: p2=1, p3=1+1=2.

This matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, with two draws.

So, maximum draws is 2.

In another sample input, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, output is 6.

Total points is 12, so total games are 6.

If all 6 games are draws, each draw gives 1 point to two players, so total points would be 2*6=12.

But in this case, points would be distributed as p1=6, p2=6, p3=6, but in the sample input, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, which is different.

So, not all games can be draws.

But the sample output is 6, which seems incorrect because if all games are draws, points would be equal, but in this case, they're not.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the sample output is 6, but in reality, if all 6 games are draws, points would be equal, which doesn't match p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, maybe the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is 6, but with some adjustments.

Wait, maybe some games are wins to adjust the points.

Let me think.

If all 6 games are draws, p1=6, p2=6, p3=6.

But we need p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, we need to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1.

How can we do that?

We can replace some draws with wins.

Each time we replace a draw with a win, one player's points increase by 1 (from 1 to 2), and the other's decrease by 1 (from 1 to 0), so the difference changes by 2.

Wait, in a draw, both get 1 point.

In a win, one gets 2 and the other gets 0.

So, replacing a draw with a win changes the points of the two players involved: one gains 1, the other loses 1.

So, to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1, we need to find a way to adjust the points by replacing some draws with wins.

Let's see:

Start with all draws: p1=6, p2=6, p3=6.

We need to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1.

We can do this by replacing draws with wins in a way that reduces p1, p2, and p3 appropriately.

For example:

- Replace a draw between p1 and p2 with a win for p2: p1 decreases by 1, p2 increases by 1.

- Replace a draw between p1 and p3 with a win for p3: p1 decreases by 1, p3 increases by 1.

- Replace a draw between p2 and p3 with a win for p3: p2 decreases by 1, p3 increases by 1.

Wait, but we need to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1.

Let me think differently.

If I replace a draw with a win for player A against player B, then player A's points increase by 1, and player B's points decrease by 1.

So, to reduce p1 by 3, I need to have p1 lose 3 times against other players.

Similarly, to reduce p2 by 2, and p3 by 1.

Wait, but p1 can only lose to p2 or p3.

Each loss for p1 means p1's points decrease by 1 (from 1 to 0 in that game), and the winner's points increase by 1 (from 1 to 2 in that game).

So, to reduce p1 by 3, I need to have p1 lose 3 times.

Similarly, to reduce p2 by 2, p2 should lose 2 times.

And to reduce p3 by 1, p3 should lose 1 time.

But, in each win, one player gains 1 point and the other loses 1 point.

So, total point reduction is equal to the number of wins.

In this case, total point reduction needed is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

But total games are 6, so all games must be wins, with no draws.

Wait, but that can't be, because in each win, one player gains 1 point and the other loses 1 point, so total point sum remains the same.

Wait, but p1 + p2 + p3 is 12, and if all games are wins, total points are still 12.

Wait, no, in wins, total points are still 2 per game, so total points are 12.

But in draws, total points are also 2 per game, so 12.

So, point sum remains the same, but the distribution changes.

Wait, but in wins, one player gets 2 and the other gets 0, so the difference changes.

In draws, both get 1.

So, to adjust the points, we can have some wins and some draws.

In the all-draws scenario, p1=6, p2=6, p3=6.

To reach p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, we need to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1.

Each win replaces a draw, and changes the points: one player gains 1, the other loses 1.

So, to reduce p1 by 3, I need to have p1 lose 3 times.

Similarly, to reduce p2 by 2, p2 should lose 2 times.

And to reduce p3 by 1, p3 should lose 1 time.

But, in each win, one player wins and the other loses.

So, the number of losses for each player must be equal to the reduction needed.

So, p1 loses 3 times, p2 loses 2 times, p3 loses 1 time.

But, in the context of wins, each win corresponds to one loser.

So, total losses should be equal to the number of wins.

In this case, total losses needed are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, which matches the total number of games, so all games must be wins.

But in that case, p1 has 3 losses, p2 has 2 losses, p3 has 1 loss.

So, p1's points would be 0 (since all losses), p2's points would be 2*(number of wins), and p3's points would be 2*(number of wins).

But wait, p2 has 2 losses, so p2 has (total games p2 plays) - (losses) = wins.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to model it differently.

Let me denote:

- Let g12 be the number of games between p1 and p2.

- Let d12 be the number of draws between p1 and p2.

- Similarly, g13, d13; g23, d23.

Then, the number of wins for p1 against p2 is w12 = g12 - d12.

Similarly, wins for p2 against p1 is w21 = g12 - d12 - w12.

Wait, no, in g12 games, d12 are draws, and the remaining g12 - d12 are wins, which can be w12 (p1 wins) and w21 (p2 wins), with w12 + w21 = g12 - d12.

Similarly for g13 and g23.

Now, p1's points are:

p1 = d12*1 + d13*1 + w12*2 + w13*2.

Similarly,

p2 = d12*1 + d23*1 + w21*2 + w23*2.

p3 = d13*1 + d23*1 + w31*2 + w32*2.

But we don't have direct information about w12, w21, w13, w31, w23, w32, so this seems too vague.

Maybe I should look for upper and lower bounds on the number of draws.

Let me consider that the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible are draws, without violating the individual players' points.

To maximize draws, I need to make as many games draws as possible, but respecting the players' total points.

So, perhaps I can iterate from the highest possible number of draws down to zero, and check if such a number of draws is possible given the points.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula to compute the maximum number of draws directly.

Looking back at the provided program, let's see what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases, and for each test case, reads p1, p2, p3.

First, it checks if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0, in which case it's impossible, so prints -1.

Otherwise, if p3 >= p1 + p2, it prints p1 + p2.

Else, it enters a loop where it initializes x=0 and y=p3, and while y >= x, it checks if p1 - x <= p2 - y, and if so, prints p1 - x + p3, else increments x and decrements y.

If the loop doesn't find a suitable x and y, it prints p3.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

First part: if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0, print -1. That makes sense, as total points must be even.

Second part: if p3 >= p1 + p2, print p1 + p2.

Is this correct?

In the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, p3 = 2 >= 1 + 1 = 2, so it prints p1 + p2 = 2, which matches the sample output.

But in another sample input where p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, p3=5 >= 3 + 4 =7 is false, so it doesn't enter this condition.

Wait, but in that case, p3=5 < p1 + p2 =7, so it goes to the else part.

Then, it enters the while loop with x=0, y=5.

Check if p1 - x <= p2 - y: 3 - 0 <= 4 - 5 ⇒ 3 <= -1, which is false, so x=1, y=4.

Check 3 -1 <=4 -4 ⇒ 2 <=0, false.

x=2, y=3.

3 -2 <=4 -3 ⇒1 <=1, true.

So, print p1 - x + p3 =3 -2 +5=6, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct in this case.

Another sample input: p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which satisfies p3 >= p1 + p2, so prints p1 + p2=2, which is correct.

But in the case where p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, p3=1 < p1 + p2=2, so goes to else part.

x=0, y=1.

Check 1 -0 <=1 -1 ⇒1 <=0, false.

x=1, y=0.

1 -1 <=1 -0 ⇒0 <=1, true.

Prints p1 -x + p3=1-1 +1=1, but sample output is -1, which doesn't match.

Wait, but in the sample input, p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, output is -1, but according to the program, it would print 1, which is different.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but maybe there's more to it.

Looking back at the program, in the else part, after the while loop, it prints p3.

But in the above case, the while loop condition is satisfied and it prints p1 - x + p3.

Wait, no, in the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, it goes into the else part, x=0, y=1.

1 -0 <=1 -1 ⇒1 <=0, false.

Then x=1, y=0.

1 -1 <=1 -0 ⇒0 <=1, true.

So, it prints p1 -x + p3=1-1 +1=1.

But according to the sample output, it should be -1.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe in some cases, even if the condition is satisfied, it's still impossible.

So, perhaps after printing, it needs to verify the feasibility.

I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider the constraints again.

Each draw between two players increases both their points by 1.

Each win increases the winner's points by 2 and the loser's by 0.

Given that, the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many games as possible are draws, without exceeding the individual players' points.

So, to maximize draws, we should maximize the number of draws for each pair, respecting their points.

Let me consider that for each pair, the number of draws cannot exceed the minimum of what each player can afford.

For example, between p1 and p2, the number of draws cannot exceed floor((p1)/1) and floor((p2)/1), since each draw gives 1 point to each.

Wait, more precisely, the number of draws between p1 and p2 should be such that p1's total points from all games include these draws.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to consider that the total points for each player come from their draws and their wins.

Each draw gives 1 point, each win gives 2 points.

But players also have losses, which give 0 points.

Wait, but losses don't directly affect the points, as losses are just the games where the opponent won.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each player, their points can be expressed as the sum of points from draws and wins.

Let me denote for player i:

p_i = d_i + 2*w_i,

where d_i is the total points from draws, and w_i is the total points from wins.

But d_i is equal to the number of draws player i participated in, since each draw gives 1 point.

Wait, no, d_i is the total points from draws, which is equal to the number of draws player i participated in.

Similarly, w_i is the number of wins player i had.

So, p_i = d_i + 2*w_i.

But d_i is the number of draws player i participated in, which is the sum of draws in all their games.

Similarly, w_i is the number of wins player i had in their games.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the total number of draws is the sum of draws in each pair's games.

So, total draws d = d12 + d13 + d23.

I need to maximize d, given that p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*w1, where w1 is the number of wins for p1.

Similarly, p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*w2,

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*w3.

I need to maximize d = d12 + d13 + d23.

Given that p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*w1,

p2 = d12 + d23 + 2*w2,

p3 = d13 + d23 + 2*w3.

Also, w1, w2, w3 are non-negative integers.

I need to maximize d = d12 + d13 + d23, subject to these equations.

This seems like a system of linear equations with integer variables.

I need to find non-negative integer solutions for d12, d13, d23, w1, w2, w3 that satisfy the equations.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can look for bounds on d.

Let me consider that d12 <= p1 - d13 - 2*w1,

But w1 can be from 0 to floor((p1 - d12 - d13)/2).

This is getting too involved.

Perhaps I need to consider that the maximum d is achieved when w1, w2, w3 are minimized.

Since p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*w1, to maximize d12 + d13, I should minimize w1.

Similarly for w2 and w3.

So, set w1 = floor((p1 - d12 - d13)/2),

But since p1 = d12 + d13 + 2*w1, and w1 is minimized when d12 + d13 is maximized.

Wait, perhaps I can set w1 = ceil((p1 - d12 - d13)/2), but I'm getting confused.

This seems too complicated for the time being.

Looking back at the program, it seems to have a specific logic that might not always hold, as seen in the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, it outputs 1, but the correct output should be -1.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to make it correct.

Let me check another sample input: p1=3, p2=3, p3=3.

Total sum is 9, which is odd, so it should print -1, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input: p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, output is 6, which seems incorrect based on my earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me try to see if p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 can be achieved with 6 draws.

If all 6 games are draws, p1=6, p2=6, p3=6, which doesn't match.

So, to adjust, we need to replace some draws with wins to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1.

Each replacement of a draw with a win decreases one player's points by 1 and increases the other's by 1.

So, to reduce p1 by 3, p2 by 2, p3 by 1, we need to have p1 lose 3 times, p2 lose 2 times, p3 lose 1 time.

But in the context of wins, each win corresponds to one loser.

So, total losses needed are 3 + 2 + 1 =6, which matches the total number of games.

So, all games must be wins.

But in that case, p1 has 3 losses, p2 has 2 losses, p3 has 1 loss.

So, p1's points would be 0 (since all losses), p2's points would be 2*(number of wins), p3's points would be 2*(number of wins).

But p2 has 2 losses, so p2 has some wins.

Wait, p2 has total games p2 plays: against p1 and p3.

Assuming p2 plays g12 games against p1 and g23 games against p3.

Similarly for p1 and p3.

This is getting too involved.

Given the time constraints, I'll assume that the program is incorrect based on the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, it outputs 1, but the correct output should be -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
