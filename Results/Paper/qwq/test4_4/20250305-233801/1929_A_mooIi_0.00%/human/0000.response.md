Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha has an array of numbers, and he wants to rearrange them in a way that maximizes something called "beauty." The beauty is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. So, basically, for each pair of consecutive elements in the array, I subtract the previous one from the current one and add all those differences up.

First, I need to understand what this sum represents. Let's take an example from the input. In the first test case, n=3 and the array is [2, 1, 3]. If I arrange it as [1, 2, 3], then the beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2. That matches the example given.

Wait a minute, why did they arrange it in ascending order? Let me try arranging it in descending order: [3, 2, 1]. Then beauty would be (2-3) + (1-2) = -1 + (-1) = -2. That's negative, which is worse. So, ascending order gives a higher beauty.

Let me try another arrangement: [1, 3, 2]. Then beauty is (3-1) + (2-3) = 2 + (-1) = 1. That's less than 2.

Another one: [2, 1, 3]. Beauty is (1-2) + (3-1) = -1 + 2 = 1 again.

So, it seems that arranging the array in ascending order gives the maximum beauty. Is this always the case?

Let me check with the second test case: n=3, array [69, 69, 69]. If I arrange them in any order, say [69, 69, 69], then beauty is (69-69) + (69-69) = 0 + 0 = 0. That matches the example.

If I arrange them in any other order, I still get 0. So, in this case, the maximum beauty is 0.

Third test case: n=5, array [100, 54, 80, 43, 90]. If I arrange in ascending order: [43, 54, 80, 90, 100]. Then beauty is (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57. That matches the example.

Fourth test case: n=4, array [3, 4, 3, 3]. Arranged in ascending order: [3, 3, 3, 4]. Beauty is (3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. That matches the example.

Fifth test case: n=2, array [2, 1]. Arranged in ascending order: [1, 2]. Beauty is (2-1) = 1. That matches the example.

So, in all these cases, arranging the array in ascending order gives the maximum beauty. Is this always true?

Let me think about it mathematically. The beauty is the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for i from 2 to n. This simplifies to a_n - a_1. Because it's a telescoping sum:

(a2 - a1) + (a3 - a2) + ... + (an - a_{n-1}) = an - a1.

So, the beauty is simply an - a1, where a1 is the first element and an is the last element in the arranged array.

Therefore, to maximize the beauty, I need to maximize an - a1. To do that, I should choose the largest possible an and the smallest possible a1.

So, by arranging the array in ascending order, a1 is the smallest element and an is the largest element, so an - a1 is maximized.

Wait, but if I arrange the array in descending order, an would be the smallest and a1 would be the largest, so an - a1 would be minimized, possibly negative.

So, yes, arranging in ascending order maximizes the beauty, which is an - a1.

Therefore, the maximum beauty is the largest element minus the smallest element in the array.

Wait, but in the first test case, it's 3 - 1 = 2, which matches the example.

In the second test case, all elements are 69, so 69 - 69 = 0.

In the third test case, 100 - 43 = 57.

In the fourth test case, 4 - 3 = 1.

In the fifth test case, 2 - 1 = 1.

So, it's indeed an - a1.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

So, the beauty is max(a) - min(a).

Therefore, for each test case, I just need to find the maximum element, find the minimum element, and compute their difference.

That's much simpler than sorting the entire array.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))

print(' '.join(ar))

This program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads n, reads the array, sorts it in ascending order, converts the elements to strings, and prints them space-separated.

Wait, but according to the problem, I need to output a single integer, which is the maximum beauty, i.e., max(a) - min(a).

But this program is printing the sorted array.

That's not what the problem is asking for.

So, this program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Let me check the problem statement again.

"output a single integer â€” the maximum beauty of the array a that can be obtained."

So, it should be a single integer, the maximum beauty, which is max(a) - min(a).

But the program is printing the sorted array.

That's not correct.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Alternatively, maybe I miscounted the lines in the code block.

Let me check again.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))

print(' '.join(ar))

Yes, it's reading inputs in a loop for each test case, reading n, reading the array, sorting it, converting to strings, and printing the sorted array.

But the problem asks for a single integer, the maximum beauty.

So, this program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires something else.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the array is rearranged to maximize the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}), which is an - a1, as I concluded.

But just to be sure, let me consider another example.

Suppose n=4, array [1, 2, 4, 3].

If arranged as [1, 2, 3, 4], beauty is (2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is 4 - 1 = 3.

If arranged as [1, 3, 2, 4], beauty is (3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 -1 + 2 = 3.

If arranged as [2, 1, 3, 4], beauty is (1-2) + (3-1) + (4-3) = -1 + 2 + 1 = 2.

So, the maximum beauty is indeed 3, which is an - a1 = 4 - 1 = 3.

Hence, in general, the maximum beauty is max(a) - min(a).

Therefore, the program should find the maximum and minimum elements in the array and compute their difference.

But the given program is sorting the array and printing it.

That's not correct.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
