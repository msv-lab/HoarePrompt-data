Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. For a friend to come to the party, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party.

4. He needs to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of friend i, and all p_i are distinct, this forms a permutation of the friends. In other words, it's like a matching where each friend is paired with another friend as their best friend.

Given that, I can think of the friends as being arranged in pairs or cycles based on their best friend relationships. But since n can be up to 50 and t can be up to 5000, I need an efficient way to compute the minimum number of invitations for each test case.

Let's consider some examples to grasp the problem better.

Example 1:

n = 5

p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]

In this case:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

- Friend 3's best friend is 2

- Friend 4's best friend is 5

- Friend 5's best friend is 4

So, we have two cycles here:

- Cycle 1: 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

- Cycle 2: 4 -> 5 -> 4

Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to come to the party. To minimize the number of invitations, he should try to get two friends from the same cycle to come by inviting both of them and their best friends.

In the first cycle, if he invites friend 1 and friend 3, then friend 1 will come because friend 3 is invited, and friend 3 will come because friend 2 is invited. But friend 2 hasn't been invited, so friend 3 won't come. Wait, it's a bit tricky.

Actually, for friend i to come, both i and p_i must be invited. So, if Monocarp invites friend 1 and friend 3, then:

- Friend 1 will come only if friend 3 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 3 will come only if friend 2 is invited. But friend 2 isn't invited yet.

So, to make friend 3 come, Monocarp needs to invite friend 2 as well. Then:

- Friend 1 comes because friend 3 is invited.

- Friend 3 comes because friend 2 is invited.

- Friend 2 comes because friend 1 is invited.

But friend 2's best friend is friend 1, who is invited, so friend 2 will come. Similarly, friend 1's best friend is friend 3, who is invited, so friend 1 will come. And friend 3's best friend is friend 2, who is invited, so friend 3 will come.

So, by inviting friends 1, 2, and 3, Monocarp gets all three to come. But he only needs at least two to come, so this works, but maybe there's a way to get two friends to come with fewer invitations.

Wait, in the example output, for this case, it's 2. So, there must be a way to get two friends to come by sending only two invitations.

Looking back at the example, it says Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5, and both will come because they are each other's best friends and both have invitations. That makes sense.

So, in this case, inviting 4 and 5 is sufficient to get two friends to come, and that requires only two invitations.

Therefore, the minimum number of invitations needed is 2.

Example 2:

n = 4

p = [2, 3, 4, 1]

Here:

- Friend 1's best friend is 2

- Friend 2's best friend is 3

- Friend 3's best friend is 4

- Friend 4's best friend is 1

This forms a single cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1

According to the example, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, and friends 1 and 2 will come.

Let's verify:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 3 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 4 is invited, but friend 4 isn't invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come, which satisfies the condition of at least two friends coming.

The example says it's impossible to do with fewer than three invitations. Let's check if that's true.

Suppose Monocarp invites only two friends. Let's say friends 1 and 2.

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 3 is invited, which he isn't.

So, friend 2 doesn't come. Only friend 1 comes, which is less than two. Not sufficient.

Another try: invite friends 1 and 3.

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 4 is invited, which he isn't.

So, no one comes. Not sufficient.

Another try: invite friends 1 and 4.

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 4 comes if friend 1 is invited, which he is.

So, friend 4 comes, but only one friend, which is less than two. Not sufficient.

Thus, it seems that three invitations are indeed necessary in this case.

Example 3:

n = 2

p = [2, 1]

Here:

- Friend 1's best friend is 2

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

This is a cycle of length 2.

If Monocarp invites both friends 1 and 2, then:

- Friend 1 comes because friend 2 is invited.

- Friend 2 comes because friend 1 is invited.

So, both come with two invitations.

Alternatively, if he invites only one, say friend 1, then friend 1 won't come because friend 2 isn't invited. Similarly, inviting only friend 2 won't make anyone come. So, two invitations are necessary.

From these examples, it seems that in cycles of length 2, inviting both friends is necessary to get both to come, which is the minimum required since we need at least two friends to come.

In cycles of longer length, like in the second example with n=4, inviting three friends is necessary to get at least two to come.

Wait, but in the first example with n=5, there was a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2. By inviting two friends from the cycle of length 2, he could get two friends to come.

So, it seems that in cycles of length 2, inviting both is necessary to get both to come, and in larger cycles, inviting more friends is needed.

Is there a general pattern here?

Let's think about the structure of these best friend relationships. Since p_i is a permutation with no fixed points (p_i ≠ i) and all p_i are distinct, it forms a set of cycles.

In a cycle of length k, to get m friends to come, how many invitations are needed?

From the first example, in a cycle of length 3, inviting 2 friends isn't enough, but inviting 3 is sufficient.

In a cycle of length 2, inviting 2 is sufficient.

Wait, but in the first example, there was a cycle of length 3 and a cycle of length 2, and by inviting 2 friends (from the cycle of length 2), he could get 2 friends to come.

So, in that case, cycles are separate, and invitations are independent between cycles.

Meaning, if there are multiple cycles, Monocarp can choose to invite friends from one cycle to make friends come from that cycle, without necessarily inviting anyone from other cycles.

So, the problem reduces to analyzing each cycle separately and determining the minimum invitations needed across all cycles to have at least 2 friends come in total.

But cycles are disjoint, so friends from different cycles don't affect each other's attendance directly.

Therefore, Monocarp can choose to focus on one cycle where he can achieve the goal with the fewest invitations.

So, the strategy is to find the cycle where the minimum number of invitations is needed to get at least 2 friends to come, and then sum those invitations.

Wait, but since cycles are disjoint, invitations in one cycle don't affect others.

Wait, no, actually, since friends are in separate cycles, Monocarp can choose to invite friends from one cycle to make friends from that cycle come, and ignore other cycles.

So, he should choose the cycle where he can get at least 2 friends to come with the fewest invitations.

Therefore, the problem is to find, for each cycle, the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends from that cycle to come, and then take the minimum over all cycles.

But actually, since cycles are separate, he can choose to focus on one cycle and ignore others, as long as he gets at least 2 friends from that cycle to come.

Wait, but in the first example, there were two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2.

By inviting 2 friends from the cycle of length 2, he got 2 friends to come.

In the cycle of length 3, would inviting 2 friends be sufficient?

Let's see: in a cycle of length 3, say friends 1, 2, 3, where 1's best friend is 2, 2's is 3, and 3's is 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 3 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 1 is invited, which he is.

So, friend 1 comes, friend 2 doesn't come because friend 3 isn't invited, and friend 3 comes because friend 1 is invited.

So, friends 1 and 3 come, which is at least 2 friends.

Wait, but in the first example, the solution was to invite friends 4 and 5, which are in a cycle of length 2, and get both to come.

But in this cycle of length 3, inviting friends 1 and 2 also gets two friends to come (1 and 3).

So, in this case, inviting 2 friends is sufficient to get at least 2 friends to come.

Wait, but in the second example, with a single cycle of length 4, inviting 3 friends was necessary to get at least 2 to come.

Wait, but in the cycle of length 3, inviting 2 friends seems sufficient.

Wait, but in the first example, the cycle of length 3 was friends 1,2,3, and p = [3,1,2,5,4].

Wait, no, in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which is:

- 1 -> 3

- 2 -> 1

- 3 -> 2

- 4 -> 5

- 5 -> 4

So, cycles are:

- 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

- 4 -> 5 -> 4

So, one cycle of length 3 and one of length 2.

In this case, inviting 2 friends from the cycle of length 2 is sufficient to get 2 friends to come.

Alternatively, inviting 2 friends from the cycle of length 3 could also get 2 friends to come, as shown earlier.

So, the minimum is 2 invitations.

In the second example, with a single cycle of length 4, inviting 3 friends is necessary to get at least 2 to come.

So, perhaps in general, for cycles of even length, inviting half plus one is needed, or something like that?

Wait, in cycle of length 2: invite 2, get 2 to come.

Cycle of length 3: invite 2, get 2 to come.

Cycle of length 4: invite 3, get 2 to come.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, in cycle of length 2: minimum invitations to get 2 to come is 2.

In cycle of length 3: minimum invitations to get 2 to come is 2.

In cycle of length 4: minimum invitations to get 2 to come is 3.

Wait, why in cycle of length 4, inviting 2 friends isn't sufficient?

Let's see: in a cycle of length 4, say friends 1,2,3,4, where 1's best friend is 2, 2's is 3, 3's is 4, 4's is 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 3 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 4 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 4 comes if friend 1 is invited, which he is.

So, friend 1 comes, friend 4 comes, but friend 2 and friend 3 don't come.

So, friends 1 and 4 come, which is at least 2 friends.

Wait, but according to the example, in the second test case, it was necessary to invite 3 friends to get at least 2 to come.

But according to this, inviting 1 and 2 would get 1 and 4 to come, which is 2 friends.

Is there a mistake here?

Wait, in the second test case, p = [2,3,4,1], which is a single cycle of length 4: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 2 is invited, which he is.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 3 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 4 is invited, which he isn't.

- Friend 4 comes if friend 1 is invited, which he is.

So, friend 1 and friend 4 come.

That's 2 friends coming with 2 invitations, which contradicts the example's output of 3.

Wait, but in the example, it says that Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1,2,3, and then friends 1 and 2 will attend.

But according to my reasoning, inviting 1 and 2 should make friends 1 and 4 attend.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

So, friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited.

Wait, no: "the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

Wait, re-reading: "the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

So, friend i comes if both friend i and friend p_i are invited.

Wait, but in the example, it says:

"the friends [2,4,5] will come to the party."

Wait, in the first example, Monocarp sends invitations to [1,2,4,5], and friends [2,4,5] come.

Wait, let's check for friend 2:

- Friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend p_2 are invited.

- p_2 =1, so friend 2 comes if friends 2 and 1 are invited. Which they are.

Similarly, friend 4:

- Comes if friend 4 and friend p_4=5 are invited. Which they are.

Friend 5:

- Comes if friend 5 and friend p_5=4 are invited. Which they are.

Friend 1:

- Comes if friend 1 and friend p_1=3 are invited. Friend 3 isn't invited, so friend 1 doesn't come.

So, friends 2,4,5 come.

Similarly, in the second test case, p = [2,3,4,1]

If Monocarp invites friends 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 1 and friend p_1=2 are invited. Which they are.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend p_2=3 are invited. Which they are.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 3 and friend p_3=4 are invited. Friend 4 isn't invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

- Friend 4 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, in the cycle of length 4, inviting 1 and 2 should make friends 1 and 4 come.

Wait, no, according to the problem, friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited.

So, in the cycle of length 4, inviting friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 1 and friend p_1=2 are invited. Which they are.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend p_2=3 are invited. Friend 3 isn't invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 3 and friend p_3=4 are invited. Friend 3 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4 comes if friend 4 and friend p_4=1 are invited. Friend 4 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

Wait, so only friend 1 comes, which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps I misread the condition.

Let me read the problem again.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

Wait, so friend i comes only if both friend i and friend p_i are invited.

So, in the first example, inviting friends 4 and 5:

- Friend 4 comes if friend 4 and friend p_4=5 are invited. Which they are.

- Friend 5 comes if friend 5 and friend p_5=4 are invited. Which they are.

- Friends 1,2,3 aren't invited, so don't come.

So, friends 4 and 5 come, which is at least 2.

In the second example, inviting friends 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 1 and friend p_1=2 are invited. Which they are.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend p_2=3 are invited. Which they are.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 3 and friend p_3=4 are invited. Friend 4 isn't invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

- Friend 4 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, but earlier I thought that inviting friends 1 and 2 would only make friend 1 come, but according to this, both friend 1 and friend 2 come because both i and p_i are invited for each.

Wait, no, friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend p_2=3 are invited. But friend 3 isn't invited in this scenario, so friend 2 doesn't come.

Wait, but in the example where Monocarp invites friends 1,2,3, it's stated that friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

So, for friend i to come, both friend i and friend p_i must be invited.

In the second test case:

- p = [2,3,4,1]

- Invitations: friends 1,2,3

- Friend 1 comes if friend 1 and friend p_1=2 are invited. Both are invited, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend p_2=3 are invited. Both are invited, so friend 2 comes.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 3 and friend p_3=4 are invited. Friend 4 isn't invited, so friend 3 doesn't come.

- Friend 4 isn't invited, so doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, but in my earlier thought experiment, when inviting friends 1 and 2 in a cycle of length 4, only friend 1 comes, because friend 2 requires friend 3 to be invited, which he isn't.

But according to the condition, friend i comes only if both i and p_i are invited.

So, in the second test case, inviting friends 1,2,3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited → comes

- Friend 3: invited but p_3=4 isn't invited → doesn't come

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, but in the earlier thought, if Monocarp invites only friends 1 and 2, then:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited → comes

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited → doesn't come

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come

So, only friend 1 comes.

But in the example, with invitations to friends 1,2,3, friends 1 and 2 come.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe the condition is that friend i comes if both i and p_i are invited, but p_i must also have their best friend invited, and so on.

Wait, re-reading the problem:

"the i -th friend comes to the party if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation."

It seems that only the direct best friend matters. There's no cascading condition based on p_i's best friend.

So, in the second test case, inviting friends 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes because friend 1 and friend 2 are invited.

- Friend 2 comes because friend 2 and friend 3 are invited.

- Friend 3 doesn't come because friend 4 isn't invited.

- Friend 4 doesn't come because not invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Hence, to get at least 2 friends to come, Monocarp needs to invite at least 3 friends in this case.

But according to my earlier thought, inviting only friends 1 and 2 should make friends 1 and 2 come, but according to the condition, friend 2 requires friend 3 to be invited, which he isn't in the scenario where only friends 1 and 2 are invited.

Wait, but in the example, inviting friends 1,2,3 makes friends 1 and 2 come, which satisfies the condition.

But to minimize invitations, is there a way to invite fewer than 3?

From earlier, inviting only friends 1 and 2 would make only friend 1 come, because friend 2 requires friend 3 to be invited, which he isn't.

Similarly, inviting friends 1 and 3 would make friend 1 come (since friend p_1=2 is not invited), and friend 3 doesn't come because friend p_3=4 isn't invited.

So, only friend 1 comes.

Inviting friends 2 and 3: friend 2 comes (since friend 3 is invited), friend 3 doesn't come (since friend 4 isn't invited), so only friend 2 comes.

Inviting friends 1 and 4: friend 1 comes (if friend 2 is invited, which he isn't), friend 4 comes (if friend 1 is invited, which he is), so only friend 4 comes.

Inviting friends 3 and 4: friend 3 comes (if friend 4 is invited, which he is), friend 4 comes (if friend 1 is invited, which he isn't), so only friend 3 comes.

So, in all cases, inviting only two friends doesn't get at least two friends to come.

Hence, the minimum is 3 invitations, as per the example.

Wait, but earlier I thought that inviting friends 1 and 2 should make friends 1 and 2 come, but according to the condition, friend 2 requires friend 3 to be invited, which he isn't if only friends 1 and 2 are invited.

Hence, only friend 1 comes.

Therefore, to make friend 2 come, Monocarp needs to invite friend 3 as well, making it three invitations.

Hence, the minimum is 3.

So, in cycles of length 4, inviting 3 friends is necessary to get at least 2 to come.

Similarly, in cycles of length 3, inviting 2 friends is sufficient to get at least 2 to come.

In cycles of length 2, inviting 2 friends is sufficient to get both to come.

So, in general, for a cycle of length k, the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come is:

- For k = 2: invite 2 friends.

- For k = 3: invite 2 friends.

- For k = 4: invite 3 friends.

Is there a general formula for this?

Let me think about it.

In a cycle of length k, to get m friends to come, how many invitations are needed?

In a cycle of length k, each friend's best friend is the next in the cycle.

So, to make friend i come, both i and p_i must be invited.

But p_i is part of the cycle, so making p_i come would require inviting p_i and p_{p_i}, and so on.

It seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of selecting a subset of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends come, i.e., at least 2 friends have both themselves and their best friends invited.

To minimize the number of invitations, I need to maximize the number of friends who come per invitation sent.

In the first example, inviting friends 4 and 5 makes both come, so it's efficient.

In the second example, inviting friends 1,2,3 makes friends 1 and 2 come, which satisfies the condition, and it's the minimal number required in that case.

In the third example, inviting both friends in the cycle of length 2 makes both come.

So, perhaps in general, for cycles of length k:

- If k = 2: invite 2 friends.

- If k >= 3: invite ceil(k/2) friends.

Wait, in the cycle of length 3, inviting 2 friends is sufficient to get 2 to come, which is better than ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

In cycle of length 4, inviting 3 friends is needed to get 2 to come, which is more than ceil(4/2)=2, which doesn't work as per earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((k+1)/2).

For k=2: floor(3/2)=1, but need to invite 2.

No, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the smallest integer m such that m >= 2 and m >= (k + 1)/2.

Wait, in k=3: m >= 2 and m >= 2, so m=2.

In k=4: m >=2 and m >= 2.5, so m=3.

Yes, that seems to match.

So, for a cycle of length k, the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come is max(2, ceil((k+1)/2)).

Wait, for k=2: ceil(3/2)=2, which is correct.

For k=3: ceil(4/2)=2, which is correct.

For k=4: ceil(5/2)=3, which matches the second example.

Seems like a general formula.

Therefore, for each cycle, calculate the minimum invitations needed using this formula, and then take the minimum across all cycles.

Wait, but since cycles are independent, Monocarp can choose to focus on the cycle where the minimum invitations are needed to get at least 2 friends to come.

So, he should find the cycle with the smallest min_invitations required to get at least 2 friends to come, and send that number of invitations.

But, in the first example, there are two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2.

For the cycle of length 2, min_invitations=2.

For the cycle of length 3, min_invitations=2.

So, the overall min_invitations is 2.

In the second example, a single cycle of length 4, min_invitations=3.

In the third example, a single cycle of length 2, min_invitations=2.

Hence, the answer is the minimum min_invitations across all cycles in each test case.

Therefore, to solve the problem, we need to:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and the permutation p.

b. Identify all cycles in the permutation p.

c. For each cycle, compute the minimum number of invitations needed to get at least 2 friends to come using the formula max(2, ceil((k+1)/2)), where k is the cycle length.

d. Find the minimum of these min_invitations across all cycles.

e. Output this minimum number.

But wait, in the first example, both cycles have min_invitations=2, so the overall minimum is 2.

In the second example, single cycle of length 4, min_invitations=3.

In the third example, single cycle of length 2, min_invitations=2.

Seems consistent.

But let's verify with another example.

Suppose n=6, p=[2,1,4,3,6,5].

Cycles: two cycles of length 2: 1-2, 3-4, 5-6.

Each cycle requires min_invitations=2.

So, overall minimum is 2.

Another example: n=6, p=[2,3,1,5,6,4].

Cycles: one cycle of length 3: 1-2-3, and one cycle of length 3: 4-5-6.

Each cycle requires min_invitations=2.

Overall minimum is 2.

Another example: n=5, p=[2,3,4,5,1].

Single cycle of length 5.

Using the formula, min_invitations=max(2, ceil(6/2))=3.

So, need to invite 3 friends to get at least 2 to come.

Wait, but according to the formula, for k=5, ceil((5+1)/2)=3.

Is that correct?

Let's see: in a cycle of length 5, inviting 3 friends should be sufficient to get at least 2 to come.

How?

Suppose friends are 1-2-3-4-5-1.

If Monocarp invites friends 1,2,3:

- Friend 1 comes if friend 1 and friend 2 are invited. Both are → comes.

- Friend 2 comes if friend 2 and friend 3 are invited. Both are → comes.

- Friend 3 comes if friend 3 and friend 4 are invited. Friend 4 isn't → doesn't come.

- Friend 4 comes if friend 4 and friend 5 are invited. Friend 4 isn't → doesn't come.

- Friend 5 comes if friend 5 and friend 1 are invited. Friend 5 isn't → doesn't come.

So, friends 1 and 2 come.

Hence, inviting 3 friends is sufficient to get at least 2 to come.

Alternatively, inviting friends 1,2,4:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is invited → comes.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 5 is invited → comes.

- Friend 5: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

Wait, but in this scenario, friend 3 isn't invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

Wait, in this case:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 isn't invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 5 is invited → comes.

- Friend 5: invited and friend 1 is invited → comes.

So, friends 1,4,5 come.

Hence, at least 2 friends come.

Thus, inviting 3 friends is sufficient.

Is there a way to do it with fewer, say 2 invitations?

Let's try inviting friends 1 and 2:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is invited → comes.

- Friend 2: invited and friend 3 isn't invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 5: not invited → doesn't come.

So, only friend 1 comes, which is less than 2.

Inviting friends 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and friend 4 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 5: not invited → doesn't come.

No one comes.

Inviting friends 1 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and friend 2 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 2: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and friend 5 is not invited → doesn't come.

- Friend 5: not invited → doesn't come.

No one comes.

Similarly, other combinations of two friends don't seem to work.

Hence, the minimum is indeed 3 invitations for a cycle of length 5.

Therefore, the formula seems correct.

So, the general approach is:

- For each test case, find all cycles in the permutation p.

- For each cycle, compute the minimum invitations needed using min_invitations = max(2, ceil((k+1)/2)), where k is the cycle length.

- Then, the overall minimum number of invitations for the test case is the minimum min_invitations across all cycles.

Implementing this requires finding the cycle structure of the permutation p.

Given that n can be up to 50 and t can be up to 5000, we need an efficient way to find the cycle lengths.

An efficient way is to perform a graph traversal, treating the permutation as a functional graph where each node points to its best friend.

We can perform a cycle detection algorithm on this graph.

Here's a rough plan for the code:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the permutation p as a list of integers.

- Since p_i is 1-based, convert it to 0-based for easier indexing.

- Initialize a visited array of size n, all False.

- Initialize a variable to store the minimum invitations for this test case, initially set to a large number, say infinity.

- For each friend i from 0 to n-1:

- If not visited[i]:

- Perform a cycle traversal starting from i.

- Count the length of the cycle.

- Compute min_invitations for this cycle using the formula.

- Update the overall minimum invitations if this min_invitations is smaller.

- After processing all cycles, print the overall minimum invitations.

Wait, but in the first example, there were two cycles, both requiring min_invitations=2, so the overall minimum is 2.

In the second example, one cycle requiring min_invitations=3, so overall minimum is 3.

In the third example, one cycle requiring min_invitations=2, so overall minimum is 2.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the first program provided, it seems to be implementing something different.

Looking back at the provided program:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

x = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

for i in range(0, x):

if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:

flag = True

print(2)

break

else:

print(3)

This seems to be reading t, then for each test case, reading n and p, then iterating through each friend and checking if l[l[i]-1] == i+1, and if so, print 2, else print 3.

Wait, but in the first example, p = [3,1,2,5,4], which is 0-based [2,0,1,4,3].

Checking for i=0:

l[l[0]-1] = l[2-1] = l[1] = 1, which is not equal to 0+1=1. Wait, l[1]=1, which corresponds to friend 2, but friend 2's best friend is 1, which is l[1]-1=0, l[0]=3, which is not equal to 2.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Wait, in 0-based indexing:

p = [3,1,2,5,4]

But friends are 1 to 5, so p[0]=3 corresponds to friend 1's best friend being 3.

Wait, in 0-based, p = [2,0,1,4,3]

So,
