Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix, initially all zeros, and I can perform two types of operations. Each operation allows me to set a whole row or a whole column to a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The goal is to maximize the sum of all the elements in the matrix, and I need to do this with no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do. Type 1 operation lets me choose a row and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, Type 2 operation lets me choose a column and set its elements to any permutation of 1 to n. Since I can choose any permutation, I can arrange the numbers in any order within the row or column.

Now, I need to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix. Since each operation can set an entire row or column, I need to think about how to assign these permutations to rows and columns to get the highest possible sum.

One thing to consider is that if I set a row, it affects all the elements in that row, and similarly, setting a column affects all elements in that column. If I set both a row and a column that intersect at a particular cell, which operation's value will be used for that cell?

I think I need to clarify how operations interact when both a row and a column are set. Let's assume that operations are performed in sequence, and later operations overwrite earlier ones for the cells they affect.

So, if I first set row i to some permutation, and then set column j to another permutation, the cell at (i,j) will be set to the value from the last operation that targeted it.

Given that, perhaps I can devise a strategy where I set all rows first and then all columns, or vice versa, but I need to ensure that I'm maximizing the sum.

Wait, maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the maximum possible sum achievable.

Each cell can hold a value between 1 and n, and I need to maximize the sum. If I could set each cell to n, the sum would be n^3, but I need to see if that's possible with the given operations.

However, since each operation sets a whole row or column to a permutation of 1 to n, no single row or column can have all elements as n because a permutation must include all numbers from 1 to n exactly once.

So, the highest value a single row can have is the sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2.

If I set all rows to their highest possible sum, the total sum would be n * [n(n+1)/2] = n^2(n+1)/2.

But I also have the option to set columns, which could potentially override some of the row settings.

Wait, maybe I can set all rows first, and then set specific columns to increase certain cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I can interleave row and column operations to maximize the sum.

Let me consider a small example to get some intuition.

Take n=1. Then the matrix is 1x1, and I can set either row 1 or column 1 to [1]. So, the maximum sum is 1, and I can do it in one operation.

For n=2, let's see. If I set row 1 to [2,1], and row 2 to [2,1], the matrix would be:

2 1

2 1

Sum is 6.

But if I then set column 1 to [2,1], the matrix becomes:

2 1

1 1

Sum is 5.

Wait, that's worse.

Alternatively, set row 1 to [2,1], row 2 to [2,1], then set column 1 to [2,1], and column 2 to [2,1]. But that would be 4 operations, which is within 2n=4.

But in this case, the final matrix would be:

2 1

1 1

Because the column operations overwrite the row operations for the intersecting cells.

Wait, no. Let's simulate it step by step.

Start with:

0 0

0 0

Operation 1: Set row 1 to [2,1]

2 1

0 0

Operation 2: Set row 2 to [2,1]

2 1

2 1

Operation 3: Set column 1 to [2,1]

2 1

1 1

Operation 4: Set column 2 to [2,1]

2 2

1 1

Sum is 6.

Hmm, better than before.

But in the example provided in the problem, for n=2, they achieved a sum of 7 with 3 operations.

Wait, let's look back at the example.

In the example, they did:

Operation 1: Type 1, row 1, permutation [1,2]

Operation 2: Type 1, row 2, permutation [1,2]

Operation 3: Type 2, column 1, permutation [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

1 2

1 2

Sum is 6.

Wait, but in the note, they say it's possible to get 7. Maybe I misread.

Wait, in the note, they show a different sequence:

Set row 1 to [2,1], then set row 2 to [2,1], then set column 1 to [2,1], resulting in:

2 1

2 1

Sum is 6.

But they mention it's possible to get 7. So perhaps I need a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then set all columns to [n, n-1, ..., 1]. But in this case, the last operation on each cell will determine its value, depending on whether the row or column operation was last.

Wait, perhaps I need to arrange the operations in a specific order to maximize the sum.

Alternatively, maybe I can set rows and columns in such a way that the maximum possible values are assigned to the cells where rows and columns overlap.

Let me try to think in terms of assigning the highest possible values to as many cells as possible.

Given that each row and each column must be a permutation of 1 to n, I need to distribute the higher numbers strategically.

Wait, perhaps I can set the main diagonal to n, and the rest to n-1, but I need to check if that's possible.

But in a permutation, I can't have all diagonal elements as n because that would require n to appear in every row and every column, which is only possible if n=1.

Wait, for n=1, it's possible, but for n>1, it's not.

So, for n=2, I can have:

[2,1]

[1,2]

Sum is 6.

But the example shows a sum of 7, so there must be a better arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the example.

In the example, they did:

Set row 1 to [1,2]

Set row 2 to [1,2]

Set column 1 to [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

1 2

1 2

Sum is 6.

But they mention it's possible to make the sum larger than 7.

Wait, no, in the note, they say it's impossible to make the sum larger than 7, and they show a way to get 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose different permutations.

Let me look back at the example.

In the example, they show:

Operation 1: Type 1, row 1, permutation [1,2]

Operation 2: Type 1, row 2, permutation [1,2]

Operation 3: Type 2, column 1, permutation [1,2]

Resulting matrix:

1 2

1 2

Sum is 6.

But in the note, they show:

Set row 1 to [2,1]

Set row 2 to [2,1]

Set column 1 to [2,1]

Resulting matrix:

2 1

2 1

Sum is 5.

But they mention that it's possible to get 7, so perhaps I need a different sequence.

Wait, maybe I need to set columns first and then rows.

Let me try:

Operation 1: Type 2, column 1, permutation [2,1]

Operation 2: Type 1, row 1, permutation [2,1]

Operation 3: Type 1, row 2, permutation [2,1]

Resulting matrix:

2 1

1 1

Sum is 5.

Still not 7.

Wait, perhaps I need to set columns and rows in a different order or choose different permutations.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set row 1 to [2,1], then set column 2 to [2,1], then set row 2 to [2,1].

Step by step:

Start with:

0 0

0 0

Operation 1: Type 1, row 1, permutation [2,1]

2 1

0 0

Operation 2: Type 2, column 2, permutation [2,1]

2 2

0 1

Operation 3: Type 1, row 2, permutation [2,1]

2 2

2 1

Sum is 7.

Ah, there we go. So, by setting row 1, then column 2, then row 2, we get a sum of 7.

This matches the example's note.

So, the order of operations matters because later operations can overwrite earlier ones.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that the highest possible values are assigned to the cells, considering the overwriting effects.

Now, for a general n, how can I achieve this?

I need a strategy that allows me to set as many high values as possible in the matrix, within the constraints of the operations.

One idea is to set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and then set all columns to [n, n-1, ..., 1]. However, since operations can overwrite each other, I need to think about the order.

Wait, perhaps I can set all rows first, and then set all columns, or vice versa.

Let me calculate the sum in that case.

If I set all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the sum would be n * sum from 1 to n, which is n * n(n+1)/2 = n^2(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I set all columns to [n, n-1, ..., 1], the sum would also be n^2(n+1)/2.

But when I combine both, some cells will be overwritten by the column operations.

Specifically, the cells where columns are set after rows will have the column's value.

So, the sum would be the sum of the column operations plus the sum of the row operations for the cells not overwritten by columns.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of which operations affect which cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that some cells will be set by row operations and others by column operations, and try to maximize the sum accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as each row operation sets the rows, and then column operations set the columns, and the cells are the minimum of the row and column values, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum value that can be assigned to each cell based on the operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each cell can be set by either its row operation or its column operation, whichever comes last.

Therefore, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the value for each cell by choosing the operation that can set it to the highest possible value.

But, since row and column operations are permutations, I need to ensure that the assignments are valid permutations.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern or formula that can give me the maximum sum.

Looking back at the example for n=2, the maximum sum is 7, which is greater than the sum obtained by just setting all rows or all columns.

For n=1, sum=1.

For n=2, sum=7.

For n=3, what would be the sum?

If I set all rows to [3,2,1] and all columns to [3,2,1], and arrange operations appropriately, what sum can I achieve?

Let me try n=3.

Set row 1 to [3,2,1], then row 2 to [3,2,1], then row 3 to [3,2,1], then column 1 to [3,2,1], column 2 to [3,2,1], column 3 to [3,2,1], but that's 6 operations, which is 2n for n=3.

What would be the resulting matrix?

Start with:

0 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 1: Set row 1 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 2: Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

3 2 1

0 0 0

Operation 3: Set row 3 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Operation 4: Set column 1 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Operation 5: Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

3 3 1

2 2 1

1 2 1

Operation 6: Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Sum is 3+3+3 + 2+2+2 + 1+2+1 = 18.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Alternatively, perhaps a different order of operations can yield a higher sum.

Let me try setting columns first and then rows.

Start with:

0 0 0

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 1: Set column 1 to [3,2,1]

3 0 0

2 0 0

1 0 0

Operation 2: Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

3 3 0

2 2 0

1 2 0

Operation 3: Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

3 3 3

2 2 2

1 2 1

Same sum as before, 18.

Now, is there a better arrangement?

If I set rows and columns in an interleaved fashion, perhaps I can get higher values.

Let me try:

Operation 1: Set row 1 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 2: Set column 1 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Operation 3: Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Operation 4: Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Operation 5: Set row 3 to [3,2,1]

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Operation 6: Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum is 3+3+3 + 3+2+2 + 3+2+1 = 22.

Better than 18.

Is there a way to get an even higher sum?

Let me try a different sequence.

Operation 1: Set row 1 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

0 0 0

0 0 0

Operation 2: Set column 1 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

2 0 0

1 0 0

Operation 3: Set row 2 to [3,2,1]

3 2 1

3 2 1

1 0 0

Operation 4: Set column 2 to [3,2,1]

3 3 1

3 2 1

1 2 0

Operation 5: Set row 3 to [3,2,1]

3 3 1

3 2 1

3 2 1

Operation 6: Set column 3 to [3,2,1]

3 3 3

3 2 2

3 2 1

Sum is 22 again.

Same as before.

Is 22 the maximum?

Wait, in this arrangement, the sum is 22.

Is there a way to get higher than that?

Let me see.

If I set row 1 to [3,2,1], column 1 to [3,2,1], row 2 to [3,2,1], column 2 to [3,2,1], row 3 to [3,2,1], and column 3 to [3,2,1], but in different orders, perhaps I can get higher sums.

Wait, in the previous sequence, I already got 22, and trying another sequence gave me the same sum.

Maybe 22 is the maximum.

But is there a formula for this?

Let me try to generalize this for any n.

Looking back at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=22

Let me see if there's a pattern.

For n=1: 1

n=2: 7

n=3: 22

Let me compute n=4 to see if I can find a pattern.

For n=4:

If I set rows 1 to 4 to [4,3,2,1], then set columns 1 to 4 to [4,3,2,1], in that order.

Sum is 4+4+4+4 + 3+3+3+3 + 2+3+2+2 + 1+3+2+1 = 40.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Alternatively, try setting columns first and then rows.

Sum is 4+3+2+1 + 4+3+2+1 + 4+3+2+1 + 4+3+2+1 = 4*(4+3+2+1) = 4*10 = 40.

Same sum as before.

Is there a better way?

Let me try interleaving row and column operations.

Start with:

0 0 0 0

4 3 2 2

4 3 2 1

Sum is 4+4+4+4 + 4+3+3+3 + 4+3+2+2 + 4+3+2+1 = 40.

Again, same sum.

So, it seems that with this strategy, the sum is consistently 40 for n=4.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

I don't think so, because in each cell, the value is limited by the minimum of the row and column values, considering the permutations.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula for this sum.

Looking back at n=1: sum=1

n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=22

n=4: sum=40

Let me see if there's a pattern.

For n=1: 1 = 1^3

n=2: 7 = 2^3 -1

n=3: 22 ≠ 3^3 - something

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the first n cubes.

For n=1: 1^3=1

n=2: 1^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9, which is not 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the sum of the first n squares.

For n=1: 1^2=1

n=2: 1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5, which is not 7.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum of the first n triangular numbers.

Triangular number T_k = k(k+1)/2.

Sum of first n triangular numbers: sum_{k=1 to n} T_k = n(n+1)(n+2)/6.

For n=1: 1*2*3/6=1

n=2: 2*3*4/6=4, which is not 7.

Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n^2 + (n-1)^2 + ... + 1^2.

For n=2: 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5, not 7.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n*(n+1)*(2n+1)/6.

For n=2: 2*3*5/6=5, not 7.

No.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Looking back at n=2: sum=7

n=3: sum=22

n=4: sum=40

Let me compute for n=5 to see if I can find a pattern.

For n=5:

Following the same strategy, set rows 1 to 5 to [5,4,3,2,1], then set columns 1 to 5 to [5,4,3,2,1].

Following the earlier pattern, the sum should be:

Sum = sum_{i=1 to n} min(i,j) for all i,j.

Wait, perhaps it's sum i=1 to n, sum j=1 to n, min(i,j).

But for n=2: min(1,1)=1, min(1,2)=1, min(2,1)=1, min(2,2)=2 => sum=5, but in the example, sum=7.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's sum i=1 to n, sum j=1 to n, max(i,j).

For n=2: max(1,1)=1, max(1,2)=2, max(2,1)=2, max(2,2)=2 => sum=7.

Yes, that matches n=2.

For n=3: max(1,1)=1, max(1,2)=2, max(1,3)=3

max(2,1)=2, max(2,2)=2, max(2,3)=3

max(3,1)=3, max(3,2)=3, max(3,3)=3

Sum=1+2+3 + 2+2+3 + 3+3+3=6 + 7 + 9=22.

Yes, matches n=3.

For n=4:

max(1,1)=1 ... max(1,4)=4 => sum=1+2+3+4=10

max(2,1)=2 ... max(2,4)=4 => sum=2+2+3+4=11

max(3,1)=3 ... max(3,4)=4 => sum=3+3+3+4=13

max(4,1)=4 ... max(4,4)=4 => sum=4+4+4+4=16

Total sum=10+11+13+16=40.

Matches n=4.

So, the sum seems to be sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to n} max(i,j).

Is there a formula for this sum?

Let me try to find a formula for sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to n} max(i,j).

I can try to compute this sum directly.

For each i, sum_{j=1 to n} max(i,j).

For j from 1 to i, max(i,j)=i

For j from i+1 to n, max(i,j)=j

Therefore, sum_{j=1 to n} max(i,j) = sum_{j=1 to i} i + sum_{j=i+1 to n} j = i*i + sum_{j=i+1 to n} j

Sum_{j=i+1 to n} j = sum_{j=1 to n} j - sum_{j=1 to i} j = n(n+1)/2 - i(i+1)/2

Therefore, sum_{j=1 to n} max(i,j) = i^2 + n(n+1)/2 - i(i+1)/2 = i^2 + n(n+1)/2 - i^2/2 - i/2 = (i^2)/2 - i/2 + n(n+1)/2

Simplify: (i^2 - i)/2 + n(n+1)/2

Now, sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1 to n} max(i,j) = sum_{i=1 to n} [(i^2 - i)/2 + n(n+1)/2]

= sum_{i=1 to n} (i^2 - i)/2 + sum_{i=1 to n} n(n+1)/2

= (1/2) sum_{i=1 to n} (i^2 - i) + n(n(n+1)/2)

= (1/2)(sum_{i=1 to n} i^2 - sum_{i=1 to n} i) + n^2(n+1)/2

= (1/2)(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 - n(n+1)/2) + n^2(n+1)/2

= (1/2)[n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 - n(n+1)/2] + n^2(n+1)/2

= (1/2)[n(n+1)/6 (2n+1 - 3)] + n^2(n+1)/2

= (1/2)[n(n+1)/6 (2n - 2)] + n^2(n+1)/2

= (1/2)[n(n+1)/6 * 2(n - 1)] + n^2(n+1)/2

= (1/2)[n(n+1)(n - 1)/3] + n^2(n+1)/2

= n(n+1)(n - 1)/6 + n^2(n+1)/2

= n(n+1)/2 [ (n - 1)/3 + n ]

= n(n+1)/2 [ (n - 1 + 3n)/3 ]

= n(n+1)/2 [ (4n - 1)/3 ]

= n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6

So, the sum is n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6.

For n=1: 1*2*3/6=1

n=2: 2*3*7/6=7

n=3: 3*4*11/6=22

n=4: 4*5*15/6=40

Which matches the sums I calculated earlier.

Therefore, the maximum sum is n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6.

Now, how to achieve this sum with at most 2n operations?

From the earlier examples, it seems that setting all rows to [n, n-1, ..., 1] and then setting all columns to [n, n-1, ..., 1] achieves this sum.

In terms of operations:

- Perform n Type 1 operations, each setting a row to [n, n-1, ..., 1]

- Perform n Type 2 operations, each setting a column to [n, n-1, ..., 1]

Total operations: 2n, which is within the limit.

This should achieve the maximum sum as calculated.

Therefore, in the program, for each test case, given n, output s = n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6 and m = 2n.

Then, output the n row operations followed by the n column operations, each using the permutation [n, n-1, ..., 1].

Looking at the provided program:

t = int(input())

for t in range(t, 0, -1):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))

print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))

This seems correct.

It calculates s correctly as n(n+1)(4n - 1)/6 and m=2n.

Then, it performs n Type 1 operations, setting each row to [n, n-1, ..., 1], and n Type 2 operations, setting each column to [n, n-1, ..., 1].

This should achieve the maximum sum as we calculated.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: True}} \]
