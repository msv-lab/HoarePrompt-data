Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have n players standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They pass a ball around the circle based on some rules, and I need to figure out who could have the ball after m throws, given some information about the directions of those throws.

First, I need to understand the setup. Players are in a circle, so the concept of clockwise and counterclockwise makes sense. The ball starts with player x.

Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction, which can be clockwise ('0'), counterclockwise ('1'), or unknown ('?'). If the direction is unknown, it means the throw could have been in either direction.

My task is, given the initial position x, the sequence of throws with their distances and directions (or lack thereof), to determine all possible players who could have the ball after m throws.

Let me think about how to model this.

Since the players are in a circle, the positions wrap around after n players. So, if someone throws the ball clockwise by r positions, I can calculate the new position by adding r to the current position and taking modulo n. Similarly, throwing counterclockwise would be subtracting r and taking modulo n.

Wait, but in programming, modulo operation with negative numbers can be tricky in some languages, so I need to make sure I handle negative values correctly if I'm subtracting.

Also, the problem mentions that player numbers are from 1 to n, but in programming, indices often start at 0. So, I might need to adjust for that.

Let's consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example in the input:

6 3 2

2 ?

2 ?

2 ?

So, n=6, m=3, x=2.

Each of the three throws has r=2 and direction '?'.

This means each throw could be either clockwise or counterclockwise.

So, starting from 2, after the first throw, the ball could be at (2+2)%6=4 or (2-2)%6=0, but since player numbers start at 1, 0 should be adjusted to player 6.

So, after the first throw, possible positions are 4 and 6.

After the second throw, from 4: (4+2)%6=6, (4-2)%6=2; from 6: (6+2)%6=2, (6-2)%6=4.

So, possible positions are 2, 4, 6.

After the third throw: from 2: 4 and 6; from 4: 2 and 6; from 6: 2 and 4.

So, again, possible positions are 2, 4, 6.

That matches the sample output.

Another example:

12 1 2

3 1

So, n=12, m=1, x=2.

r=3, c='1', which is counterclockwise.

So, the new position is (2 - 3) % 12 = -1 % 12 = 11.

So, the ball is with player 11.

That matches the sample output.

Third example:

10 7 4

Throws:

2 ?

9 1

4 ?

7 0

2 0

8 1

5 ?

I need to track the possible positions after each throw.

Start with 4.

First throw: 2 ?, so from 4, it can go to (4+2)%10=6 or (4-2)%10=2.

Second throw: 9 1, so counterclockwise.

From 6: (6-9)%10=-3%10=7

From 2: (2-9)%10=-7%10=3

So, possible positions: 7, 3

Third throw: 4 ?, so from 7: 7+4=11%10=1, 7-4=3; from 3: 3+4=7, 3-4=-1%10=9

So, possible positions: 1,3,7,9

Fourth throw: 7 0, which is clockwise.

From 1: 1+7=8

From 3: 3+7=10

From 7: 7+7=14%10=4

From 9: 9+7=16%10=6

So, possible positions: 4,6,8,10

Fifth throw: 2 0, clockwise.

From 4: 4+2=6

From 6: 6+2=8

From 8: 8+2=10

From 10: 10+2=12%10=2

So, possible positions: 2,6,8,10

Sixth throw: 8 1, counterclockwise.

From 2: 2-8=-6%10=4

From 6: 6-8=-2%10=8

From 8: 8-8=0%10=0, which should be adjusted to 10

From 10: 10-8=2

So, possible positions: 2,4,8,10

Seventh throw: 5 ?, so from each of these, it can go either way.

From 2: 2+5=7, 2-5=-3%10=7

Wait, 2-5=-3%10=7. So both directions go to 7.

From 4: 4+5=9, 4-5=-1%10=9

Similarly, both directions go to 9.

From 8: 8+5=13%10=3, 8-5=3

From 10: 10+5=15%10=5, 10-5=5

So, possible positions: 3,5,7,9

But the sample output is:

4

3 5 7 9

Which matches what I have.

Alright, so my approach seems correct.

Now, to generalize this.

I need to keep track of the possible positions of the ball after each throw.

I can start with the initial position x, and then for each throw, for each current possible position, I apply the throw based on the direction.

If the direction is '0', only clockwise is possible.

If the direction is '1', only counterclockwise is possible.

If the direction is '?', both directions are possible.

So, for each throw, I can update the set of possible positions accordingly.

I need to make sure to handle the modulo operation correctly, especially since player numbers are from 1 to n, not 0 to n-1.

So, when I do (current + r) % n or (current - r) % n, I need to adjust for the fact that player 0 corresponds to player n.

Wait, in Python, negative modulo works correctly, but to make sure, I should handle it properly.

For example, (2 - 3) % 6 = (-1) % 6 = 5, which corresponds to player 6.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in code, I can maintain a set of possible positions, starting with {x}.

Then, for each throw, I create a new set for the next possible positions.

For each current position, depending on the direction, I add the possible new positions.

If direction is '?', I add both clockwise and counterclockwise positions.

After all throws, I have the final set of possible positions.

Then, I need to output the count of these positions and the positions in increasing order.

I also need to handle the case where n, m, x are within their specified ranges, and ensure that the program is efficient enough given the constraints.

Given that n can be up to 1000 and m up to 1000, and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of n*m across all test cases being at most 2*10^5, I need to make sure that my solution is O(n*m) per test case, which should be acceptable.

Now, looking at the provided program:

import sys

from functools import lru_cache

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)

t = func_2()

for i in range(t):

func_4()

def func_1():

return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def func_2():

return int(func_1())

def func_3():

return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

def func_4():

n, m, x = func_3()

ans = {x}

for _ in range(m):

r, c = func_1().split()

r = int(r)

temp = set()

for q in ans:

if c == '0' or c == '?':

temp.add((q + r) % n)

if c == '1' or c == '?':

temp.add((q - r) % n)

ans = temp

if 0 in ans:

ans.discard(0)

ans.add(n)

print(len(ans))

print(*ans)

So, this code seems to implement exactly what I described.

It reads t test cases, and for each test case, it reads n, m, x, then m lines of r and c.

It starts with ans = {x}, and for each throw, it creates a temp set and adds possible new positions based on the direction c.

After all throws, it adjusts positions where 0 is changed to n, and then prints the number of possible positions and the positions in increasing order.

This seems correct.

But wait, in the code, it does (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n.

As I thought earlier, in Python, (q - r) % n will handle negative values correctly.

Also, it checks if 0 is in ans and replaces it with n, which is correct because player numbers are from 1 to n.

But, I wonder if there are any edge cases that this code might miss.

Let me think about some edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='0' (clockwise)

Clockwise from 1 with r=1 goes to 2.

Counterclockwise would go to 2 as well because (1-1)%2=0, which should be adjusted to player 2.

Wait, no, (1-1)%2=0, but players are numbered from 1 to 2, so 0 should be adjusted to 2.

But in this case, both directions go to player 2.

Wait, but c='0', so only clockwise is allowed, which goes to 2.

So, ans should be {2}.

Edge case 2: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='1' (counterclockwise)

Counterclockwise from 1 with r=1 goes to (1-1)%2=0, which is player 2.

So, ans should be {2}.

Edge case 3: n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='?'

Both directions are possible, so it should go to 2 in both cases, so ans={2}.

Edge case 4: n=3, m=2, x=2, r1=1 c1='0', r2=1 c2='1'

First throw: from 2, clockwise r=1 to 3.

Second throw: from 3, counterclockwise r=1 to 2.

So, ans={2}.

But let's see what the code does.

First throw: c='0', so only (2+1)%3=0, which is adjusted to 3.

Second throw: from 3, c='1', so (3-1)%3=2.

So, ans={2}, which is correct.

Another edge case: n=4, m=2, x=1, r1=2 c1='?', r2=2 c2='?'

First throw: ? so both directions.

From 1, clockwise r=2 to 3, counterclockwise to (1-2)%4=3.

So, ans={3}.

Wait, both directions go to 3.

Then second throw: from 3, ? so both directions: (3+2)%4=1, (3-2)%4=1.

So, ans={1}.

But wait, (3-2)%4=1, (3+2)%4=1.

So, yes, ans={1}.

Another edge case: n=4, m=2, x=1, r1=1 c1='0', r2=1 c2='1'

First throw: c='0', so from 1 to 2.

Second throw: c='1', from 2 to (2-1)%4=1.

So, ans={1}.

Seems correct.

I can't think of any edge cases where this code would fail.

Also, the code seems efficient enough, as it handles each throw by iterating over the current set of possible positions, and for each position, adds the possible new positions based on the throw.

Given that n and m are up to 1000, and t is up to 10^4, but with the sum of n*m across all test cases being at most 2*10^5, this should be acceptable.

I don't see any issues with this code.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
