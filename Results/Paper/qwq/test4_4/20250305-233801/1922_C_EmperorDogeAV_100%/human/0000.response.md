Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n cities located on a number line, each with a unique coordinate. The coordinates are given in ascending order, which is helpful. The distance between any two cities is just the absolute difference between their coordinates.

For each city, there's a concept of the "closest city." From the example, it seems that for each city, there's exactly one other city that is closest to it. The problem states that the closest city is unique for every city, so I don't have to worry about ties.

Now, the problem describes two types of actions I can take when traveling between cities:

1. Travel directly from city x to city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates in coins.

2. Travel from city x to its closest city, paying just 1 coin.

Given that, for each query, I need to find the minimum number of coins required to go from city x to city y.

First, I need to understand how to make use of the "travel to closest city" action effectively. Since it costs only 1 coin to go to the closest city, it might be beneficial to use this action repeatedly to get closer to the target city.

Let me think about how to model this. Suppose I'm at city x, and I can either go directly to y, paying |a_x - a_y|, or I can go to the closest city to x, paying 1 coin, and then continue from there.

But considering that the closest city is unique for each city, and given the sorted nature of the cities, maybe there's a pattern or a way to precompute some information to answer the queries efficiently.

Looking at the example:

Cities: [0, 8, 12, 15, 20]

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) -> City 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) -> City 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) -> City 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) -> City 4 (15)

Wait, City 4's closest city is City 3, which is closer than City 5. Makes sense.

In the first query, going from City 1 to City 4:

- Go from 1 to 2 (pay 1 coin)

- Go from 2 to 3 (pay 1 coin)

- Go from 3 to 4 (pay 1 coin)

Total: 3 coins

Alternatively, going directly from 1 to 4 would cost |0 - 15| = 15 coins, which is worse.

In the second query, from City 1 to City 5:

- Go from 1 to 2 (1 coin)

- Go from 2 to 3 (1 coin)

- Go from 3 to 4 (1 coin)

- Go from 4 to 5 (5 coins, since distance is |15 - 20| = 5)

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins

But the output says 8 coins, which matches.

Wait, but in the second query, is there a better way? Maybe going directly from 1 to 5 would cost 20 coins, which is worse. So, yes, the path through the closest cities is better.

Another query: from City 3 to City 4, which is directly to its closest city, so just 1 coin.

From City 3 to City 2:

- Go from 3 to 2 (distance |12 - 8| = 4 coins)

- Or go from 3 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 5 (5 coins), then from 5 to 2 (?), but that seems worse. So directly going from 3 to 2 is better.

Wait, but according to the example, it's 4 coins, which makes sense.

Last query: from City 5 to City 1:

- Go from 5 to 4 (1 coin)

- Go from 4 to 3 (1 coin)

- Go from 3 to 2 (4 coins)

- Go from 2 to 1 (8 coins)

Total: 1 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 14 coins

Alternatively, going directly from 5 to 1 would cost 20 coins, which is worse.

So, using the closest city moves seems advantageous when the direct distance is larger.

Now, considering the constraints:

- t test cases, up to 10^4

- n up to 10^5 per test case, but sum of n over all test cases <= 10^5

- m up to 10^5 per test case, but sum of m over all test cases <= 10^5

So, overall time complexity should be O(n + m) per test case, or carefully managed O(n log n) if necessary.

Given that, I need an efficient way to handle m queries per test case.

Looking at the reference solution:

It seems to precompute some information about moving forward to the closest city and backward.

It defines a function func_1 that computes for each city (except the last one) whether moving to the next city is the closest or not.

Wait, let's look closely.

In func_1:

- It iterates through the cities from 0 to n-2.

- For each city i, it looks at the previous city (back) and the next city (forward).

- If the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, it sets prog_cities[i] = 1, else sets it to the distance to the next city.

So, prog_cities[i] is either 1 or the distance to the next city, depending on which neighbor is closer.

Then, it computes prefix sums for these prog_cities.

Similarly, it reverses the list of cities and does the same thing to compute backward moves.

Then, for each query, depending on whether a < b or a > b, it uses the forward or backward prefix sums to compute the cost.

Wait, in the code:

if a < b:

print(pref_sum_f[b-1] - pref_sum_f[a-1])

else:

print(pref_sum_b[b-1] - pref_sum_b[a-1])

So, it's calculating the cumulative cost of moving from a to b via the closest cities, using precomputed prefix sums.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me think about how this works.

In the forward direction:

- For each city i, if the next city is closer than the previous one, prog_cities[i] = 1 (since moving to the closest city costs 1 coin), else it's the distance to the next city.

- Then, prefix sums are computed for these values.

Similarly, in the backward direction, it's done in reverse.

So, when a < b, it's moving forward from a to b, accumulating the costs as defined in prog_cities.

Wait, but in the example, moving from city 1 to city 4 involved moving to city 2 (cost 1), then to city 3 (cost 1), then to city 4 (cost 1), total 3 coins.

According to the prefix sums, pref_sum_f[3] - pref_sum_f[0] should be 3, which matches.

Similarly, from city 1 to city 5:

Move from 1 to 2 (1 coin), 2 to 3 (1 coin), 3 to 4 (1 coin), 4 to 5 (5 coins), total 8 coins.

pref_sum_f[4] - pref_sum_f[0] should be 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8, which matches.

From city 3 to city 4: pref_sum_f[3] - pref_sum_f[2] = 1, which matches.

From city 3 to city 2: since a < b doesn't hold here (a=3, b=2), it would use the backward prefix sums.

Compute pref_sum_b[1] - pref_sum_b[2]. Wait, indices are off.

Wait, cities are 1-indexed, prefix sums are 0-indexed.

Need to be careful with indexing.

Wait, in the code:

pref_sum_f = [0]

for i in range(n-1):

pref_sum_f.append(pref_sum_f[i] + forward_cities[i])

Similarly for pref_sum_b.

So, pref_sum_f[0] = 0

pref_sum_f[1] = forward_cities[0]

pref_sum_f[2] = forward_cities[0] + forward_cities[1]

and so on.

Given that, for a query from a to b, if a < b, it's pref_sum_f[b-1] - pref_sum_f[a-1]

Yes, that makes sense.

Similarly for a > b, using the backward prefix sums.

Seems like this is an efficient way to precompute the costs of moving via closest cities in both directions.

But is this always optimal?

In other words, is it always better to move via the closest cities in one direction rather than sometimes taking direct jumps?

Looking back at the example, it seems to work.

Another test case: suppose cities at [0,1,2,3,4], and I need to go from 1 to 4.

If I move via closest cities:

1 -> 2 (1 coin)

2 -> 3 (1 coin)

3 -> 4 (1 coin)

Total: 3 coins

Directly: |1-4| = 3 coins

So, same cost.

But according to the problem, moving via closest cities should be at least as good as the direct jump, or better.

Wait, in this case, it's the same.

But in the earlier example, moving via closest cities was better than direct jump.

Wait, in the first example, moving from 1 to 4:

Via closest cities: 3 coins

Directly: 15 coins

So, via closest cities is better.

In the second example, moving from 1 to 5:

Via closest cities: 8 coins

Directly: 20 coins

Again, via closest cities is better.

In the third example, moving from 3 to 4:

Via closest cities: 1 coin

Directly: 3 coins

Better via closest cities.

From 3 to 2:

Via closest cities: 4 coins

Directly: 4 coins

Same.

From 5 to 1:

Via closest cities: 14 coins

Directly: 20 coins

Better via closest cities.

So, in all these cases, moving via closest cities is at least as good as direct jump.

Is this always the case?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose cities at [0,100,101]

Closest cities:

City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (100)

City 2 (100): closest is city 3 (101)

City 3 (101): closest is city 2 (100)

Now, query from city 1 to city 3.

Via closest cities:

1 -> 2 (1 coin)

2 -> 3 (1 coin)

Total: 2 coins

Directly: |0 - 101| = 101 coins

So, via closest cities is better.

Another query: from city 2 to city 3.

Via closest cities: 1 coin

Directly: 1 coin

Same.

So, in this case, it's the same.

Wait, but in this case, moving directly costs 1 coin, which is the same as moving via closest cities.

But according to the problem, in this setup, city 2's closest city is city 3, and city 3's closest city is city 2.

So, moving from city 2 to city 3 is either 1 coin via closest city or directly 1 coin.

So, same cost.

Hence, moving via closest cities is not worse than direct jump.

Hence, in all cases, moving via closest cities is at least as good as direct jump.

Therefore, the minimal cost path would be to move via closest cities until you reach the target.

Hence, precomputing the costs of moving via closest cities in both directions and using prefix sums to answer range queries seems correct.

Hence, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**
