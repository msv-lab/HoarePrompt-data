Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad wants to hold m rounds of a competition, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. He already has a bank of n problems with various difficulties, and if he doesn't have enough problems for the m rounds, he needs to create some more. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of new problems he needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

First, I need to understand the requirements. Each round requires one problem of each difficulty level. So for m rounds, he needs m problems of each level A through G. That means, in total, he needs 7*m problems, with m problems of each difficulty.

Now, he already has n problems in his bank, each with a difficulty from A to G. I need to check how many of each difficulty he has and see if it's enough for m rounds. If not, calculate how many more he needs to create.

Let's think about it step by step.

1. **Identify the number of problems needed for m rounds:**
   - For each difficulty level (A, B, C, D, E, F, G), he needs m problems.
   - So total problems needed: 7*m.

2. **Check the current problem bank:**
   - He has n problems with difficulties from A to G.
   - I need to count how many problems he has for each difficulty level.

3. **Calculate the shortfall for each difficulty:**
   - For each difficulty level, if the number of problems he has is less than m, he needs to create m - (number he has) more problems for that level.
   - If he has more than or equal to m problems for a level, he doesn't need to create any more for that level.

4. **Sum up the shortfalls for all difficulty levels:**
   - This will give the total number of new problems he needs to create.

Wait a minute, I think I've got that right. Let me see if there are any edge cases or special conditions I need to consider.

- **Edge Case 1:** m = 1, n = 7, and he has one problem of each difficulty. In this case, he doesn't need to create any new problems.
- **Edge Case 2:** m = 2, n = 7, and he has one problem of each difficulty. Then, for each difficulty, he has 1 problem but needs 2, so he needs to create 1 more of each, totaling 7 new problems.
- **Edge Case 3:** m = 1, n = 0. He has no problems, so he needs to create 7 new problems, one for each difficulty.
- **Edge Case 4:** m = 0, n = 10. But m is at least 1, as per the problem constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ 5), so m=0 isn't possible.
- **Edge Case 5:** m = 5, n = 35, and he has exactly 5 problems of each difficulty. Then, he doesn't need to create any new problems.
- **Edge Case 6:** m = 5, n = 30, and he has 4 problems of each difficulty. Then, he needs to create 7 more problems, one for each difficulty.

Also, the problem mentions that there may not be enough problems, so he may have to create some, and we need to find the minimum number of problems he needs to create.

Now, looking at the example provided:

- Input: 10 1 BGECDCBDED

- He has 10 problems: B,G,E,C,D,C,B,D,E,D

- For m=1, he needs 1 problem of each A,B,C,D,E,F,G.

- Checking the counts:

  - A: 0 (needs 1, so +1)

  - B: 3 (has 3, which is more than needed)

  - C: 2 (has 2, which is more than needed)

  - D: 3 (has 3, which is more than needed)

  - E: 3 (has 3, which is more than needed)

  - F: 0 (needs 1, so +1)

  - G: 1 (has 1, which is enough)

- Total new problems needed: 2 (one A and one F)

- Which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

- 10 2 BGECDCBDED

- He has the same 10 problems.

- For m=2, he needs 2 problems of each A,B,C,D,E,F,G.

- Checking counts:

  - A: 0 (needs 2)

  - B: 3 (has 3, which is more than needed)

  - C: 2 (has 2, which is enough)

  - D: 3 (has 3, which is more than needed)

  - E: 3 (has 3, which is more than needed)

  - F: 0 (needs 2)

  - G: 1 (has 1, needs 2, so +1)

- Total new problems: 2 (A) + 2 (F) + 1 (G) = 5

- Which matches the sample output.

One more sample:

- 9 1 BBCDEFFGG

- He has 9 problems: B,B,C,D,E,F,F,G,G

- For m=1, needs 1 of each A,B,C,D,E,F,G.

- Counts:

  - A: 0 (needs 1)

  - B: 2 (has 2, which is more than needed)

  - C: 1 (has 1, which is enough)

  - D: 1 (has 1, which is enough)

  - E: 1 (has 1, which is enough)

  - F: 2 (has 2, which is more than needed)

  - G: 2 (has 2, which is more than needed)

- Total new problems: 1 (A)

- Which matches the sample output.

So, my initial approach seems to align with the sample inputs and outputs.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

from collections import Counter

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

ans = 0

p = 'ABCDEFG'

hmp = Counter(s)

for i in p:

if i not in hmp:

ans += m

for i in hmp:

if hmp[i] < m:

ans += m - hmp[i]

print(ans)



Let's analyze this step by step.

1. It reads the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case, it reads n (number of problems) and m (number of rounds), and then the string s representing the difficulties of the problems.

3. It initializes ans (answer) to 0.

4. It defines p as 'ABCDEFG', which are the required difficulty levels.

5. It creates a Counter object hmp from the string s, which counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the problem bank.

6. It then iterates over each difficulty level in p:

- If the difficulty level is not in hmp, it adds m to ans because he needs m problems of that difficulty and has none.

- Then, it iterates over each key in hmp:

- If the count of that difficulty is less than m, it adds m - hmp[i] to ans.

Wait a second, there might be a potential double-counting issue here.

Consider a difficulty level that is in hmp but hmp[i] < m. For such levels, the code first checks if i not in hmp and adds m if it's not present, which is correct. Then, it checks again within the hmp keys if hmp[i] < m and adds m - hmp[i].

But, for levels that are in hmp, the first loop (for i in p) will only add m to ans if i not in hmp. For levels that are in hmp, it won't add anything in the first loop, and then in the second loop, it checks if hmp[i] < m and adds m - hmp[i].

So, for levels present in hmp:

- If hmp[i] < m, it adds m - hmp[i].

- If hmp[i] >= m, it adds nothing.

For levels not in hmp:

- It adds m in the first loop.

This seems correct. It ensures that for each required difficulty level, if it's missing, add m, and if it's present but insufficient, add the difference.

Given that, and matching it with the sample inputs and outputs, it seems the program is correctly implementing the required logic.

Therefore, I would say the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{2} \]
