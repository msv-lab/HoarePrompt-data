Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2, which makes sense because each pair of islands is connected.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. Our job is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, given that Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand what it means for Dominater to act optimally. Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so he should try to cut off as many islands as possible from island 1 by destroying bridges.

In graph terms, this is about connecting or disconnecting components of the graph by removing edges (bridges). Everule can reach all islands that are connected to island 1 via some path of bridges that haven't been destroyed.

So, the goal is to maximize the number of islands that are disconnected from island 1 by destroying at most k bridges.

Wait, no. Actually, Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, which means maximizing the number of islands that are disconnected from island 1.

But the problem says to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, so it's the number of islands that remain connected to island 1 after Dominater has destroyed up to k bridges.

Let me think about this differently. In a complete graph, every island is directly connected to every other island. To isolate island 1 from other islands, Dominater needs to break all paths from island 1 to the other islands.

But since it's a complete graph, to disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater needs to remove all bridges connected to island 1. Wait, no. That would disconnect island 1 from every other island, but Dominater can only destroy up to k bridges.

Wait, no. In a complete graph, to disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater needs to remove all bridges connected to island 1. Since island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands, there are n-1 bridges directly connected to island 1.

If Dominater removes all of these n-1 bridges, then island 1 is completely isolated, and Everule can only visit island 1.

But Dominater can only destroy up to k bridges. So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can remove all bridges connected to island 1, and Everule can only visit island 1.

On the other hand, if k < n-1, then some bridges connected to island 1 remain, and Everule can reach those islands directly. Furthermore, even if some direct bridges are removed, Everule might still reach other islands through indirect paths via other islands.

But in a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two islands, so it's tricky to disconnect islands completely.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of bridges Dominater needs to remove to disconnect a particular island from island 1.

In a complete graph, to disconnect island A from island 1, Dominater needs to remove all bridges that connect island A to island 1 and to any island that can reach island 1.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Let me look at some examples from the input and output provided.

First test case:

Input: 2 0

Output: 2

Explanation: No bridges can be destroyed, so Everule can reach both islands.

Second test case:

Input: 2 1

Output: 1

Explanation: Dominater can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Third test case:

Input: 4 1

Output: 4

Explanation: With n=4, and k=1, Dominater can destroy one bridge. But even after destroying one bridge, Everule can still reach all four islands through other paths.

Fourth test case:

Input: 5 10

Output: 1

Explanation: With n=5, the total number of bridges is 10. If k=10, Dominater can destroy all bridges, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Fifth test case:

Input: 5 3

Output: 5

Explanation: With n=5 and k=3, Dominater can destroy 3 bridges, but Everule can still reach all five islands through remaining bridges.

Sixth test case:

Input: 4 4

Output: 1

Explanation: With n=4, total bridges are 6. If k=4, Dominater can destroy 4 bridges. Depending on which bridges are destroyed, Everule might be able to reach only island 1.

From these examples, it seems that if k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1, else Everule can visit all n islands.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=4, k=1, and output is 4, meaning Everule can visit all islands.

But according to the above statement, since k=1 < n-1=3, Everule can visit all islands.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=5, k=3, which is less than n-1=4, so Everule can visit all five islands.

In the sixth test case, n=4, k=4. Now, k=4 is greater than or equal to n-1=3, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, which is greater than or equal to n-1=4, but total bridges are 10, so destroying all 10 bridges isolates island 1.

But actually, n-1=4, which is less than 10, so k >= n-1 would hold.

Wait, but in the third test case, k=1 < n-1=3, so Everule can visit all islands.

In the sixth test case, k=4 >= n-1=3, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Seems consistent.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If k >= n-1, then Everule can only visit island 1.

- Else, Everule can visit all n islands.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, k=10, which is greater than n-1=4, so Everule can only visit island 1.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, n=5, k=3 < 4, so Everule can visit all five islands.

Yes, this seems to hold.

So, the condition is:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Wait, but in the third test case, n=4, k=1 < 3, so print 4.

In the sixth test case, k=4 >= 3, so print 1.

Seems correct.

But let's verify with the fourth test case: n=5, k=10 >= 4, so print 1.

Fifth test case: n=5, k=3 < 4, so print 5.

Yes, matches the output.

So, the logic seems to be that if k is at least n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1 by destroying all its connections to other islands, hence Everule can only visit island 1.

Otherwise, if k < n-1, there are still some connections from island 1 to other islands, and since the graph is complete, Everule can reach all islands through some paths.

Wait, but is this always true? In a complete graph, even if some bridges are destroyed, there might still be multiple paths between islands.

But, if Dominater destroys all n-1 bridges connected to island 1, then island 1 is isolated.

If Dominater destroys fewer than n-1 bridges, there are still some direct bridges from island 1 to some islands.

Moreover, even if direct bridges are destroyed, there might be indirect paths through other islands.

But in a complete graph, as long as island 1 is connected to at least one other island, and that island is connected to all others, Everule can reach all islands.

Wait, perhaps the key is to ensure that island 1 remains connected to at least one other island, unless Dominater destroys all n-1 bridges connected to island 1.

So, if k < n-1, Dominater cannot disconnect island 1 from all other islands, meaning Everule can reach all islands.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from all other islands, so Everule can only visit island 1.

This seems to align with the examples.

Hence, the program should check if k >= n-1:

if yes, print 1

else, print n

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n - 1)

Wait a second, in the else clause, it prints n - 1, but according to my reasoning, it should print n.

Looking back at the examples:

Third test case: n=4, k=1 < 3, so print 4, but according to the program, it would print n - 1 = 3, which doesn't match the example output of 4.

Wait, that's a discrepancy.

Similarly, fifth test case: n=5, k=3 < 4, program would print n - 1 = 4, but example output is 5.

This suggests that the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation of the third test case, it says that Everule can still visit all four islands despite Dominater destroying one bridge.

Hence, the correct output should be 4, but according to the program, it would print n - 1 = 3, which is incorrect.

Similarly, in the fifth test case, correct output is 5, but program would print n - 1 = 4, which is wrong.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

The correct logic is:

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Not print(n - 1) in the else clause.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
