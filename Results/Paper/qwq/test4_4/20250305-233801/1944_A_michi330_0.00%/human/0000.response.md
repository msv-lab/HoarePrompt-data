Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

There are n islands, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. So, it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n(n-1)/2.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit, assuming Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand the problem. Everule starts from island 1 and can travel through bridges to other islands. Dominater wants to limit this travel by destroying up to k bridges.

My goal is to find out how many islands Everule can still reach despite Dominater's actions.

Let me think about graph theory terms. Islands are nodes, and bridges are edges. It's a complete graph, meaning every pair of nodes is connected by an edge.

Everule starts from node 1 and can traverse the graph via edges. Dominater can remove up to k edges to minimize the number of nodes Everule can reach.

I need to find the minimum number of nodes that remain accessible from node 1 after Dominater removes up to k edges.

I recall that in graph theory, the connected component containing a node is the set of all nodes reachable from it. In a complete graph, the entire graph is connected, but by removing edges, we can split it into smaller components.

Dominater wants to minimize the size of the connected component containing node 1.

Given that it's a complete graph, the strategy for Dominater would be to cut off as many nodes as possible from node 1 by removing edges.

Let's consider that in a complete graph, node 1 is connected to n-1 other nodes directly.

If Dominater removes edges connected to node 1, he can isolate it from other nodes.

But Dominater can only remove up to k edges.

So, if k is at least n-1, Dominater can remove all edges connected to node 1, isolating it. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.

If k is less than n-1, Dominater can only remove k edges from node 1, meaning Everule can still reach at least (n-1 - k) nodes directly, plus node 1 itself.

Wait, but it's a complete graph, so there might be other paths to reach nodes even if some direct edges are removed.

Hmm, that complicates things.

Let me think again.

In a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes. So, even if some bridges are destroyed, there might still be alternative paths.

Therefore, it's not as simple as just counting the direct edges from node 1.

I need to consider the overall connectivity.

Let me consider that in a complete graph, removing edges won't necessarily disconnect the graph unless a certain number of edges are removed.

I need to find out the minimum number of nodes that remain connected to node 1 after removing up to k edges.

I recall that in graph theory, the concept of vertex connectivity and edge connectivity comes into play.

Edge connectivity is the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to disconnect the graph.

In a complete graph with n nodes, the edge connectivity is n-1, meaning you need to remove at least n-1 edges to disconnect the graph.

But in this problem, Dominater can remove up to k edges.

So, if k is less than n-1, the graph remains connected, and Everule can reach all n nodes.

If k is equal to or greater than n-1, Dominater can start disconnecting nodes from node 1.

Wait, but in a complete graph, even if you remove n-1 edges, there might still be paths through other nodes.

I need to think carefully.

Let me consider small values of n and k.

Take n=2, k=0.

So, two islands connected by one bridge. No bridges are destroyed. Everule can visit both islands. So, the answer is 2.

n=2, k=1.

Dominater can destroy the single bridge between the two islands. Now, Everule can only visit island 1. Answer is 1.

n=3, k=1.

Three islands, connected by three bridges.

If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between island 1 and 2, Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3, since island 1 is connected to 3, and 3 is connected to 2.

So, Everule can still reach all three islands. Answer is 3.

n=3, k=2.

If Dominater destroys two bridges, say between 1 and 2, and 1 and 3.

Everule is isolated from islands 2 and 3, but since island 2 and 3 are still connected, they are still part of the connected component containing island 1, because Everule can reach them via island 3.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Dominater destroys two bridges, say between 1 and 2, and 1 and 3.

Then, Everule cannot reach island 2 or 3 directly, but island 2 and 3 are still connected by a bridge between them.

So, the entire graph is still connected through island 3 to island 2.

Therefore, Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but in this case, the graph is still connected, so Everule can reach all islands.

Wait, but Dominater's goal is to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

So, in n=3, k=2, the answer is still 3.

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=3, k=2, the answer should be 3.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem, for n=4, k=1, the answer is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Similarly, for n=5, k=10, which is all possible bridges for n=5 (since 5*4/2=10), so Dominater can destroy all bridges, and Everule can only visit island 1, so answer is 1.

Another case: n=5, k=3.

Total bridges are 10. Dominater can destroy 3 bridges.

Everule should still be able to reach all islands, since the graph remains connected.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=5, k=3, the answer is 5.

Lastly, n=4, k=4.

Total bridges are 6. Dominater can destroy 4 bridges.

I need to see if Everule can still reach all islands.

But in this case, Dominater can disconnect island 1 from the others by removing all its connections.

Wait, n=4, k=4.

If Dominater removes all 3 edges connected to island 1, that's 3 edges, but k=4, so he can remove one more edge.

But even if he removes all 3 edges connected to island 1, the other islands are still connected among themselves.

So, Everule is isolated from the rest, but the other islands are connected among themselves.

So, the connected component containing island 1 has only island 1.

Hence, the answer is 1.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=4, k=4, the answer is 1.

Similarly, for n=5, k=10, answer is 1.

Ok, so from these examples, it seems that if k is at least n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

Otherwise, Everule can visit all islands.

Wait, but in n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

n=4, k=4, answer is 1.

So, the threshold seems to be k >= n-1.

If k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1.

Else, Everule can visit all islands.

Wait, but in n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

n=5, k=10, answer is 1.

And n=5, k=10 is equal to the total number of bridges, which is 10.

So, it makes sense that if k is up to n-1, Everule can still reach all islands.

Only when k is at least n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Wait, but in n=4, k=4, which is more than n-1=3, answer is 1.

In n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

In n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

In n=5, k=10, answer is 1.

So, it seems that as long as k is less than n-1, Everule can reach all islands.

If k is at least n-1, Everule can only reach island 1.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3, which is equal to n-1=3, answer is 1.

In n=4, k=4, answer is 1.

So, seems that if k >= n-1, answer is 1.

Else, answer is n.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

For n=4, k=3, answer is 1.

For n=4, k=4, answer is 1.

Wait, but according to this logic, for n=4, k=3, which is equal to n-1=3, answer is 1.

For k < n-1, answer is n.

That seems consistent with the examples.

So, the strategy for Dominater is to remove all n-1 edges connected to island 1, isolating it from the rest.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can do this, and Everule can only visit island 1.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, so Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but in n=3, k=2, which is n-1=2, answer should be 1.

But earlier I thought that even if k=2 in n=3, Everule can still reach all islands because the other two islands are connected.

Wait, but according to the logic, if k >= n-1, answer is 1.

But in n=3, k=2, answer should be 1.

But in n=4, k=3, answer is 1.

In n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

In n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

In n=5, k=10, answer is 1.

So, the pattern is that if k >= n-1, answer is 1.

Else, answer is n.

Wait, but in n=3, k=2, which is n-1=2, answer should be 1.

But intuitively, if Dominater removes all 2 edges connected to island 1, Everule is isolated.

Even though islands 2 and 3 are connected, Everule cannot reach them.

So, answer is 1.

Similarly, in n=4, k=3, answer is 1.

In n=4, k=4, answer is 1.

In n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

Wait, but in n=5, k=3, which is less than n-1=4, so answer is 5.

In n=5, k=4, answer would be 1.

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

For n=5, k=10, answer is 1.

So, seems that the threshold is k >= n-1.

If k >= n-1, answer is 1.

Else, answer is n.

So, the program seems to implement this logic.

Let me look at the program.

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Wait, in the given program, it's slightly different.

It's:

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n - 1)

But according to my reasoning, it should be print(n) when k < n-1.

But in the example, for n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

For n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

So, it should be print(n).

But in the program, it's print(n -1), which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking back, it's:

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n - 1)

Wait, no, in the initial message, it's print(n -1).

But in the example, for n=4, k=1, answer is 4, which is n, not n-1.

So, the program is incorrect.

It should be print(n) when k < n-1.

Wait, but in the program, it's print(n -1).

That's a mistake.

It should be print(n) when k < n-1.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says:

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands despite what Dominater does.

Hence, when k < n-1, Everule can reach all islands, which is n islands.

So, the correct output should be n when k < n-1.

In the program, it's printing n-1, which is wrong.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

But according to the program, it would print 3.

Which is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

Wait, but perhaps there is something I'm missing.

Let me check the problem statement again.

Find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, assuming Dominater acts optimally to minimize this number.

Given that, Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

Everule starts from island 1.

In the complete graph, all islands are connected.

Dominater can remove up to k bridges.

The goal is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit after Dominater removes up to k bridges optimally.

From my earlier reasoning, if k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only visit 1 island.

If k < n-1, Dominater cannot isolate island 1, so Everule can visit all n islands.

Hence, the correct logic is:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But in the program, it's print(n -1) when k < n-1.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

Wait, but in the initial problem, in the example, for n=4, k=1, answer is 4.

For n=5, k=3, answer is 5.

For n=4, k=3, answer is 1.

For n=4, k=4, answer is 1.

So, seems that when k >= n-1, answer is 1.

Else, answer is n.

Hence, the program should be:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But in the given program, it's print(n -1) when k < n-1.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

Wait, but perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Maybe in the program, it's intended to be print(n) when k < n-1.

But in the code snippet, it's print(n -1).

That's a typo or mistake.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intends something else.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

So, it includes island 1 in the count.

Hence, if k >= n-1, Everule can only visit island 1, so answer is 1.

Else, Everule can visit all islands, so answer is n.

Hence, the program should be:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But in the given program, it's print(n -1) when k < n-1, which is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

Wait, but perhaps there is a different interpretation.

Maybe considering that island 1 is always included, and the rest n-1 islands can be cut off partially.

But according to the problem, Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.

Given that, the minimal number is 1, when k >= n-1.

Else, it's n.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

Wait, but perhaps in the program, it's a typo, and it should be print(n) instead of print(n -1).

But as per the given program, it's print(n -1).

Hence, it's incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, starting from island 1, after Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges optimally.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Graph**:
   - We have a complete graph with \( n \) islands, where every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can traverse through the bridges to reach other islands.

2. **Dominater's Strategy**:
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.
   - To isolate island 1 from as many other islands as possible, Dominater should aim to cut off all direct connections from island 1.

3. **Critical Observation**:
   - Island 1 is directly connected to \( n-1 \) other islands.
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), Dominater can destroy all these \( n-1 \) bridges, isolating island 1. Hence, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still reach some other islands. Since the graph is complete, there will always be alternate paths via other islands, ensuring that all islands remain connected.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), the number of islands Everule can visit is 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), the number of islands Everule can visit is \( n \).

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the values of \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n-1 \), print 1 because island 1 is isolated.
   - Otherwise, print \( n \) because all islands remain connected.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Dominater's optimal strategy is to destroy bridges connected to island 1 to isolate it.
   - If Dominater destroys fewer than \( n-1 \) bridges, island 1 remains connected to at least one other island, and due to the completeness of the graph, all islands remain accessible.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on Dominater's optimal bridge destruction.
