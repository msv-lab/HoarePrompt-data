Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each of length n. I need to determine if there exists a template string t of length n, consisting of lowercase and/or uppercase Latin letters, such that strings a and b match the template t, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template t. The conditions are:

1. If the i-th character of t is lowercase, then the i-th character of the string must be exactly the same as the i-th character of t.

2. If the i-th character of t is uppercase, then the i-th character of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the i-th character of t.

Also, for string c, it should not match the template t, meaning that there should be at least one position where the condition fails.

My task is to find if such a template t exists for the given a, b, and c.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a template t such that:

- For each position i, if t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be equal to t[i], and c[i] must not be equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] and b[i] must be different from the lowercase version of t[i], and c[i] must be equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

Wait, no. Actually, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] is not equal to t[i].

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] is equal to the lowercase version of t[i].

But for a and b to match t, they must satisfy the conditions for all positions.

So, I need to choose t in such a way that:

- For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

- a[i].lower() != t[i].lower()

- b[i].lower() != t[i].lower()

- c[i].lower() == t[i].lower()

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- t[i] is uppercase: 

- a[i] must be different from t[i].lower()

- b[i] must be different from t[i].lower()

- c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower()

- t[i] is lowercase:

- a[i] must be equal to t[i]

- b[i] must be equal to t[i]

- c[i] must not be equal to t[i]

So, for each position i, I have two choices for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

I need to choose for each position i whether t[i] should be lowercase or uppercase, such that:

- If t[i] is lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

Also, I need to make sure that such a t exists.

Let me think about this position by position.

For each position i, I have two options for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

I need to choose for each position independently, and ensure that the choices satisfy the conditions for all positions.

Wait, but the choices are interdependent because t[i] affects a[i], b[i], and c[i] in different ways.

I need to find if there exists a combination of choices (lowercase or uppercase for each t[i]) such that:

- For a and b, all positions satisfy their respective conditions.

- For c, at least one position does not satisfy the condition.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved by checking constraints for each position and seeing if there's a way to satisfy all of them.

Let me consider each position independently first.

For each position i, I can consider the possible choices for t[i] based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me define:

- If I choose t[i] to be lowercase:

- t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be different from t[i].

- So, t[i] = a[i] = b[i] != c[i]

- If a[i] != b[i], then this choice is invalid.

- If a[i] = b[i] but c[i] == a[i], then this choice is invalid.

- If a[i] = b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then this choice is valid.

- If I choose t[i] to be uppercase:

- t[i].lower() must not be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower().

- So, t[i].lower() != a[i], t[i].lower() != b[i], and c[i] == t[i].lower().

- Which implies that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], because t[i].lower() cannot be equal to a[i] or b[i].

- Wait, no.

Wait, let's rephrase.

If t[i] is uppercase:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, t[i].lower() must be different from a[i] and b[i], but equal to c[i].

Therefore, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for t[i] to be uppercase:

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

- t[i].lower() != a[i]

- t[i].lower() != b[i]

Which implies:

- c[i] == t[i].lower() != a[i] and != b[i]

Therefore, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

So, for each position i, if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] to be uppercase with t[i].lower() = c[i].

Otherwise, if a[i] = b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] to be lowercase with t[i] = a[i].

Otherwise, no valid choice for t[i].

Wait, but I need to ensure that for c to not match t, there is at least one position where the condition fails.

Wait, hold on.

Actually, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, in other words, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where the condition is violated.

But for a and b, all positions must satisfy their conditions.

So, I need to choose t such that:

- For a and b, all positions satisfy:

- If t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower()

- For c, there exists at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me try to think differently.

I need to find a template t such that:

- a and b both match t

- c does not match t

So, first, I need to find the intersection of templates that a matches and templates that b matches, and then ensure that c does not match any of those templates.

Wait, actually, it's the intersection of templates that a matches and b matches, and then the complement of the set of templates that c matches.

So, it's (templates that a matches) intersect (templates that b matches) intersect (not (templates that c matches))

I need to check if this set is non-empty.

So, I need to find if there exists at least one template t that a and b both match, but c does not match.

To make this feasible, I need to find constraints for each position i and ensure that the choices for t[i] satisfy the conditions for a, b, and c.

Let's consider each position i independently.

For each position i, I can have two choices for t[i]: lowercase or uppercase.

For each choice, I need to check if it's valid given a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Then, across all positions, I need to ensure that:

- For a and b, all positions satisfy their conditions.

- For c, at least one position does not satisfy its condition.

This sounds like a problem that can be solved by checking for each position the possible choices for t[i], and then ensuring that there's a combination where at least one position for c fails.

Let me try to formalize this.

For each position i:

- If I choose t[i] to be lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- So, t[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] != a[i]

- Hence, a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] must not equal a[i]

- If these conditions are not met, choosing t[i] as lowercase is invalid

- If I choose t[i] to be uppercase:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

- So, t[i].lower() must be equal to c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

- Hence, c[i] must not equal a[i] and c[i] must not equal b[i]

- Additionally, t[i] can be either uppercase version of c[i]

- So, t[i] can be c[i].upper()

- But c[i] must not equal a[i] and c[i] must not equal b[i]

- So, for uppercase choice to be valid, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Now, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase with t[i] = a[i]

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase with t[i] = c[i].upper()

- In other cases, I may not have a valid choice

But I need to ensure that for c to not match t, there is at least one position where the condition fails.

Wait, but in the choices above, if I choose t[i] as lowercase where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then for that position, c does not match t, which is sufficient for c to not match t.

Similarly, if I choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then for that position, c matches t, which is not what I want.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I choose t[i] as uppercase, then for c to not match t, I need c[i] == t[i].lower(), which is exactly what I set t[i].lower() = c[i].

Wait, no.

Wait, if t[i] is uppercase, then for c to not match t, c[i] must not equal t[i].lower().

But I set t[i].lower() = c[i], so c[i] == t[i].lower(), which means c does not match t.

Wait, no.

Actually, if t[i] is uppercase, then for c to match t, c[i] must be equal to t[i].lower().

But I want c to not match t, so I need c[i] != t[i].lower().

Wait, no.

Wait, the condition for c not matching t is that there exists at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, to ensure c does not match t, I need at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

Wait, but in the uppercase case, if t[i].lower() == c[i], then c matches t at that position.

Wait, no.

Actually, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, to ensure c does not match t, I need to choose at least one position where one of these conditions holds.

But in practice, if I choose t[i] as lowercase where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then for that position, c[i] != t[i], which satisfies the condition for c not matching t.

Alternatively, if I choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then c[i] == t[i].lower(), which also satisfies the condition for c not matching t.

So, in either choice, if I can make at least one position where the condition for c not matching t holds, then I can satisfy the overall condition.

Therefore, I need to ensure that there is at least one position where:

- (t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i]) or (t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower())

Given the constraints on a and b, I need to choose t[i] such that a and b match t at all positions, and c does not match t at at least one position.

So, to summarize:

- For each position i:

- If I choose t[i] as lowercase:

- a[i] == t[i]

- b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- If I choose t[i] as uppercase:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

Now, I need to find if there exists a combination where for all positions, a and b match t, and there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Let me consider the possibilities.

Case 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

In this case, a and b match t, and c does not match t at this position.

Case 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Then, a and b match t (since a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower()), and c matches t at this position (since c[i] == t[i].lower()).

Wait, but I need c to not match t at at least one position.

So, if I choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then c matches t at this position, which is not what I want.

Wait, no, because I need c to not match t, meaning that there exists at least one position where c does not match t.

So, if I have at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower(), then c does not match t.

Wait, but in case 2, if I choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then c[i] == t[i].lower(), which means c matches t at this position.

But I need c to not match t at at least one position.

So, in this case, choosing t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b for some positions, and choosing t[j] as lowercase where a[j] == b[j] and c[j] != a[j] for at least one position j, would ensure that c does not match t at position j.

Alternatively, if I can't choose any position where t[i] is lowercase with c[i] != t[i], then I need to ensure that there's at least one position where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower().

Wait, but in the second case, choosing t[i] as uppercase makes c match t at that position, which is not helpful for making c not match t.

I'm getting confused here.

Let me think differently.

I need to find if there exists a template t such that:

- For all i, a matches t: if t[i] is lowercase, a[i] == t[i]; if t[i] is uppercase, a[i] != t[i].lower()

- For all i, b matches t: similarly

- There exists at least one i where c does not match t: if t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]; or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

To make this easier, perhaps I can iterate through each position and determine the possible choices for t[i], and then see if there's a combination where c fails at least one position.

Let's consider position i.

Possible choices for t[i]:

1. Choose t[i] as lowercase:

- t[i] = a[i] (which must equal b[i]), and c[i] != a[i]

- So, this is only possible if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. Choose t[i] as uppercase:

- t[i].lower() != a[i], t[i].lower() != b[i], and c[i] == t[i].lower()

- So, t[i].lower() must be c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Therefore, for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase.

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase.

- In other cases, I may not have a valid choice.

But I need to ensure that in the overall template, there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Wait, but in both choices, c does not match t at that position.

Wait, no.

If I choose t[i] as lowercase where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then c[i] != t[i], so c does not match t at that position.

If I choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then c[i] == t[i].lower(), which means c matches t at that position.

Wait, no, but in this case, c matches t at this position, but I need c to not match t at at least one position.

So, if I choose t[i] as uppercase where c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then c matches t at this position, which is not sufficient for c not to match t.

I need to have at least one position where c does not match t.

So, to ensure that c does not match t, I need to have at least one position where:

- t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower()

In the first choice (t[i] lowercase), if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then choosing t[i] as lowercase satisfies c not matching t at that position.

In the second choice (t[i] uppercase), if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then choosing t[i] as uppercase makes c match t at that position, which is not helpful for c not matching t.

Therefore, to ensure that c does not match t, I need to have at least one position where t[i] is lowercase and c[i] != t[i].

If I can't have any position where t[i] is lowercase with c[i] != t[i], then I need to ensure that there's at least one position where t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower().

But in the uppercase choice, c matches t at that position, which is not what I want.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here.

Let me try to think in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions.

First, for a and b to match t, at each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower()

Second, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position j where:

- If t[j] is lowercase, then c[j] != t[j]

- If t[j] is uppercase, then c[j] == t[j].lower()

So, in other words, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position j where c[j] != t[j] if t[j] is lowercase, or c[j] == t[j].lower() if t[j] is uppercase.

Now, I need to choose t such that:

- For all i, a matches t and b matches t

- There exists at least one j where c does not match t

Given that, I need to ensure that:

- For each position i:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == t[i] and b[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != t[i].lower() and b[i] != t[i].lower()

- And there exists at least one j where:

- If t[j] is lowercase, then c[j] != t[j]

- Or if t[j] is uppercase, then c[j] == t[j].lower()

To make this manageable, perhaps I can consider the following approach:

- For each position i, determine if it's possible to choose t[i] as lowercase or uppercase based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

- Then, ensure that in the chosen template, there is at least one position where c does not match t.

Let's consider position i:

- Option 1: Choose t[i] as lowercase

- Requirements:

- a[i] == b[i] == t[i]

- c[i] != t[i]

- So, a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: Choose t[i] as uppercase

- Requirements:

- a[i] != t[i].lower()

- b[i] != t[i].lower()

- c[i] == t[i].lower()

- So, t[i].lower() != a[i], t[i].lower() != b[i], and c[i] == t[i].lower()

- Therefore, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

So, for each position i, I can choose t[i] as lowercase only if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

Or choose t[i] as uppercase only if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Now, for the template to satisfy the conditions, I need to choose for each position i either option 1 or option 2, and ensure that at least one position is chosen such that c does not match t.

Wait, but in option 1, c does not match t at position i, and in option 2, c matches t at position i.

Therefore, if I choose at least one position with option 1, then c does not match t at that position.

If I choose all positions with option 2, then c matches t at all positions, which is not allowed.

Therefore, to have c not match t, I need to choose at least one position with option 1.

So, I need to check if there exists at least one position i where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

If such a position exists, then I can choose t[i] as lowercase for that position, and for all other positions, choose either option that is valid.

If no such position exists, then I cannot have c not match t, because I would have to choose all positions with option 2, which makes c match t at all positions, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the existence of such a template t is equivalent to the existence of at least one position i where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

Wait, but there might be positions where option 2 is not available.

Wait, no, if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose option 1 for that position, and for other positions, as long as I have valid choices, I can choose option 2 if necessary.

But I need to ensure that for positions where I choose option 2, option 2 is valid, i.e., c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, no, if a[i] != b[i], then I cannot choose option 1, because a[i] != b[i], so a[i] == b[i] condition fails.

Wait, I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase, which ensures that c does not match t at this position.

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase, which makes c match t at this position.

- If a[i] != b[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase, because a[i] != b[i].

- If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase.

- If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase, because c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i] would violate the condition for uppercase.

Therefore, for positions where a[i] != b[i]:

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase.

- Else, I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase, and since I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase (because a[i] != b[i]), there is no valid choice for t[i] at this position.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that a and b are strings of length n consisting of only lowercase letters, and n is at least 1.

So, for positions where a[i] != b[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], I can choose t[i] as uppercase.

For positions where a[i] != b[i], but c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then I cannot choose t[i] as uppercase, and since I cannot choose t[i] as lowercase (because a[i] != b[i]), there is no valid choice for t[i] at this position.

Therefore, for such positions, there is no valid choice for t[i], meaning that no valid template t exists.

Wait, but perhaps I can still have a valid template if I can choose t[i] in a way that satisfies the conditions for a, b, and c.

Wait, let's consider an example.

Suppose n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Then, position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'c'

Since a[1] != b[1], and c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1], I can choose t[1] as uppercase with t[1] = 'C'

Then:

- a[1] = 'a' != 'c' (since t[1] is uppercase, t[1].lower() = 'c')

- b[1] = 'b' != 'c'

- c[1] = 'c' == 'c'

So, c does not match t at this position because t[1] is uppercase and c[1] == t[1].lower()

Wait, but according to the problem, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, in this case, t[1] is uppercase, and c[1] == t[1].lower(), which means c does not match t at this position.

Therefore, choosing t[1] as uppercase satisfies the condition for c not matching t at this position.

Similarly, if a[1] == b[1] and c[1] != a[1], I can choose t[1] as lowercase, which also makes c not match t at this position.

So, in this example, I can choose t = "C", which is uppercase, and it satisfies the conditions.

Another example:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "a"

Then, position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a'

Here, a[1] != b[1], and c[1] == a[1], so I cannot choose t[1] as uppercase because c[1] == a[1].

Also, I cannot choose t[1] as lowercase because a[1] != b[1].

Therefore, no valid choice for t[1], meaning no valid template t exists.

So, in this case, the answer should be "NO"

Another example:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "a"

c = "b"

Then, position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'b'

Here, a[1] == b[1] and c[1] != a[1], so I can choose t[1] as lowercase with t[1] = 'a'

Then, c[1] = 'b' != 'a', so c does not match t at this position.

Therefore, t = "a" satisfies the conditions.

Another example:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'a'

Here, a[1] != b[1], and c[1] == a[1], so I cannot choose t[1] as uppercase.

Therefore, no valid choice for t[1]

Position 2:

a[2] = 'a', b[2] = 'b', c[2] = 'a'

Same as position 1.

Therefore, no valid template exists.

Hence, "NO"

Another example:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

I need to check for each position i:

- If a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], then I can choose t[i] as lowercase.

- If c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], then I can choose t[i] as uppercase.

- If a[i] != b[i], and c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i], then no valid choice for t[i].

Let's check position by position.

Position 1:

a[1] = 'm', b[1] = 'l', c[1] = 'a'

a[1] != b[1], c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1] → can choose t[1] as uppercase.

Position 2:

a[2] = 'a', b[2] = 'u', c[2] = 'd'

a[2] != b[2], c[2] != a[2] and c[2] != b[2] → can choose t[2] as uppercase.

Position 3:

a[3] = 't', b[3] = 'c', c[3] = 'h'

a[3] != b[3], c[3] != a[3] and c[3] != b[3] → can choose t[3] as uppercase.

Position 4:

a[4] = 'h', b[4] = 'k', c[4] = 'o'

a[4] != b[4], c[4] != a[4] and c[4] != b[4] → can choose t[4] as uppercase.

Position 5:

a[5] = 'f', b[5] = 'f', c[5] = 'c'

a[5] == b[5], c[5] != a[5] → can choose t[5] as lowercase.

Position 6:

a[6] = 'o', b[6] = 'o', c[6] = 'o'

a[6] == b[6], c[6] == a[6] → cannot choose t[6] as lowercase.

Also, c[6] == a[6], so cannot choose t[6] as uppercase.

Therefore, no valid choice for t[6].

Hence, no valid template exists for this case.

Wait, but in the example output, it's "YES" for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, c = "adhoccoder"

Wait, position 6:

a[6] = 'r', b[6] = 'c', c[6] = 'o'

Wait, no, a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

Wait, n=10.

Let me align the positions correctly.

a = "m a t h f o r c e s"

b = "l u c k f o r c e s"

c = "a d h o c c o d e r"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'm', b[1] = 'l', c[1] = 'a'

a[1] != b[1], c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1] → can choose t[1] as uppercase.

Position 2:

a[2] = 'a', b[2] = 'u', c[2] = 'd'

a[2] != b[2], c[2] != a[2] and c[2] != b[2] → can choose t[2] as uppercase.

Position 3:

a[3] = 't', b[3] = 'c', c[3] = 'h'

a[3] != b[3], c[3] != a[3] and c[3] != b[3] → can choose t[3] as uppercase.

Position 4:

a[4] = 'h', b[4] = 'k', c[4] = 'o'

a[4] != b[4], c[4] != a[4] and c[4] != b[4] → can choose t[4] as uppercase.

Position 5:

a[5] = 'f', b[5] = 'f', c[5] = 'c'

a[5] == b[5], c[5] != a[5] → can choose t[5] as lowercase.

Position 6:

a[6] = 'o', b[6] = 'r', c[6] = 'c'

a[6] != b[6], c[6] != a[6] and c[6] != b[6] → can choose t[6] as uppercase.

Position 7:

a[7] = 'r', b[7] = 'c', c[7] = 'o'

a[7] != b[7], c[7] != a[7] and c[7] != b[7] → can choose t[7] as uppercase.

Position 8:

a[8] = 'c', b[8] = 'e', c[8] = 'd'

a[8] != b[8], c[8] != a[8] and c[8] != b[8] → can choose t[8] as uppercase.

Position 9:

a[9] = 'e', b[9] = 's', c[9] = 'e'

a[9] != b[9], c[9] == a[9] → cannot choose t[9] as uppercase.

Since a[9] != b[9], and c[9] == a[9], I cannot choose t[9] as uppercase.

Hence, no valid choice for t[9].

Therefore, no valid template exists.

But in the example output, it's "YES" for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Wait, in position 9:

a[9] = 'e', b[9] = 's', c[9] = 'e'

a[9] != b[9], and c[9] == a[9]

So, I cannot choose t[9] as uppercase because c[9] == a[9], which violates the condition for uppercase.

Also, I cannot choose t[9] as lowercase because a[9] != b[9].

Hence, no valid choice for t[9].

Therefore, no valid template exists.

But the example output is "YES", so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose t[5] as lowercase, which ensures that c does not match t at position 5.

Then, for position 9, even if I choose t[9] as uppercase, since c[9] == a[9], it would make c match t at position 9, but since c does not match t at position 5, overall c does not match t.

Wait, but earlier I thought that choosing t[i] as uppercase makes c match t at that position, which is not desirable.

Wait, no, when t[i] is uppercase, c does not match t if c[i] == t[i].lower().

Wait, no, according to the problem:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then for c to not match t, c[i] == t[i].lower()

- So, if t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower(), then c does not match t at that position.

Wait, I think I'm confusing myself.

Let me re-read the problem.

"The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold for all i from 1 to n :

- if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ;

- if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i ."

"For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string."

"Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't hold for at least one i ."

So, for c to not match t, there must be at least one position where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == t[i].lower()

In other words, c does not match t if there exists at least one position i where:

- t[i].islower() and c[i] != t[i], or

- t[i].isupper() and c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, in position 9:

If I choose t[9] as uppercase with t[9].lower() = c[9] = 'e', then c[i] == t[i].lower(), which means c does not match t at this position.

Wait, but earlier I thought that choosing t[i] as uppercase makes c match t at that position, but according to the problem, it's the opposite.

Wait, let's clarify:

- If t[i] is uppercase, then for c to match t, c[i] must be different from t[i].lower()

- So, if t[i] is uppercase and c[i] == t[i].lower(), then c does not match t at that position.

Wait, no.

Wait, the condition for c to match t is:

- If t[i] is lowercase, c[i] == t[i]

- If t[i] is uppercase, c[i] != t[i].lower()

So, c does not match t if:

- There exists at least one position i where:

- If t[i] is lowercase, then c[i] != t[i]

- Or if t[i] is uppercase, then c[i] == t[i].lower()

So, in position 9:

If I choose t[9] as uppercase with t[9].lower() = 'e', then c[9] == 'e' == t[9].lower(), which means c does not match t at position 9.

Therefore, choosing t[9] as uppercase with t[9].lower() = c[9] ensures that c does not match t at position 9.

Similarly, in position 5, if I choose t[5] as lowercase with t[5] = 'f', then c[5] = 'c' != 'f', so c does not match t at position 5.

Therefore, even if I choose t[i] as uppercase for other positions where c[i] == t[i].lower(), as long as there is at least one position where c does not match t, the overall c does not match t.

Therefore, in the earlier example where a[9] != b[9] and c[9] == a[9], I can still choose t[9] as uppercase with t[9].lower() = c[9], which makes c not match t at position 9.

Wait, but earlier I thought that choosing t[i] as uppercase with c[i] == t[i].lower() makes c not match t at that position.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, in position 9, even though a[9] != b[9] and c[9] == a[9], I can still choose t[9] as uppercase with t[9].lower() = c[9], which makes c not match t at position 9.

Similarly, for positions where a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], choosing t[i] as lowercase ensures c does not match t at that position.

Therefore, as long as there exists at least one position where I can choose t[i] as lowercase with a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], or choose t[i] as uppercase with c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], and ensure that for other positions, I can choose t[i] appropriately, then a valid template exists.

Wait, but in the earlier example where a[9] != b[9] and c[9] == a[9], I thought I couldn't choose t[9] as uppercase, but actually, I can choose t[9] as uppercase with t[9].lower() = c[9], which satisfies the conditions.

Wait, no, if a[9] != b[9], and c[9] == a[9], then choosing t[9] as uppercase requires t[9].lower() != a[9] and t[9].lower() != b[9], but c[9] == a[9], which contradicts t[9].lower() != a[9].

Wait, let's see:

For t[9] as uppercase:

- t[9].lower() != a[9]

- t[9].lower() != b[9]

- c[9] == t[9].lower()

But c[9] == a[9], so t[9].lower() == c[9] == a[9], but t[9].lower() != a[9], which is a contradiction.

Therefore, I cannot choose t[9] as uppercase in this case.

Hence, no valid choice for t[9], and thus no valid template exists.

But in the example output, it's "YES
