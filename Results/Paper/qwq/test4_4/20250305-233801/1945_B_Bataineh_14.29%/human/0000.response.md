Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: the first one every 'a' minutes and the second one every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks are launched and when they are visible. Let's break it down.

For the first installation, it launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

Similarly, the second installation launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible from the time it's launched up to m minutes after its launch. So, if a firework is launched at time t, it's visible from t to t + m, inclusive.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the input:

6 7 4

So, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

Fireworks from the first installation are launched at 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.

Fireworks from the second installation are launched at 7, 14, 21, 28, etc.

Each firework is visible for 5 minutes (since m = 4).

So, for the first installation:

- Launched at 6: visible from 6 to 10

- Launched at 12: visible from 12 to 16

- Launched at 18: visible from 18 to 22

And so on.

For the second installation:

- Launched at 7: visible from 7 to 11

- Launched at 14: visible from 14 to 18

- Launched at 21: visible from 21 to 25

Now, looking at the time intervals:

From 6 to 7: only the first installation's firework is visible.

From 7 to 10: both fireworks are visible.

From 12 to 14: the first installation's firework launched at 12 is visible, and the second installation's firework launched at 14 is visible from 14 to 18, so at 14, both are visible.

But according to the answer, the maximum is 2.

Wait, but in the third test case:

7 8 56

The output is 17.

So, in that case, multiple fireworks from each installation are visible at the same time.

I need to find a general way to calculate the maximum number of visible fireworks.

Let me think about it mathematically.

For a given time t, the number of fireworks visible is the sum of the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible at t and the number from the second installation that are visible at t.

I need to find the maximum over all possible t.

But checking for every possible t isn't feasible because t can be up to infinity.

So, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the launch times.

For the first installation, the launch times are multiples of a: a, 2a, 3a, ...

Similarly, for the second installation: b, 2b, 3b, ...

Each firework is visible from t to t + m, where t is the launch time.

So, for the first installation, the visibility intervals are [a, a + m], [2a, 2a + m], [3a, 3a + m], etc.

Similarly for the second installation: [b, b + m], [2b, 2b + m], etc.

I need to find the time when the most of these intervals overlap.

This seems like an interval scheduling problem, where I need to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals from two different sets.

I recall that for such problems, one efficient way is to sort all the event times (both start and end times) and then keep a counter of active intervals.

But again, since t can be up to 10^18 and m can be up to 10^18, I can't iterate through all times.

I need a mathematical approach to calculate the maximum overlap without iterating through each time.

Let me think about the possible overlaps.

First, consider that fireworks from the first installation are launched every a minutes and are visible for m minutes.

Similarly, for the second installation, every b minutes and visible for m minutes.

I need to find a time t where the number of overlapping fireworks is maximized.

I should consider the launch times and their visibility periods.

Let me consider the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible at time t.

This would be the number of integers k such that t is in [k*a, k*a + m].

Similarly for the second installation.

Wait, but k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

So, for the first installation, the number of visible fireworks is the number of k where t - m <= k*a <= t.

Similarly for the second installation.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of launches from each installation whose visibility intervals include t.

So, for the first installation, the number of k such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Similarly for the second installation.

To maximize the total number of visible fireworks, I need to choose t such that the sum of these counts is maximized.

Let me try to express this mathematically.

For the first installation, the number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

This is equivalent to floor((t - m)/a) < k <= floor(t/a)

So, the number of k is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Similarly, for the second installation, it's floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

So, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over t.

But floor functions are tricky to handle directly.

I need to find t that maximizes:

floor(t/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/a) - floor((t - m)/b)

I should consider the properties of floor functions and how they change with t.

I recall that floor(x) is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.

So, floor(t/a) increases by 1 every a minutes, specifically at multiples of a.

Similarly for floor(t/b), it increases by 1 every b minutes, at multiples of b.

Similarly, floor((t - m)/a) and floor((t - m)/b) also increase by 1 every a and b minutes, respectively, but shifted by m.

So, the expression floor(t/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/a) - floor((t - m)/b) can be seen as the difference between the number of launches up to t and up to t - m for both installations.

I need to find t that maximizes this difference.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

The LCM of a and b is the time after which the launch patterns repeat.

But given that a and b can be up to 10^18, calculating LCM might not be straightforward due to potential overflow.

Wait, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not an issue.

But even so, considering the LCM might not be the most efficient approach because m can also be up to 10^18.

I need a smarter way to find the maximum overlap without considering all possible t.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the number of visible fireworks can change.

These points are at multiples of a and b, and at t - m being multiples of a and b.

So, the critical points are at multiples of a and b, and multiples of a and b shifted by m.

Therefore, the possible t where the maximum might occur are at multiples of a and b, and at t = k*a + m and t = l*b + m for integers k and l.

But checking all such t is still not feasible for large a, b, and m.

I need to find a mathematical formula that can directly compute the maximum number of visible fireworks without iterating through all possible t.

Let me consider the case when m is less than both a and b.

In this case, since m < a and m < b, each firework from either installation is visible for less than one full launch cycle.

So, no two fireworks from the same installation can be visible at the same time.

Therefore, the maximum number of visible fireworks is 2: one from each installation.

This matches the first example: a=6, b=7, m=4. Since m < a and m < b, max visible is 2.

Similarly, in the second test case: a=3, b=4, m=10.

Here, m > a and m > b.

So, multiple fireworks from each installation can be visible at the same time.

I need to find how many from each installation can be visible simultaneously.

Let me consider the number of fireworks from the first installation visible at time t.

This is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Similarly for the second installation.

I need to maximize floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

I recall that floor(x) - floor(y) can be expressed as floor(x - y) under certain conditions, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, I can think about the fractional parts.

Let me consider t/a - floor(t/a) = {t/a}, the fractional part.

Similarly for t/b, (t - m)/a, and (t - m)/b.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me consider specific cases to find a pattern.

Case 1: a and b are co-prime (their greatest common divisor is 1).

In this case, the launch times don't overlap unless a divides b or vice versa, but since they are co-prime, their launch times are distinct.

So, in this case, the maximum visible fireworks would be the sum of the maximum number from each installation.

But I need to find what that sum is.

For the first installation, the number of visible fireworks at time t is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Similarly for the second installation.

I need to maximize floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

Let me consider t such that t is a multiple of a and b, i.e., t is a multiple of LCM(a, b).

But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider t = LCM(a, b).

At t = LCM(a, b), both installations have launched fireworks, and I can calculate the number of visible fireworks.

But I need to maximize over all possible t, not just at LCM(a, b).

Let me consider t = m.

At t = m, the first installation has launched fireworks at times <= m.

Similarly for the second installation.

But I need to consider t >= max(a, b), I think.

Wait, no, t can be any time after the installations are turned on, so t >= 0.

But fireworks are launched starting at a and b minutes, respectively.

So, t >= 0, but fireworks are only launched at t >= a and t >= b.

Wait, no, the installations are turned on simultaneously, and they launch fireworks at a, 2a, 3a, etc., and b, 2b, 3b, etc.

So, fireworks are launched at t >= a and t >= b, respectively.

Now, considering t >= 0, but fireworks are only visible at t >= a and t >= b.

Wait, no, fireworks are launched at t = a, 2a, 3a, etc., and are visible from t to t + m.

So, their visibility starts at t and ends at t + m.

Therefore, for t >= 0, the number of visible fireworks is the sum of the number of launches from each installation that satisfy t - m <= k*a <= t for the first installation, and similarly for the second.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how many launches from each installation have t in [k*a, k*a + m].

Which is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for the second installation.

Wait, I need to be careful with the floor functions.

Actually, the number of k such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m is floor((t - m)/a) + 1 to floor(t / a).

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

The number of k where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

This is equivalent to k*a <= t and t <= k*a + m.

So, k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

Therefore, k <= t / a and k >= (t - m)/a.

So, k in [ceil((t - m)/a), floor(t / a)]

Therefore, the number of k is floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1

Similarly for the second installation.

So, the total number of visible fireworks is:

[ floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 ] + [ floor(t / b) - ceil((t - m)/b) + 1 ]

I need to maximize this over t.

But ceil(x) = floor(x) + 1 if x is not integer, else floor(x).

So, ceil((t - m)/a) = floor((t - m)/a) + 1 if (t - m)/a is not integer, else floor((t - m)/a)

Similarly for ceil((t - m)/b)

Therefore, floor(t / a) - ceil((t - m)/a) + 1 =

floor(t / a) - [floor((t - m)/a) + 1] + 1 = floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) - 1 + 1 = floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Similarly for the second installation.

So, the total number of visible fireworks is:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/b)

This is the same expression I had earlier.

I need to maximize this over t.

Let me consider the difference between floor(t / a) and floor((t - m)/a)

The difference floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether t - m crosses a multiple of a.

Wait, no, it can be greater than 1 if m >= a.

Wait, more precisely, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval (t - m, t]

Which can be floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a)

This can be 0, 1, 2, ..., up to floor(m / a) + 1, depending on t.

Similarly for b.

So, to maximize the total, I need to maximize floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/b)

I need to find t where both differences are maximized.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can consider the possible values of t modulo LCM(a, b).

Because the patterns of launches repeat every LCM(a, b) minutes.

But given that a and b can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to infinity, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the possible maximum values for each term.

For floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a), the maximum value is floor(m / a) + 1.

Similarly for floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/b), the maximum value is floor(m / b) + 1.

Therefore, the maximum possible sum is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But is this achievable?

It is achievable if there exists a t where both floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) = floor(m / a) + 1 and floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/b) = floor(m / b) + 1.

Is this always possible?

Let me check with the examples.

First example: a=6, b=7, m=4

floor(4 / 6) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

floor(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1

Sum: 2

Which matches the output.

Second example: a=3, b=4, m=10

floor(10 / 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4

floor(10 / 4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

Sum: 7

Which matches the output.

Third example: a=7, b=8, m=56

floor(56 / 7) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9

floor(56 / 8) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8

Sum: 17

Which matches the output.

So, it seems that the maximum number of visible fireworks is indeed floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

Wait, but in the first example, floor(4 / 6) + floor(4 / 7) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

In the second example, floor(10 / 3) + floor(10 / 4) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7.

In the third example, floor(56 / 7) + floor(56 / 8) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17.

All match.

So, perhaps the general formula is floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But let's check the fourth example: a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

floor(78123459896 / 5) + floor(78123459896 / 6) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630, which matches the output.

Fifth example: a=1, b=1, m=1

floor(1 / 1) + floor(1 / 1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches.

Sixth example: a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) + floor(1000000000000000000 / 1) + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 always gives the correct answer.

But is this always true?

Let me consider a case where m < a or m < b.

For example, a=6, b=7, m=4.

floor(4 / 6) = 0, floor(4 / 7) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

Another case: a=2, b=3, m=1

floor(1 / 2) = 0, floor(1 / 3) = 0, so 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which should be correct.

Wait, but if m < a and m < b, then at any time, only one firework from each installation can be visible, so maximum is 2.

Which matches the formula.

Another case: a=2, b=2, m=2

floor(2 / 2) = 1, so 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

But let's see:

Launch times: 2,4,6,...

Each firework visible from t to t+2.

At t=2, firework launched at 2 is visible from 2 to 4.

At t=4, fireworks launched at 2 and 4 are both visible from 4 to 6.

So, at t=4, two fireworks are visible.

But according to the formula, it's floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

But in reality, only two fireworks are visible at t=4.

This contradicts the formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, m=2, so visibility is from t to t+2.

At t=4:

Firework launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4.

Firework launched at t=4: visible from 4 to 6.

So, at t=4, both are visible.

But according to the formula, it's 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I'm misapplying the formula.

Wait, a=2, b=2, m=2.

floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

But in reality, only two fireworks are visible at t=4.

So, the formula is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps there's an overlap in installations.

Wait, but both installations launch every 2 minutes.

So, launches at 2,4,6,...

Each firework is visible from t to t+2.

At t=4:

- Firework launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

- Firework launched at t=4: visible from 4 to 6

So, only two fireworks are visible.

But according to the formula, it's 4, which is wrong.

So, the formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Let me think again.

In this case, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m)/b)

For a=2, b=2, m=2.

Let's compute for t=4.

floor(4 / 2) - floor((4 - 2)/2) + floor(4 / 2) - floor((4 - 2)/2) = 2 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 2.

Which matches the observation.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2.

But that was incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I confused the two expressions.

Wait, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m)/a) can be up to floor(m / a) + 1.

But in this case, floor(4 / 2) - floor(2 / 2) = 2 - 1 = 1.

Similarly for b: 1.

Total: 2.

But floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is wrong.

So, perhaps the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 is only correct when a and b are greater than m.

Wait, no, in the examples where m >= a and m >= b, it seems to work.

But in the case where m < a or m < b, it doesn't.

Wait, in the first example, m < a and m < b, and floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2, which matches.

In the second example, m >= a and m >= b, floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which matches.

In the third example, m >= a and m >= b, floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17, which matches.

In the fourth example, m >= a and m >= b, floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = large numbers, which matches.

In the fifth example, a=b=1, m=1, floor(1 / 1) + floor(1 / 1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which matches.

In the sixth example, a=b=1, m=10^18, floor(10^18 / 1) + floor(10^18 / 1) + 2 = 10^18 + 10^18 + 2 = 2*10^18 + 2, which matches.

Wait, but in the case a=2, b=2, m=2, floor(2 / 2) + floor(2 / 2) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, but in reality, only 2 fireworks can be seen at the same time.

So, the formula overcounts in this case.

What's different in this case?

Ah, perhaps when a divides m and b divides m, the formula overcounts.

Wait, in this case, a=2 divides m=2, and b=2 divides m=2.

Wait, but in the fifth example, a=1, b=1, m=1, floor(1 / 1) + floor(1 / 1) + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, and in reality, four fireworks can be seen: two from each installation.

Wait, but in the case a=2, b=2, m=2, only two fireworks can be seen at the same time, not four.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment when a and b are equal.

Wait, in the fifth example, a=1, b=1, m=1.

At t=1:

- Firework from first installation launched at t=1: visible from 1 to 2

- Firework from second installation launched at t=1: visible from 1 to 2

At t=2:

- Firework from first installation launched at t=1: visible until t=2

- Firework from first installation launched at t=2: visible from t=2 to t=3

- Firework from second installation launched at t=1: visible until t=2

- Firework from second installation launched at t=2: visible from t=2 to t=3

So, at t=2, four fireworks are visible, which matches the formula.

In the case a=2, b=2, m=2.

At t=2:

- Firework from first installation launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

- Firework from second installation launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

At t=4:

- Firework from first installation launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

- Firework from first installation launched at t=4: visible from 4 to 6

- Firework from second installation launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

- Firework from second installation launched at t=4: visible from 4 to 6

So, at t=4, four fireworks are visible.

Wait, but earlier I thought only two are visible.

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken.

At t=4:

- Firework 1 launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

- Firework 2 launched at t=4: visible from 4 to 6

- Firework 3 from second installation launched at t=2: visible from 2 to 4

- Firework 4 from second installation launched at t=4: visible from 4 to 6

So, indeed, four fireworks are visible at t=4.

So, the formula holds.

I must have miscounted earlier.

So, perhaps the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 is correct.

But wait, in the case where a=1, b=1, m=1, it's correct.

In a=2, b=2, m=2, it's correct.

In a=6, b=7, m=4, it's correct.

In a=3, b=4, m=10, it's correct.

In a=7, b=8, m=56, it's correct.

In a=5, b=6, m=78123459896, it's correct.

In a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000, it's correct.

So, perhaps the formula is correct.

But why does it work?

Let me try to understand why this formula gives the correct answer.

The expression floor(m / a) represents how many times the first installation would have launched fireworks within m minutes.

Similarly, floor(m / b) for the second installation.

Adding 2 accounts for the current launches at time t.

So, the total is the sum of the past launches still visible plus the current launches.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the precise reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of launches from each installation whose visibility intervals overlap with the current time t.

Given that, floor(m / a) represents the number of past launches from the first installation that are still visible at time t.

Similarly for the second installation.

Adding 2 accounts for the current launches from both installations.

But I need to ensure that t is chosen such that the current launches are visible along with as many past launches as possible.

In the case where m is large compared to a and b, more past launches are visible.

In the case where m is smaller than a and b, only the current launches are visible.

Which matches the formula:

If m < a and m < b, floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2.

If m >= a and m >= b, floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the sum of past launches plus the current ones.

So, it seems consistent.

Therefore, the formula floor(m / a) + floor(m / b) + 2 gives the maximum number of visible fireworks.

Hence, the program provided is correct.

So, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
