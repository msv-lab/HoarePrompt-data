Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either has a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what a "single block" means. It means all the chips are together with no gaps between them. So, if I have chips at positions 1, 3, and 4, that's a block because there's no free cell between them. But if I have chips at 1, 3, and 5, there are free cells between them, so it's not a single block.

Okay, so the task is to make sure all the chips are adjacent to each other without any free cells in between. To do this, I can move chips to the left as long as there's a free cell available.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip and make sure all the cells between them are occupied by chips. That would ensure there are no gaps.

Wait, but the operations allow me to only move chips to the left, to the closest free cell to the left. So, I can't move chips to the right; only left.

Hmm, that changes things. So, I need to think about how to rearrange the chips by only moving them to the left.

Let me consider an example to understand this better.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 8

a = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

So, the cells are:

1: free (0)

2: chip (1)

3: chip (1)

4: chip (1)

5: free (0)

6: chip (1)

7: chip (1)

8: free (0)

My goal is to have all chips form a single block with no free cells between them.

Looking at this, I can see that the chips are at positions 2,3,4,6,7. There's a gap between position 4 and 6.

So, I need to move the chips at positions 6 and 7 to fill the gap.

Looking at the operations allowed, I can choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left.

So, for the chip at position 7, the closest free cell to the left is position 5. So, I can move it there.

After moving, the array becomes:

[0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]

Now, all chips are together from position 2 to 6, with no gaps. That's a single block.

And it took only one operation.

That matches the first example's output, which is 1.

Another example:

n = 6

a = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, there's only one chip at position 2. Since it's already a block (as there's only one chip), no operations are needed. Output is 0.

Another example:

n = 6

a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

All cells are occupied by chips, so it's already a single block. Output is 0.

Another example:

n = 5

a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Chips at positions 1,3,5.

To make them a single block, I need to move the chip at position 5 to position 2, but position 2 is already occupied. Wait, no, I can only move to the left to the closest free cell.

So, position 5: closest free cell to the left is position 2.

But position 2 is free, so I can move the chip from 5 to 2.

After moving, the array becomes [1,1,1,0,0]

Now, all chips are together from position 1 to 3, with no gaps. That's a single block. It took one operation.

But the note says it takes 2 operations. Wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, in the note, it says "In the fourth example, you can perform two operations: move the chip from position 5 to position 2, and then move the chip from position 3 to position 2." Wait, but in my previous step, after moving the chip from 5 to 2, the array becomes [1,1,1,0,0], which is already a single block. So why does it say 2 operations?

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after moving the chip from 5 to 2, the array becomes [1,1,1,0,0], which is a single block. But according to the note, it says "In the fourth example, you can perform two operations: move the chip from position 5 to position 2, and then move the chip from position 3 to position 2." So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, let's see:

Original array: [1,0,1,0,1]

After moving 5 to 2: [1,1,1,0,0]

Now, all chips are together from position 1 to 3, which is a single block. So, only one operation is needed. But the note says two operations are performed. Maybe there's a different way to interpret this.

Wait, perhaps the operations are performed sequentially, and after each operation, the positions update.

Let me think again.

Original array: [1,0,1,0,1]

First operation: move chip from position 5 to position 2.

Now, array becomes: [1,1,1,0,0]

Second operation: move chip from position 3 to position 2.

Now, array becomes: [1,1,0,0,0]

Wait, but in this case, all chips are still together, but it's mentioned that it takes two operations. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the goal is to have all chips in consecutive positions, not necessarily to the leftmost possible.

But in my first operation, moving from 5 to 2 already achieves the goal. So, maybe the minimal number is one operation.

Perhaps the note is showing a possible sequence that takes two operations, but the minimal number is actually one, as in my approach.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 2 for this case. So, maybe my approach is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think differently.

I need to make sure that all chips are together without any gaps.

So, first, I need to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip. Between these two positions, all cells should be occupied by chips.

So, the number of operations needed would be equal to the number of gaps between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, but I can only move chips to the left.

So, perhaps I need to move the rightmost chips to the left to fill the gaps.

Let me try with the fourth example:

n = 5

a = [1,0,1,0,1]

Leftmost chip at position 1, rightmost at position 5.

I need to have all chips from position 1 to position 3.

So, I need to move the chip from position 5 to position 3, which is one operation.

But according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after moving the chip from position 5 to position 3, I still have a gap at position 2.

Wait, no, if I move from 5 to 3, then position 3 has a chip, position 2 is free, so I need to move the chip from position 3 to position 2.

Wait, but in the first step, moving from 5 to 3, the array becomes [1,0,1,0,0]

Then, moving from 3 to 2, array becomes [1,1,0,0,0]

Now, all chips are together from position 1 to 2, with no gaps.

So, it took two operations, matching the sample output.

So, my initial approach was incorrect because I didn't consider that moving one chip might create another gap that needs to be filled.

So, a better way is to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip, and then count the number of gaps between them.

Wait, but in the fourth example, the number of gaps is one (between position 1 and 3), but according to the sample output, it's 2 operations.

Hmm, maybe it's not that straightforward.

Let me think of another approach.

Perhaps I can find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip, and then count the number of free cells between them.

Then, the number of operations needed would be equal to the number of free cells between them.

Wait, in the fourth example, between position 1 and position 5, there are two free cells (positions 2 and 4).

But the sample output is 2, which matches.

In the first example:

n=8

a=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 7.

Between position 2 and 7, there are positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Chips are at 2,3,4,6,7.

So, free cell at position 5.

Hence, one operation needed, which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=5

a=[1,0,1,0,1]

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5.

Between 1 and 5, positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Chips at 1,3,5.

Free cells at 2 and 4.

Hence, two operations needed.

This seems consistent.

So, the approach is:

- Find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip.

- Count the number of free cells between them (inclusive).

- This count is the number of operations needed.

Wait, but in the second example:

n=6

a=[0,1,0,0,0,0]

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 2.

Between 2 and 2, only position 2 has a chip, no free cells.

Hence, 0 operations, which matches the sample output.

Another example:

n=6

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1]

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 6.

Between 1 and 6, all positions have chips, no free cells.

Hence, 0 operations, matching the sample output.

Another example:

n=9

a=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 7 and 8.

Wait, positions 2,3,7,8 have chips.

So, leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8.

Between 2 and 8, positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Chips at 2,3,7,8.

Free cells at 4,5,6.

Hence, three operations needed, matching the sample output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- For each test case:

- Find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip.

- Count the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chip (inclusive).

- Print this count as the number of operations needed.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

res = 0

while a and a[0] == 0:

a.pop(0)

while a and a[-1] == 0:

a.pop()

print(a)

for i in range(len(a)):

if a[i] == 0:

res += 1

print(res)

This program seems to implement the above logic.

It first removes leading zeros (free cells) from the left until it finds the first chip.

Then, it removes trailing zeros from the right until it finds the last chip.

Then, it counts the number of zeros (free cells) in the remaining list, which should be the number of operations needed.

Looking back at the fourth example:

n=5

a=[1,0,1,0,1]

After removing leading zeros, a becomes [1,0,1,0,1] (no leading zeros to remove).

Then, removing trailing zeros, a remains [1,0,1,0,1] (no trailing zeros to remove).

Then, count the number of zeros in [1,0,1,0,1], which is 2.

Hence, res=2, matching the sample output.

Similarly, for the first example:

n=8

a=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

After removing leading zeros, a becomes [1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Then, removing trailing zeros, a becomes [1,1,1,0,1,1]

Then, count the number of zeros in [1,1,1,0,1,1], which is 1.

Hence, res=1, matching the sample output.

So, this seems correct.

Wait, but in the second example:

n=6

a=[0,1,0,0,0,0]

After removing leading zeros, a becomes [1,0,0,0,0]

Then, removing trailing zeros, a becomes [1]

Then, count the number of zeros in [1], which is 0.

Hence, res=0, matching the sample output.

Another example:

n=6

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1]

No leading or trailing zeros to remove, a remains [1,1,1,1,1,1]

Count of zeros is 0, matching the sample output.

Last example:

n=9

a=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

After removing leading zeros, a becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Then, removing trailing zeros, a becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Count of zeros is 3, matching the sample output.

So, this approach seems correct.

Hence, the given program is correct.
