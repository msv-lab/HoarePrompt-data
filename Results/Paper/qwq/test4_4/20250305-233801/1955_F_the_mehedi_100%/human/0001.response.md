Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play the game again with the remaining numbers. This continues until there are no numbers left.

My task is to figure out the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes the numbers optimally. So, Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins.

First, I need to understand how the XOR operation works with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's list out their binary representations:

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011 (which is 1|2)

- 4: 100

So, XORing these numbers would involve bitwise exclusive OR operations.

Given that the sequence can have multiple instances of each number, I need to consider the counts of each number.

Let me think about the XOR of the entire sequence. The XOR of a set of numbers is the bitwise XOR of all of them. Bob wins when this XOR is zero.

I need to find out, for each subset of the sequence (created by Eve's removals), how many times the XOR is zero.

But Eve is removing one number at a time, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers. So, it's not about all possible subsets, but about a specific sequence of removals.

Wait, but actually, since Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, she can choose in a way that maximizes Bob's wins.

So, I need to consider the sequence of removals that leads to the maximum number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Let me try to rephrase the problem:

- Start with n numbers.

- Eve removes one number, and if the XOR of the remaining n-1 numbers is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

- Repeat by removing another number, and check the XOR of the remaining n-2 numbers.

- Continue until no numbers are left.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, so she chooses which number to remove at each step to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.

I need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve chooses optimally.

Let me consider the properties of XOR:

- XOR is associative and commutative.

- XOR of a number with itself is zero.

- XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.

Given that all numbers are up to 4, and we have counts of each number, perhaps I can find a way to calculate the XOR based on these counts.

Let me denote:

- c1: count of 1s

- c2: count of 2s

- c3: count of 3s

- c4: count of 4s

Total numbers: n = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4

I need to consider the XOR of the entire sequence and how it changes as numbers are removed.

Wait, maybe I can think about the XOR of the entire sequence initially, and then see how removing numbers affects the XOR.

Let me denote the initial XOR as X.

Then, after removing one number, the XOR of the remaining numbers would be X XOR the removed number.

So, for Bob to win after removing a number, X XOR removed_number should be zero.

Which means that the removed number should be equal to X.

So, for Bob to win after the first removal, Eve should remove a number that is equal to X.

If X is present in the sequence, Eve can choose to remove it, making the XOR of the remaining numbers zero.

If X is not present in the sequence, then Bob cannot win on the first removal.

Wait, but X could be a number in the sequence, but it's not necessarily one of 1,2,3,4, because X is the XOR of some combination of these numbers.

Wait, but since all numbers are 1,2,3,4, and XOR is associative and commutative, X could be any value between 0 and 7, since 4 is 100 in binary, and 3 is 011, so XORing them can give values up to 7 (111).

But in this problem, since the numbers are only up to 4, and XOR is between these numbers, the possible XOR values are limited to the XOR of subsets of {1,2,3,4} with the given counts.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the parity of the counts.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too involved.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the XOR as a vector in a 3-dimensional space, since the numbers are up to 4 (which is 100 in binary), so the XOR can be represented by three bits.

But maybe that's overcomplicating things.

Let me look at small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example from the input:

1 1 1 0

So, c1=1, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

So, the numbers are 1, 2, 3

Compute the XOR: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = (1 ^ 2 ^ 3) = 0

So, initially, with all three numbers, XOR is 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number. Let's see the possible removals:

- Remove 1: remaining numbers 2 and 3, XOR = 2 ^ 3 = 1, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

- Remove 2: remaining numbers 1 and 3, XOR = 1 ^ 3 = 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

- Remove 3: remaining numbers 1 and 2, XOR = 1 ^ 2 = 3, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

So, only the initial game is a win for Bob, hence output is 1.

Second example:

1 0 1 2

So, c1=1, c2=0, c3=1, c4=2

Numbers: 1, 3, 4, 4

Compute XOR: 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = (1 ^ 3) ^ (4 ^ 4) = 2 ^ 0 = 2

So, initially, XOR is 2, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number.

Possible removals:

- Remove 1: remaining numbers 3, 4, 4; XOR = 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 3 ^ 0 = 3, Alice wins.

- Remove 3: remaining numbers 1, 4, 4; XOR = 1 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 1 ^ 0 = 1, Alice wins.

- Remove 4: remaining numbers 1, 3, 4; XOR = 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 2 ^ 4 = 6, Alice wins.

- Remove another 4: same as above, XOR = 6, Alice wins.

So, in this case, Bob doesn't win any of the games except possibly one, but according to the sample output, it's 1. Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps Eve can choose to remove a number in such a way that in one of the steps, Bob wins.

Let me try again.

Initial sequence: 1, 3, 4, 4; XOR = 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 2, Alice wins.

Eve removes one number.

Say, Eve removes one 4.

Remaining numbers: 1, 3, 4; XOR = 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 2 ^ 4 = 6, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number.

Say, removes 3.

Remaining numbers: 1, 4; XOR = 1 ^ 4 = 5, Alice wins.

Then, removes another number.

Removes 4.

Remaining numbers: 1; XOR =1, Alice wins.

So, in this case, only Alice wins.

But according to the sample output, it's 1, meaning Bob wins once.

Maybe there's a different order.

Let's try removing 1 first.

Remaining numbers: 3, 4, 4; XOR = 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 3 ^ 0 = 3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3.

Remaining numbers: 4, 4; XOR = 0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins once.

Hence, the maximum is 1.

Okay, so Eve can choose to remove numbers in a way that maximizes Bob's wins.

In this case, by removing 1 first, then 3, she gets one Bob win.

Similarly, in the first example, only the initial game is a Bob win.

So, the strategy for Eve is to remove numbers in a way that makes the XOR zero as often as possible.

Now, I need to generalize this for any given counts of 1,2,3,4.

Looking at the problem, it seems that Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, and that removing a number changes the XOR to the previous XOR XOR the removed number, there might be some patterns based on the counts of each number.

Let me think about the parity of the counts.

Suppose I have even counts of some numbers and odd counts of others.

Wait, but since XOR is involved, perhaps considering the parity of the counts of each bit position would help.

Let me consider the binary representations again:

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011 (which is 1|2)

- 4: 100

So, bit positions:

- Bit 0: 1, 3

- Bit 1: 2, 3

- Bit 2: 4

So, for each bit position, the XOR will be 1 if the number of 1s in that bit position is odd, and 0 otherwise.

Therefore, the overall XOR is determined by the parity of the counts in each bit position.

Let me define:

- For bit 0: count of 1s and 3s.

- For bit 1: count of 2s and 3s.

- For bit 2: count of 4s.

So, initial XOR:

- Bit 0: (c1 + c3) % 2

- Bit 1: (c2 + c3) % 2

- Bit 2: (c4) % 2

Now, as Eve removes numbers one by one, the counts change, and accordingly, the XOR changes.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove in a way that makes the XOR zero as often as possible.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think recursively, but with large t (up to 10^4), I need an efficient way.

Perhaps there's a mathematical formula or a pattern based on the counts.

Looking at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Sample Output:

1

1

3

3

12

Looking at these, I need to find a pattern.

In the first case: c1=1, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

Total numbers: 3

Bob wins once.

In the second case: c1=1, c2=0, c3=1, c4=2

Total numbers: 4

Bob wins once.

In the third case: c1=2, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

Total numbers: 6

Bob wins three times.

In the fourth case: c1=3, c2=3, c3=2, c4=0

Total numbers: 8

Bob wins three times.

In the fifth case: c1=0, c2=9, c3=9, c4=9

Total numbers: 27

Bob wins twelve times.

Looking at these, it seems that the number of Bob's wins is related to the floor division of the counts by 2, plus some condition.

Looking at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = 0

if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:

cnt += 1

for x in a:

cnt += math.floor(x / 2)

print(cnt)

So, it's summing up the floor division of each count by 2, and adding 1 if all counts of 1,2,3 are odd.

Wait, but c4 is not involved in that condition.

Looking at the first sample input:

1 1 1 0

floor(1/2) = 0 for each, so 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, then since all three are odd, cnt +=1, so cnt=1, which matches the sample output.

Second sample input:

1 0 1 2

floor(1/2)=0, floor(0/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(2/2)=1, so cnt=0+0+0+1=1, which matches the sample output.

Third sample input:

2 2 2 0

floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0, so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches.

Fourth sample input:

3 3 2 0

floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0, so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches.

Fifth sample input:

0 9 9 9

floor(0/2)=0, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, so cnt=0+4+4+4=12, which matches.

So, in all sample inputs, this code produces the correct output.

But is this correct in general?

Let me try to understand why this would work.

Looking back at the earlier observation, Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

The code seems to be counting the number of pairs in each count, which makes sense because XORing a number with itself results in zero.

So, for each pair of the same number, removing one of them would leave the other, which XORs to itself, which might be zero or not.

Wait, that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering that for each number, removing it affects the XOR in a certain way, and by counting the floor division by 2, it's counting the number of times pairs can be formed, which might relate to cancelling out in XOR.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a certain XOR value for the entire sequence.

Then, when I remove a number, the new XOR is the old XOR XOR the removed number.

Bob wins if this new XOR is zero.

So, for Bob to win, the removed number must be equal to the current XOR.

But, since the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and XOR can be any value from 0 to 7, but the numbers are only up to 4 (100 in binary), the XOR can be any combination of these numbers.

Wait, but in the sequence, the XOR can be any value from 0 to 7, since 4 is 100, and 3 is 011, so combining them can give any binary combination up to 111.

But in this problem, since we're dealing with counts of 1,2,3,4, perhaps we can represent the XOR in terms of the parity of these counts.

Earlier, I noted that:

- Bit 0: (c1 + c3) % 2

- Bit 1: (c2 + c3) % 2

- Bit 2: (c4) % 2

So, the XOR value is:

X = ((c1 + c3) % 2) | ( (c2 + c3) % 2 << 1 ) | ( (c4) % 2 << 2 )

Now, when Eve removes a number, say she removes number k, then the new XOR is X XOR k.

For Bob to win, X XOR k must be zero, which means k must be equal to X.

So, for Bob to win after removing a number, Eve needs to remove a number that is equal to the current XOR.

Therefore, Eve should remove a number that is equal to the current XOR, if such a number exists in the sequence.

If there are multiple such numbers, she can choose any of them.

If there is no such number, then Bob cannot win at that step.

So, the problem reduces to finding, at each step, whether the current XOR exists in the sequence, and if so, removing it to make the XOR zero, thus making Bob win.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, so she should choose to remove a number that is equal to the current XOR as often as possible.

Now, to maximize Bob's wins, Eve should arrange the removal order such that the condition X is in the sequence is satisfied as many times as possible.

But since Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, she can select the one that is equal to the current XOR, if available.

So, the question is, how many times can she do this optimally?

This seems like a problem that can be solved by counting the number of times she can remove a number that is equal to the current XOR.

But it's still not straightforward to compute directly.

Let me consider the total number of removals, which is n, and the number of times Bob can win.

Each time Bob wins, it's when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, which happens after Eve removes a number that is equal to the previous XOR.

So, perhaps the number of times Bob wins is equal to the number of times Eve can remove a number that is equal to the current XOR.

This seems a bit recursive, as the XOR changes with each removal.

Let me think of it in terms of the initial XOR and how it changes.

Let me consider that the initial XOR is X0.

Then, Eve removes a number k1 such that k1 = X0, if possible, making the new XOR X1 = X0 XOR k1 = X0 XOR X0 = 0, so Bob wins the first game.

Then, Eve removes another number k2 such that k2 = current XOR, which is now 0, so she removes a 0, but 0 is not in the sequence, since all numbers are 1,2,3,4.

Wait, but 0 is not in the sequence, so she cannot remove a 0, meaning Bob cannot win again.

Wait, but in this step, since the XOR is 0, and there is no 0 in the sequence, Bob cannot win.

So, only the first removal can make Bob win, in this case.

Wait, but in the second example, it's possible for Bob to win once.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after the first removal, the XOR becomes 0, and then when Eve removes another number, the XOR becomes that number, which is not zero, so Alice wins.

Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider the second example again:

c1=1, c2=0, c3=1, c4=2

Numbers: 1,3,4,4

Initial XOR: 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 2

Eve can choose to remove a number that is equal to the current XOR, which is 2, but 2 is not in the sequence. So, she cannot remove a number equal to the current XOR, meaning Bob cannot win on the first removal.

So, Alice wins the first game.

Then, Eve removes one number. Suppose she removes a 4.

Remaining numbers: 1,3,4; XOR = 1 ^ 3 ^ 4 = 6

Again, XOR is 6, which is not present in the sequence, so Bob cannot win.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 3.

Remaining numbers: 1,4; XOR = 5

Again, 5 is not in the sequence.

Then, removes 4.

Remaining number: 1; XOR =1

Again, 1 is in the sequence, but since it's the only number left, removing it results in XOR=0, which would be a Bob win.

But wait, the sequence is empty after this removal, so the game ends.

So, in this case, Bob doesn't win any of the games.

But according to the sample output, it's 1, meaning Bob wins once.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe Bob wins when the sequence is empty, since XOR of an empty sequence is zero.

But according to the problem, they play with n numbers, then n-1, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

So, when the sequence is empty, XOR is zero, so Bob wins.

But in this case, Eve removes numbers in a way that maximizes Bob's wins.

So, perhaps the number of times Bob wins is equal to the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero, including possibly when the sequence is empty.

Wait, but in the first example, with 1,2,3, the initial XOR is zero, so Bob wins once, and then after removing one number, XOR becomes non-zero, so Alice wins the remaining games.

In the second example, initial XOR is 2, so Alice wins, then Eve removes a number, and depending on which number she removes, the XOR changes, but she cannot make it zero, until the last removal, when the sequence is empty, which is XOR zero, Bob wins.

So, in that case, Bob wins once.

Similarly, in the third example, with c1=2, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0, numbers: two 1s, two 2s, two 3s.

Initial XOR: 1 ^1 ^2^2^3^3 = 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1.

Remaining numbers: 1,2,2,3,3; XOR=1 ^2^2^3^3=1^0^0=1

Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 2.

Remaining numbers:1,2,3,3; XOR=1^2^3^3=1^2^0=3

Alice wins.

Then, remove 3.

Remaining numbers:1,2,3; XOR=1^2^3=0

Bob wins.

Then, remove another number, say 1.

Remaining numbers:2,3; XOR=2^3=1

Alice wins.

Then, remove 2.

Remaining number:3; XOR=3

Alice wins.

Then, remove 3.

Sequence empty; XOR=0

Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins three times: initially, then after removing three numbers, and finally when the sequence is empty.

Hence, the output is 3, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the fourth example, with c1=3, c2=3, c3=2, c4=0, numbers: three 1s, three 2s, two 3s.

Initial XOR: 1^1^1^2^2^2^3^3=1^1^1^2^2^2^3^3

Since XOR is associative and commutative:

1^1=0, 1^0=1, similarly for 2^2=0, 2^0=2, 3^3=0, so overall XOR=1^2^0=3

So, initial XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes a number.

If she removes 3, remaining numbers: three 1s, three 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^1^2^2^2^3=1^0^0^3=1^3=2

Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 1.

Remaining numbers: two 1s, three 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^2^2^2^3=0^2^3=1

Alice wins.

Then, remove 2.

Remaining numbers: two 1s, two 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^2^2^3=0^0^3=3

Alice wins.

Then, remove 3.

Remaining numbers: two 1s, two 2s; XOR=1^1^2^2=0

Bob wins.

Then, remove 1.

Remaining numbers: one 1, two 2s; XOR=1^2^2=1

Alice wins.

Then, remove 2.

Remaining numbers:1,2; XOR=3

Alice wins.

Then, remove 1.

Remaining number:2; XOR=2

Alice wins.

Then, remove 2.

Sequence empty; XOR=0

Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice: after removing four numbers and after removing all numbers.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a better removal order.

Let's try a different order.

Initial sequence: three 1s, three 2s, two 3s.

Initial XOR: 3

Eve removes 3: remaining: three 1s, three 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^1^2^2^2^3=1^0^0^3=1^3=2

Alice wins.

Remove 2: remaining: three 1s, two 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^1^2^2^3=1^0^2^3=1^2^3=4

Alice wins.

Remove 1: remaining: two 1s, two 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^2^2^3=0^0^3=3

Alice wins.

Remove 3: remaining: two 1s, two 2s; XOR=0

Bob wins.

Remove 2: remaining: two 1s, one 2; XOR=1^1^2=0^2=2

Alice wins.

Remove 1: remaining: one 1, one 2; XOR=1^2=3

Alice wins.

Remove 1: remaining: one 2; XOR=2

Alice wins.

Remove 2: sequence empty; XOR=0

Bob wins.

So, again, Bob wins twice.

But the sample output is 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to make Bob win three times.

Let's try a different removal order.

Initial sequence: three 1s, three 2s, two 3s.

Initial XOR: 3

Eve removes 1: remaining: two 1s, three 2s, two 3s; XOR=1^2^2^2^3^3=1^0^2^3=1^2^3=4

Alice wins.

Remove 2: remaining: two 1s, two 2s, two 3s; XOR=1^1^2^2^3^3=0^0^0=0

Bob wins.

Remove 3: remaining: two 1s, two 2s, one 3; XOR=1^1^2^2^3=0^0^3=3

Alice wins.

Remove 1: remaining: one 1, two 2s, one 3; XOR=1^2^2^3=1^0^3=1^3=2

Alice wins.

Remove 2: remaining: one 1, one 2, one 3; XOR=1^2^3=0

Bob wins.

Remove 1: remaining: one 2, one 3; XOR=2^3=1

Alice wins.

Remove 3: remaining: one 2; XOR=2

Alice wins.

Remove 2: sequence empty; XOR=0

Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins three times: after removing two numbers, after removing four numbers, and after removing all numbers.

Hence, the sample output is 3.

So, Eve can arrange the removal order to make Bob win three times.

Now, I need to generalize this.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

cnt = 0

if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:

cnt += 1

for x in a:

cnt += math.floor(x / 2)

print(cnt)

So, it's adding floor(x/2) for each count x, and then adding 1 if all counts of 1,2,3 are odd.

Wait, but in the fourth example, c1=3, c2=3, c3=2, c4=0

floor(3/2)=1, floor(3/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0, so cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the third example, c1=2, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(2/2)=1, floor(0/2)=0, cnt=1+1+1+0=3, which matches.

In the second example, c1=1, c2=0, c3=1, c4=2

floor(1/2)=0, floor(0/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(2/2)=1, cnt=0+0+0+1=1, which matches.

In the first example, c1=1, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

floor(1/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(1/2)=0, floor(0/2)=0, but since a[0]%2 == a[1]%2 == a[2]%2 ==1, cnt +=1, so cnt=1, which matches.

In the fifth example, c1=0, c2=9, c3=9, c4=9

floor(0/2)=0, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, floor(9/2)=4, cnt=0+4+4+4=12, which matches.

So, in all sample inputs, this code produces the correct output.

Now, I need to verify if this logic is correct in general.

Looking back, it seems that cnt is counting the floor(x/2) for each count x, which is like counting the number of pairs in each count.

Additionally, it adds 1 if all counts of 1,2,3 are odd.

Wait, but why is that?

Looking back at
