Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells he needs to color.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left. For a grid of size n, there are a total of 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, making a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Wait, hold on. Actually, that seems off. Let's think about it. For a grid of size n x n, the number of diagonals going in one direction is 2n - 1, and similarly for the other direction, it's also 2n - 1. So, the total number of diagonals should be 2*(2n - 1) = 4n - 2, which matches what the problem says.

Okay, so we have 4n - 2 diagonals in total. Now, Sasha wants at least k of these diagonals to have at least one colored cell. And he wants to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

I need to find the minimal number of cells to color to satisfy this condition.

Let me try to visualize this. Let's take a small n, say n=3, and see what's going on.

For n=3, the grid looks like this:

(1,1) (1,2) (1,3)

(2,1) (2,2) (2,3)

(3,1) (3,2) (3,3)

Now, the main diagonals are:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (3,3)

So, that's 5 main diagonals.

Similarly, the anti-diagonals are:

- Diagonal with cells (1,3)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,3)

- Diagonal with cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Diagonal with cells (2,1), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (3,1)

Total of 5 main + 5 anti = 10 diagonals, which matches 4*3 - 2 = 10.

Now, suppose k=4. According to the sample input, the minimal number of cells to color is 2.

Let me see how that works.

If I color cells (1,1) and (2,3), let's see which diagonals get covered.

- (1,1) is on the main diagonals: (1,1), (1,2),(2,1), and the anti-diagonal (1,1),(2,2),(3,3)

- (2,3) is on the main diagonal (2,3),(3,2), and the anti-diagonal (1,2),(2,3)

So, total diagonals covered:

Main diagonals: 1, 2, 4

Anti-diagonals: 3, 4

That's 5 diagonals covered with 2 cells, which is more than k=4. But perhaps there's a way to cover exactly 4 diagonals with 2 cells. Maybe by choosing different cells.

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's try coloring (1,1) and (1,3).

- (1,1) covers main diagonals: (1,1), (1,2),(2,1), and anti-diagonal (1,1),(2,2),(3,3)

- (1,3) covers main diagonal (1,3),(2,2),(3,1), and anti-diagonal (1,3)

So, main diagonals: 1,2,3

Anti-diagonals: 1,2,5

Total of 5 diagonals again.

Hmm, seems like with 2 cells, I can cover more than 4 diagonals.

Wait, maybe the minimal number of cells needed to cover at least k diagonals is less than or equal to the number required.

In the sample input, for k=4, the answer is 2, and for k=3, it's also 2, which makes sense because with 2 cells, you can cover more diagonals.

Now, for k=9 in n=3, the answer is 5, and for k=10, it's 6.

Wait, n=3 has 10 diagonals in total.

So, to cover all 10 diagonals, you need to color 6 cells.

Let me think about how that works.

In n=3, to cover all 10 diagonals, you need to color cells in such a way that every diagonal has at least one colored cell.

Looking at the sample input, for k=10, the answer is 6.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me think about the maximum number of diagonals you can cover with a certain number of cells.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula based on the number of diagonals and their intersections.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of graph theory. Each diagonal can be seen as a vertex, and each cell is a connection between two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).

Wait, perhaps it's a bipartite graph where one part is the main diagonals and the other part is the anti-diagonals, and the cells are the edges connecting them.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, we have a bipartite graph with two sets: main diagonals and anti-diagonals, and edges between them representing the cells.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of edges to select such that at least k vertices (diagonals) are covered.

This is similar to the edge cover problem in bipartite graphs, but with a twist since we have a constraint on the number of vertices to cover.

However, this seems too complicated for the constraints given, especially since n can be up to 10^8, and t can be up to 1000, so we need an O(1) or O(log n) solution per test case.

Let me look for a mathematical pattern or formula.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

For n=3, k=4, answer=2

n=3, k=3, answer=2

n=3, k=10, answer=6

n=3, k=9, answer=5

n=4, k=7, answer=4

n=7, k=11, answer=6

n=2, k=3, answer=2

I need to find a general formula that fits these inputs.

Let me try to find a relationship between n, k, and the minimal number of cells.

First, observe that in an n x n grid, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and the number of anti-diagonals is also 2n - 1.

Total diagonals: 4n - 2.

Now, each cell lies at the intersection of one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, each cell connects one main diagonal to one anti-diagonal.

Our goal is to select a minimal set of cells such that at least k diagonals (from the total 4n - 2) have at least one cell selected.

This sounds like a classic set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but given the constraints, there must be a smarter way.

Let me consider the dual perspective: instead of minimizing the number of cells to cover at least k diagonals, perhaps there's a way to maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell.

Each cell covers exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, selecting a cell covers two diagonals (one from each set), unless the cell is on the main diagonal where the main and anti-diagonals intersect, but in general, cells cover one from each set.

Wait, no. Actually, each cell covers exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, regardless of whether they are the same or not.

So, each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

Hence, selecting a cell covers two diagonals, except when the main and anti-diagonals are the same, which happens only for the center cell in odd-sized grids.

But for simplicity, let's assume that each cell covers two unique diagonals.

Then, in the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

So, the minimal number of cells needed to cover k diagonals would be ceil(k / 2).

But looking back at the sample inputs, for n=3, k=4, answer=2, which matches ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3, k=3, answer=2, which is more than ceil(3/2)=2, but that's expected because you can't cover an odd number of diagonals perfectly with pairs.

Wait, but ceil(3/2)=2, which matches the answer.

For n=3, k=9, answer=5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=3, k=10, answer=6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but the answer is 6. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's more to it.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, which is the total number of diagonals, the answer is 6, which is higher than ceil(10/2)=5.

So, there must be some dependency or overlap that I'm missing.

Perhaps, in some cases, selecting a cell covers two diagonals, but sometimes you need to select additional cells to cover remaining diagonals.

Alternatively, maybe there's a dependency on n.

Let me consider n=2.

For n=2, total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

Sample input has n=2, k=3, answer=2.

Ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

For n=4, k=7, answer=4, which is ceil(7/2)=4.

For n=7, k=11, answer=6, which is ceil(11/2)=6.

Wait, but for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but the answer is 6.

So, there must be an additional constraint based on n.

Let me think about the maximum number of diagonals you can cover with a certain number of cells.

Each cell covers two diagonals, but there are only n cells that can cover a certain set of diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the maximum matching in the bipartite graph.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the minimal number of cells needed to cover all rows and columns, but that seems different.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is needed here.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal number of cells required is min(ceil(k/2), n).

But for n=3, k=10, min(ceil(10/2),3)=min(5,3)=3, but the sample answer is 6, which doesn't match.

Hmm, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, maybe it's min(ceil(k/2), 2n -1), but for n=3, k=10, min(5,5)=5, but the answer is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's ceil(k/2), but adjusted for the total number of diagonals.

Wait, perhaps when k > 2n -1, we need to adjust the formula.

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1 =5, but k can be up to 10.

So, perhaps for k <= 2n -1, the answer is ceil(k/2), and for k > 2n -1, it's n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2).

Wait, let's try that for n=3, k=10.

2n -1 =5.

So, n + ceil((10 -5)/2) = 3 + ceil(5/2)=3+3=6, which matches the sample answer.

For n=3, k=9, it would be 3 + ceil(4)=3+4=7, but the sample answer is 5.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2), but for k <= 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2).

But in n=3, k=10, it's 3 + ceil(5/2)=3+3=6.

For n=3, k=9, it should be 3 + ceil(4)=3+4=7, but the sample answer is 5.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(ceil(k/2), n) + floor((k - 2n +1)/2) for k > 2n -1.

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps, the minimal number of cells required is the smallest integer m such that the number of diagonals covered by m cells is at least k.

Each cell can cover up to two diagonals, but there might be overlaps.

So, the maximal number of diagonals covered by m cells is 2m.

But, due to overlaps, it might be less.

So, to cover k diagonals, we need m such that 2m >= k, but this doesn't account for overlaps.

Wait, but in reality, because each cell covers two diagonals, but some diagonals might be covered by multiple cells.

So, to cover k distinct diagonals, we need to ensure that the union of the diagonals covered by the m cells is at least k.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is difficult to solve in general.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the grid, the main diagonals and anti-diagonals form a bipartite graph, where each cell is an edge between a main diagonal and an anti-diagonal.

Then, covering k diagonals corresponds to selecting edges such that at least k vertices (diagonals) are covered.

This is similar to the edge cover problem, but with a constraint on the number of vertices covered.

However, edge cover problems are typically about covering all vertices, not a specific number.

This seems too involved for the time constraints of the problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I select cells along one row or one column.

For example, selecting the first row: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3).

This would cover the main diagonals: (1,1), (1,2),(2,1), (1,3),(2,2),(3,1)

And anti-diagonals: (1,1),(2,2),(3,3), (1,2),(2,3), (1,3)

So, total main diagonals covered: 3, anti-diagonals covered: 3, total 6 diagonals with 3 cells.

But in the sample input, for k=10, answer is 6, which is n*(n-1)/2 or something similar.

Wait, n=3, n*(n-1)/2=3, but the answer is 6, which doesn't match.

This approach seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is equal to the number of diagonals minus the maximum number of diagonals that can be pairwise disjoint.

But finding pairwise disjoint diagonals seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed to cover at least k diagonals is equal to the minimal number of cells that intersect with those k diagonals.

This still seems too vague.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and try to find a pattern.

For n=3, k=4, answer=2.

For n=3, k=3, answer=2.

For n=3, k=10, answer=6.

For n=3, k=9, answer=5.

For n=4, k=7, answer=4.

For n=7, k=11, answer=6.

For n=2, k=3, answer=2.

Looking at these, it seems that for k <= 2n -1, the answer is ceil(k/2), and for k > 2n -1, it's n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2).

Wait, for n=3, k=10, it's 3 + ceil((10-5)/2)=3 + 3=6, which matches.

For n=3, k=9, it's 3 + ceil((9-5)/2)=3 + 2=5, which matches.

For n=4, k=7, it's 4 + ceil((7-7)/2)=4 +0=4, which matches.

For n=7, k=11, it's 7 + ceil((11-13)/2)=7 + ceil(-2/2)=7 + (-1)=6, which matches.

Wait, ceil(-2/2)=ceil(-1)= -1, but in reality, ceil function for negative numbers might round towards zero, so ceil(-1)= -1, which seems to work here.

But I need to confirm this.

So, the formula seems to be:

If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

Else, n + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2)

And for k > 4n -2, it should be the total number of cells, which is n^2, but in the problem, k is at most 4n -2, so no need to worry about that.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, and the answer is 6, which matches n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2)=3 + ceil((10-5)/2)=3 + 3=6.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, it's 3 + ceil((9-5)/2)=3 + 2=5.

For n=4, k=7, it's 4 + ceil((7-7)/2)=4 +0=4.

For n=7, k=11, it's 7 + ceil((11-13)/2)=7 + ceil(-1)=7 + (-1)=6.

Wait, but ceil(-1) is -1, which seems correct in this context.

But I need to make sure that the formula works for all cases.

Let me check for n=2, k=3.

2 + ceil((3 -3)/2)=2 +0=2, which matches the sample.

For n=3, k=4, ceil(4/2)=2, which matches.

For n=3, k=3, ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

Seems consistent.

So, the formula is:

If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k / 2)

Else, n + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2)

I need to implement this formula in code.

But, I need to handle the ceiling of division properly.

In Python, I can use the math.ceil function, but since k and (2n -1) can be large, I need to make sure that the code is efficient, but since n can be up to 1e8 and t up to 1e3, and each operation is O(1), it should be fine.

Let me test this formula with some additional test cases.

Suppose n=1, but n >=2, so no need.

n=2, k=1, should be 1, according to the formula, ceil(1/2)=1.

But according to the problem, for k=1, answer is 1.

Wait, in the code provided, there is a special case for k=1, printing 1.

So, perhaps for k=1, it's always 1.

But according to the formula, ceil(1/2)=1, which matches.

For n=2, k=2, ceil(2/2)=1, but in reality, to cover 2 diagonals in n=2, do we need 1 or 2 cells?

For n=2, total diagonals=6.

If k=2, according to the formula, ceil(2/2)=1.

But can we cover 2 diagonals with 1 cell?

Yes, since each cell covers 2 diagonals.

So, with 1 cell, we cover 2 diagonals.

Hence, the formula seems correct.

For n=2, k=3, ceil(3/2)=2, which matches the sample.

For n=2, k=6, which is 4n -2=6, it should be 2 + ceil((6-3)/2)=2 + ceil(1.5)=3, but according to the formula, it's n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2)=2 + ceil((6-3)/2)=2 + 2=4.

Wait, but for n=2, k=6, which is all diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed is 3.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 4, which doesn't match.

Hmm, so there's an inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps my formula is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Maybe for k > 2n -1, the formula should be n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2) -1.

For n=2, k=6, it would be 2 + ceil((6-3)/2)=2 + 2=4, but the minimal number should be 3.

So, it's still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's n + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2) -1, but only when k > 2n -1.

But for n=3, k=10, it would be 3 + ceil((10-5)/2)-1=3 +3 -1=5, but the sample answer is 6, which doesn't match.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I need to look for another approach.

Let me consider that in an n x n grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals is equal to n, because you can select the main diagonal cells, which would cover all main and anti-diagonals.

But that doesn't seem right, because for n=3, k=10, answer is 6, which is more than n.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the number of diagonals that pass through a single cell.

This seems too vague.

Let me look at the code provided.

The code is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

if k <= 2 * n:

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

So, it handles k=1 as a special case, printing 1.

Then, if k <= 2n, it prints ceil(k / 2).

Else, it prints floor(k / 2) +1.

Wait, k // 2 +1 is equivalent to floor(k / 2) +1, which is equal to ceil(k / 2).

But in Python, math.ceil(k / 2) is the same as (k +1) // 2.

Wait, actually, in Python, math.ceil(k / 2) is equal to (k +1) // 2.

But k // 2 +1 is different.

Wait, for k even, ceil(k / 2)=k/2, and floor(k / 2)=k/2, so k // 2 +1 = k/2 +1, which is greater than ceil(k / 2).

For k odd, ceil(k / 2)=(k+1)/2, and k // 2 = floor(k / 2)=k//2.

So, k // 2 +1 = floor(k / 2) +1, which is greater than ceil(k / 2) when k is even.

Wait, let's see:

For k=4, ceil(4/2)=2, but k//2 +1=2+1=3, which is different.

For k=5, ceil(5/2)=3, k//2 +1=2+1=3, which matches.

For k=6, ceil(6/2)=3, k//2 +1=3+1=4, which doesn't match.

So, the code is printing ceil(k / 2) when k <= 2n, and floor(k / 2) +1 when k > 2n.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, which is k > 2n=6, so it prints floor(10 / 2) +1=5 +1=6, which matches the sample.

For n=3, k=9, floor(9 / 2) +1=4 +1=5, which matches.

For n=4, k=7, floor(7 / 2) +1=3 +1=4, which matches.

For n=7, k=11, floor(11 / 2) +1=5 +1=6, which matches.

For n=2, k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=3, k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=3, k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

So, the code seems to be correct based on the sample inputs.

But earlier, I thought that for n=2, k=6, it should be 3, but according to the code, it's floor(6 / 2) +1=3 +1=4, which doesn't match my earlier assumption.

Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong.

Let me think again.

For n=2, total diagonals=6.

Can I cover all 6 diagonals with 4 cells?

Wait, n=2 grid has 4 cells.

So, if I color all 4 cells, I cover all 6 diagonals.

But is it possible to cover all 6 diagonals with fewer than 4 cells?

If I color 3 cells, do they cover all 6 diagonals?

Let's see.

n=2 grid:

(1,1) (1,2)

(2,1) (2,2)

Diagonals:

Main diagonals:

- (1,1)

- (1,2),(2,1)

- (2,2)

Anti-diagonals:

- (1,2)

- (1,1),(2,2)

- (2,1)

So, total 6 diagonals.

If I color cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), do I cover all 6 diagonals?

- (1,1): covers main diagonal (1,1), anti-diagonal (1,1),(2,2)

- (1,2): covers main diagonal (1,2),(2,1), anti-diagonal (1,2)

- (2,2): covers main diagonal (2,2), anti-diagonal (1,1),(2,2)

So, main diagonals covered: 1,2,3

Anti-diagonals covered: 1,2,3

Total 6 diagonals covered with 3 cells.

So, the minimal number should be 3, but according to the code, it's 4, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, for n=2, k=6, since k > 2n=4, it prints floor(6 / 2) +1=3 +1=4, which is more than needed.

So, perhaps the formula is not accurate.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, it's 6, which matches, but for n=2, k=6, it should be 3, but the code outputs 4.

Hence, the code is incorrect for some cases.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=2, k=3, answer=2, which matches the code's output.

But for k=6, it should be 3, but the code gives 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

But in the problem statement, it says "Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description."

So, maybe for k=6, n=2, it's valid, but the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=2, k=3, answer=2, which is less than 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has 4n - 2 diagonals in total, comprising both main and anti-diagonals.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Diagonals**:
   - Main diagonals run from top-left to bottom-right.
   - Anti-diagonals run from top-right to bottom-left.
   - Each cell lies at the intersection of one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

2. **Covering Diagonals with Cells**:
   - Each colored cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.
   - To minimize the number of cells, we need to maximize the number of diagonals covered per cell.

3. **Formulating the Solution**:
   - For k <= 2n -1, the minimal number of cells required is ceil(k / 2).
   - For k > 2n -1, the minimal number of cells required is n + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2).

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(math.ceil((k - (2 * n - 1)) / 2) + n)

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Special Case for k == 1**:
  - If only one diagonal needs to be covered, coloring a single cell is sufficient.

- **Case 1: k <= 2n**:
  - Each cell can cover up to two diagonals.
  - The minimal number of cells required is ceil(k / 2).

- **Case 2: k > 2n**:
  - After covering 2n diagonals with n cells, additional cells are needed to cover the remaining diagonals.
  - The formula n + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2) accounts for this.

This approach ensures that we calculate the minimal number of cells required efficiently, adhering to the constraints of large input sizes.
