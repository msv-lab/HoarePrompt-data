Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

And I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these n constraints. Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of k is finite. Plus, no two constraints are the same.

First, I need to understand the input and output format. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line is t, the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line is n, the number of constraints, followed by n lines each containing a pair of integers a and x, where a is the type of constraint and x is the value.

My task is to process these constraints and find the number of integers k that satisfy all of them.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to first determine the range of k based on the constraints of type 1 and 2, and then subtract the numbers that are excluded by the constraints of type 3 within that range.

So, for constraints of type 1 (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among them because k needs to satisfy all constraints. Similarly, for constraints of type 2 (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among them.

Then, the possible values of k are from max_type1 to min_type2, inclusive.

After that, I need to subtract the numbers that are excluded by the constraints of type 3 (k != x).

But I have to be careful because constraints of type 3 might overlap or be outside the range determined by type 1 and 2 constraints.

Wait, but the problem says that no two constraints are the exact same, so no duplicate constraints.

Also, it's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and that the answer is finite.

Okay, let's think about an example.

Take the first example from the input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, n=4, with constraints:

- k >= 3

- k <= 10

- k != 1

- k != 5

From k >= 3 and k <= 10, the possible k are 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But k !=1 and k!=5, but since k >=3, k=1 is already excluded. So, only k=5 is excluded from the range.

Therefore, the possible k are 3,4,6,7,8,9,10, which is 7 numbers.

That matches the first output.

Another example:

2

1 5

2 4

Here, k >=5 and k <=4, which is impossible, so 0.

Got it.

So, in general, I need to find the intersection of all these constraints.

I can keep track of the lower bound using the maximum of all type 1 constraints, and the upper bound using the minimum of all type 2 constraints.

Then, the number of integers in this range is upper_bound - lower_bound + 1.

Then, I need to subtract the number of integers in this range that are excluded by the type 3 constraints.

Since type 3 constraints are k != x, and x can be in or out of the range.

So, I need to count how many x in type 3 are within the range [lower, upper], and subtract that count from the total range size.

But I have to ensure that the range is valid, meaning lower_bound <= upper_bound.

If lower_bound > upper_bound, then there are no integers that satisfy the constraints, so the answer is 0.

Also, since n can be up to 100 and t up to 500, efficiency shouldn't be a big issue here.

Let me think about potential edge cases.

- All constraints are type 1 and 2, no type 3.

- Only one type 3 constraint.

- Multiple type 3 constraints.

- Type 3 constraints that are outside the range, which shouldn't affect the count.

- Type 3 constraints that are within the range.

- When lower_bound == upper_bound, and it's excluded by type 3.

- When the range is large, up to 10^9.

I need to make sure that I handle large ranges correctly, but since I'm just calculating the count, it should be fine.

Also, need to ensure that the type 3 constraints don't cause duplicates, but since the problem states that no two constraints are the same, I don't need to worry about duplicate exclusions.

Let me think about how to implement this.

I'll read t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, the number of constraints.

- Initialize lower_bound to the smallest possible integer, say -infinity.

- Initialize upper_bound to the largest possible integer, say +infinity.

- Initialize a set to store the type 3 constraints.

- Read each constraint:

- If a=1, set lower_bound to max(lower_bound, x)

- If a=2, set upper_bound to min(upper_bound, x)

- If a=3, add x to the set of excluded numbers.

- After processing all constraints, check if lower_bound <= upper_bound.

- If not, the answer is 0.

- Else, calculate the number of integers in [lower_bound, upper_bound], which is upper_bound - lower_bound + 1.

- Then, count how many numbers in the excluded set fall within this range.

- Subtract this count from the range size to get the final answer.

Seems straightforward.

Let me think about how to implement this in code.

I'll need to read input efficiently.

Since n can be up to 100 and t up to 500, it's manageable.

I'll use Python for this.

Initialize lower_bound to a very small number, like -1e18, and upper_bound to a very large number, like 1e18.

But actually, since x can be up to 1e9, and constraints are a and x, I think using standard int in Python should be fine.

But to be safe, I'll use int in Python, which can handle large integers.

Also, using a set for type 3 constraints to ensure uniqueness.

Then, for each test case, collect all constraints, determine lower and upper bounds, and the excluded numbers.

Then, calculate the range size, and subtract the count of excluded numbers within the range.

Let me think about the implementation in more detail.

Define a function to handle each test case.

But in the given code, it's not using a function, just processing all test cases in a loop.

That should be fine.

Read t, then loop t times, read n, then n lines of constraints.

For each constraint, parse a and x.

Based on a, update lower_bound or upper_bound accordingly.

If a=1, bx = max(bx, x)

If a=2, ax = min(ax, x)

If a=3, add x to cx set.

Then, if bx > ax, impossible, so 0.

Else, calculate ax - bx + 1, then subtract the number of excluded x in cx that are within [bx, ax].

So, in the code, it's using cx as a set to store the type 3 constraints.

Then, it's calculating tmp, which is the count of excluded x in the range [bx, ax].

Finally, ax - bx + 1 - tmp is the answer for that test case.

Seems correct.

Let me check with the first example.

n=4

Constraints:

1 3 -> bx = max(-1,3) = 3

2 10 -> ax = min(1e9,10) =10

3 1 -> cx={1}

3 5 -> cx={1,5}

Then, bx=3, ax=10

Check if 3 > 10? No.

Then, tmp= number of x in cx where x >=3 and x <=10.

cx={1,5}

1 is less than 3, so only 5 is in the range.

So, tmp=1

Then, 10-3+1 -1 =7, which matches the first output.

Good.

Another example:

n=2

1 5

2 4

Then, bx=max(-1,5)=5

ax=min(1e9,4)=4

Check if 5 >4, yes, so 0.

Correct.

Another example:

n=10

Constraints:

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

So, type 1 constraints: 1 3, 1 7, 1 2 -> bx = max(3,7,2)=7

Type 2 constraints: 2 100, 2 98 -> ax=min(1e9,100,98)=98

Type 3 constraints: 6,7,100,44,99

Then, check if 7 >98? No.

So, range is 7 to 98.

tmp= number of excluded x in [7,98]

cx={6,7,100,44,99}

6 is less than 7, so excluded.

100 is greater than 98, so excluded.

99 is greater than 98, so excluded.

So, only 7 and 44 are in the range.

tmp=2

So, 98-7+1 -2 =92-2=90, which matches the third output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=6

1 5

2 10

1 9

2 2

3 2

3 9

So, type 1: 1 5, 1 9 -> bx=max(5,9)=9

Type 2: 2 10, 2 2 -> ax=min(1e9,10,2)=2

Check if 9 >2, yes, so 0.

Correct, matches the fourth output.

Another test case:

n=5

1 1

2 2

3 1

3 2

3 3

Type 1: 1 1 -> bx=1

Type 2: 2 2 -> ax=2

Type 3: 1,2,3

Range: 1 to 2.

Excluded: 1 and 2 are in the range.

So, tmp=2

2-1+1 -2=1-2=-1, but since it can't be negative, it should be 0.

Wait, but in the code, it's ax - bx +1 -tmp, so 2-1+1=2 -2=0.

Correct, matches the fifth output.

Another test case:

n=6

1 10000

2 900000000

3 500000000

1 100000000

3 10000

3 900000001

Type 1: 1 10000, 1 100000000 -> bx=max(10000,100000000)=100000000

Type 2: 2 900000000 -> ax=900000000

Type 3: 500000000,10000,900000001

Range: 100000000 to 900000000

Excluded: 500000000 is in the range, 10000 is less than bx, 900000001 is greater than ax.

So, tmp=1 (only 500000000)

So, 900000000 - 100000000 +1 -1 =800000000, matches the sixth output.

Great.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

r = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

cx = set()

ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)

bx = -1

for _ in range(n):

(a, x) = map(int, input().split())

if a == 1:

bx = max(x, bx)

elif a == 2:

ax = min(x, ax)

else:

cx.add(x)

if bx > ax:

r.append(0)

else:

tmp = 0

for i in cx:

if i >= bx and i <= ax:

tmp += 1

r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)

print(*r, sep='\n')





I need to verify if this code correctly implements the logic I just described.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

Then, for each test case, it reads n, the number of constraints.

It initializes cx as an empty set to store type 3 constraints.

Then, it initializes ax and bx.

Wait, ax is set to int(1000000000.0 + 7), which is int(1000000007.0), so ax=1000000007

bx is set to -1.

Then, it reads n constraints.

For each constraint:

If a=1, bx = max(x, bx)

If a=2, ax = min(x, ax)

If a=3, add x to cx set.

Then, if bx > ax, it's impossible, so append 0 to r.

Else, calculate tmp as the count of x in cx that are within [bx, ax].

Then, append ax - bx +1 - tmp to r.

Finally, print all elements in r separated by newline.

Seems correct.

But I need to check if the initial values of ax and bx are appropriate.

ax is set to 1000000007, which is larger than 1e9, so it should work as an initial upper bound.

bx is set to -1, which is smaller than any possible x, so it should work as an initial lower bound.

But, wait, x can be as low as 1, but in the problem, x is at least 1, but to be safe, maybe set bx to -infinity, but in Python, we can set bx to -1e18 or something like that.

But -1 is also fine since x >=1.

So, it should be okay.

Then, the calculation of tmp is correct, iterating through cx and counting how many are within [bx, ax].

Finally, ax - bx +1 - tmp is the correct count.

So, I think this code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
