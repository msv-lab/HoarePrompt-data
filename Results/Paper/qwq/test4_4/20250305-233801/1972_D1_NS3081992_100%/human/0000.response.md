Alright, I have this problem to solve. I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, such that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

First, I need to understand the condition: a + b should be a multiple of b * GCD(a, b). In other words, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b without leaving a remainder.

Let's denote GCD(a, b) as d. So, d divides both a and b. That means we can write a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where GCD(a1, b1) = 1.

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * GCD(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes: d^2 * b1 divides d * (a1 + b1), which simplifies to d * b1 divides (a1 + b1).

Since GCD(a1, b1) = 1, a1 and b1 are coprime.

So, d * b1 divides a1 + b1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, which puts some constraints on possible values of a1 and b1.

Let's think about this differently. Since a1 and b1 are coprime, and d * b1 divides a1 + b1, then b1 divides a1 + b1.

Because b1 divides d * b1, and d * b1 divides a1 + b1, then b1 divides a1 + b1.

But since b1 divides b1, and a1 and b1 are coprime, then b1 divides a1 + b1 implies b1 divides a1.

But a1 and b1 are coprime, so the only way b1 divides a1 is if b1 = 1.

Wait, that seems off. If b1 divides a1 and GCD(a1, b1) = 1, then b1 must be 1.

So, b1 = 1.

That means b = d * 1 = d.

And a = d * a1.

Given that b1 = 1, which implies b = d.

So, for the condition to hold, b must be equal to GCD(a, b).

But GCD(a, b) divides b, so b being equal to GCD(a, b) implies that b divides a.

Wait, no. If b = GCD(a, b), then since GCD(a, b) divides a, b divides a.

So, b divides a.

Wait, that seems like a key insight.

So, the condition a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b) simplifies to b divides a.

Is that correct?

Let me verify.

If b divides a, then a = k * b for some integer k.

Then, a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

And b * GCD(a, b) = b * GCD(k * b, b) = b * b, since GCD(k * b, b) = b * GCD(k, 1) = b * 1 = b.

Wait, no.

Wait, GCD(k * b, b) = b * GCD(k, 1) = b * 1 = b.

So, b * GCD(a, b) = b * b = b^2.

And a + b = (k + 1) * b.

So, we need b^2 to divide (k + 1) * b.

Which simplifies to b divides (k + 1).

But b divides (k + 1) * b implies b divides (k + 1) * b.

But since b divides b, and GCD(b, k + 1) could be anything, but in this case, it's sufficient that b divides (k + 1) * b, which is always true because b divides b.

Wait, that seems too loose.

Wait, no.

If b divides (k + 1) * b, and b divides b, then it's always true.

But that can't be right because not all pairs where b divides a satisfy the original condition.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me re-examine.

Given that a = k * b, then a + b = (k + 1) * b.

And b * GCD(a, b) = b * GCD(k * b, b) = b * b.

So, we need b^2 to divide (k + 1) * b.

Which means b divides (k + 1).

Because b^2 divides (k + 1) * b implies b divides (k + 1).

So, b divides (k + 1).

But k = a / b, so k is an integer since b divides a.

So, b divides (k + 1), where k is integer.

Wait, but k + 1 is integer, so b divides an integer.

But for b to divide k + 1, k + 1 must be a multiple of b.

Wait, that's an additional constraint.

So, not only does b divide a, but k + 1 must be a multiple of b.

Wait, that seems like an extra condition.

Wait, hold on.

If a = k * b, and k + 1 is a multiple of b, say k + 1 = m * b for some integer m, then k = m * b - 1.

So, a = (m * b - 1) * b = m * b^2 - b.

Therefore, a = m * b^2 - b.

So, for each b, a must be of the form m * b^2 - b, for some integer m ≥ 1.

Wait, but a must be at least 1.

So, m * b^2 - b ≥ 1.

Which implies m ≥ (1 + b) / b^2.

But since m is integer, m ≥ ceil((1 + b)/b^2).

But b is at least 1, so let's see for b = 1:

m ≥ (1 + 1)/1^2 = 2/1 = 2, so m ≥ 2.

Then a = m * 1^2 - 1 = m - 1.

Since m ≥ 2, a ≥ 1.

For b = 2:

m ≥ (1 + 2)/4 = 3/4, so m ≥ 1.

a = m * 4 - 2.

For m = 1, a = 2.

For m = 2, a = 6.

And so on.

Wait, but this seems complicated.

Is there a better way to approach this?

Maybe I should look for a different way to express the condition.

Let me try to rephrase the condition.

We have a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b).

Which means that b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Let me denote d = GCD(a, b).

Then, a = d * a', b = d * b', where GCD(a', b') = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

b * d divides a + b → d * b' * d divides d * a' + d * b' → d^2 * b' divides d * (a' + b') → d * b' divides (a' + b').

Since GCD(a', b') = 1, and b' divides a' + b', then b' divides a'.

But since GCD(a', b') = 1, b' must be 1.

Therefore, b' = 1.

Which implies that b = d * 1 = d.

So, b = d = GCD(a, b).

But since d divides a, and b = d, then b divides a.

Moreover, since b = d, and d divides b, it's consistent.

So, the condition simplifies to b divides a and b = GCD(a, b).

But since b = GCD(a, b), and b divides a, this seems redundant.

Wait, but GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, so if b divides a, then GCD(a, b) = b.

So, the condition b = GCD(a, b) is automatically satisfied if b divides a.

Therefore, the condition reduces to b divides a.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that there's an additional condition that k + 1 is divisible by b.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconcile these thoughts.

Let me carefully go through it again.

Given that b divides a, so a = k * b for some integer k ≥ 1.

Then, GCD(a, b) = GCD(k * b, b) = b.

So, b * GCD(a, b) = b * b = b^2.

And a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

So, the condition is that b^2 divides (k + 1) * b.

Which simplifies to b divides (k + 1).

Because b^2 divides (k + 1) * b implies b divides (k + 1).

So, b divides (k + 1).

Since k + 1 is an integer, this means that k + 1 is a multiple of b.

So, k + 1 = m * b for some integer m ≥ 1.

Therefore, k = m * b - 1.

Thus, a = k * b = (m * b - 1) * b = m * b^2 - b.

So, for each b, a must be of the form m * b^2 - b, for m ≥ 1.

Given that a must be at least 1, we have m * b^2 - b ≥ 1 ⇒ m ≥ (1 + b)/b^2.

Since m is an integer, m ≥ ceil((1 + b)/b^2).

Now, for each b from 1 to m, we can find the possible values of m, and thus the corresponding a.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me see if there's a better way.

Looking back at the condition: b divides a and b divides (a + b).

Wait, if b divides a, then b divides a + b automatically, since b divides both a and b.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily true.

Wait, if b divides a, then b divides a + b, because a = k * b, so a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b, which is clearly divisible by b.

So, the condition is simply that b divides a.

But earlier, I had that b divides (k + 1), which seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me double-check.

Given that b divides a, so a = k * b.

Then, a + b = (k + 1) * b.

And b * GCD(a, b) = b * b, since GCD(a, b) = b.

So, the condition is that b^2 divides (k + 1) * b.

Which simplifies to b divides (k + 1).

So, b divides (k + 1).

Therefore, k + 1 is a multiple of b, i.e., k + 1 = m * b for some integer m ≥ 1.

Thus, k = m * b - 1.

Therefore, a = k * b = (m * b - 1) * b = m * b^2 - b.

Hence, for each b, a must be of the form m * b^2 - b, for m ≥ 1, and 1 ≤ a ≤ n.

So, for each b from 1 to m, we can find the number of integers m such that m * b^2 - b ≥ 1 and m * b^2 - b ≤ n.

Simplifying, m * b^2 ≤ n + b.

So, m ≤ (n + b)/b^2.

Since m is an integer, m ≤ floor((n + b)/b^2).

Therefore, for each b, the number of valid m is floor((n + b)/b^2).

But m must be at least 1, so for each b, the number of valid a is floor((n + b)/b^2), provided that m * b^2 - b ≥ 1.

Wait, m * b^2 - b ≥ 1 ⇒ m * b^2 ≥ b + 1 ⇒ m ≥ ceil((b + 1)/b^2).

But since m is at least 1, and (b + 1)/b^2 is less than or equal to 1 for b ≥ 1, m starts from 1.

Therefore, for each b from 1 to m, the number of valid a is floor((n + b)/b^2).

Hence, the total number of pairs is the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2).

This seems manageable.

Now, considering the constraints:

- t ≤ 10^4

- n and m up to 2*10^6

- Sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2*10^6

So, per test case, n and m can be up to 2*10^6, but the total sum over all test cases is limited to 2*10^6.

This suggests that the time complexity should be O(t * m), but since t can be up to 10^4 and m up to 2*10^6, and t * m could be up to 10^10, which is too slow.

Therefore, I need a faster approach.

Let's see if I can optimize the calculation of the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2).

Let me denote k = b^2.

Then, floor((n + b)/k) = floor((n + b)/b^2).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over b and compute floor((n + b)/b^2) for each b.

But with m up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, this would be too slow.

I need a way to compute this sum more efficiently.

Let me consider the function floor((n + b)/b^2).

Let me rewrite it:

floor((n + b)/b^2) = floor(n/b^2 + 1/b).

Since b is a positive integer, 1/b is less than or equal to 1.

Therefore, floor(n/b^2 + 1/b) = floor(n/b^2) + floor(1/b).

But floor(1/b) is 1 for b = 1, and 0 for b >= 2.

So, floor((n + b)/b^2) = floor(n/b^2) + [1 if b == 1 else 0].

Therefore, the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2) is equal to the sum over b from 1 to m of floor(n/b^2) plus the number of b where b == 1.

In other words, it's equal to the sum over b from 1 to m of floor(n/b^2) plus 1 if m >= 1.

But since m >=1 in all test cases (as per constraints), we can consider it accordingly.

Wait, but b starts from 1, so for b=1, floor(n/1^2) +1, but according to the earlier expression, floor(n/b^2) + [1 if b==1 else 0], it seems a bit messy.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle b=1 separately.

Let me compute floor((n + b)/b^2) for b=1:

floor((n + 1)/1^2) = floor(n + 1) = n + 1.

For b >=2, floor((n + b)/b^2).

So, the total sum is n + 1 plus the sum from b=2 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2).

But this still seems inefficient to compute directly for large m.

I need a better way to compute this sum.

Let me consider the general term floor((n + b)/b^2).

Let me denote k = b^2.

Then, floor((n + b)/k) = floor((n + b)/b^2).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the range of b where b^2 is less than or equal to n + b.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

I recall that in number theory, sums involving floor division can often be optimized using techniques like divisor summation optimization, where we group terms with the same value of floor(n/i).

In this case, the floor division is floor(n/b^2), which is similar to floor(n/i), where i = b^2.

So, perhaps I can iterate over the possible values of b^2 and group terms accordingly.

Let me consider that.

Define i = b^2.

Then, for each i that is a perfect square, say i = k^2 for integer k, then b = k.

So, the sum becomes sum over k from 1 to floor(sqrt(m)) of floor(n/k^2) + [1 if k ==1 else 0].

Wait, but m can be up to 2*10^6, so floor(sqrt(m)) is up to floor(sqrt(2*10^6)) ≈ floor(1414.21) = 1414.

So, for each test case, I can iterate up to 1414 and compute the sum.

Wait, but m can be up to 2*10^6, but floor(sqrt(m)) is up to 1414.

Wait, but in reality, floor(sqrt(2*10^6)) is floor(1414.2135...) = 1414.

So, for each test case, I need to iterate up to 1414 and compute the sum.

But t can be up to 10^4, and for each test case, iterating up to 1414 is acceptable, as 10^4 * 1414 ≈ 1.4*10^7 operations, which should be manageable.

But perhaps I can optimize it further.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case, read n and m.

2. Compute the sum over b from 1 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2).

3. To optimize this sum, note that b^2 can be grouped, since floor(n/b^2) can take on fewer distinct values.

4. Iterate over b from 1 to min(m, floor(sqrt(n + b))).

Wait, that might be too vague.

Let me think about the standard technique for optimizing sums involving floor(n/i).

In standard divisor summation optimization, we group terms where floor(n/i) is constant.

Similarly, here, we can group terms where floor(n/b^2) is constant.

Let me attempt to implement this optimization.

First, for a given n and m, I need to compute sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/b^2).

As discussed earlier, for b=1, this is n + 1.

For b >=2, it's floor((n + b)/b^2).

But to optimize, I'll consider the general sum sum_{b=1}^m floor((n + b)/b^2).

Let me define a function to compute this sum efficiently.

I'll use the fact that the number of distinct values of floor(n/b^2) is small, specifically O(sqrt(n)).

Wait, but n can be up to 2*10^6, so sqrt(n) is up to ~1414.

Similarly, m is up to 2*10^6, but in practice, b^2 can be up to m^2, but since b goes up to m, b^2 can be up to m^2, but m is up to 2*10^6.

But in reality, for b from 1 to m, b^2 from 1 to m^2, but n + b is up to 2*10^6 + 2*10^6 = 4*10^6.

So, floor((n + b)/b^2) can be computed for each b, but with optimization.

Let me attempt to implement an optimized version.

I'll iterate b from 1 to m, and compute floor((n + b)/b^2), but group b's that have the same floor((n + b)/k), where k = b^2.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the ranges where floor((n + b)/b^2) is constant.

This is similar to finding the maximum number of b's for which floor((n + b)/b^2) remains the same.

Then, I can compute the value for that range and multiply by the number of b's in that range.

This can reduce the number of iterations significantly.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Define l = 1

While l <= m:

Set r = m

While l <= r:

Set mid = (l + r + 1) // 2

If floor((n + mid)/mid^2) == floor((n + l)/l^2):

Set l = mid

Else:

Set r = mid - 1

Within this range, the value floor((n + b)/b^2) is constant for b from current l to r.

Then, add the value multiplied by the count (r - l + 1) to the sum.

Set l = r + 1

This is a standard approach for optimizing such sums.

But implementing this for each test case separately might still be too slow if t is up to 10^4.

Wait, but with t up to 10^4 and m up to 2*10^6, and the sum over all test cases of m is up to 2*10^6, it should be manageable.

Because the total time complexity would be O(t * sqrt(m)), which is approximately O(10^4 * 1414) = O(1.4*10^7), which is acceptable.

Therefore, I can proceed with this approach.

Let me outline the steps again:

- For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Initialize sum = 0.

- Iterate b from 1 to m:

- Compute floor((n + b)/b^2).

- Add this value to the sum.

- But optimize this loop using the standard optimization technique.

- Print the sum.

Implementing this optimization will make the solution efficient enough.

Let me consider the edge cases.

- When n = 1 and m = 1:

- Only pair is (1,1):

- a + b = 2

- b * GCD(a,b) = 1 * 1 = 1

- 1 divides 2, so it's valid.

- Output: 1

- When n = 2 and m = 3:

- Possible pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (1,2), (1,3)

- Check each:

- (1,1): 1 + 1 = 2, 1 * 1 = 1, 1 divides 2 → valid

- (2,1): 2 + 1 = 3, 1 * 1 = 1, 1 divides 3 → valid

- (2,2): 2 + 2 = 4, 2 * 2 = 4, 4 divides 4 → valid

- (2,3): 2 + 3 = 5, 3 * 1 = 3, 3 divides 5? No.

- (1,2): 1 + 2 = 3, 2 * 1 = 2, 2 divides 3? No.

- (1,3): 1 + 3 = 4, 3 * 1 = 3, 3 divides 4? No.

- So, only 3 valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2)

- Output: 3

- Another test case: n = 10, m = 8

- From the note, there are 14 valid pairs.

- I won't list them here, but assuming the analysis is correct.

Therefore, the approach seems valid.

Now, considering the provided code, I need to check if it correctly implements this logic.

Looking at the code:

- There are multiple functions defined, but the main function is func_16(), which calls func_15() for each test case.

- func_15() seems to implement the logic for one test case.

Looking into func_15():

def func_15():

(n, m) = func_7()

i = 1

ans = 0

while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

i += 1

return ans - 1

Wait, this seems similar to the optimized approach I was thinking about.

Let me analyze it.

- It reads n and m using func_7(), which splits input into integers.

- Initializes i =1 and ans =0.

- Then, it runs a loop while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:

- ans += (n + i) // (i * i)

- i +=1

- Finally, returns ans -1

Wait, why ans -1? In the earlier analysis, for b=1, floor((n + b)/b^2) = n +1, but here, it seems to include b=1 in the sum and then subtract 1 at the end.

Wait, let's see.

In the loop, it iterates i from 1 to m, and as long as i * i <= n + i.

Wait, for i=1:

(n + 1)//(1*1) = (n +1)//1 = n +1

Then i=2:

If 4 <= n +2, then add (n +2)//4

And so on, until i * i > n + i.

Then, it returns ans -1.

In the first test case, n=1, m=1:

i=1: 1 <=1 and 1 <= 1 +1 =2 → ans += 2, i=2

i=2: 2 <=1? No → stop → ans=2 → return 2-1=1, which matches the expected output.

In the second test case, n=2, m=3:

i=1: 1 <=3 and 1 <=2+1=3 → ans +=3, i=2

i=2: 2 <=3 and 4 <=2+2=4 → ans +=1, i=3

i=3: 3 <=3 and 9 <=2+3=5? No → stop → ans=4 → return 4-1=3, which matches the expected output.

In the fourth test case, n=10, m=8:

i=1: 1 <=8 and 1 <=10+1=11 → ans +=11, i=2

i=2: 2 <=8 and 4 <=10+2=12 → ans +=3, i=3

i=3: 3 <=8 and 9 <=10+3=13 → ans +=1, i=4

i=4: 4 <=8 and 16 <=10+4=14? No → stop → ans=15 → return 15-1=14, which matches the expected output.

So, this seems correct.

But why subtract 1 at the end?

Looking back, for b=1, floor((n +1)/1)=n +1, which is included in the sum.

But perhaps there's an off-by-one error.

Wait, in the loop, it adds (n +i)//(i*i) for i from 1 to some limit.

But for i=1, it adds n +1.

Then, for i=2, it adds floor((n +2)/4), and so on.

But in the end, it subtracts 1.

Wait, perhaps it's because b=1 is being overcounted.

Wait, in the first test case, with n=1, m=1:

Only (1,1) is valid.

But the sum would be (1 +1)//1 =2, then subtract 1 to get 1.

Similarly, in the second test case, sum is 3 +1 =4, subtract 1 to get 3.

Wait, but why?

Wait, perhaps the subtraction of 1 is to adjust for the inclusion of b=1.

But in the first test case, it's correct.

In the second test case, it's correct.

In the fourth test case, it's correct.

So, perhaps it's a correct implementation.

Therefore, the given program is correct.
