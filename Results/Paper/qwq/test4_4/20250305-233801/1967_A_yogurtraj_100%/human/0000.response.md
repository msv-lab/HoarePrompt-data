Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards, each with a number from 1 to n, and I have a certain number of cards for each number, given by a_i for each i from 1 to n. Then, I can buy up to k new cards, and I can choose any numbers from 1 to n for these new cards. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

First, I need to understand what a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n] means in this context. It means that in any sequence of n cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once. So, in other words, there are no duplicates in any n-length subarray.

My goal is to maximize the number of such subarrays in my arrangement of cards.

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order I want, and I can choose which numbers to buy with my k coins, I need to strategize how to arrange them to maximize these permutations.

Let's think about the total number of possible n-length subarrays in an array of length m. It's m - n + 1. So, if I have an array of length m, the number of n-length subarrays is m - n + 1.

But not all of these will be permutations of [1,2,...,n]. I need to maximize how many of these are actual permutations.

One way to approach this is to try to create as many n-length windows as possible that contain each number exactly once.

I recall that in sliding window problems, especially those involving frequencies of elements, we often use a frequency map to keep track of how many times each element appears in the current window.

But given the constraints here, with n up to 2*10^5 and a_i up to 10^12, and k up to 10^12, it's clear that a straightforward simulation isn't feasible due to time and memory constraints.

I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of such permutations without simulating the entire arrangement.

Let's consider the minimal requirements for each n-length window to be a permutation: each number from 1 to n must appear exactly once.

So, for each window of size n, the frequency of each number must be exactly one.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to arrange the cards in such a way that as many n-length segments as possible satisfy this condition.

I also have the option to buy up to k additional cards, choosing any numbers from 1 to n for them.

First, I need to consider the initial distribution of cards I have.

Let me denote the total number of cards I have initially as s = sum_{i=1 to n} a_i.

Then, after buying k cards, the total number of cards becomes s + k.

The number of n-length subarrays I can have in this arrangement is (s + k) - n + 1.

However, not all of these will be permutations; I need to maximize how many of them are permutations.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations.

One strategy that comes to mind is to arrange the cards in a way that repeats the sequence [1,2,...,n] as much as possible, because each such sequence will have windows that are permutations.

But I need to be careful with the counts of each number.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of periodicity. If I arrange the cards in a repeating sequence of [1,2,...,n], then every n-length window will be a permutation.

But I need to ensure that I have enough cards of each number to sustain this arrangement.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I want to create as many n-length windows that are permutations as possible.

Each such window requires that each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

So, the number of such windows is limited by the number of times I can place a complete set of [1,2,...,n] in the arrangement.

But I can overlap these windows.

Wait, actually, in a sequence like [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], for n=3, the windows are:

[1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [1,2,3], etc.

Each of these is a permutation of [1,2,3].

So, even though the sequence repeats, each window is a permutation.

So, if I can arrange the cards in a sequence where every n cards form a permutation, that would be ideal.

But I need to maximize the number of such windows, given the constraints on the number of cards I have for each number.

Let me consider the minimal number of times each number needs to appear to achieve a certain number of windows.

Suppose I want to have m such windows.

Each window requires one of each number, but since windows can overlap, some numbers can be shared between windows.

Specifically, each number can be part of multiple windows.

In fact, in a sliding window approach, each new window shares n-1 elements with the previous window.

So, to maximize the number of windows, I need to ensure that I have enough cards of each number to cover the demands of these overlapping windows.

This sounds like a problem of covering a sequence with overlapping windows, where each window has specific requirements.

I think it's similar to creating a sequence where the frequency of each number is spread out in such a way that as many n-length windows as possible are permutations.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the total number of windows I can have, which is (total number of cards - n + 1), and try to maximize how many of these are permutations.

But again, with large n and a_i up to 1e12, I need a more efficient way.

Perhaps I should consider the minimal number of times each number needs to appear to achieve a certain number of windows.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of complete sets of [1,2,...,n] I can form with the cards I have, and then see how many windows I can get from that.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that each complete set of [1,2,...,n] allows me to form n permutations if arranged properly.

But that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Another idea: the number of windows that are permutations is equal to the number of positions where the n cards starting at that position form a permutation.

So, if I can arrange the sequence so that as many consecutive n-card groups as possible are permutations, that would maximize the count.

But how?

I need to ensure that in each group of n cards, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once.

This sounds like requiring that the sequence is a concatenation of multiple [1,2,...,n] blocks, or some arrangement where the overlapping windows maintain the permutation property.

But maybe that's not the most efficient way.

Let me try to think in terms of frequency.

Suppose I have f_i cards of number i for each i from 1 to n.

Then, in a sequence of m cards, the total number of windows is m - n + 1.

Each window is a permutation if and only if each number appears exactly once in that window.

So, for each window, the frequency of each number is exactly one.

To maximize the number of such windows, I need to arrange the cards so that as many n-length segments as possible have each frequency equal to one.

This seems tricky to maximize directly.

Perhaps I should look for a lower bound or some other way to approach this.

Wait, maybe inclusion-exclusion could help, but I don't think it's practical here.

Given time constraints, I need a better approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the minimal frequency required for each number to achieve a certain number of windows.

Suppose I want w windows, each being a permutation.

Each window requires one of each number.

But since windows overlap, some numbers can be shared between windows.

Specifically, two consecutive windows share n-1 numbers.

So, the number of times each number needs to appear to have w windows is roughly w, but with overlaps, it's less.

Wait, more precisely, for w windows, I need at least w occurrences of each number, but with overlaps, I can reduce the total number of cards needed.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the total number of windows I can achieve given the constraints on the number of cards I have.

I need to maximize the number of windows, w, such that the total number of cards I need is less than or equal to the sum of a_i plus k.

But I need a better way to model this.

Perhaps I can model it as covering the windows with the available cards.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=1, k=10

a=[1]

So, I have one card with number 1, and I can buy 10 more cards, each with number 1.

So, total cards: 11 ones.

The only possible subarray is of length 1, which is [1], and there are 11 such subarrays, all of which are permutations of [1].

So, the answer is 11.

Makes sense.

Second test case:

n=2, k=4

a=[8,4]

So, I have 8 ones and 4 twos.

I can buy 4 more cards, choosing numbers from 1 and 2.

Let's say I buy 0 ones and 4 twos, so now I have 8 ones and 8 twos.

One possible arrangement is alternating ones and twos: [1,2,1,2,...,1,2]

In this case, every window of size 2 is [1,2], which is a permutation of [1,2].

There are 15 such windows.

But the explanation says that arranging [1,2,1,2,...,1,2] gives 8 subarrays [1,2] and 7 subarrays [2,1], totaling 15.

Wait, in the arrangement [1,2,1,2,...,1,2], the windows are:

[1,2], [2,1], [1,2], [2,1], ..., [1,2], [2,1]

So, if there are 16 cards (8 ones and 8 twos), the number of windows is 16 - 2 + 1 = 15.

Each window is either [1,2] or [2,1], both of which are permutations of [1,2].

Hence, all 15 windows are permutations.

So, the maximum is 15.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=4

a=[6,1,8]

After buying 4 cards, let's say I buy 2 cards of 2 and 2 cards of 3, so now a=[6,3,10]

I need to arrange these to maximize the number of 3-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,3].

One possible arrangement is [3,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,3]

In this arrangement, the windows would be various combinations, but it's complicated to count manually.

The output is 15, but I need to find a general approach.

From these examples, it seems that arranging the cards in a way that repeats the sequence [1,2,...,n] as much as possible maximizes the number of permutation windows.

So, perhaps the strategy is to create as many complete blocks of [1,2,...,n] as possible, and then arrange the remaining cards to extend these blocks as much as possible.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me consider that each complete block of [1,2,...,n] contributes n permutation windows.

Wait, no.

In a sequence like [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], for n=3, the windows are:

[1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [1,2,3]

So, each block of [1,2,3] repeated contributes overlapping windows that are all permutations.

Specifically, each repetition of [1,2,3] adds three windows: [1,2,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2].

But in reality, when repeated, the overlapping parts allow for more windows.

Wait, in the sequence [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], the windows are:

1. [1,2,3]

2. [2,3,1]

3. [3,1,2]

4. [1,2,3]

5. [2,3,1]

6. [3,1,2]

7. [1,2,3]

So, seven windows, all of which are permutations.

So, for m cards, the number of windows is m - n + 1.

In this case, m=9, n=3, so 7 windows.

So, if I can arrange the cards in such a way that all m - n + 1 windows are permutations, that would be ideal.

But I need to maximize this number, given the constraints on the number of cards I have for each number.

I need to find the maximum m such that, after buying up to k additional cards, I can arrange the cards so that as many windows as possible are permutations.

But how?

Perhaps I need to find the minimal number of times each number needs to appear to achieve a certain number of windows.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of times each number needs to appear to cover all the windows.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me consider sorting the initial counts a_i.

In the code provided, it sorts a in ascending order.

r starts with a[0], and then iterates through the sorted a, accumulating the differences multiplied by the index.

It seems to be calculating some prefix sums or something similar.

But I need to understand the logic behind it.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to make all a_i as equal as possible, since if some a_i are much smaller than others, they can limit the number of windows.

In other words, the limiting factor is the smallest a_i, because each window needs one of each number.

So, the minimal a_i limits the number of complete sets I can form.

But that's not entirely accurate, because with overlapping windows, I can reuse some cards.

Wait, maybe it's about the minimal number of times any number appears.

If I have a number that appears only once, then I can only have one window that includes that number.

But if I have multiple instances of each number, I can have more windows.

But it's not just the minimal a_i, because overlapping allows sharing of cards.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider the problem in terms of the total number of cards.

Suppose I have s = sum(a_i), and I can buy up to k more cards.

Total cards: s + k.

The maximum number of windows is s + k - n + 1.

But not all of these can be permutations due to constraints on a_i.

I need to find the minimal number of windows that cannot be permutations due to insufficient counts of some numbers.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the maximal number of windows where each number appears exactly once in each window.

To do this, I need to ensure that for each number i, the number of windows that include i doesn't exceed a_i.

But since windows overlap, this is tricky.

I recall that in streaming algorithms, there are ways to count frequencies in sliding windows.

But I need a different approach.

Let me consider that each window is a set of n cards, each with a unique number.

So, for each window, I need one of each number.

Thus, the total number of windows is limited by the number of times I can select one of each number without reusing the same card in overlapping windows.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system of inequalities.

Let w be the number of windows.

Each window requires one of each number, so for each number i, the total number of windows that include it cannot exceed a_i.

But since windows overlap, it's not straightforward.

This seems too complex.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in some problems, to maximize the number of complete sets, we need to find the minimal frequency among the required elements.

In this case, since each window requires one of each number, the minimal a_i would limit the number of windows.

But again, with overlapping, I can have more windows than the minimal a_i.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of possible windows given the frequencies.

But I'm stuck.

Let me consider that in order to have w windows, each being a permutation, I need to have a_i >= ceil(w / n) for each i.

Because each window takes one of each number, so over w windows, I need at least w/n occurrences of each number.

But since w might not be divisible by n, I need to take the ceiling of w/n.

So, a_i >= ceil(w / n) for all i.

But in reality, because of overlapping, I can have more windows with the same set of cards.

Wait, perhaps that's not accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have infinite cards of each number.

Then, I can arrange them in any way I want, and the maximum number of windows is s + k - n + 1.

But since I have limitations on a_i, I need to ensure that in the arrangement, the frequency of each number is <= a_i.

Wait, no, a_i is the number of cards I have for each number, which is the total available.

In the arrangement, the frequency of each number can be up to a_i plus the number of times I buy that number.

Wait, no, k is the total number of cards I can buy, regardless of the number.

So, I can buy up to k cards, choosing any numbers from 1 to n.

Thus, for each number i, the total available is a_i + b_i, where sum(b_i) <= k.

I need to choose b_i such that sum(b_i) <= k, and then arrange all a_i + b_i cards in a way that maximizes the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

This seems too abstract.

Let me consider that to maximize the number of permutation windows, I should aim to have the sequence consist of as many repeated blocks of [1,2,...,n] as possible.

Each block contributes n windows that are permutations.

But I need to verify this.

Wait, in the sequence [1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3], for n=3, we have 7 windows, all of which are permutations.

So, it's better than just having separate blocks.

So, perhaps arranging the cards in a periodic manner with period n maximizes the number of permutation windows.

In such an arrangement, each window of size n is a permutation.

So, if I can arrange the entire sequence in such a periodic manner, the number of permutation windows would be m - n + 1, where m is the total number of cards.

But I need to ensure that I have enough cards of each number to sustain this periodic arrangement.

In other words, in a sequence of m cards arranged in blocks of [1,2,...,n], repeated floor(m / n) times, with the remaining m mod n cards appended at the end.

In such an arrangement, each complete block contributes n permutation windows, and the overlapping between blocks also creates additional permutation windows.

But I need to calculate how many such windows there are in total.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I arrange the cards in a sequence where the numbers cycle through [1,2,...,n], repeating as necessary.

In this arrangement, every n-length window is a permutation, as long as I have enough cards of each number.

Specifically, for a sequence of length m, the number of n-length permutation windows is m - n + 1, provided that the sequence is arranged in such a way that each window is a permutation.

But I need to ensure that I have enough cards of each number to support this arrangement.

In such a sequence, each number appears floor(m / n) times, plus an additional ceiling(m / n) for some numbers.

Wait, more precisely, for each number i, the number of times it appears is ceil(m / n) or floor(m / n), depending on the position.

Specifically, the number of times number i appears is ceil((m - i + n) / n).

But this seems too involved.

Perhaps a better way is to find the maximal m such that, for each i, a_i + b_i >= ceil((m - position_i) / n)), where position_i is the position of number i in the cycle.

But this is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that I need to find the maximal m such that, for each i, a_i + b_i >= ceil(m / n).

Because in the periodic arrangement, each number appears at least ceil(m / n) times.

But actually, in a perfectly periodic sequence, each number appears exactly ceil(m / n) or floor(m / n) times, depending on the position.

But to simplify, perhaps I can require that a_i + b_i >= ceil(m / n) for all i.

Then, the total number of cards would be m, and the number of permutation windows would be m - n + 1.

I need to maximize m such that:

- m <= s + k, where s = sum(a_i)

- a_i + b_i >= ceil(m / n) for all i

- sum(b_i) <= k

This seems promising.

So, I need to maximize m, subject to:

m <= s + k

a_i + b_i >= ceil(m / n) for all i

sum(b_i) <= k

I need to find the maximal m that satisfies these constraints.

To maximize m, I need to maximize ceil(m / n), because ceil(m / n) is the minimal a_i + b_i required.

Wait, actually, ceil(m / n) is the minimal frequency required for each number.

So, I need to set b_i such that a_i + b_i >= ceil(m / n) for all i.

And sum(b_i) <= k.

So, the total number of coins spent is sum(b_i) = sum(max(ceil(m / n) - a_i, 0)) over all i.

This needs to be <= k.

So, I can perform a binary search on m, and for each m, calculate the required b_i for each i, and check if the total sum of b_i is <= k.

Then, take the maximal m that satisfies this.

Finally, the number of permutation windows would be m - n + 1.

This seems feasible.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and k.

b. Read the array a of size n.

c. Perform a binary search on m, from n (minimal sequence length to have at least one window) to s + k, where s = sum(a_i).

d. For each m in the binary search:

i. Calculate ceil(m / n).

ii. For each i from 1 to n, calculate b_i = max(ceil(m / n) - a_i, 0).

iii. If sum(b_i) <= k, then it's possible to achieve m.

e. Find the maximal m such that sum(b_i) <= k.

f. The number of permutation windows is m - n + 1.

g. Output this number.

This seems correct.

But I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 100, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^5.

So, a binary search over m for each test case would be O(log(s + k)) per test case, but with s and k up to 10^12, log(s + k) is about 40.

So, total time complexity would be O(t * log(s + k) * n), which with t=100, n=2*10^5, log(s + k)=40, is about 8 * 10^8 operations, which is too slow.

I need a faster way.

Is there a way to compute m without binary search?

Let me consider that m is maximized when ceil(m / n) is minimized.

Wait, no, ceil(m / n) increases with m.

I need to find the minimal c such that sum(max(c - a_i, 0)) <= k, and then m = n * (c - 1) + n.

Wait, no.

Wait, ceil(m / n) = c, so m = c * n - (n - (m % n)), but it's complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let c = ceil(m / n).

Then, m = c * n - (n - r), where r = m mod n.

But this is getting messy.

Let me consider that c = ceil(m / n) implies that m <= c * n - 1.

So, m <= c * n - 1.

I need to find the minimal c such that sum(max(c - a_i, 0)) <= k.

Then, m <= c * n - 1.

And I need to maximize m, so for that c, m = c * n - 1.

Then, the number of permutation windows is m - n + 1 = (c * n - 1) - n + 1 = c * n - n = n * (c - 1).

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, m - n + 1 = (c * n - 1) - n + 1 = c * n - n = n * (c - 1).

But according to the earlier example, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the second example:

n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]

c = ceil(m / 2)

We need to find the minimal c such that sum(max(c - a_i, 0)) <= k.

For c=4:

sum(max(4 - 8, 0) + max(4 - 4, 0)) = 0 + 0 = 0 <= 4.

So, m <= 4*2 - 1 = 7.

Then, number of windows is 7 - 2 + 1 = 6.

But in the example, it's 15.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the second example, with n=2, k=4, a=[8,4], and after buying 4 cards of type 2, total a=[8,8].

Then, m=16, number of windows is 16 - 2 + 1 = 15, which matches the example.

So, in this case, c=ceil(16 / 2)=8.

And sum(max(8 - 8, 0) +
