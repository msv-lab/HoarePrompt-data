Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Maxim has two arrays: a and b. Array a is longer, with n elements, and array b has m elements, where m is less than or equal to n. He wants to look at every possible subsegment of a that has length m, and for each of these subsegments, he wants to check if it's "good."

A subsegment c is considered "good" if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b. It's important to note that the elements in both a and b can be rearranged, but I think the key is that we're comparing the frequency of elements.

Wait, no. The problem says that the elements of c can be rearranged such that at least k of them match the elements of b. So, it's not about the frequencies exactly matching, but rather that at least k elements in c are present in b, considering some arrangement.

Let me try to understand this with the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

We need to look at all subsegments of a of length 4:

- [4,1,2,3]: Can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b entirely, so at least 2 match.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above.

- [2,3,4,5]: Can be rearranged to [2,3,4,5], which has 3 elements matching b.

- [3,4,5,6]: Can be rearranged to [3,4,5,6], which has 2 elements matching b.

- [4,5,6,?]: Wait, n=7, so the subsegments are:

  - a[1:4] = [4,1,2,3]

  - a[2:5] = [1,2,3,4]

  - a[3:6] = [2,3,4,5]

  - a[4:7] = [3,4,5,6]

So, all four subsegments have at least 2 elements matching b after rearrangement. Hence, the output is 4.

In the second test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

Same a and b.

- [4,1,2,3]: Can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b entirely, so at least 3 match.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above.

- [2,3,4,5]: Has 3 elements matching b.

- [3,4,5,6]: Has 2 elements matching b.

So, only the first three subsegments are good, hence output is 3.

In the third test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

Same a and b.

- [4,1,2,3]: Can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b entirely.

- [1,2,3,4]: Same as above.

- [2,3,4,5]: Has only 3 elements matching b.

- [3,4,5,6]: Has 2 elements matching b.

So, only the first two subsegments are good, hence output is 2.

In the fourth test case:

n=11, m=5, k=3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

We need to find subsegments of length 5 where at least 3 elements match b after rearrangement.

Let's list the subsegments:

- [9,9,2,2,10]: Elements are 9,9,2,2,10. Comparing to b: 9,10 match. So, 2 matches.

- [9,2,2,10,9]: Elements are 9,9,2,2,10. Again, 9 and 10 match.

- [2,2,10,9,7]: Elements are 2,2,9,10,7. Matches: 9,10,7. So, 3 matches.

- [2,10,9,7,6]: Elements are 2,10,9,7,6. Matches: 9,10,7,6. So, 4 matches.

- [10,9,7,6,3]: Elements are 10,9,7,6,3. Matches: 9,10,7,6. So, 4 matches.

- [9,7,6,3,6]: Elements are 9,7,6,3,6. Matches: 9,7,6. So, 3 matches.

- [7,6,3,6,3]: Elements are 7,6,3,6,3. Matches: 6,7. So, 2 matches.

So, subsegments starting at positions 3,4,5,6 are good. Hence, output is 4.

In the fifth test case:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a = [4,1,5,6]

b = [6]

We look at subsegments of length 1:

- [4]: Does not match b.

- [1]: Does not match b.

- [5]: Does not match b.

- [6]: Matches b.

Only one subsegment is good, hence output is 1.

From these examples, it seems that for each subsegment c of length m, we need to check if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them are present in b. Since rearrangement is allowed, it's essentially checking if the number of elements in c that are also in b is at least k.

Wait, but b can have duplicate elements. So, we need to consider the frequency of each element in b.

Wait, no. The problem says "the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b." It doesn't specify whether the matching should consider the frequency or not.

Looking back at the examples, in the first test case, k=2, and in all subsegments, at least 2 elements are present in b, considering their frequency.

Wait, but in the third test case, k=4, and only the first two subsegments have at least 4 elements that are in b.

Wait, but b can have duplicates, and c can have duplicates as well.

Wait, in the first test case, b = [1,2,3,4], and a has subsegments like [4,1,2,3], which matches entirely.

But in the second test case, b is the same, but k=3, and subsegments like [2,3,4,5] have three elements matching b.

In the third test case, k=4, so only subsegments with all four elements matching b are considered good.

So, it seems that we need to count, for each subsegment c of length m, the number of elements in c that are also in b, and check if this number is at least k.

But we have to be careful with duplicates. If b has duplicates, and c has the same duplicates, do we count the frequency?

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b." It doesn't specify frequency matching, so perhaps it's just the count of matching elements, regardless of their frequency in b.

For example, if b = [1,2,2,3], and c = [2,2,3,4], then c has two 2's and one 3, which matches b in having at least two 2's and one 3. So, in this case, it would be considered good if k <= 3.

But in another case, if b = [1,2,2,3], and c = [2,3,4,5], then c has one 2 and one 3, which matches b in having at least one 2 and one 3, but b has two 2's, so if k > 2, it might not be good.

Wait, but the problem says "at least k of them match the elements of array b." It's a bit ambiguous.

Looking back at the examples, it seems that they are considering the count of unique matching elements, not considering frequency.

Wait, in the first test case, b = [1,2,3,4], and c has at least two elements matching b, which are present in b.

But in the second test case, k=3, and subsegments need to have at least three elements matching b.

Wait, maybe it's the number of elements in c that are also in b, regardless of frequency.

So, perhaps, for each subsegment c, count how many elements are in b (considering unique elements), and check if this count is at least k.

But wait, b can have duplicates, so perhaps we need to consider frequency.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of multisets.

If we consider b as a multiset, and c as a multiset, then we need to check if the number of elements in c that are also in b is at least k, considering their frequencies.

So, for each subsegment c, we can compute the intersection of c and b as multisets, and check if the size of this intersection is at least k.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the problem reduces to, for each subsegment c of length m, compute the size of the multiset intersection of c and b, and check if it's at least k.

Then, sum up over all such subsegments.

Now, to implement this efficiently, given that n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases <= 2e5, and similarly for m.

So, we need an efficient way to compute the multiset intersection size for each subsegment.

One way to do this is to use sliding windows, keeping track of the frequency of elements in the current window, and compare it with the frequency in b.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case, we can:

1. Read n, m, k.

2. Read array a of length n.

3. Read array b of length m.

4. Initialize a frequency counter for b.

5. Initialize a frequency counter for the first window of a of length m.

6. Compute the intersection size between the first window and b.

7. If the intersection size >= k, increment the answer.

8. Slide the window over a, one element at a time, updating the frequency counters and the intersection size accordingly.

9. For each window, if intersection size >= k, increment the answer.

10. After processing all windows, print the answer.

Now, to efficiently compute the intersection size, we can keep track of how many elements in the current window are also in b, considering their frequencies.

So, for each element in the window, if it's in b, and its frequency in the window is less than or equal to its frequency in b, we count it fully. If its frequency in the window is higher than in b, we count only up to the frequency in b.

Wait, but actually, since we're dealing with multisets, the intersection should be the minimum of the frequencies of each element in both multisets.

So, for each element, intersection += min(freq_in_window, freq_in_b)

But, in the problem, it's said "at least k of them match", which might not necessarily mean the sum of frequencies, but perhaps the number of elements that match.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement:

"the elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

So, it's about selecting k positions where the elements of c match the elements of b, regardless of their positions.

So, it's more about having at least k elements in c that are also in b, considering their frequencies.

Wait, but it's a bit vague.

Looking back at the notes in the problem:

"In other words, find the number of positions 1 ≤ l ≤ n−m+1 such that the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, …, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array."

And a good array c is one where, after rearrangement, at least k elements match those in b.

Given that rearrangement is allowed, it suggests that we can reorder c to align as many elements as possible with b.

So, to maximize the number of matching elements, we should match the elements in c that are present in b.

Therefore, the number of matching elements is the size of the multiset intersection of c and b.

Hence, we need to compute, for each window c, the size of the multiset intersection of c and b, and check if it's at least k.

Now, to implement this efficiently, we need a way to maintain frequency counters for the current window and for b, and compute their intersection size quickly.

Let's think about how to do this.

First, we can create a frequency dictionary for b.

Then, for the first window in a, create a frequency dictionary and compute the intersection size.

Then, as we slide the window, we add the new element and remove the old element, updating the frequency counters and the intersection size accordingly.

This way, we can maintain the intersection size in constant time per slide.

Let's try to formalize this.

Initialize:

- freq_b: frequency counter for b.

- freq_window: frequency counter for the first window of size m in a.

- intersection_size: sum over all elements of min(freq_window[element], freq_b[element])

Then, for each slide:

- Remove the element that is leaving the window: decrease freq_window[old_element], and update intersection_size accordingly.

- Add the new element entering the window: increase freq_window[new_element], and update intersection_size accordingly.

- Check if intersection_size >= k, and increment answer if true.

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, we need to handle frequency counters efficiently.

In Python, we can use collections.Counter for this purpose.

However, since n and m can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases <= 2e5, and similarly for m, we need to make sure that our implementation is efficient enough.

Using sliding window technique with frequency counters should be acceptable.

Let's think about potential optimizations.

Since we're dealing with large inputs, we need to make sure that our code is optimized for speed.

One way to speed up the process is to precompute the frequency counters for b and the initial window, and then update them efficiently as we slide the window.

Also, using default dictionaries or preallocating arrays for frequency counts can help, but since the elements can be up to 1e6, it's better to use dictionaries for frequency counting.

Now, let's think about potential edge cases.

Edge Cases:

1. All elements in a and b are the same.

   - For example, a = [1,1,1,1], b = [1,1,1], k=2. All windows should be good.

2. No elements in a match b.

   - For example, a = [1,2,3,4], b = [5,6,7], k=1. No windows are good.

3. k=1, m=1.

   - For example, a = [1,2,3,4], b = [2], k=1. Only the window [2] is good.

4. k=m, meaning all elements in the window must match b.

   - For example, a = [1,2,3,4], b = [1,2,3], k=3. Only the window [1,2,3] is good.

5. Duplicates in a and b.

   - For example, a = [1,1,2,2], b = [1,2,2,3], k=3. Need to handle frequencies correctly.

Let me consider the fifth test case from the example:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a = [4,1,5,6]

b = [6]

We need to check each subsegment of length 1:

- [4]: 4 is not in b, so not good.

- [1]: 1 is not in b, so not good.

- [5]: 5 is not in b, so not good.

- [6]: 6 is in b, so good.

Hence, only one good subsegment, which matches the output.

Wait, but according to the problem, b = [6], and a has elements [4,1,5,6]. Only the last element matches b, so only one good subsegment.

Now, considering duplicates:

Suppose a = [1,2,2,3], b = [1,2,2,3], k=3.

Here, m=4, n=4.

The only window is [1,2,2,3], which has intersection size of 4 with b, which is >=3, so it's good.

Another case: a = [1,2,2,3], b = [1,2,3,4], k=3.

Intersection size is 3 (1,2,3), which is >=3, so good.

Another case: a = [1,2,3,4], b = [1,2,3,4], k=4.

Only one window, intersection size 4, which is >=4, so good.

Another case: a = [1,2,3,4], b = [1,2,3,4], k=5.

No window can have intersection size >=5, since m=4.

Hence, no good subsegments.

Wait, but m=4, and k=5, which is impossible, since m < k.

Hence, k should satisfy 1 <= k <= m <= n.

As per constraints, k <= m <= n.

Hence, if m < k, then no window can be good.

But in this problem, it's guaranteed that k <= m <= n.

Hence, we don't need to handle cases where k > m.

Now, let's think about implementing the sliding window with frequency counters.

I'll use Python's collections.Counter for frequency counting.

Initialize freq_b as Counter of b.

Initialize freq_window as Counter of a[0:m].

Compute intersection_size as sum of min(freq_window[element], freq_b[element]) for all elements in freq_window.

If intersection_size >= k, increment answer.

Then, for each new position r from m to n-1:

- Remove a[r - m] from freq_window: decrement its count, and update intersection_size accordingly.

- Add a[r] to freq_window: increment its count, and update intersection_size accordingly.

- If intersection_size >= k, increment answer.

Finally, print the answer.

This should work correctly.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given Program:

from collections import defaultdict, Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
        done = set()
        extra = set()
        for j in range(m):
            if a[j] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[j])
                done.add(a[j])
            else:
                extra.add(a[j])
        ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            if old in extra:
                extra.remove(old)
            elif old in done:
                done.remove(old)
                todo.add(old)
            if a[r] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[r])
                done.add(a[r])
            else:
                extra.add(a[r])
            if len(done) >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

Analysis:

The program uses sets for todo, done, and extra.

It processes the first window of size m:

- For each element in the first window, if it's in todo, remove it from todo and add it to done.

- If it's not in todo, add it to extra.

Then, it checks if len(done) >= k, and initializes ans accordingly.

Then, for each subsequent window:

- Removes the old element (a[r - m]):

- If it's in extra, remove it from extra.

- If it's in done, remove it from done and add it back to todo.

- Adds the new element (a[r]):

- If it's in todo, remove it from todo and add it to done.

- If it's not in todo, add it to extra.

- Checks if len(done) >= k, and increments ans if true.

Finally, prints ans.

Now, let's see if this logic correctly computes the number of good subsegments.

First, it uses sets for todo, done, and extra.

But sets do not consider frequencies; they only consider uniqueness.

However, the problem requires considering frequencies, as it's about multisets.

For example, if b has duplicates, and c has duplicates, the intersection should consider the minimum frequency.

But in the given program, it's using sets, which only track uniqueness, not frequencies.

Hence, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem, it says "elements of array c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b."

Given that, perhaps it's only about the unique elements matching, not their frequencies.

But looking back at the examples, it seems that frequencies are being considered.

Wait, in the third test case, k=4, and only subsegments with all four elements matching b are considered good.

Hence, frequencies need to be considered.

Wait, but in that test case, b has unique elements, so frequencies are all 1.

Hence, in that case, it's about having all four elements matching b, regardless of their order.

But in general, if b has duplicates, we need to consider frequencies.

Given that, the given program is incorrect because it uses sets, which do not handle frequencies.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
