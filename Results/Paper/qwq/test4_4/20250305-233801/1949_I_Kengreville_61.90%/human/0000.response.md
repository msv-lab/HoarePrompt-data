Alright, I've got this problem here. It seems a bit tricky at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the problem is about disks in a plane. Each disk has a center with integer coordinates and a positive integer radius. The key points are:

1. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they can be tangent to each other.

2. I need to determine if it's possible to change the radii of these disks in such a way that:

   a. Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent after the change.

   b. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area after the change.

   c. The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

3. The new radii can be any positive real numbers, and the centers cannot be changed.

First, I need to understand what it means for disks to be tangent. Two disks are tangent if they touch at exactly one point, which means the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii.

So, if two disks are tangent, their centers are at a distance equal to the sum of their radii. If I change the radii, I need to ensure that this condition still holds for tangent disks.

Moreover, disks that were not tangent should not overlap after the change, meaning the distance between their centers should be greater than the sum of their new radii.

And, of course, I need to make sure that the sum of all radii decreases.

This sounds like an optimization problem with constraints. I need to find new radii for each disk that satisfy certain conditions and minimize the sum of the radii.

Let me think about how to model this.

First, let's consider the constraints:

1. For tangent disks i and j, the sum of their new radii should be equal to the distance between their centers.

2. For non-tangent disks i and j, the sum of their new radii should be less than or equal to the distance between their centers.

3. All new radii should be positive real numbers.

4. The sum of all new radii should be strictly less than the sum of the original radii.

This seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to express the new radii in terms of the original radii and some variables.

Let me try to think about it differently. Suppose I have a graph where each disk is a node, and there is an edge between two nodes if their disks are tangent. This graph represents the tangent relationships.

In this graph, connected components might play a role because within a connected component, the radii are related through the tangent conditions.

Let me consider one connected component first.

Suppose I have a connected component with disks a, b, c, etc., where each pair of adjacent disks is tangent.

For these disks, the sum of their radii must satisfy the distance equality for tangent disks.

So, for disks a and b: r_a + r_b = d_ab, where d_ab is the distance between centers of a and b.

Similarly, for b and c: r_b + r_c = d_bc.

And so on.

This is a system of linear equations.

I can express this system in terms of equations:

r_a + r_b - d_ab = 0

r_b + r_c - d_bc = 0

...

Now, if I have more equations than variables, it might be inconsistent, but in this case, since the disks are tangent and non-overlapping, the original radii satisfy these equations.

But I need to find new radii that still satisfy these equations for tangent disks and the inequalities for non-tangent disks, and also have a strictly smaller sum.

Let me consider that in a connected component, I can express all radii in terms of one radius.

For example, choose a root disk in the component and express all other radii in terms of its radius using the tangent conditions.

Then, I can plug these expressions into the non-tangent conditions and the sum condition.

This might help me determine if a decrease is possible.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's pick a root disk in the connected component, say disk 0.

Then, for each other disk in the component, I can find a path from the root to that disk, and using the tangent conditions along the path, express its radius in terms of the root's radius.

For example, if disk 0 is tangent to disk 1, then r1 = d01 - r0.

If disk 1 is tangent to disk 2, then r2 = d12 - r1 = d12 - (d01 - r0) = d12 - d01 + r0.

And so on.

In this way, all radii in the component can be expressed in terms of r0.

Then, for non-tangent disks in the component, I need to ensure that the sum of their radii is less than the distance between their centers.

These become inequalities in terms of r0.

Additionally, all radii must be positive.

Finally, the sum of all radii should be strictly less than the original sum.

So, for each connected component, I need to check if there exists a value for r0 such that:

1. All radii are positive.

2. All non-tangent disk pairs satisfy the non-overlapping condition.

3. The sum of radii is strictly less than the original sum.

If this is possible for at least one connected component, then the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it's "NO".

Wait, but actually, I need to consider all connected components separately, because changes in one component don't affect others.

So, for each connected component, I can try to decrease the sum of radii in that component, while satisfying the conditions.

If I can decrease the sum in at least one component, then the total sum will decrease, and I can set the radii in other components to their original values.

Hence, the overall sum will decrease.

Therefore, if any connected component allows a decrease in sum while preserving the tangent conditions and non-overlapping conditions, the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it's "NO".

So, the problem reduces to checking each connected component separately.

Now, how do I check for a single connected component?

Let's consider a connected component with disks a, b, c, etc.

Choose a root disk, say a, and express all other radii in terms of ra.

Then, for non-tangent pairs, ensure that the sum of their radii is less than the distance between their centers.

Also, ensure that all radii are positive.

Finally, ensure that the sum of all radii is strictly less than the original sum.

Let me consider an example to see how this works.

Take the first sample input:

5

0 2 1

0 0 1

4 -3 4

11 0 3

11 5 2

Let's plot these disks.

Disk 0 at (0,2) with r=1

Disk 1 at (0,0) with r=1

Disk 2 at (4,-3) with r=4

Disk 3 at (11,0) with r=3

Disk 4 at (11,5) with r=2

First, check which disks are tangent.

Calculate the distances between centers:

Distance between 0 and 1: sqrt((0-0)^2 + (2-0)^2) = 2

Sum of radii: 1 + 1 = 2, so they are tangent.

Distance between 0 and 2: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (2-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 25) = sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5, which is less than sqrt(41), so not tangent.

Distance between 0 and 3: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 4) = sqrt(125) ≈ 11.180

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4, less than sqrt(125), not tangent.

Distance between 0 and 4: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (2-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 9) = sqrt(130) ≈ 11.402

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3, less than sqrt(130), not tangent.

Distance between 1 and 2: sqrt((0-4)^2 + (0-(-3))^2) = sqrt(16 + 9) = 5

Sum of radii: 1 + 4 = 5, tangent.

Distance between 1 and 3: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-0)^2) = 11

Sum of radii: 1 + 3 = 4 < 11, not tangent.

Distance between 1 and 4: sqrt((0-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = sqrt(121 + 25) = sqrt(146) ≈ 12.083

Sum of radii: 1 + 2 = 3 < 12.083, not tangent.

Distance between 2 and 3: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + 9) = sqrt(58) ≈ 7.616

Sum of radii: 4 + 3 = 7 < 7.616, not tangent.

Distance between 2 and 4: sqrt((4-11)^2 + (-3-5)^2) = sqrt(49 + 64) = sqrt(113) ≈ 10.630

Sum of radii: 4 + 2 = 6 < 10.630, not tangent.

Distance between 3 and 4: sqrt((11-11)^2 + (0-5)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 3 + 2 = 5, tangent.

So, the tangent pairs are:

0-1, 1-2, and 3-4.

Now, let's consider the connected components.

From the tangent pairs:

0-1, 1-2, so 0,1,2 are connected.

3-4, so 3 and 4 are connected.

Thus, there are two connected components: {0,1,2} and {3,4}.

Now, for each component, I need to see if I can decrease the sum of radii while preserving the tangent conditions and non-overlapping conditions.

Let's take component {0,1,2}.

Choose disk 0 as root.

Express r1 and r2 in terms of r0.

From tangent pairs:

r0 + r1 = 2 => r1 = 2 - r0

r1 + r2 = 5 => (2 - r0) + r2 = 5 => r2 = 3 + r0

Now, check non-tangent pairs within the component:

0 and 2: sum of radii r0 + r2 = r0 + (3 + r0) = 2*r0 + 3 < sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403

So, 2*r0 + 3 < 6.403 => 2*r0 < 3.403 => r0 < 1.7015

Also, all radii must be positive:

r1 = 2 - r0 > 0 => r0 < 2

r2 = 3 + r0 > 0 => r0 > -3, but since r0 is positive, this is always true.

Original sum of radii in this component: r0 + r1 + r2 = r0 + (2 - r0) + (3 + r0) = 5 + r0

New sum: r0 + (2 - r0) + (3 + r0) = 5 + r0

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, decreasing r0 and r2 by 0.5 and increasing r1 by 0.5 decreases the sum by 0.5.

Let me see:

Original radii: r0=1, r1=1, r2=4

Sum: 1+1+4=6

New radii: r0=0.5, r1=1.5, r2=3.5

Sum: 0.5+1.5+3.5=5.5, which is less than 6.

Check tangent conditions:

r0 + r1 = 0.5 + 1.5 = 2, which matches the distance between 0 and 1.

r1 + r2 = 1.5 + 3.5 = 5, which matches the distance between 1 and 2.

Check non-tangent condition:

r0 + r2 = 0.5 + 3.5 = 4 < sqrt(41) ≈ 6.403, which holds.

All radii are positive.

So, in this case, it's possible to decrease the sum in this component.

Similarly, for component {3,4}:

r3 + r4 = 5 => r4 = 5 - r3

Non-tangent pairs: none within this component.

Original sum: r3 + r4 = 5

New sum: r3 + r4 = 5, which cannot be decreased while maintaining the tangent condition.

Because r4 = 5 - r3, so sum is always 5.

If I decrease r3, r4 increases by the same amount, keeping the sum constant.

Hence, in this component, the sum cannot be decreased.

Therefore, since in the first component the sum can be decreased, the overall answer is "YES".

Now, let's consider the second sample input:

4

2 2 2

7 2 3

7 7 2

2 7 3

Let's find the distances between centers:

Distance between 0 and 1: sqrt((2-7)^2 + (2-2)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5, tangent.

Distance between 0 and 2: sqrt((2-7)^2 + (2-7)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071

Sum of radii: 2 + 2 = 4 < 7.071, not tangent.

Distance between 0 and 3: sqrt((2-2)^2 + (2-7)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5, tangent.

Distance between 1 and 2: sqrt((7-7)^2 + (2-7)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 3 + 2 = 5, tangent.

Distance between 1 and 3: sqrt((7-2)^2 + (2-7)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071

Sum of radii: 3 + 3 = 6 < 7.071, not tangent.

Distance between 2 and 3: sqrt((7-2)^2 + (7-7)^2) = 5

Sum of radii: 2 + 3 = 5, tangent.

So, tangent pairs are:

0-1, 0-3, 1-2, 2-3.

Thus, all disks are connected in one component.

Now, let's try to express all radii in terms of r0.

Choose r0 as the root.

From 0-1: r1 = 5 - r0

From 0-3: r3 = 5 - r0

From 1-2: r2 = 5 - r1 = 5 - (5 - r0) = r0

From 2-3: r3 = 5 - r2 = 5 - r0

Wait, but earlier from 0-3, r3 = 5 - r0.

So, consistent.

Now, check non-tangent pairs:

0 and 2: r0 + r2 = r0 + r0 = 2*r0 < sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071 => r0 < 3.5355

0 and 3: already defined by tangent condition.

1 and 3: r1 + r3 = (5 - r0) + (5 - r0) = 10 - 2*r0 < sqrt(50) ≈ 7.071 => 10 - 2*r0 < 7.071 => 2*r0 > 2.929 => r0 > 1.4645

Also, all radii must be positive:

r1 = 5 - r0 > 0 => r0 < 5

r2 = r0 > 0 => r0 > 0

r3 = 5 - r0 > 0 => r0 < 5

Original sum: r0 + r1 + r2 + r3 = r0 + (5 - r0) + r0 + (5 - r0) = 10

New sum: same as original, 10.

So, no matter what r0 I choose within the allowed range, the sum remains 10, which is not strictly less than the original sum.

Therefore, in this component, it's not possible to decrease the sum of radii while preserving the tangent conditions and non-overlapping conditions.

Hence, the answer is "NO".

From these examples, it seems that the problem can be approached by considering connected components based on tangent disks and checking if the sum of radii in any component can be decreased.

Now, to generalize this approach, I need to:

1. Build a graph where disks are nodes and edges connect tangent disks.

2. Identify connected components in this graph.

3. For each connected component, check if it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while preserving the tangent conditions and non-overlapping conditions.

4. If any component allows a decrease, then the overall sum can be decreased, and the answer is "YES"; otherwise, it's "NO".

Now, for each connected component, how do I check if the sum can be decreased?

Let me consider that in a connected component, once I fix one radius, the other radii are determined based on the tangent conditions.

So, if I choose a root disk and express all other radii in terms of the root's radius, I can then express the sum of radii in terms of the root's radius.

Then, I can check if there exists a value for the root's radius such that:

- All radii are positive.

- All non-tangent pairs satisfy the non-overlapping condition.

- The sum of radii is strictly less than the original sum.

If such a value exists, then it's possible to decrease the sum in that component.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Let me formalize this.

Let's denote:

- Let C be a connected component with disks d1, d2, ..., dk.

- Choose d1 as the root.

- Define r1 as the radius of d1.

- Express all other radii ri in terms of r1 using the tangent conditions.

- Let S(r1) be the sum of all radii in terms of r1.

- Let D(r1) be the system of inequalities representing the non-overlapping conditions for non-tangent pairs.

- Let R be the range of possible values for r1 such that all radii are positive and D(r1) holds.

- Check if there exists an r1 in R such that S(r1) < original sum.

If such an r1 exists, then it's possible to decrease the sum in this component.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

Now, to implement this, I need an efficient way to express all radii in terms of the root's radius and check the conditions.

Let me consider that in a connected component, the radii are linearly dependent through the tangent conditions.

So, I can express all radii as linear functions of the root's radius.

Then, the sum S(r1) is also a linear function of r1.

Similarly, the non-overlapping conditions for non-tangent pairs are linear inequalities in terms of r1.

The positivity of radii are also linear inequalities in terms of r1.

So, overall, I have a system of linear inequalities in one variable, r1, and a linear function S(r1).

I need to check if there exists an r1 in the feasible range defined by the inequalities such that S(r1) < original sum.

This seems manageable.

Let me consider that S(r1) is a linear function of r1, say S(r1) = a*r1 + b.

Similarly, the original sum is a constant, say S_original.

I need to find if there exists r1 such that a*r1 + b < S_original, within the feasible range of r1.

This can be determined by finding the range of r1 where a*r1 + b < S_original and checking if this range overlaps with the feasible range from the inequalities.

Now, to find the expressions for radii in terms of r1, I need to traverse the connected component and express each radius in terms of r1.

This can be done using depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS), propagating the relationships through the tangent connections.

Let me consider implementing DFS for this purpose.

In the DFS, starting from the root disk d1 with r1 as the variable, for each tangent neighbor dj, I can express rj in terms of r1.

Then, for each tangent neighbor of dj, express its radius in terms of rj, and so on.

During this process, I need to ensure that no cycles lead to inconsistent equations.

Wait, but since the original radii satisfy all tangent conditions, the system should be consistent.

Hence, as long as I express all radii in terms of r1, there shouldn't be any inconsistencies.

Once I have all radii expressed in terms of r1, I can write the sum S(r1) and the inequalities for non-tangent pairs.

Then, solve for r1 to find if there exists a value where S(r1) < S_original while satisfying all inequalities.

Now, to implement this efficiently, especially given that n can be up to 1000, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me consider that in a connected component with k disks, after expressing all radii in terms of r1, the sum S(r1) is a linear function of r1.

Similarly, each non-tangent pair imposes a linear inequality in terms of r1.

The positivity of each radius imposes another linear inequality in terms of r1.

So, overall, I have a system of linear inequalities in one variable, r1.

I can find the feasible interval for r1 where all inequalities hold.

Then, within this interval, check if S(r1) < S_original for some r1.

Since S(r1) is linear, this is straightforward.

Now, to make this efficient, I need to:

1. Build the graph of tangent disks.

2. Identify connected components.

3. For each connected component, perform DFS to express all radii in terms of r1.

4. Collect all inequalities in terms of r1.

5. Find the feasible range for r1.

6. Check if S(r1) < S_original for some r1 in this range.

If any connected component allows this, answer "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Now, to handle large inputs efficiently, I need to optimize the implementation.

Given that n can be up to 1000 and centers can have large coordinates (up to 10^9), I need to handle large numbers and potential large distances.

But since distances are squared distances, and radii are up to 10^9, I need to ensure that I don't have integer overflows.

In Python, integers can be arbitrary precision, so that's fine.

But I need to ensure that I'm comparing correctly.

Wait, in the code provided, I see that when checking if two disks are tangent, it checks if (r_i + r_j)^2 == dx^2 + dy^2.

This is equivalent to checking if the distance squared equals (r_i + r_j)^2.

This is correct, as distance squared being equal to (r_i + r_j)^2 indicates tangency.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func_1():

n = int(input())

x = [None] * n

y = [None] * n

r = [None] * n

visited = [False] * n

coef0 = [None] * n

coef1 = [None] * n

nodes = []

for i in range(n):

(x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

ok = False

for i in range(n):

if not visited[i]:

coef0[i] = 0

coef1[i] = 1

nodes = []

dfs(i)

c0 = 0

c1 = 0

for j in nodes:

c0 += coef0[j]

c1 += coef1[j]

ok = ok or c1 != 0

if ok:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

def dfs(i):

if not visited[i]:

visited[i] = True

nodes.append(i)

for j in range(n):

dx = x[i] - x[j]

dy = y[i] - y[j]

if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:

coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]

coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

dfs(j)

This code seems to be implementing the approach I described.

Let me analyze it step by step.

First, it reads n, then reads n lines of x[i], y[i], r[i].

Then, it initializes visited, coef0, coef1, and nodes arrays.

It seems to iterate through each disk, and if it hasn't been visited, it sets coef0[i] = 0, coef1[i] = 1, resets nodes, and calls dfs(i).

In the dfs function, it marks the disk as visited, adds it to nodes, and for each unvisited tangent disk j, sets coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i] and coef1[j] = -coef1[i], then recurses to dfs(j).

After dfs returns, it sums c0 and c1 for all nodes in the component.

Then, it sets ok to True if c1 != 0 for any component.

Finally, if ok is True, it prints "YES"; else, "NO".

Wait, this seems too simplistic compared to what I thought was needed.

In my earlier analysis, I thought I needed to check if S(r1) < S_original for some r1 in the feasible range.

But in this code, it's summing c0 and c1 for each component and checking if c1 != 0.

What do c0 and c1 represent?

Let me try to understand.

In the DFS, for each disk j tangent to disk i, it sets:

coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]

coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

This seems like it's expressing rj in terms of ri.

Wait, let's see.

From the tangent condition, r_i + r_j = distance, which is r[i] + r[j] = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2).

But in the code, it's checking (r[i] + r[j])^2 == dx^2 + dy^2, which is correct for tangency.

But in the DFS, it sets coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]

Wait, but r_j = (coef0[j] - coef1[j]*r1)

Wait, perhaps coef0 and coef1 represent the expressions for radii in terms of r1.

Let me consider that each radius r_j is expressed as coef0[j] + coef1[j]*r1.

Then, for the root disk, r1 is expressed as r1 = coef0[1] + coef1[1]*r1, but coef0[1] = 0 and coef1[1] = 1, so r1 = 0 + 1*r1, which holds.

For a tangent neighbor j of disk 1, r_j = (coef0[j] + coef1[j]*r1)

From the tangent condition, r1 + r_j = d1j, where d1j is the distance between centers 1 and j.

So, r_j = d1j - r1

Hence, coef0[j] = d1j and coef1[j] = -1

Which matches the code: coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i], but since r[i] + r[j] = d1j, and coef0[i] = 0 for the root, so coef0[j] = d1j - 0 = d1j

And coef1[j] = -coef1[i] = -1

So, r_j = d1j + (-1)*r1 = d1j - r1

Which is correct.

For another tangent neighbor k of j, r_k = d_jk - r_j = d_jk - (d1j - r1) = d_jk - d1j + r1

So, coef0[k] = d_jk - d1j and coef1[k] = 1

Which would be set in the DFS when visiting k from j.

Similarly, this propagates through the component.

Now, after DFS, it sums c0 and c1 for all nodes in the component.

What does c0 and c1 represent in this sum?

Sum of coef0[j] and sum of coef1[j] for all j in the component.

Wait, perhaps S(r1) = sum(coef0[j] + coef1[j]*r1) for all j in the component.

So, S(r1) = sum(coef0[j]) + sum(coef1[j])*r1

In the code, it computes c0 = sum(coef0[j]) and c1 = sum(coef1[j])

So, S(r1) = c0 + c1 * r1

Now, the original sum is sum of original radii in the component.

Let's denote it as S_original.

We need to check if there exists r1 such that S(r1) < S_original, within the feasible range of r1.

From the expressions, S(r1) = c0 + c1 * r1

We need c0 + c1 * r1 < S_original

This is a linear inequality in r1.

If c1 != 0, then depending on the sign of c1, r1 can be chosen to make S(r1) smaller or larger.

If c1 > 0, then decreasing r1 decreases S(r1)

If c1 < 0, then increasing r1 decreases S(r1)

Hence, if c1 != 0, it's possible to adjust r1 to decrease S(r1), provided that r1 stays within the feasible range defined by the inequalities.

But in the code, it simply checks if c1 != 0 for any component, and if so, answers "YES"

This seems too simplistic.

Is this correct?

Wait, in the first sample, for component {0,1,2}:

Let's compute c0 and c1.

Assume disk 0 is the root, r1 = r0.

Then:

r0 = 0 + 1*r1 (since coef0[0] = 0, coef1[0] = 1)

r1 = 2 - r0 = 2 - r1 => coef0[1] = 2, coef1[1] = -1

r2 = 3 + r0 = 3 + r1 => coef0[2] = 3, coef1[2] = 1

So, c0 = 0 + 2 + 3 = 5

c1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1

Hence, S(r1) = 5 + 1*r1

Original sum is r0 + r1 + r2 = r1 + (2 - r1) + (3 + r1) = 5 + r1

Wait, that matches S(r1) = 5 + r1

To decrease the sum, we need 5 + r1 < 5 + r1, which is impossible unless r1 is decreased, but that would require adjusting within the constraints.

Wait, in the sample explanation, they decreased r0 and r2 by 0.5 and increased r1 by 0.5, resulting in a total sum decrease by 0.5.

But according to the above, S(r1) = 5 + r1, and original sum is also 5 + r1.

Wait, but in the sample, original radii are r0=1, r1=1, r2=4, sum=6

Then, new radii r0=0.5, r1=1.5, r2=3.5, sum=5.5 < 6

But according to S(r1) = 5 + r1, with r1=0.5, S=5.5 < original sum of 6.

Wait, but in this case, S(r1) = 5 + r1, and original sum is 5 + r1.

Wait, but in the sample, original sum is 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which matches S(r1) = 5 + r1 with r1=1.

Then, with r1=0.5, S=5.5 < 6.

Hence, it's possible to decrease the sum by choosing a smaller r1.

But in the code, it just checks if c1 != 0, which in this case c1=1 !=0, so it answers "YES", which is correct.

Now, in the second sample, for the single connected component {0,1,2,3}:

Choose disk 0 as root, r1 = r0.

Then:

r0 = 0 + 1*r1

r1 = 5 - r0 => coef0[1] = 5, coef1[1] = -1

r2 = r0 => coef0[2] = 0, coef1[2] = 1

r3 = 5 - r0 => coef0[3] = 5, coef1[3] = -1

Hence, c0 = 0 + 5 + 0 + 5 = 10

c1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0

So, S(r1) = 10 + 0*r1 = 10

Original sum is r0 + r1 + r2 + r3 = r0 + (5 - r0) + r0 + (5 - r0) = 10

Hence, S(r1) = 10, which cannot be decreased.

Thus, c1 = 0, so it doesn't allow decreasing the sum.

Hence, the code would answer "NO", which matches the sample.

So, in this case, the code's approach seems correct.

It checks if c1 != 0 for any component.

If c1 != 0, then S(r1) is a linear function with slope c1, and depending on the sign, we can choose r1 to decrease S(r1).

If c1 == 0, then S(r1) is constant, and cannot be decreased.

Hence, if any component has c1 != 0, then it's possible to decrease the sum in that component, and hence overall sum can be decreased.

Otherwise, it's not possible.

This seems to be a correct approach.

But I need to verify if this is always the case.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose I have two disks that are tangent.

Disk 0: r0

Disk 1: r1 = d - r0, where d is the distance between centers.

Sum S(r0) = r0 + (d - r0) = d

Which is constant.

Hence, c1 = 0, and sum cannot be decreased.

Now, if I have a component with three disks, where disk 1 is tangent to both disk 0 and disk 2.

Let me say:

Disk 0: r0

Disk 1: r1 = d01 - r0

Disk 2: r2 = d12 - r1 = d12 - (d01 - r0) = d12 - d01 + r0

Sum S(r0) = r0 + (d01 - r0) + (d12 - d01 + r0) = d12 + r0

Hence, c0 = d12, c1 = 1

In this case, S(r0) = d12 + r0

Original sum is r0 + r1 + r2 = r0 + (d01 - r0) + (d12 - d01 + r0) = d12 + r0

So, S(r0) = d12 + r0

To decrease S(r0), I need d12 + r0 < d12 + r0, which requires r0 < r0, which is impossible.

Wait, but in the first sample, it was possible to decrease the sum.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the constraints on r0.

In the first sample, there were non-tangent pairs with constraints like r0 + r2 < some distance.

In the three-disk example, if there are non-tangent pairs, their constraints might allow r0 to be decreased.

Wait, in the first sample, r0 + r2 < sqrt(41), which was 2*r0 + 3 < sqrt(41)

So, r0 < (sqrt(41) - 3)/2 ≈ (6.403 - 3)/2 ≈ 1.7015

Original r0 was 1, which is less than 1.7015.

Then, decreasing r0 further would decrease S(r0) = d12 + r0, but in this case, d12 is fixed, so S(r0) decreases with r0.

But in the three-disk example, if d12 is fixed, and S(r0) = d12 + r0, then to decrease S(r0), I need to decrease r0, but is that possible?

Wait, in the first sample, r0 was decreased from 1 to 0.5, and S decreased from 6 to 5.5.

But in the three-disk example, if I decrease r0, do I violate any constraints?

Let me consider that.

Suppose disk 0 and disk 2 are not tangent.

Then, their sum of radii must be less than the distance between their centers.

So, r0 + r2 < d02

Given that r2 = d12 - d01 + r0

So, r0 + (d12 - d01 + r0) < d02 => 2*r0 + (d12 - d01) < d02 => 2*r0 < d02 - d12 + d01

So, r0 < (d02 - d12 + d01)/2

As long as this inequality holds, r0 can be decreased up to this limit.

Hence, in such a case, it's possible to decrease r0 and thereby decrease S(r0).

Therefore, in this case, c1 != 0, and the sum can be decreased.

Hence, the code's approach seems correct.

It checks if c1 != 0 for any component, which indicates that the sum can be adjusted by changing r1 in that component.

Hence, if c1 !=0 for any component, it's possible to decrease the sum, and answer "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

This seems to be a correct implementation of the approach.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**
