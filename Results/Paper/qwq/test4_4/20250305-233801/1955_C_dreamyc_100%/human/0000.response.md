Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i. The Kraken attacks them k times, alternating between the first and the last ship. Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1, and if a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is no longer attacked.

I need to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the pattern of attacks. The Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. So, attacks alternate between the two ends of the list of ships.

I need to simulate this process efficiently because n can be up to 2*10^5 and k up to 10^15, which means a straightforward simulation won't work due to time constraints.

Let me think about how to model this.

Option 1: Simulate the process step by step, but that's too slow for large n and k.

Option 2: Find a mathematical way to calculate how many times each ship is attacked without simulating each attack.

Let's explore Option 2.

First, observe that attacks alternate between the first and last ship. Each cycle of two attacks (one on the first and one on the last) reduces the durability of both ships by 1, provided they haven't sunk yet.

But ships can sink at different times, which complicates things because once a ship sinks, the number of attacks on the remaining ships changes.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the total number of attacks that can be performed before all ships are sunk.

Let's consider the total durability of all ships. If the total durability is less than or equal to k, then all ships will be sunk.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true because some ships might sink before others, and the attacks are directed specifically to the first and last ships alternately.

Wait, no. If the total durability is less than or equal to k, then certainly all ships will be sunk, because each attack reduces the total durability by 1.

So, if sum(a_i) <= k, then all n ships are sunk.

But if sum(a_i) > k, then some ships won't be sunk.

So, in the program, there's a function func_1 that seems to handle this.

Let me look at the code.

The function func_1 takes n, k, and nums (the list of durabilities).

First, it checks if k >= sum(nums). If so, return n, meaning all ships are sunk.

Otherwise, it calculates a and b as math.ceil(k / 2) and k // 2, respectively.

Then, it initializes ans, s_a, and s_b to 0.

It loops through the ships from both ends, accumulating the durability sums s_a and s_b, and increments ans whenever s_a <= a or s_b <= b.

Wait, this seems suspicious.

Let me think about what a and b represent.

If k is the total number of attacks, and attacks alternate between the first and the last ship, then approximately half the attacks are on the first ship and half on the last ship, but depending on whether k is odd or even, the distribution might differ.

Wait, math.ceil(k / 2) would be the number of attacks on the first ship if k is odd, since the first ship gets one more attack than the last ship.

And k // 2 would be the number of attacks on the last ship.

So, a is the number of attacks on the first ship, and b is the number of attacks on the last ship.

Then, the code seems to be checking how many ships can be sunk by these attacks.

It iterates from both ends, accumulating the durability and checking if the accumulated durability is less than or equal to a or b.

But I'm not sure if this correctly accounts for the sinking of ships and the reduction in the number of attacks as ships sink.

Wait, when a ship sinks, it's removed, and the attacks continue on the remaining ships.

So, the process is:

- Attack the first ship, reduce its durability.

- If it reaches 0, remove it.

- Then attack the last ship, reduce its durability.

- If it reaches 0, remove it.

- Repeat until k attacks are done or no ships are left.

The code, however, seems to be accumulating the durability from both ends and checking against a and b.

I'm not sure if this correctly models the process, especially because it doesn't account for the removal of ships and how that affects future attacks.

Maybe I need a better approach.

Let's consider that in each full cycle (two attacks: one on the first and one on the last), the durability of both the first and last ships is reduced by 1, provided they still exist.

But ships can sink at different times, so the number of cycles is limited by the number of existing ships.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate how many full cycles can be performed before any ship sinks.

Then, in each full cycle, reduce the durability of both ends by 1.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I should think in terms of the minimum number of attacks required to sink a certain number of ships.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that in each cycle, the Kraken can reduce the durability of the first and last ships by 1 each, but only if they are still afloat.

So, I need to find out how many ships are sunk given k attacks, alternating between the first and last ships.

I need an efficient way to simulate this without iterating through each attack.

An idea: use a deque to represent the ships, since we're removing from both ends.

But even with a deque, simulating each attack might be too slow for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Another idea: calculate how many attacks are needed to sink each ship, assuming it's being attacked repeatedly.

But since attacks alternate, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total number of attacks needed to sink the first m ships from the left and the first m ships from the right.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look back at the provided code.

In func_1, after checking if k >= sum(nums), it calculates a and b as ceil(k/2) and floor(k/2), respectively.

Then, it iterates through the ships from both ends, accumulating the durability sums s_a and s_b.

For each ship from the left, it adds its durability to s_a and checks if s_a <= a.

Similarly, for each ship from the right, it adds its durability to s_b and checks if s_b <= b.

Then, it counts the number of times these conditions are met.

I suspect that this is trying to count how many ships can be sunk given the number of attacks on each end.

But I'm not entirely sure if this is correct.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first example from the problem:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

According to the problem, after 5 attacks, 2 ships are sunk.

Let's see what the code does.

sum(a) = 1+2+4+3 = 10, which is greater than k=5, so it proceeds to calculate a and b.

a = ceil(5/2) = 3, b = floor(5/2) = 2.

Then, it iterates from both ends:

First iteration:

s_a = 1 <= 3 → ans +=1

s_b = 3 <= 2 → no

Second iteration:

s_a = 1+2 = 3 <= 3 → ans +=1

s_b = 3+4 = 7 > 2 → no

So, ans = 2, which matches the example.

Another test case:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

sum(a)=10 >6, a=3, b=3

First iteration:

s_a=1<=3 → ans=1

s_b=3<=3 → ans=2

Second iteration:

s_a=1+2=3<=3 → ans=3

s_b=3+4=7>3 → no

So, ans=3, which should be correct.

Another test case:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

sum(a)=20 == k, so all 5 ships are sunk, which matches the output.

Another test case:

n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

sum(a)=5 >2, a=1, b=1

First iteration:

s_a=3 >1 → no

s_b=2 <=1 → ans=1

Second iteration:

s_a=3+0=3 >1 → no

s_b=2+0=2 >1 → no

So, ans=1, but according to the problem, output is 0.

Wait, in the problem's output, it's 0 for this test case.

But according to the code, it's 1.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Let's simulate the process for n=2, k=2, a=[3,2]

First attack: attack first ship, durability becomes 2

Second attack: attack last ship, durability becomes 1

No ship has sunk yet, so ans should be 0, but the code returns 1.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

So, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
