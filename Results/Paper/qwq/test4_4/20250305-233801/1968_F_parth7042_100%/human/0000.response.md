Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have an array, and we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting." An interesting subarray is one that can be divided into at least two parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

First, I need to grasp what bitwise XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

So, for a subarray to be interesting, I need to split it into at least two consecutive segments where the XOR of each segment is the same.

Let me look at the example provided:

Array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]

Queries:

1. Subarray from 1 to 5: [1,1,2,3,0] - YES

2. Subarray from 2 to 4: [1,2,3] - YES

3. Subarray from 3 to 5: [2,3,0] - NO

4. Subarray from 1 to 3: [1,1,2] - NO

5. Subarray from 3 to 4: [2,3] - NO

I need to figure out a way to determine this efficiently, especially since n and q can be up to 2*10^5, which means I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let's think about the properties of XOR. One important property is that XOR is associative and commutative. Another key property is that if a XOR b = c, then a XOR c = b and b XOR c = a.

I recall that prefix XOR can be useful in these kinds of problems. Let's define a prefix XOR array, where pf[i] is the XOR of all elements from 1 to i.

So, pf[0] = 0 (empty XOR)

pf[1] = a[1]

pf[2] = a[1] XOR a[2]

pf[3] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR a[3]

and so on.

Now, the XOR of a subarray from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Given that, I need to check if I can split the subarray [l,r] into at least two parts where each part's XOR is equal.

Let's denote the XOR of the entire subarray as x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x is zero, that means pf[r] = pf[l-1], which implies that the XOR of the subarray is zero. In this case, I can split the subarray into any number of parts, and each part's XOR will be zero because XORing zero with any value doesn't change it. So, if x is zero, the answer is YES.

If x is not zero, I need to check if there exists at least one split point in the subarray where the XOR of the left part is equal to the XOR of the remaining part.

Wait, actually, I need to split into at least two parts, and each part's XOR should be equal to x.

Wait, but x is the XOR of the entire subarray. If I split the subarray into two parts, the XOR of the first part is y, and the XOR of the second part is x XOR y (since y XOR (x XOR y) = x). So, for both parts to have the same XOR, y should be equal to x XOR y, which implies y = x XOR y, which simplifies to y = x / 2, but XOR doesn't work like that.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r], I want to split it into k parts where k > 1, and each part's XOR is equal to some value y.

But the problem specifies that y should be the same for all parts.

Wait, more formally, for the subarray [l,r], I need to find indices l = p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r+1 such that the XOR of a[p1] to a[p2-1], a[p2] to a[p3-1], ..., a[pk-1] to a[pk-1] are all equal.

Let me denote y = the common XOR value.

So, y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times) should equal the XOR of the entire subarray [l,r], which is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

But XOR is associative and commutative, so the overall XOR is the XOR of all the individual parts' XORs.

So, if I have k parts, each with XOR y, then the overall XOR is y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times).

If k is even, y XOR y is 0, and so on, which would make the overall XOR 0 if k is even.

If k is odd, the overall XOR would be y.

But in the problem, k > 1, so k can be even or odd greater than 1.

Wait, but in the problem, it's specified that k > 1.

So, if k is even, the overall XOR is 0, and if k is odd, it's y.

But the overall XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = x.

So, if k is even, x should be 0, and if k is odd, x should be y.

But y is the XOR of each part, and y should be equal for all parts.

This seems confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the value of y, and I want to split the subarray into parts where each part's XOR is y.

I need to find if there exists a y such that the subarray can be split into at least two parts with XOR y.

But since y is not given, I need to find if such a y exists.

Wait, but y is determined by the subarray's total XOR and the number of parts.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I should look for a way to split the subarray into two or more parts where each part's XOR is equal.

Let me consider that for two parts, the XOR of the first part is y, and the XOR of the second part is x XOR y, as I thought earlier.

For them to be equal, y should be equal to x XOR y, which implies y = x XOR y, which simplifies to y XOR y = x, which is x = 0.

So, only if x = 0, can I split into two parts with equal XOR.

But in the problem, k > 1, which includes k = 2.

So, for x = 0, I can split into any even number of parts with XOR 0.

But the problem allows k > 1, so k can be even or odd greater than 1.

Wait, but if k is odd and greater than 1, say k=3, then the overall XOR would be y XOR y XOR y = y (since y XOR y = 0, and 0 XOR y = y).

But the overall XOR is x, so y = x.

But for the three parts to have XOR y, and the overall XOR is y, which should be equal to x.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

I recall that in some XOR problems, using the property of prefix XOR and checking for equal values can help.

Let me consider that.

If pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = x, and I want to split the subarray [l,r] into k parts with each part's XOR equal to y, then perhaps I can look for points where the prefix XOR up to that point minus the prefix XOR at l-1 is equal to y.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look back at the example.

Array: [1,1,2,3,0]

Query 1: l=1, r=5 -> subarray [1,1,2,3,0]

It's possible to split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and each XOR is 1.

Wait, 1 XOR 1 = 0, which is not equal to 1.

Wait, no, [1], [1], [2,3,0]

XOR of [1] is 1

XOR of [1] is 1

XOR of [2,3,0] is 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1

So, all parts have XOR 1.

So, k=3, which is odd, and overall XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1 (since k is odd), which matches pf[5] XOR pf[0] = something.

Wait, pf[0] = 0, pf[1] = 1, pf[2] = 0, pf[3] = 2, pf[4] = 1, pf[5] = 1

So, pf[5] XOR pf[0] = 1 XOR 0 = 1, which matches x.

So, in this case, x = 1, and k=3 (odd), and y=1, which matches x.

Another query: l=2, r=4 -> [1,2,3]

It's possible to split into [1,2],[3], each with XOR 3 and 3.

Wait, 1 XOR 2 = 3, and [3] has XOR 3.

So, k=2 (even), and overall XOR should be 3 XOR 3 = 0, but pf[4] XOR pf[1] = what?

pf[4] = 1, pf[1] = 1, so 1 XOR 1 = 0, which matches.

So, for k even, x should be 0.

For k odd, x should be y.

In this case, y = 3, and k=2 (even), x=0, which matches.

Wait, but in the first case, k=3 (odd), x=1, y=1, which matches.

So, the condition seems to hold.

But how do I generalize this to check if such a split is possible?

I need a way to find if there exists a k > 1 such that the subarray can be split into k parts with each part's XOR equal to y, and depending on k being even or odd, x should be 0 or y accordingly.

This seems tricky to implement directly.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of times the prefix XOR value appears.

Let me consider that.

I can precompute the prefix XOR array pf[0..n], where pf[i] = a[1] XOR a[2] XOR ... XOR a[i]

Then, for a subarray [l,r], its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, to split [l,r] into k parts with equal XOR, I need to find points l = p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r+1 such that pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] = pf[p3-1] XOR pf[p2-1] = ... = pf[pk-1] XOR pf[pk-2-1] = y

And y should be equal for all these parts.

Wait, pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] is the XOR of the first part [p1, p2-1], which should be y.

Similarly, pf[p3-1] XOR pf[p2-1] is the XOR of the second part [p2, p3-1], which should also be y.

And so on.

So, I need pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] = pf[p3-1] XOR pf[p2-1] = ... = y

Which implies that pf[p2-1] = pf[p1-1] XOR y

pf[p3-1] = pf[p2-1] XOR y = pf[p1-1] XOR y XOR y = pf[p1-1]

And so on.

This seems cyclical, but I'm not sure.

Maybe I need to consider that all pf[pi-1] for i odd are equal to pf[p1-1], and for i even, they are equal to pf[p1-1] XOR y.

But this is getting complicated.

Let me try another approach.

Suppose I fix y, and I want to split the subarray into parts where each part's XOR is y.

I can iterate through the subarray, keeping a running XOR, and whenever the running XOR equals y, I make a cut there.

This way, I can split the subarray into parts where each part's XOR is y.

But y is not given; I need to find if such a y exists that allows k > 1 parts.

Wait, but in this problem, y is determined by the subarray's total XOR divided by k, but since it's XOR, it's not straightforward.

Maybe I need to consider that for the subarray to be split into k parts with equal XOR, the total XOR x must be equal to y if k is odd, or 0 if k is even.

Wait, more precisely:

- If k is even, x must be 0.

- If k is odd, x must be y.

But y must be equal for all parts.

So, for even k, x must be 0, and for odd k, x must be y.

But y is the XOR of each part.

In this problem, since k > 1, we need to check if there exists a k > 1 that satisfies the above conditions.

Given that, perhaps I can check:

- If x == 0, then it's possible to split into any even number of parts with y=0.

- If x != 0, then it's possible to split into k parts where k is odd, and y = x.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, but in the first query of the example, x = 1, and it's split into k=3 parts, each with y=1.

In the second query, x = 0, and it's split into k=2 parts, each with y=3.

Wait, but y doesn't have to be x when k is even.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Suppose I have x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

If x == 0, then I can split into any even number of parts with y=0.

If x != 0, then I need to check if there exists a k > 1 (odd or even) such that the subarray can be split into k parts with each part's XOR equal to y.

But y must be consistent across all parts.

Wait, perhaps I can generalize that for any split into k parts, the overall XOR is y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k times), which is 0 if k is even, and y if k is odd.

So, for the overall XOR x:

- If k is even, x must be 0.

- If k is odd, x must be y.

Given that, for x == 0, I can choose k even, and y=0.

For x != 0, I can choose k odd, and y=x.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, but in the second query of the example, x=0, and it's split into k=2 parts with y=3.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, for x=0 and k even, y can be anything, since y XOR y = 0.

But in reality, y has to be such that each part's XOR is y.

Wait, in the second query, [1,2,3], x=0.

If I split into [1,2] and [3], XOR of [1,2] is 1 XOR 2 = 3, and XOR of [3] is 3.

So, y=3, and k=2 (even), and x=0, which matches y XOR y = 0.

So, in this case, y is not zero, but y XOR y = 0, which matches x=0.

So, for x=0 and k even, y can be any value such that y XOR y = 0, which is always true.

Hence, for x=0 and k even, it's possible to split into k parts with any y.

But in practice, y has to be consistent across all parts.

Wait, but in this case, y=3 works.

So, perhaps for x=0 and k even, I can choose y such that there are at least two parts with XOR y.

In the second query, y=3, and there are two parts with XOR 3.

Similarly, in the first query, x=1, and k=3 (odd), y=1.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If x == 0, and k is even, it's possible.

- If x != 0, and k is odd, it's possible only if there exists at least one way to split into k parts with each part's XOR equal to x.

But I need to find a way to check this efficiently.

Let me think about how to check for x == 0 and k even.

For x == 0, I need to find at least two parts with XOR y, where y can be any value, but in practice, y has to be consistent across all parts.

Wait, no, y has to be the same for all parts.

So, for x == 0 and k even, I need to check if I can split the subarray into k parts where each part's XOR is y, and y XOR y = 0.

But y XOR y = 0 implies y=0.

Wait, no, y XOR y = 0 for any y.

Wait, no, y XOR y = 0.

But in the second query, y=3, and 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches x=0.

So, y can be any value, as long as there are even number of parts.

Hence, for x == 0 and k even, it's always possible to split into k parts with y being the XOR of each part.

So, for x == 0, the answer is YES.

For x != 0, I need to check if there exists at least one way to split into k parts (k >1, can be odd or even) with each part's XOR equal to y, where y is consistent across all parts.

But for k odd, y should be x, and for k even, y can be anything, but since x == y XOR y == 0, y must be such that y XOR y == 0, which is always true.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to find a different approach.

I recall that in some problems involving XOR, using the property of prefix XOR and checking for equal values can help determine if a subarray has a certain XOR.

Let me consider that.

If I have the prefix XOR array pf[0..n], then the XOR of any subarray [l,r] is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, to split [l,r] into k parts with each part's XOR equal to y, I need to find points l = p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r+1 such that pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] = y, pf[p3-1] XOR pf[p2-1] = y, and so on.

This implies that pf[p1-1] XOR pf[p2-1] = y, pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p3-1] = y, and so on.

If I look at this sequence, I can see that pf[p1-1] XOR pf[p2-1] = y, pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p3-1] = y, and so on.

Combining these, I can see that pf[p1-1] XOR pf[pk-1] = y XOR y XOR ... XOR y (k-1 times).

If k is even, y XOR y XOR ... XOR y = 0.

If k is odd, it's y.

But pf[p1-1] XOR pf[pk-1] = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = x.

So, x = y if k is odd, and x = 0 if k is even.

Hence, for x == 0, k must be even, and for x != 0, k must be odd.

But in the problem, k >1, so k can be any integer greater than 1.

Wait, but in the second query, x=0, k=2 (even), which matches.

In the first query, x=1, k=3 (odd), which matches.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If x == 0, then it's possible to split into any even k >1.

- If x !=0, it's possible to split into any odd k >1.

But I need to confirm if this is always true.

Wait, but in the second query, x=0, and it's split into k=2 parts, which is even.

In the first query, x=1, and it's split into k=3 parts, which is odd.

So, perhaps the condition is that for x ==0, k must be even, and for x !=0, k must be odd.

But I need to ensure that such a split is possible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's not specified that k must be even for x==0 and odd for x!=0.

It just says to split into k>1 parts with each part's XOR equal.

But from the above analysis, it seems that for x==0, k must be even, and for x!=0, k must be odd.

But in the problem, it's possible to have x!=0 and k even, as in the second query.

Wait, no, in the second query, x=0, k=2 (even).

Wait, no, in the second query, subarray [2,4]: [1,2,3]

pf[4] XOR pf[1] = 1 XOR 1 = 0, so x=0.

k=2 (even), which matches.

Similarly, in the first query, x=1, k=3 (odd).

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If x ==0, then k must be even.

- If x !=0, then k must be odd.

But in the problem, it's allowed to have k>1, and we need to check if such a k exists that satisfies the above conditions.

But in the problem, it's to determine if such a split exists for at least one k>1.

Hence, for x==0, it's possible (k even >1), and for x!=0, it's possible (k odd >1).

But I need to confirm if this is always the case.

Wait, but in the third query of the first test case, subarray [3,5]: [2,3,0]

x=2 XOR 3 XOR 0 =1

So, x=1 !=0, so k must be odd >1.

Is it possible to split [2,3,0] into odd number of parts >1 with each part's XOR equal to 1?

Let's see:

Possible splits:

- k=3: [2],[3],[0]

XORs: 2,3,0 -> not equal.

- k=5: Not possible, since n=3.

So, no split possible, hence NO.

Similarly, in the fourth query, subarray [1,3]: [1,1,2]

x=1 XOR 1 XOR 2=2

k must be odd >1.

Possible splits:

- k=3: [1],[1],[2]

XORs:1,1,2 -> not equal.

Hence, NO.

Fifth query: [2,3], x=1 XOR 2=3

k must be odd >1.

Possible splits:

- k=2: Not allowed, since k must be odd.

- k=3: Not possible, n=2.

Hence, NO.

So, in this test case, the answers match the above logic.

Another test case:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

Queries:

1. [1,5]: [1,2,3,4,5], x=1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR5=1^2=3^3=0^4=4^5=1

x=1 !=0, so k must be odd >1.

Possible splits:

- k=3: [1,2],[3],[4,5]

XORs: 1^2=3, [3], [4^5=1] -> not equal.

- k=5: [1],[2],[3],[4],[5]

XORs:1,2,3,4,5 -> not equal.

Hence, NO.

- k=1 is not allowed.

Hence, NO.

Second query: [2,4]: [2,3,4], x=2^3^4=1^4=5

x=5 !=0, k must be odd >1.

Possible splits:

- k=3: [2],[3],[4]

XORs:2,3,4 -> not equal.

Hence, NO.

Third query: [3,5]: [3,4,5], x=3^4^5=7^5=2

x=2 !=0, k must be odd >1.

Possible splits:

- k=3: [3],[4],[5]

XORs:3,4,5 -> not equal.

Hence, NO.

Fourth query: [1,3]: [1,2,3], x=1^2^3=3^3=0

x=0 ==0, k must be even >1.

Possible splits:

- k=2: [1,2],[3]

XORs:1^2=3, [3] -> not equal.

Wait, 3 !=3, but in the previous test case, it was considered YES.

Wait, in the first test case, for x=0, k=2, it was YES.

But in this case, for x=0, k=2, it's NO.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the first test case, for x=0, k=2, it was YES because y=3, and y XOR y =0, which matches x=0.

But in this case, x=0, and for k=2, split into [1,2],[3], y=3, which matches y XOR y =0.

Hence, it should be YES.

Wait, but in the sample output, for this test case, the answers are:

YES

NO

NO

YES

NO

Wait, but according to the above, for the fourth query, x=0, k=2 should be YES.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for x==0, it's possible to split into any even k>1, provided that there exists at least two points where the prefix XOR is equal within the subarray.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if there exists at least one point in the subarray where the prefix XOR up to that point is equal to pf[l-1].

Wait, more precisely, for x==0, I need to check if there exists at least one point in the subarray where the prefix XOR is equal to pf[l-1].

Because then, I can split the subarray into two parts: [l, p] and [p+1, r], each with XOR y.

Wait, but y XOR y =0, which matches x=0.

Hence, if there exists at least one point p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1], then I can split into [l,p] and [p+1,r], each with XOR y.

Since x=0, y can be any value such that y XOR y =0, which is always true.

Hence, for x==0, I need to check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

Similarly, for x !=0, I need to check if there exists at least two points in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Wait, perhaps I need to map the prefix XOR values and check for their frequencies.

Let me consider that.

For x==0:

I need to find if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

Because then, [l,p] has XOR pf[p] XOR pf[l-1] =0, and [p+1,r] has XOR pf[r] XOR pf[p] =0.

Hence, both parts have XOR 0.

So, for x==0, I need to check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

For x !=0:

I need to find if there exists at least two points in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Wait, why two points?

Let me think.

Suppose I want to split into k=3 parts with each XOR y=x.

Then, I need to find points p1, p2, p3 where p1=l, p3=r+1, and p2 is such that pf[p2-1] XOR pf[p1-1] = y, and pf[p3-1] XOR pf[p2-1] = y.

So, pf[p2-1] = pf[p1-1] XOR y = pf[l-1] XOR x

And pf[p3-1] = pf[p2-1] XOR y = pf[l-1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l-1]

But pf[p3-1] should be pf[r], which is pf[l-1] in this case.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to look for points where pf[p] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

In general, for x !=0, I need to find at least two points in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Because then, I can split into [l,p1], [p1+1,p2], [p2+1,r], each with XOR y=x.

Wait, but I need to confirm this.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have p1 where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x

Then, the XOR of [l,p1] is pf[p1] XOR pf[l-1] = (pf[l-1] XOR x) XOR pf[l-1] = x

Similarly, the XOR of [p1+1, r] is pf[r] XOR pf[p1] = pf[r] XOR (pf[l-1] XOR x) = (pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]) XOR x = x XOR x =0

Wait, but I need both parts to have XOR y=x.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to find p1 where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR y

And p2 where pf[p2] = pf[p1] XOR y, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, using the fact that the number of times a particular XOR value appears in the prefix XOR array can help determine if a subarray with a certain XOR exists.

In this problem, perhaps I can use a similar approach.

Let me consider that.

I can precompute the prefix XOR array pf[0..n].

Then, for each query [l,r], I can compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Then:

- If x ==0, I need to check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

Because then, I can split into [l,p], which has XOR pf[p] XOR pf[l-1] =0, and [p+1,r], which has XOR pf[r] XOR pf[p] =0.

Hence, both parts have XOR 0.

- If x !=0, I need to check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

Because then, I can split into [l,p], which has XOR x, and [p+1,r], which has XOR x.

Hence, k=2, which is even, but x !=0, which contradicts earlier analysis.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for x !=0, k must be odd.

But in this case, for x !=0, I'm considering splitting into k=2 parts with each XOR x, which would make the overall XOR x XOR x =0, which contradicts x !=0.

Hence, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider splitting into k=3 parts for x !=0.

Let me try that.

For x !=0, I need to find p1 and p2 where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and pf[p2] = pf[p1] XOR x = pf[l-1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l-1].

Hence, p2 should be such that pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

So, for x !=0, I need to find at least two points in [l,r]: one where pf[p] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and another where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

But p2 must be greater than p1.

Hence, I need to check if there exists p1 in [l,r] where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and p2 in [p1+1, r] where pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

This would allow me to split into three parts: [l,p1], [p1+1,p2], [p2+1,r], each with XOR y=x.

Wait, but I need to ensure that the XOR of [p2+1,r] is also x.

Given that pf[r] XOR pf[p2] should be x, and pf[p2] = pf[l-1], then pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] =x, which matches the overall x.

Hence, for x !=0, I need to find at least one p1 in [l,r] where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and at least one p2 in [p1+1, r] where pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

This seems feasible.

Hence, the conditions are:

- If x ==0, check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- If x !=0, check if there exists at least one p1 in [l,r] where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and at least one p2 in [p1+1, r] where pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

To implement this efficiently, I can map each pf value to the list of indices where it appears.

Then, for each query [l,r]:

- Compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

- If x ==0:

- Check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- Which means, check if there is any p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- If x !=0:

- Check if there exists at least one p1 in [l,r] where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and at least one p2 in [p1+1, r] where pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

- To check this, I can find all p1 in [l,r] where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and for each such p1, check if there exists p2 in [p1+1, r] where pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

- To optimize, I can precompute for each pf value, the list of indices where it appears, and then use binary search to find if there exists p in [l,r] for a given pf value.

Hence, the plan is:

1. Compute the prefix XOR array pf[0..n].

2. Create a map from pf value to the list of indices where it appears.

3. For each query [l,r]:

a. Compute x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

b. If x ==0:

- Check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- Use binary search on the list of indices for pf[l-1] to see if any p in [l,r].

c. If x !=0:

- Find all p1 in [l,r] where pf[p1] = pf[l-1] XOR x.

- For each such p1, check if there exists p2 in [p1+1, r] where pf[p2] = pf[l-1].

- Again, use binary search on the list of indices for pf[l-1] to find if there is any p2 > p1 and <=r.

- If such a p2 exists for any p1, then answer YES; else, NO.

This should be efficient enough, as the total time complexity is O((n + q) log n), which is acceptable given n and q up to 2e5.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

- It reads all input at once and splits it into a list called data.

- It initializes index=0 to track the current position in data.

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads n and q.

- Initializes array a[1..n] and prefix XOR array pf[0..n].

- Creates a defaultdict mp to map pf values to lists of indices.

- mp[0] is initialized with [0].

- Fills a, pf, and populates mp with indices for each pf value.

- For each query:

- Reads l and r.

- Computes x = pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

- If x ==0, appends 'YES' to results.

- Else:

- Gets v1 = mp[pf[r]]

- Gets v2 = mp[pf[l-1]]

- Finds it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)

- Finds it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) -1

- If it1 < len(v1) and it2 >=0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2], appends 'YES'; else, 'NO'

Now, let's analyze this.

For x ==0:

- It directly appends 'YES'.

- According to our earlier analysis, for x ==0, we need to check if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- However, the code directly says 'YES' without checking if such a p exists.

- This is incorrect.

- It should only say 'YES' if there exists at least one p in [l,r] where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- But the code doesn't perform this check; it just assumes 'YES' for x ==0.

For x !=0:

- It gets v1 = mp[pf[r]], which is the list of indices where pf[p] = pf[r].

- v2 = mp[pf[l-1]], list of indices where pf[p] = pf[l-1].

- It finds it1 = bisect_left(v1, l), which is the first p1 >=l where pf[p1] = pf[r].

- It finds it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) -
