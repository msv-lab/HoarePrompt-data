Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Now, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase letters. Since there are k choices for each position in the string, and the string is of length n, the total number of such strings is k^n. That can be a large number if n and k are big, so I need to be careful with how I approach this.

The problem says that m can be up to 1000 per test case, and the sum of m over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6. Also, t can be up to 10^5. So, I need an efficient way to handle this, especially since t can be up to 10^5.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting to solve the problem with some bit manipulation. Let's try to understand what it's doing.

The function func reads the input for t test cases. For each test case, it reads n, k, m, and the string s.

Then, it initializes cnt to 0 and cur to 0. It iterates through each character in s, converts it to its corresponding ordinal value minus 'a' to get a number between 0 and k-1.

It checks if the bit corresponding to that character in cur is 0. If it is, it sets that bit in cur. If cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, which is a bitmask with the first k bits set to 1, it increments cnt and resets cur to 0.

After processing the entire string s, it checks if cnt is greater than or equal to n. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string that doesn't exist as a subsequence in s.

This seems to be checking how many complete sets of the first k letters are present in s as subsequences. If there are at least n such sets, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO' and provides a string that doesn't exist.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's consider the first example:

n = 2, k = 2, m = 4, s = "abba"

The possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' are: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb".

We need to check if all of these are subsequences of "abba".

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (s[0] and s[2])

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 (s[0] and s[1])

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 (s[1] and s[2])

- "bb": positions 2 and 4 (s[1] and s[3])

All of them are present, so the answer should be 'YES'.

According to the code:

It iterates through s:

- s[0] = 'a': cur = 1 (binary: 01)

- s[1] = 'b': cur = 3 (binary: 11), which is equal to (1 << 2) - 1 = 3, so cnt = 1, cur = 0

- s[2] = 'b': cur = 2 (binary: 10)

- s[3] = 'a': cur = 3 (binary: 11), so cnt = 2, cur = 0

Since cnt = 2 >= n = 2, it prints 'YES'.

That seems correct for this case.

Now, the second example:

n = 2, k = 2, m = 3, s = "abb"

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb"

Check if they are subsequences:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3 (s[0] and s[2])

- "ab": positions 1 and 2 (s[0] and s[1])

- "ba": positions 2 and 3 (s[1] and s[2])

- "bb": positions 2 and 3 (s[1] and s[2])

Wait, "aa" is "a" at position 1 and "b" at position 3, but "b" is not 'a', so "aa" is not a subsequence. So, it should be 'NO' and provide "aa".

According to the code:

- s[0] = 'a': cur = 1 (01)

- s[1] = 'b': cur = 3 (11), cnt = 1, cur = 0

- s[2] = 'b': cur = 2 (10)

cnt = 1 >= n = 2? No, so 'NO'

Then, it constructs ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt = 'b' * 1 = 'b'

Then, it finds tmp by checking which bits are not set in cur. cur = 2 (10), so bit 0 is not set, which corresponds to 'a'. So, tmp = 'a'

Then, ans += tmp = 'b' + 'a' = 'ba'

Then, ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) = 'a' * (2 - 1 - 1) = 'a' * 0 = ''

So, ans = 'ba'

But according to the example, it should be 'aa'. So, there's a discrepancy here.

This suggests that the code's logic for constructing the missing string is flawed.

Another example:

n = 3, k = 3, m = 10, s = "aabbccabab"

Possible strings of length 3 using 'a', 'b', 'c'.

Total 3^3 = 27 possible strings.

We need to check if all of them are present as subsequences in s.

This seems more complex, but according to the example, the answer is 'NO' and the missing string is "ccc".

Looking at the code's output for this case:

Iterate through s:

- 'a': cur = 1 (001)

- 'a': cur remains 1

- 'b': cur = 3 (011)

- 'b': cur remains 3

- 'c': cur = 7 (111), cnt = 1, cur = 0

- 'c': cur = 4 (100)

- 'a': cur = 5 (101)

- 'b': cur = 7 (111), cnt = 2, cur = 0

- 'a': cur = 1 (001)

- 'b': cur = 3 (011)

So, cnt = 2 >= n = 3? No, so 'NO'

Then, ans = chr(97 + 3 - 1) * cnt = 'c' * 2 = 'cc'

Then, find tmp: cur = 3 (011), so bits 0 and 1 are set, bit 2 is not set, which is 'c'. But the code checks for cur & (1 << i) == 0, so for i from 0 to k-1:

- i=0: cur & 1 == 1 (since 3 & 1 == 1)

- i=1: cur & 2 == 2 (since 3 & 2 == 2)

- i=2: cur & 4 == 0, so tmp = 'c'

Then, ans += tmp = 'cc' + 'c' = 'ccc'

Then, ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) = 'a' * (3 - 2 - 1) = 'a' * 0 = ''

So, ans = 'ccc', which matches the example's output.

But in the second test case, it output 'ba' instead of 'aa', which is incorrect.

So, the code seems to have a flaw in constructing the missing string.

Let's think about a better way to approach this problem.

Given the constraints, especially with t up to 10^5 and m up to 1000, and the sum of m over all test cases up to 10^6, we need an efficient solution.

Generating all k^n strings is not feasible for large n and k, as k^n can be up to 26^26, which is astronomically large.

Hence, we need a smarter way to check if all possible strings of length n using the first k letters are subsequences of s.

One way to approach this is to consider the positions of each character in s.

For each of the k characters, we can store the list of their positions in s.

Then, for any sequence of characters, we can check if there exists a subsequence in s that matches that sequence by iterating through the position lists in the order specified by the sequence.

However, checking this for all k^n sequences is still not practical due to time constraints.

We need a way to determine if there exists at least one sequence that is not a subsequence of s.

To do this efficiently, we can think about the maximum number of distinct subsequences of length n that s can have, and compare it to the total number of possible sequences, which is k^n.

If the number of distinct subsequences of length n in s is less than k^n, then there exists at least one sequence that is not a subsequence of s.

But counting the exact number of distinct subsequences of length n in s is also computationally intensive for large m and n.

Instead, perhaps we can find a way to determine if s contains all possible sequences of length n using the first k letters.

One idea is to consider that for s to contain all possible sequences of length n, it must contain all possible sequences of length 1, 2, up to n.

But this seems too vague.

Let's think differently.

Suppose we fix the first character of the sequence and see if we can find the remaining n-1 characters in order after it.

We can recursively apply this logic.

But again, this seems too slow for the given constraints.

Another approach is to model this problem using a graph.

We can create a graph where each node represents the current length of the subsequence we're building.

We start from node 0 (no characters chosen), and for each character in s, we can transition to the next node corresponding to appending that character to the subsequence.

We need to ensure that for all possible sequences of length n, there is a path from node 0 to node n in this graph.

But constructing such a graph explicitly is not feasible due to its size.

We need a more efficient way.

Let's consider the problem in terms of the positions of characters in s.

For each character in the sequence, we need to find its position in s that is after the position of the previous character in the sequence.

To check if a particular sequence is a subsequence of s, we can iterate through s and try to match the characters of the sequence in order.

But again, checking this for all possible sequences is not practical.

We need a way to determine if there's at least one sequence that isn't a subsequence of s.

Perhaps it's easier to find such a sequence directly, rather than checking all possible sequences.

To do this, we can try to find a sequence where the required positions cannot be satisfied given the positions of the characters in s.

But how?

Let's consider the positions of each character separately.

If for some character, its positions in s are too sparse to satisfy the required number of occurrences in the sequences, then we might have sequences that cannot be formed.

But this is still vague.

Let's consider the minimal number of times each character needs to appear in s to ensure that all sequences are possible.

For example, if n=1, then s must contain all k characters at least once.

If n=2, s must contain all possible pairs, which would require that for each pair of characters, there exists at least one occurrence where the first character appears before the second one.

This seems complicated to generalize.

Let's think about the minimal number of times each character must appear in s to cover all possible sequences.

But even that seems tricky, as the dependencies between characters are interwoven.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the provided code's approach is acceptable, despite the mistake in constructing the missing string.

But since it has a flaw in constructing the missing string, as seen in the second test case, we need to fix that.

Alternatively, we need to find a better way to construct the missing string when the answer is 'NO'.

Let's try to understand the logic behind the provided code.

It seems to be counting how many times it can find a complete set of the first k letters in s as a subsequence.

It does this by maintaining a bitmask cur, where each bit represents whether a particular character has been seen so far.

When cur becomes equal to (1 << k) - 1, it means all k characters have been seen in order, so it resets cur and increments cnt.

Then, if cnt >= n, it means we can form at least n such complete sets, so it prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and tries to construct a missing string.

The way it constructs the missing string is by taking the sequence of characters corresponding to the bits set in cur during the cnt times, and then appending a character that isn't present in the last cur.

But in the second test case, it failed to produce the correct missing string.

So, perhaps this approach is not correct.

An alternative approach is to use dynamic programming to keep track of the possible sequences that can be formed up to a certain point in s.

We can maintain a DP array where dp[i] represents the set of sequences of length i that can be formed up to the current position in s.

But with n up to 26 and m up to 1000, and t up to 10^5, this might be too slow.

Wait, but n and k are small (up to 26), so maybe it's manageable.

Let's think about it.

We can initialize dp[0] as the empty sequence.

Then, for each character in s, for each length i from n-1 down to 0, and for each sequence of length i that can be formed up to the current position, we can append the current character to it if it's one of the first k letters, and add it to dp[i+1].

But this seems too slow for the given constraints, as dp[i] can have up to k^i entries, and with t up to 10^5 and m up to 1000, it would be too time-consuming.

We need a smarter way.

Let's consider the problem in terms of the positions of each character.

For each character from 0 to k-1, let's store the list of positions where it appears in s.

Then, to check if a particular sequence exists as a subsequence, we can iterate through the sequence and for each character, find the smallest position in its position list that is greater than the position of the previous character in the sequence.

If we can find such positions for all characters in the sequence, then the sequence is a subsequence of s.

But again, checking this for all k^n sequences is not feasible.

We need a way to determine if there exists at least one sequence that isn't a subsequence of s.

Perhaps we can find the sequences that are missing by identifying the sequences where the required positions cannot be satisfied.

But how to do this efficiently?

Let's consider the minimal number of times we need to see each character in s to cover all possible sequences.

For example, for n=1, we need each character at least once.

For n=2, we need each pair at least once, which would require that for each pair of characters, there exists at least one occurrence where the first character appears before the second one in s.

This seems too involved.

An alternative idea is to model this as a graph where nodes represent prefixes of sequences, and edges represent appending a character to the prefix.

We can then check if all paths of length n are covered by s.

But again, this seems too slow.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the provided code's approach, despite its flaw, is acceptable if we can fix the missing string construction.

Let's try to understand what the code is trying to do.

It's counting how many times it can collect all k characters in order as a subsequence in s.

It uses a bitmask to keep track of which characters have been seen so far.

When it has seen all k characters (mask equals (1 << k) - 1), it increments a counter and resets the mask.

If the counter is at least n, it means we can form at least n complete sets of the first k letters in order as subsequences, so it prints 'YES'.

Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and tries to construct a missing string based on the current mask.

In the second test case, for s = "abb", k = 2, n = 2, the code sets cnt = 1 (since it finds one complete set 'ab'), but n = 2, so it needs two complete sets.

Since cnt < n, it prints 'NO' and constructs 'ba', but the correct missing string is 'aa'.

This indicates that the code's logic for constructing the missing string is incorrect.

Perhaps a better way is to find the sequence that isn't covered by s.

To do this, we can find the sequence that requires more occurrences of a character than are available in s.

For example, in the second test case, "aa" requires two 'a's, but in "abb", there is only one 'a', so "aa" cannot be a subsequence.

Hence, we can construct the missing string by repeating the character that doesn't occur enough times.

But this might not cover all cases, as sequences can be more complex.

Wait, perhaps we can find the sequence that requires more occurrences of a particular character than are available in s.

In the second test case, 'a' appears only once, so any sequence that requires two 'a's cannot be a subsequence.

Hence, "aa" is a valid missing sequence.

Similarly, if a character appears insufficient times, we can construct a sequence by repeating that character n times.

But we need to ensure that such a sequence isn't present in s.

In the third test case, for n=3, k=3, s="aabbccabab", the missing sequence is "ccc", which isn't present because 'c' appears only twice.

Hence, "ccc" is a valid missing sequence.

So, perhaps the way to construct a missing sequence is to find a character that appears fewer than n times in s and construct a sequence of that character repeated n times.

If all characters appear at least n times, then perhaps all sequences are present.

But is this always correct?

Wait, no. Consider s = "aaab", n=3, k=2, m=4.

Here, 'a' appears three times, 'b' appears once.

So, according to this logic, since 'a' appears three times, we can form "aaa".

But we also need to check other sequences like "aab", "aba", "baa", etc.

But in this case, since 'b' appears only once, sequences like "abb" or "bba" might not be possible.

Wait, but n=3, and 'b' appears only once, so sequences requiring multiple 'b's aren't possible.

Hence, constructing a sequence with multiple 'b's would be missing.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to find the character that appears the fewest times in s, and construct a sequence of that character repeated n times.

If that sequence isn't present, then output it.

But we need to ensure that such a sequence isn't a subsequence in s.

In the earlier example, for s="abb", n=2, k=2, the character 'a' appears once, 'b' appears twice.

Hence, "aa" isn't present, which is correct.

In another example, s="aabbccabab", n=3, k=3, 'c' appears twice, so "ccc" isn't present.

This seems to work.

But is this always sufficient?

Let's consider a case where all characters appear at least n times, but there are still missing sequences.

For example, s="abacadaeaf", n=5, k=5, m=11.

Assume 'a','b','c','d','e' are the first k letters.

In this string, each character from 'a' to 'e' appears at least once, but perhaps not enough to cover all sequences.

Wait, n=5, so sequences of length 5.

If each character appears at least 5 times, but the positions are such that some sequences aren't possible.

But in practice, if each character appears at least n times, and the string is long enough, it's likely that all sequences are present, but not necessarily.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps this approach isn't fully reliable.

An alternative idea is to find the sequence that requires the maximum spacing between characters, which might not be present in s.

But this is also too vague.

Given time constraints, perhaps the provided code's approach is acceptable, with a fix for the missing string construction.

To fix the missing string construction, instead of using the bitmask cur to construct the missing string, perhaps we should find the character that appears the fewest times in s and construct a sequence of that character repeated n times.

So, in the second test case, 'a' appears once, so "aa" is a missing sequence.

In the third test case, 'c' appears twice, so "ccc" is missing.

This seems to work.

Hence, we can modify the code to find the character that appears the fewest times in s, and if its count is less than n, construct a sequence of that character repeated n times.

Otherwise, print 'YES'.

This should be efficient enough, as counting character frequencies can be done in linear time.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, read t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, k, m

- Read s

- Count the frequency of each of the first k characters in s

- Find the character with the minimum frequency among these k characters

- If the minimum frequency is less than n, then:

- Print 'NO'

- Construct the missing string by repeating this character n times

- Else:

- Print 'YES'

This seems straightforward and efficient.

Let's test this logic with the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Frequencies: 'a':1, 'b':2

Minimum frequency is 1, which is less than n=2.

Hence, construct "aa" and print 'NO' and "aa", which matches the expected output.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Frequencies: 'a':4, 'b':4, 'c':2

Minimum frequency is 2, which is less than n=3.

Hence, construct "ccc" and print 'NO' and "ccc", which matches the expected output.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Frequencies: 'a':2, 'b':2

Minimum frequency is 2, which is greater than or equal to n=2.

Hence, print 'YES'

This matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

Therefore, the provided code is incorrect because it uses a flawed approach to count the number of complete sets of k characters and to construct the missing string.

The correct approach is to find the character that appears the fewest times in s among the first k characters, and if it appears fewer than n times, construct a sequence of that character repeated n times.

Otherwise, all sequences are present.

Hence, Correctness: **False**
