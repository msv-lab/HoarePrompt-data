Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of strings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], etc.

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string into substrings, none of which are palindromes. If such a partition exists, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition, and then the partition itself. If no such partition exists, I should output "NO".

Looking at the constraints, there can be up to 10^4 test cases, and each string can be up to 10^6 characters long, with a total sum of |s| across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. So, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably linear time per string.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

sinktheyacht

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

Explanation:

The entire string "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so the single-part partition is valid.

Example 2:

Input:

lllllllll

Output:

NO

Explanation:

Every substring of this string is a palindrome because all characters are 'l'. Therefore, no valid partition exists.

Example 3:

Input:

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

Explanation:

The string is partitioned into "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

From these examples, I can see that if the entire string is not a palindrome, I can simply output the whole string as one part. If it is a palindrome, I need to find a way to split it into substrings that are not palindromes.

But in some cases, like "lllllllll", it's impossible because any substring will be a palindrome since all characters are the same.

So, I need a way to determine whether a given string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

Let me think about the properties of strings that cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings. If a string consists of the same character repeated, like "aaa", then any substring will be a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Similarly, if a string has a structure where every possible substring is a palindrome, then it's impossible. But in practice, this would only happen if all characters are the same.

On the other hand, if there's at least one character that's different from the others, then perhaps I can find a way to partition the string to avoid palindromic substrings.

Let me consider the string "aabaa". If I try to partition it into "a", "abaa", but "a" is a palindrome. So that doesn't work. Alternatively, "aa", "baa", but "aa" is a palindrome. "aab", "aa" – "aa" is a palindrome again. "a", "a", "baa" – all are palindromes. So in this case, it might be impossible.

Wait, but "aabaa" itself is a palindrome, so maybe in general, for palindromic strings, it's impossible to partition them into non-palindrome substrings.

But wait, in the example, "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome, but it can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, having the entire string be a palindrome doesn't necessarily mean it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

So, I need a better approach.

Let me think about the conditions under which a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

If all possible substrings of the string are palindromes, then it's impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

But in reality, for substrings to all be palindromes, the string must consist of the same character repeated, because any two different characters would allow for substrings that are not palindromes.

Wait, for example, in "aaabaaa", the substring "aabaa" is not a palindrome.

Wait, no, "aabaa" is a palindrome.

Wait, "aabaa" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.

But "aab" is not a palindrome.

So, in "aaabaaa", "aab" is not a palindrome.

So, in general, if there's any substring that is not a palindrome, then it's possible to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

Therefore, the only time it's impossible is when every possible substring is a palindrome, which only happens if all characters in the string are the same.

Wait, is that true?

Let me check.

Take "aaa". All substrings are "a", "aa", "aaa", all of which are palindromes.

Take "aaab".

Substrings include "aaa", "aa", "a", "aab", "aab", "ab", "b", etc.

"ab" is not a palindrome.

So, in "aaab", I can partition it into "aaa" and "b", but "aaa" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, "aa", "ab", but "aa" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, "a", "aab", but "a" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, "aaa", "b", but "aaa" is a palindrome.

Wait, but "aab" is not a palindrome.

So, if I partition "aaab" into "aab" and "b", "aab" is not a palindrome, and "b" is a palindrome.

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, so in this case, is there any way to partition "aaab" into non-palindrome substrings?

Let's see:

"aaab" itself is not a palindrome.

So, I can partition it into "aaab", which is not a palindrome.

So, that's a valid partition.

Wait, but "aaab" is not a palindrome because reversing it gives "baaa", which is different from "aaab".

So, in this case, it's valid to output "aaab" as a single part.

So, perhaps, if the entire string is not a palindrome, I can always partition it into the entire string as one part.

But in the earlier example, "aabaa" is a palindrome, so I cannot partition it into the entire string as one part because it's a palindrome.

But actually, "aabaa" is a palindrome, but as shown in the example, it can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", which are not palindromes.

Wait, but "aabaa" is a different string.

Wait, in the example, "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome, and it's partitioned into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, perhaps, for any string that is not a palindrome, I can partition it into the entire string as one part.

For strings that are palindromes, I need to find a way to partition them into substrings that are not palindromes.

But in some cases, like "aaa", it's impossible because any substring is a palindrome.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the entire string is a palindrome, check if it's possible to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes.

- If all substrings are palindromes, which only happens when all characters are the same, then output "NO".

- Otherwise, find a way to partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes.

So, to implement this, I need a function to check if a string is a palindrome.

Then, for each test case:

1. Check if the entire string is a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES" and the string as a single part.

- If it is a palindrome, proceed to step 2.

2. Check if all characters in the string are the same.

- If yes, output "NO".

- If not, find a way to partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes.

For step 2, if the string is a palindrome but not all characters are the same, I need to find a way to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes.

One way to do this is to find a substring that is not a palindrome and partition the string accordingly.

But I need to ensure that all parts of the partition are not palindromes.

Let me think about this.

Suppose the string is a palindrome, and it's not composed of all identical characters.

Then, there must be at least two different characters in the string.

Let's say there is a character at position i that is different from the first character.

Since the string is a palindrome, the character at position n - i - 1 is also different from the first character, where n is the length of the string.

Wait, no. Because the string is a palindrome, the character at position i is equal to the character at position n - i - 1.

So, if s[i] != s[0], then s[n - i - 1] != s[0] as well.

But since the string is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n - i - 1].

So, if s[i] != s[0], then s[n - i - 1] != s[0] as well.

Wait, perhaps I can try to partition the string at positions where s[i] != s[0].

Let me consider an example.

Take "abba", which is a palindrome.

s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b' != s[0], s[2] = 'b' != s[0], s[3] = 'a' == s[0].

So, positions where s[i] != s[0] are i=1 and i=2.

Now, if I partition the string into s[0:i+1] and s[i+1:], where i is the first position where s[i] != s[0].

So, for i=1, partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:] = "ba".

Check if both are not palindromes.

"ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, this is a valid partition.

Another example: "aabbaa".

s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'a', s[2] = 'b' != s[0].

So, i=2.

Partition into s[0:3] = "aab" and s[3:] = "bbaa".

Check if both are not palindromes.

"aab" is not a palindrome, "bbaa" is not a palindrome.

So, valid partition.

Another example: "abcba".

s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b' != s[0].

So, i=1.

Partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:] = "cba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

Valid partition.

Another example: "aaa".

s[0] = 'a', all s[i] == 'a'.

So, no i where s[i] != s[0].

Hence, output "NO", which is correct because all substrings are palindromes.

Another example: "aabaa".

s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'a', s[2] = 'b' != s[0].

So, i=2.

Partition into s[0:3] = "aab" and s[3:] = "baa".

"aab" is not a palindrome, "baa" is not a palindrome.

Valid partition.

Another example: "ababa".

s[0] = 'a', s[1] = 'b' != s[0].

So, i=1.

Partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:] = "aba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, but "aba" is a palindrome.

So, this partition is invalid.

Wait, so in this case, partitioning at the first i where s[i] != s[0] leads to a partition where one part is a palindrome.

So, this approach doesn't always work.

Wait, but according to the earlier examples, it worked.

In "abba", it worked.

In "aabbaa", it worked.

In "abcba", it worked.

In "aabaa", it worked.

But in "ababa", it doesn't work.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Alternative approach:

If the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, then there must be at least two positions where s[i] != s[0].

Let's find the smallest such i.

In "ababa", s[1] = 'b' != 'a', so i=1.

Partition into s[0:i+1] = "aba" and s[i+1:] = "aba".

But "aba" is a palindrome, so this partition is invalid.

Alternative partition: partition into more parts.

For example, partition "ababa" into "ab", "aba", "ba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "aba" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, this partition is invalid.

Alternatively, partition into "ab", "ab", "a".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

Alternatively, partition into "aba", "ba".

"aba" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, partition into "a", "baba".

"a" is a palindrome, "baba" is not a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, partition into "ab", "aba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "aba" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, partition into "aba", "ba".

Same as above.

Seems like no matter how I partition "ababa", I can't get all parts to be non-palindromes.

So, is "ababa" an exception, or is it generally impossible for some palindromic strings?

Wait, but in the example, "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome, and it can be partitioned into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

So, perhaps there are ways to partition some palindromic strings into non-palindrome substrings.

But in the case of "ababa", it seems impossible.

Wait, let's try partitioning "ababa" into "ab", "a", "ba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, "aba", "ba".

"aba" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, "ab", "aba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "aba" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, "a", "baba".

"a" is a palindrome, "baba" is not a palindrome.

Invalid.

Alternatively, "aba", "ba".

Same as above.

Seems like no valid partition exists for "ababa".

But why does it work for "uwuowouwu"?

Let's see "uwuowouwu".

It's a palindrome.

s[0] = 'u', s[1] = 'w' != 'u', so i=1.

Partition into s[0:2] = "uw" and s[2:] = "uowouwu".

"uw" is not a palindrome, "uowouwu" is a palindrome.

So, this partition is invalid because "uowouwu" is a palindrome.

But in the example, it's partitioned into "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

Let's check:

"uw" is not a palindrome, "uow" is not a palindrome, "ouwu" is not a palindrome.

So, this seems valid.

How did they achieve this?

Maybe by partitioning in such a way that neither part is a palindrome.

So, in general, for palindromic strings that aren't composed of identical characters, it might be possible to partition them into non-palindrome substrings, but it's not always straightforward.

So, perhaps a general approach is:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the entire string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, output "NO".

- If the entire string is a palindrome but not all characters are the same, try to partition it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- If that's not possible, try partitioning into more parts.

But this seems inefficient, and I need an efficient solution given the constraints.

Let me think about how to check if a string can be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings.

First, if the string is not a palindrome, I can output it as a single part.

If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to find a way to partition it into substrings that are not palindromes.

To make it efficient, I need a way to decide how to partition the string without checking all possible partitions.

One idea is:

- Find the smallest prefix that is not a palindrome.

- Then, the remaining suffix might or might not be a palindrome.

- If the suffix is not a palindrome, then partitioning into that prefix and the suffix would work.

- If the suffix is a palindrome, then try to further partition the suffix.

But this might not always work.

Let's try with "ababa".

Find the smallest prefix that is not a palindrome.

"ab" is not a palindrome.

Then, the suffix is "aba", which is a palindrome.

So, partitioning into "ab" and "aba" is invalid because "aba" is a palindrome.

Then, further partition "aba" into "ab" and "a".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

Alternatively, partition "aba" into "a", "b", "a".

All are palindromes.

Invalid.

So, seems like no valid partition exists for "ababa".

Another approach:

If the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, find two substrings that are not palindromes.

To do this, find a prefix that is not a palindrome and a suffix that is not a palindrome.

If the intersection of these two is the entire string, then it's possible.

Wait, maybe not the right way.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a palindromic string that is not composed of identical characters.

I can find at least one position where the character is different from the first character.

Let's say s[i] != s[0].

Since it's a palindrome, s[n - i - 1] != s[0] as well.

Now, if I partition the string into s[0:i+1] and s[i+1:], and check if both parts are not palindromes.

If s[0:i+1] is not a palindrome and s[i+1:] is not a palindrome, then this partition is valid.

If s[i+1:] is a palindrome, then this partition is invalid.

In such cases, perhaps I can further partition s[i+1:].

But this might lead to multiple partitions.

To keep it simple, maybe I can choose a larger prefix to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

For example, in "ababa", if I choose i=1, s[0:2] = "ab", which is not a palindrome, and s[2:] = "aba", which is a palindrome.

So, this partition is invalid.

Alternatively, choose a larger prefix, say s[0:3] = "aba", which is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Or s[0:4] = "abab", which is not a palindrome, and s[4:] = "a", which is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

So, seems like no matter how I partition "ababa" into two parts, one of them is a palindrome.

Therefore, I need to partition it into more than two parts.

But as shown earlier, even with three parts, it's not possible to have all parts non-palindromes.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

But for "uwuowouwu", it's possible.

So, perhaps there's no general rule, and I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for strings that are palindromes and not composed of identical characters, if their length is greater than 2, and they have at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then it might be possible to partition them into non-palindrome substrings.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative idea is to always partition the string into two parts: a prefix and a suffix, where the prefix is the smallest possible non-palindrome.

But as shown in "ababa", this might not work.

Another idea is to partition the string into three parts.

But this might not be efficient, considering the time constraints.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

The program is:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func\_2()

def func\_1(s) -> bool:

return s == s[::-1]

def func\_2():

s = input()

(n, x) = (len(s), -1)

if func\_1(s[0:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(s)

return

for i in range(1, n):

if s[i] != s[0]:

x = i

break

if x == -1:

print('NO')

return

if func\_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])

elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])

So, let's analyze this.

First, it defines func\_1 to check if a string is a palindrome.

Then, func\_2 handles each test case.

It reads the string s and its length n.

It checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If so, it outputs "YES", 1, and the string itself.

If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first position x where s[x] != s[0].

If no such position exists, it means all characters are the same, so it outputs "NO".

If such a position exists, it checks if s[x + 1:] is not a palindrome.

- If s[x + 1:] is not a palindrome, it partitions the string into s[0:x + 1] and s[x + 1:], outputs "YES", 2, and these two parts.

- If s[x + 1:] is a palindrome, it checks if x == 1 or x == n // 2.

- If so, it outputs "NO".

- Otherwise, it partitions the string into s[0:x + 2] and s[x + 2:], outputs "YES", 2, and these two parts.

So, this approach tries to partition the string into two parts:

1. s[0:x + 1] and s[x + 1:], where x is the first position where s[x] != s[0].

2. If s[x + 1:] is a palindrome, it tries s[0:x + 2] and s[x + 2:].

And if x == 1 or x == n // 2, it outputs "NO".

Let's test this approach with some examples.

Example 1:

s = "sinktheyacht"

This is not a palindrome, so it outputs "YES", 1, "sinktheyacht".

Correct, as shown in the example.

Example 2:

s = "lllllllll"

All characters are 'l', so it's a palindrome and x = -1, outputs "NO".

Correct, as shown in the example.

Example 3:

s = "uwuowouwu"

This is a palindrome.

s[0] = 'u', s[1] = 'w' != 'u', so x = 1.

Then, s[x + 1:] = s[2:] = "uowouwu", which is a palindrome.

So, it checks if x == 1 or x == n // 2.

x = 1 and n = 9, n // 2 = 4.

So, x != n // 2, so it partitions into s[0:x + 2] = s[0:3] = "uwu" and s[3:] = "owouwu".

But "uwu" is a palindrome, so this partition is invalid.

But according to the program, it would output "YES", 2, "uwu" and "owouwu", which is incorrect because "uwu" is a palindrome.

Wait, but in the example, it outputs "YES", 3, "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

So, the program's output is different from the example.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, let's see what the program does.

s = "uwuowouwu"

x = 1 (first i where s[i] != s[0])

s[x + 1:] = s[2:] = "uowouwu", which is a palindrome.

x == 1, which is true, so it outputs "NO".

But in the example, it's supposed to output "YES", 3, "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

So, the program seems to output "NO" in this case, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the condition.

Looking back at the program:

if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])

elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])

In the case of s = "uwuowouwu":

x = 1

s[x + 1:] = s[2:] = "uowouwu", which is a palindrome, so func_1(s[x + 1:]) == True.

Then, it checks if x == 1 or x == n // 2.

x == 1 is True, so it outputs "NO".

But according to the example, it should output "YES", 3, "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

So, the program seems to be incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
