Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about a game on a checkered board where Alice and Bob are moving their chips based on specific rules, and I need to determine who wins or if it's a draw when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game setup. The board has h rows and w columns. Alice starts at (x_a, y_a) and Bob at (x_b, y_b). Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left, while Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left. They take turns, with Alice starting first.

The goal for each player is to land on the opponent's chip to win. If a player can't make a move—Alice if she's in the last row, Bob if he's in the first row—it's a draw.

Given multiple test cases, I need to output "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" for each case.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to handle the logic based on the row differences between Alice and Bob. Let's break it down step by step.

The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

For each test case, it reads six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b.

The first condition checks if Alice's row is greater than Bob's row (`if a > c:`). If so, it prints "Draw". This makes sense because Alice is already below Bob, and since Alice can only move down and Bob up, their paths won't cross.

If Alice's row is not greater than Bob's row, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between their rows, using integer division (`x = abs(a - c) // 2`).

Then, it checks if the difference in rows is odd or even.

If the difference is odd (`if abs(a - c) % 2:`), it calculates the possible range for Bob's column after `x` moves. It sets `l` to the maximum of 1 or `d - x` and `r` to the minimum of `w` or `d + x`. Then, it checks if Alice can reach within this range in `x + 1` moves. If both left and right boundaries are within Alice's reach, it's Alice's win; otherwise, it's a draw.

If the difference is even, it calculates the range for Alice's column after `x` moves and checks if Bob can reach within that range in `x` moves. If both boundaries are within Bob's reach, it's Bob's win; otherwise, it's a draw.

This logic seems to be based on the number of moves each player can make and whether they can intersect within those moves.

Let me think about the game mechanics to verify this approach.

Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left, which means she increases her row by 1 each move and can adjust her column by -1, 0, or +1.

Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left, decreasing his row by 1 each move and can adjust his column similarly.

The key is to see if their paths can cross before Alice reaches the bottom or Bob reaches the top.

The provided code seems to calculate the number of moves Alice and Bob can make towards each other and then checks if their column positions can overlap within those moves.

The condition `if a > c:` correctly identifies that if Alice is already below Bob, they can't meet, resulting in a draw.

For other cases, calculating `x` as half the row difference seems logical because each player moves towards each other, reducing the row difference by 1 or 2 per two moves (one by each player).

The odd and even checks make sense because the number of moves affects who makes the last move.

If the row difference is odd, Alice has one more move than Bob, since she starts first. So, she can adjust her column position one more time, giving her an advantage in reaching Bob's column.

Similarly, if the difference is even, Bob has the same number of moves as Alice, so he can try to intercept Alice.

The calculations for `l` and `r` seem to determine the possible column range each player can reach after their moves.

However, I need to ensure that these calculations accurately reflect the possible column positions after the specified number of moves.

Let's consider that each move can change the column by at most 1. So, in `x` moves, a player can move up to `x` columns to the left or right.

Hence, `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)` correctly define the range Bob can reach in `x` moves.

Similarly, for Alice, `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)` define her reachable range in `x` moves.

Now, the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` checks if Alice can reach both ends of Bob's range in `x + 1` moves. If yes, Alice can intercept Bob, so it's Alice's win; else, it's a draw.

Similarly, for even differences, it checks if Bob can reach both ends of Alice's range in `x` moves, deciding Bob's win or a draw.

This seems logically sound, but to be thorough, let's consider some test cases.

Take the first test case from the example:

6 5 2 2 5 3

Here, h=6, w=5, Alice at (2,2), Bob at (5,3).

Difference in rows: 5 - 2 = 3 (odd).

x = 3 // 2 = 1.

So, l = max(1, 3 - 1) = 2, r = min(5, 3 + 1) = 4.

Check if abs(2 - 2) <= 2 and abs(4 - 2) <= 2, which is 0 <= 2 and 2 <= 2, both true. So, Alice wins.

Which matches the expected output "Alice".

Another test case:

4 1 2 1 4 1

h=4, w=1, Alice at (2,1), Bob at (4,1).

Difference: 4 - 2 = 2 (even).

x = 2 // 2 = 1.

l = max(1,1-1)=1, r = min(1,1+1)=1.

Check if abs(1 -1) <=1 and abs(1 -1) <=1, which is 0 <=1 and 0 <=1, true. So, Bob wins.

But according to the sample output, it's "Bob".

Wait, but in the code, for even differences, it's printing "Bob" if the conditions are met.

Wait, but in the code, it's `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])`

So, for this case, it should print "Bob", which matches the sample.

Another test case:

1 4 1 3 1 1

h=1, w=4, Alice at (1,3), Bob at (1,1).

Since h=1, Alice can't move, it's a draw.

But according to the code, a > c is not applicable here since a=1, c=1, which is a <= c.

But in this case, a = c =1, so a >= c, but the condition is a > c.

So, a=1, c=1, a > c is False, so it goes to the else clause.

x = abs(1-1)//2 =0

Difference is even, so l=max(1,3-0)=1, r=min(4,3+0)=3.

Check if abs(1-1)<=0 and abs(3-1)<=0, which is 0<=0 and 2<=0, which is False.

So, it's a draw, which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

Let me consider a case where Alice is above Bob, and their row difference is even.

For example:

h=5, w=5, a=1, b=4, c=5, d=2.

Difference:5-1=4, even.

x=4//2=2.

l=max(1,4-2)=2, r=min(5,4+2)=5.

Check if abs(2-2)<=2 and abs(5-2)<=2, which is 0<=2 and 3<=2.

3 >2, so False, Draw.

Which matches the sample output "Draw".

Another case:

h=4, w=4, a=1, b=1, c=4, d=4.

Difference:4-1=3, odd.

x=3//2=1.

l=max(1,4-1)=3, r=min(4,4+1)=4.

Check if abs(3-1)<=2 and abs(4-1)<=2, which is 2<=2 and 3<=2.

3>2, so False, Draw.

Which matches the sample "Draw".

One more:

h=10, w=10, a=1, b=6, c=10, d=8.

Difference:10-1=9, odd.

x=9//2=4.

l=max(1,8-4)=4, r=min(10,8+4)=10.

Check if abs(4-6)<=5 and abs(10-6)<=5, which is 2<=5 and 4<=5, both True, so Alice wins.

Which matches the sample "Alice".

Seems consistent.

Looking back at the code, it seems to handle the cases correctly based on the row differences and the possible column movements.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{Alice}}
