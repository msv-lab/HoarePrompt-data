Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they're playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum would be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what's being asked. For each test case, I get n, which is the number of elements in the array, k, which is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and x, which is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. Then, there's the array itself, consisting of positive integers.

The goal is to find the sum of the array after both players have done their operations, assuming they both play optimally.

Let's think about this step by step.

First, Alice gets to remove up to k elements. She wants to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements, right? Because removing smaller elements will leave larger elements in the array, which is good for the sum.

Wait, but Bob will then multiply up to x elements by -1, and he wants to minimize the sum. So, he will choose to multiply the largest positive elements by -1 to reduce the sum as much as possible.

But Alice knows that Bob will do this, so maybe she needs to strategize differently.

Hmm.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first test case from the example:

1

1 1 1

1

So, n=1, k=1, x=1, and the array is [1].

Alice can remove up to 1 element, which is the only element, so she removes it. Then, Bob has no elements left to multiply by -1, so the sum is 0. That makes sense.

Second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Alice can remove up to 1 element. To maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest element, which is 1. So, the array becomes [3,2,4]. Then, Bob can multiply up to 1 element by -1. To minimize the sum, he should multiply the largest element by -1, which is 4 becomes -4. So, the array is [3,2,-4], and the sum is 1.

But according to the sample output, it's 2. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the explanation, it says that in the second test case, it's optimal for Alice to not remove any elements. So, the array remains [3,1,2,4]. Bob then multiplies the largest element, 4, by -1, making it -4. So, the sum is 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

That's less than what I got earlier when Alice removed the smallest element. So, apparently, it's better for Alice not to remove any elements in this case.

Interesting. So, sometimes it's better for Alice to remove elements, and sometimes not.

I need to find a general strategy.

Let me think about sorting the array.

If I sort the array in ascending order, the smallest elements are first, and the largest are last.

Alice can remove up to k elements, which would be the smallest k elements to maximize the sum.

But Bob can then multiply up to x of the remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

So, to optimize, Alice needs to consider how Bob will react to her removal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the remaining elements after Alice's removal.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, say the smallest k elements. Then, Bob will multiply the largest x remaining elements by -1.

So, the sum would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the top x remaining elements (because multiplying by -1 subtracts twice the value from the sum).

Wait, that makes sense.

Let me formalize this.

Letâ€™s sort the array in ascending order.

If Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining array is elements[k:n].

Then, Bob will multiply the largest x elements among these remaining elements by -1.

So, the sum would be sum(elements[k:n]) - 2 * sum(elements[n-x-k:n-k]).

Wait, no.

Wait, elements[k:n] are sorted in ascending order, so the largest x elements are elements[n-k-x:n-k].

Wait, I'm getting confused with the indices.

Let me think differently.

After Alice removes k elements, the remaining elements are elements[k:n], sorted in ascending order.

Bob will multiply the x largest remaining elements by -1, which are elements[n-x-k:n-k].

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the entire array.

Let me try to generalize.

Suppose Alice removes k elements, specifically the smallest k elements.

Then, the remaining array is elements[k:n], sorted ascending.

Bob will multiply the largest x remaining elements by -1, which are elements[n-k-x:n-k].

So, the sum would be sum(elements[k:n]) - 2 * sum(elements[n-k-x:n-k]).

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, if Alice removes a different set of k elements, but since the array is sorted, removing the smallest k makes sense.

Wait, but in the second test case, it was better for Alice not to remove any elements.

So, perhaps I need to consider different possibilities and choose the best one for Alice.

Alice can choose to remove any number from 0 to k elements.

For each possible number of elements removed, from 0 to k, calculate the sum after Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1.

Then, choose the option that gives the maximum sum.

That seems like a solid approach.

Let me try to formalize this.

Given a sorted array in ascending order, for each i from 0 to k:

- Remove the smallest i elements.

- The remaining array is elements[i:n].

- Bob will multiply the largest x elements by -1, which are elements[n-x-i:n-i].

- So, the sum would be sum(elements[i:n]) - 2 * sum(elements[n-x-i:n-i]).

Then, Alice chooses the i that maximizes this sum.

Yes, that makes sense.

Let me verify this with the second test case.

n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: [1,2,3,4]

Option 1: i=0, remove 0 elements.

Sum = sum([1,2,3,4]) - 2 * sum([4]) = 10 - 8 = 2.

Option 2: i=1, remove the smallest 1 element.

Sum = sum([2,3,4]) - 2 * sum([4]) = 9 - 8 = 1.

So, Alice chooses i=0, sum=2, which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

n=1, k=1, x=1

Array: [1]

Option 1: i=0, remove 0 elements.

Sum = sum([1]) - 2 * sum([1]) = 1 - 2 = -1.

Option 2: i=1, remove the only element.

Sum = 0.

Alice chooses the maximum, which is 0.

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, in the sample input, it's 1 1 1 followed by 1, and the output is 0.

Yes.

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently, considering that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5.

So, I need an O(n log n) solution per test case, which should be acceptable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, x.

b. Read the array of n integers.

c. Sort the array in ascending order.

d. Initialize a variable to store the maximum sum, say max_sum = -infinity.

e. For i in 0 to k:

i. Calculate the sum of elements from i to n-1: sum_a = sum(elements[i:n]).

ii. Calculate the sum of the largest x elements among the remaining elements:

if n - i >= x:

sum_b = sum(elements[n - x - i:n - i])

else:

sum_b = sum(elements[i:n])

But wait, need to be careful with the indices.

Actually, elements[n - x - i:n - i] would be the largest x elements if i elements are removed.

But need to ensure that n - i >= x, otherwise, sum_b is sum(elements[i:n]).

Wait, no.

If n - i < x, then Bob can multiply all remaining elements by -1.

So, sum_b = sum(elements[i:n]).

Else, sum_b = sum(elements[n - x - i:n - i]).

Then, the sum would be sum_a - 2 * sum_b.

Then, take the maximum over all i from 0 to k.

Finally, print the maximum sum.

Wait, but in the first test case, with n=1, k=1, x=1, array=[1]:

- Option i=0: sum_a = 1, sum_b = 1, sum = 1 - 2*1 = -1.

- Option i=1: sum_a = 0, sum_b = 0, sum = 0.

Maximum is 0.

Which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, n=4, k=1, x=1, array=[3,1,2,4]:

- Sorted array: [1,2,3,4]

- Option i=0: sum_a = 1+2+3+4=10, sum_b = 4, sum=10-8=2.

- Option i=1: sum_a = 2+3+4=9, sum_b=4, sum=9-8=1.

Maximum is 2.

Correct.

Another test case:

n=6, k=6, x=3

Array: [1,4,3,2,5,6]

Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Options:

i=0: sum_a=21, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=21-30=-9.

i=1: sum_a=20, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=5.

i=2: sum_a=18, sum_b=6+5=11, sum=18-22=-4.

i=3: sum_a=15, sum_b=6+5=11, sum=15-22=-7.

i=4: sum_a=11, sum_b=6, sum=11-12=-1.

i=5: sum_a=6, sum_b=6, sum=0.

i=6: sum_a=0, sum_b=0, sum=0.

Maximum is 5.

But according to the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, n=6, k=6, x=3

Array: [1,4,3,2,5,6]

Sorted: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Options:

i=0: sum_a=21, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=21-30=-9.

i=1: sum_a=20, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=20-30=-10.

Wait, different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the sample output, for this test case, it's 0.

But according to my calculation, the maximum is -9.

Wait, maybe I need to double-check.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if i >= n - x, then sum_b is sum(elements[i:n]).

Wait, in this case, n=6, x=3.

For i=0 to 6.

i=0: sum_a=21, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=21-30=-9.

i=1: sum_a=20, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=20-30=-10.

i=2: sum_a=18, sum_b=6+5+4=15, sum=18-30=-12.

i=3: sum_a=15, sum_b=6+5=11, sum=15-22=-7.

i=4: sum_a=11, sum_b=6+5=11, sum=11-22=-11.

i=5: sum_a=6, sum_b=6, sum=6-12=-6.

i=6: sum_a=0, sum_b=0, sum=0.

So, the maximum is 0.

Ah, I see. I miscalculated earlier for i=1: sum_a=20 - 2*15 = -10, but actually, for i=1, sum_b is still 15.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 0, which corresponds to i=6.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 0, but according to the sample input, it's 6 6 3, array [1,4,3,2,5,6], and the output is 0.

But according to my calculation, the maximum is 0 when i=6.

So, Alice removes all 6 elements, sum is 0.

Bob has no elements to multiply by -1.

Hence, sum is 0.

But earlier, I thought that Alice would want to maximize the sum, so removing all elements gives sum 0, which is better than negative sums.

Yes, in this case, it's better for Alice to remove all elements to get sum 0, rather than leaving some elements and getting a negative sum.

So, in this case, the answer is 0.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, in implementation, I need to consider i from 0 to k, and choose the maximum sum.

Now, to optimize, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient implementation.

I can sort the array in O(n log n) time, and then compute the sums efficiently.

To compute sum_a and sum_b for each i, I can precompute prefix sums.

Let me define prefix[i] = sum of elements from 0 to i-1.

So, sum_a[i] = sum from i to n-1 = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

And sum_b[i]:

if n - i >= x, sum_b[i] = sum from n - x - i to n - i - 1.

Wait, need to be careful with indices.

Let me think differently.

After sorting in ascending order, elements[0] to elements[n-1].

After removing i smallest elements, remaining elements are elements[i:n].

Among these, the largest x elements are elements[n - x - i:n - i].

So, sum_b[i] = sum(elements[n - x - i:n - i]) if n - i >= x, else sum(elements[i:n]).

Wait, no, if n - i < x, then Bob can multiply all remaining elements by -1.

So, sum_b[i] = sum(elements[i:n]).

Else, sum_b[i] = sum(elements[n - x - i:n - i]).

Hence, sum for i is sum_a[i] - 2 * sum_b[i].

I can precompute prefix sums to compute these sums quickly.

Let me define prefix[i] = sum of elements[0 to i-1].

Then, sum_a[i] = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

If n - i >= x, sum_b[i] = prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i].

Else, sum_b[i] = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

Hence, sum for i = sum_a[i] - 2 * sum_b[i].

I need to compute this for each i from 0 to k, and take the maximum.

Edge cases:

- If k >= n, Alice can remove all elements, sum is 0.

- If x >= n - i, Bob can multiply all remaining elements by -1, sum is sum_a[i] - 2 * sum_a[i] = -sum_a[i].

- If x = 0, Bob cannot multiply any elements by -1, sum is sum_a[i].

I need to handle these cases correctly.

Also, need to make sure that indices don't go negative.

For example, when computing sum_b[i] = prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i], need to ensure that n - x - i >= 0.

Otherwise, sum_b[i] = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

Wait, no.

If n - i >= x, sum_b[i] = sum(elements[n - x - i:n - i]) = prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i].

Else, sum_b[i] = sum(elements[i:n]) = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

Need to ensure that n - x - i >= 0.

If n - x - i < 0, then sum_b[i] = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

Else, sum_b[i] = prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i].

Yes, that's correct.

Implementation steps:

1. Read t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, k, x.

b. Read the array of n elements.

c. Sort the array in ascending order.

d. Compute prefix sums: prefix[0] = 0, prefix[1] = elements[0], prefix[2] = elements[0] + elements[1], ..., prefix[n] = sum of all elements.

e. Initialize max_sum = -infinity.

f. For i in 0 to k:

i. sum_a = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

ii. if n - i >= x and n - x - i >= 0:

sum_b = prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i].

else:

sum_b = prefix[n] - prefix[i].

iii. current_sum = sum_a - 2 * sum_b.

iv. if current_sum > max_sum:

max_sum = current_sum.

g. Print max_sum.

Need to handle cases where n - x - i < 0 properly.

Let me try to implement this logic in code.

But first, let's see if this matches the sample inputs.

First test case:

1

1 1 1

1

Sorted array: [1]

prefix: [0,1]

For i=0:

sum_a = 1 - 0 = 1

sum_b = since n - i = 1 >= x=1, and n - x - i = 0 >=0, sum_b = prefix[1] - prefix[0] = 1 - 0 =1

sum = 1 - 2*1 = -1

For i=1:

sum_a = 1 - 1 =0

sum_b = 0

sum =0

Max sum is 0.

Matches sample output.

Second test case:

4 1 1

1 2 3 4

Sorted: [1,2,3,4]

prefix: [0,1,3,6,10]

For i=0:

sum_a =10 -0=10

sum_b = since n - i =4 >=x=1, and n - x -i=3 >=0, sum_b=prefix[4]-prefix[3]=10-6=4

sum=10-8=2

For i=1:

sum_a=10-1=9

sum_b=prefix[3]-prefix[2]=6-3=3

sum=9-6=3

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, it should be sum_b=4.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the indices.

Wait, n=4, x=1, i=0:

sum_b = prefix[4 - 0] - prefix[4 -1 -0] = prefix[4] - prefix[3] =10-6=4

Yes.

For i=1:

sum_b = prefix[4 -1] - prefix[4 -1 -1] = prefix[3] - prefix[2] =6-3=3

But according to earlier logic, Bob can multiply up to x=1 elements, which should be the largest remaining element, which is 4.

Wait, but according to this, sum_b=3 for i=1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I have an error in the implementation.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me double-check.

After removing i=1 elements, remaining elements are [2,3,4]

The largest x=1 element is 4.

So, sum_b should be 4.

But according to the formula, sum_b = prefix[4 -1] - prefix[4 -1 -1] = prefix[3] - prefix[2] =6-3=3

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, elements are [1,2,3,4]

After removing 1 element, [2,3,4]

Sum_b should be the largest x=1 element, which is 4.

But prefix[3] - prefix[2] =2+3+4 - (2+3)=4, wait, no, prefix[3]=6, prefix[2]=3, 6-3=3, which is 2+3+4 - (2+3)=4.

Wait, no, prefix[3]=2+3+4=9 in this case?

Wait, no, wait, I think I messed up the prefix definition.

Let me define prefix[i] as sum of the first i elements.

So, prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=1

prefix[2]=1+2=3

prefix[3]=1+2+3=6

prefix[4]=1+2+3+4=10

Then, for i=1:

sum_a = prefix[4] - prefix[1] =10 -1=9

sum_b = since n -i=3 >=x=1, and n -x -i=4-1-1=2 >=0, sum_b=prefix[3]-prefix[2]=6-3=3

But the largest x=1 element is 4, so sum_b should be 4.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

I think I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps sum_b should be sum of the largest x elements among the remaining elements.

After removing i elements, the remaining elements are elements[i:n].

The largest x elements among these are elements[n - x - i:n - i].

But in terms of prefix sums, sum_b should be prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i]

But in this case, elements[1:4]=[2,3,4], sum_b should be 4.

But prefix[3] - prefix[2]=6-3=3, which is 2+3+4 - (2+3)=4.

Wait, 2+3+4 - (2+3)=4, yes, that's correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, sum_b=4, sum_a=9, sum=9-8=1.

Wait, but according to earlier manual calculation, it was sum=1.

Yes, in the second test case, the sum is 2 when i=0 and 1 when i=1.

Hence, maximum is 2.

So, the formula seems correct.

I must have miscalculated the prefix sums earlier.

Yes, with prefix[0]=0, prefix[1]=1, prefix[2]=3, prefix[3]=6, prefix[4]=10.

For i=1:

sum_a=10 -1=9

sum_b=prefix[3]-prefix[2]=6-3=3

sum=9-6=3

Wait, but earlier I thought sum_b should be 4.

Wait, no, sum_b is sum of the largest x elements, which is 4.

But according to prefix[3]-prefix[2]=6-3=3, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps sum_b should be sum of the largest x elements, which are the last x elements in the sorted list.

After removing i smallest elements, the remaining list is elements[i:n], sorted ascending.

The largest x elements are elements[n - x - i:n - i].

But in terms of prefix sums, prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i] gives the sum of elements[n - x - i:n - i].

In the second test case, for i=1:

n=4, x=1

sum_b=prefix[3] - prefix[2]=6-3=3, but the largest x=1 element is 4.

Wait, but elements[2:3]=[4], sum=4.

Wait, but prefix[3]-prefix[2]=4, which is correct.

Earlier, I thought it was 3, but no, prefix[3]=6, prefix[2]=3, difference is 3, but elements[2:3]=[4], sum=4.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps my prefix sum is incorrect.

Wait, elements=[1,2,3,4]

prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=1

prefix[2]=1+2=3

prefix[3]=1+2+3=6

prefix[4]=1+2+3+4=10

Then, elements[2:3]=[3], sum=3.

Wait, no, indices are zero-based.

Wait, maybe I need to redefine prefix sums.

Let me define prefix[i] as sum of elements[0 to i-1].

So, prefix[0]=0

prefix[1]=elements[0]=1

prefix[2]=elements[0]+elements[1]=1+2=3

prefix[3]=elements[0]+elements[1]+elements[2]=1+2+3=6

prefix[4]=elements[0]+elements[1]+elements[2]+elements[3]=10

Then, elements[i:n] is from i to n-1.

Sum_a = sum(elements[i:n]) = prefix[n] - prefix[i]

Sum_b = sum of the largest x elements among elements[i:n]

Which are the last x elements in the sorted list, i.e., elements[n - x - i:n - i]

Wait, no.

Wait, elements[i:n] are in ascending order, so the largest x elements are elements[n - x - i:n - i]

But in terms of prefix sums, sum_b = prefix[n - i] - prefix[n - x - i]

But in the second test case, for i=1:

n=4, x=1

sum_b = prefix[3] - prefix[2]=6-3=3

But elements[2:3]=[3], sum=3, but the largest x=1 element should be 4.

Wait, elements[i:n]=[2,3,4], largest x=1 element is 4.
