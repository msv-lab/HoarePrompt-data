Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where me and the computer take turns placing rooks, but we have to make sure that no two rooks attack each other. That means no two rooks can be in the same row or column.

I start first by placing a white rook at some position (r, c), and then the computer places a black rook at (c, r). But there's a catch: if r equals c, meaning the position is on the diagonal, the computer can't mirror my move and skips its turn. Got it.

We've already played k moves, and the computer has mirrored them accordingly, and it's guaranteed that these moves are valid. Now, I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible from this point onward, until no more moves can be made. And since the number can be large, I have to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a valid move. A valid move is placing a rook in a position where it doesn't share its row or column with any other rook, regardless of color.

Given that, I need to continue playing until no more valid moves are possible. Since it's a game of perfect information and both players are placing rooks optimally (in a sense, just following the rules without trying to maximize or minimize anything), I need to find out all possible ways the game can proceed from the current state.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

4 1

1 2

8 1

7 6

1000 4

4 4

952 343

222 333

90 91

Output:

3

331

671968183

So for n=4 and k=1 with move (1,2), there are 3 possible final configurations.

I need to figure out a way to generalize this for any n and k, given the constraints.

Let's think about the state of the board after k moves have been made, including the computer's mirrored moves.

Each move I make at (r,c) blocks row r and column c for future moves. Similarly, the computer's move at (c,r) blocks row c and column r.

So, for each move I make, two positions are blocked: one for the row and column I placed my rook, and another for the computer's mirror move.

But if r == c, meaning the move is on the diagonal, the computer skips its turn, so only one position is blocked in that case.

Wait, no. According to the problem, if r = c, the computer can't mirror my move and skips its turn. So, only my move is applied, blocking one row and one column.

Otherwise, both my move and the computer's mirror move block two rows and two columns in total.

Wait, but in the mirror move, the computer places a rook at (c,r), which blocks row c and column r.

So, in total, for each of my moves:

- If r != c, then:

- My move at (r,c) blocks row r and column c.

- Computer's move at (c,r) blocks row c and column r.

- So, rows r and c are both blocked, and columns r and c are both blocked.

- Essentially, rows and columns r and c are fully blocked.

- If r == c, then:

- Only my move at (r,r) blocks row r and column r.

- Computer skips its turn.

- So, only row r and column r are blocked.

Wait, but in this case, since it's a rook, placing it on (r,r) blocks the entire row r and the entire column r.

But in the mirror move, placing at (c,r) would be (r,r), which is the same as my move, but according to the problem, if r == c, the computer skips its turn.

So, if r != c, then my move at (r,c) and computer's move at (c,r) block rows r and c, and columns r and c.

If r == c, only my move at (r,r) blocks row r and column r, and computer skips.

So, in terms of blocked rows and columns, for each pair of moves where r != c, we block two rows and two columns.

For each move where r == c, we block one row and one column, and the computer skips.

But wait, in terms of blocking, since rooks attack along rows and columns, placing a rook at (r,c) blocks the entire row r and the entire column c.

So, if I place a rook at (r,c), no more rooks can be placed in row r or column c.

Similarly, if the computer places a rook at (c,r), that blocks row c and column r.

So, in total, after my move at (r,c) and computer's move at (c,r), rows r and c are fully blocked, and columns r and c are fully blocked.

Wait, but actually, placing a rook at (r,c) blocks row r and column c, and placing a rook at (c,r) blocks row c and column r.

So, in total, row r and column c are blocked by my move, and row c and column r are blocked by the computer's move.

So, rows r and c are both blocked, and columns r and c are both blocked.

Wait, but in terms of placing future rooks, if a row or column is blocked, no more rooks can be placed in that row or column.

So, effectively, after my move at (r,c) and computer's move at (c,r), rows r and c are fully blocked, and columns r and c are fully blocked.

But actually, since placing a rook in a row blocks the entire row, and placing in a column blocks the entire column, the combination of my move and the computer's move blocks rows r and c, and columns r and c.

However, if r == c, only my move at (r,r) blocks row r and column r, and the computer skips.

So, in that case, only row r and column r are blocked.

So, to model this, I need to keep track of the rows and columns that are already blocked by previous moves.

Given that, I can think of the remaining unblocked rows and columns as the available positions where I can place new rooks.

But the problem is to find the number of different final configurations possible from the current state.

A configuration is defined by the positions and colors of the rooks on the board.

Since I place white rooks and the computer places black rooks, and the computer mirrors my moves, the configurations depend on how I place my rooks and how the computer responds.

But the computer always mirrors my moves, unless I place on the diagonal, in which case the computer skips.

So, the game proceeds with me placing a rook in some position, and the computer mirroring it, unless I place on the diagonal.

I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible, considering all possible sequences of moves from the current state.

This sounds like a combinatorial problem, where I need to count the number of ways to place rooks without attacking each other, considering the mirroring constraint.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's consider the initial state after k moves have been made.

Each of my k moves corresponds to either:

- Placing a rook at (r,c) where r != c, and the computer places a rook at (c,r).

- Placing a rook at (r,r), and the computer skips.

So, for each move:

- If r != c, two rooks are placed: one at (r,c) and one at (c,r).

- If r == c, only one rook is placed at (r,r).

Now, I need to determine how many rows and columns are already blocked by these moves.

Let me define:

- Let S be the set of rows and columns that are blocked.

For each move:

- If r != c:

- Add r and c to S.

- If r == c:

- Add r to S.

So, S is the union of all rows and columns that have been blocked by the moves so far.

Then, the number of remaining rows and columns that are unblocked is n - |S|.

Wait, but since S includes both rows and columns, and a row or column is blocked if it's in S.

So, the number of unblocked rows is n - |S|, and the number of unblocked columns is n - |S|.

But actually, since S includes both rows and columns, I need to be careful.

Wait, let's define S as the set of indices that have either a row or column blocked.

So, S is the union of the rows and columns that have been blocked.

Since rows and columns are both labeled from 1 to n, I can think of S as a set of indices from 1 to n, where each index represents both a row and a column.

Wait, but in reality, rows and columns are separate, but since they are indexed the same, I can treat S as the set of indices that have either a row or column blocked.

So, for each move:

- If r != c:

- Add r and c to S.

- If r == c:

- Add r to S.

Then, the number of unblocked rows is n - |S|, and the number of unblocked columns is n - |S|.

Now, in the remaining part of the game, I need to place rooks in the unblocked rows and columns, following the same rules: I place a white rook, and the computer mirrors it, unless I place on the diagonal.

I need to find the number of different final configurations from this point.

Let me think about the remaining game.

Each of my moves can be:

- Placing a white rook at (r,c), where r != c, and the computer places a black rook at (c,r).

- Placing a white rook at (r,r), and the computer skips.

In both cases, I need to ensure that the positions are valid, meaning that the rows and columns are unblocked.

So, the number of remaining unblocked rows and columns is n - |S|.

Let m = n - |S|.

So, m is the number of unblocked rows and columns.

Now, the problem reduces to: given an m x m chessboard with no rooks initially placed, how many different final configurations are possible when me and the computer take turns placing rooks, following the same rules?

Because the previous moves have already blocked some rows and columns, and now we're considering the unblocked part as a new m x m chessboard.

So, the number of final configurations is a function of m.

Let's denote f(m) as the number of possible final configurations for an m x m chessboard with no initial rooks, following the same placement rules.

Then, the answer for the original problem is f(m).

So, I need to find f(m).

Now, I need to find a way to compute f(m).

Let's think about how the game progresses on the m x m chessboard.

I start by placing a white rook at some position (r,c), and then the computer places a black rook at (c,r), unless r == c, in which case the computer skips.

Then, I place another white rook, and so on, until no more moves are possible.

Each move reduces the number of available rows and columns.

Specifically:

- If I place a rook at (r,c) where r != c:

- Rows r and c are blocked.

- Columns r and c are blocked.

- The computer places a rook at (c,r), which blocks the same rows and columns.

- So, in total, two rows and two columns are blocked.

- If I place a rook at (r,r):

- Row r and column r are blocked.

- The computer skips.

- So, only one row and one column are blocked.

Wait, but in terms of blocking, placing a rook at (r,c) blocks row r and column c, and placing a rook at (c,r) blocks row c and column r.

So, in total, after both moves, rows r and c are blocked, and columns r and c are blocked.

Hence, for each pair of moves where r != c, four total blocks are made (two rows and two columns).

But since S already accounts for these blocks, in the remaining m x m board, I need to consider how many ways I can place rooks without overlapping in rows or columns.

This seems similar to placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, which is related to permutations or derangements.

But the mirroring adds a twist.

Let me consider small values of m to see if I can find a pattern.

Let's compute f(m) for small m.

Case 1: m = 0

- No board, so only one configuration: no rooks placed.

- f(0) = 1

Case 2: m = 1

- Only one position: (1,1)

- I can place a white rook at (1,1), and the computer skips.

- No more moves possible.

- So, only one configuration.

- f(1) = 1

Case 3: m = 2

- Positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Option 1: I place a white rook at (1,2), computer places at (2,1)

- Now, rows 1 and 2 are blocked, columns 1 and 2 are blocked.

- No more moves possible.

- Configuration: white at (1,2), black at (2,1)

- Option 2: I place a white rook at (2,1), computer places at (1,2)

- Same as above, just order is different, but the configuration is the same as Option 1.

- Option 3: I place a white rook at (1,1), computer skips

- Now, row 1 and column 1 are blocked.

- Remaining positions: (2,2)

- I can place a white rook at (2,2), computer skips.

- Configuration: white at (1,1) and white at (2,2)

- Option 4: I place a white rook at (2,2), computer skips

- Similarly, configuration: white at (2,2) and white at (1,1)

- But since the order doesn't matter, this is the same as Option 3.

- So, only two unique configurations for m=2.

Wait, but according to the first test case in the example, with n=4 and k=1, m=4-2=2 (since k=1 and r!=c, so num=2), and it says there are 3 possible final configurations.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated m.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, k=1, move is (1,2), which is r != c, so num = 2.

Thus, m = n - num = 4 - 2 = 2.

But according to the example, there are 3 possible final configurations.

But in my earlier calculation, I got only 2 for m=2.

Hmm, maybe I missed something.

Wait, in m=2, let's enumerate carefully.

Option 1: I place at (1,2), computer at (2,1). No more moves possible.

Option 2: I place at (2,1), computer at (1,2). Same as Option 1.

Option 3: I place at (1,1), computer skips. Then I place at (2,2), computer skips.

Option 4: I place at (2,2), computer skips. Then I place at (1,1), computer skips.

But Option 3 and Option 4 are the same in terms of configuration, just different in the order of placement.

So, only two unique configurations.

But the example says for n=4, k=1, output is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in Option 3 and Option 4, the order of placement matters if they are different.

Wait, but the problem states that configurations are different if there exists a coordinate with a rook in one and not in the other, or different colors.

In Option 3 and Option 4, the final configuration is the same: white at (1,1) and white at (2,2).

So, they should be considered the same configuration.

Hence, f(2) should be 2.

But according to the example, for m=2, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

Wait, in m=2, let's see:

- Option 1: Place at (1,2) and (2,1). One configuration.

- Option 2: Place at (1,1) and (2,2). Another configuration.

- Option 3: Place at (2,2) and (1,1). But this is the same as Option 2.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is 3, but according to this, it should be 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, k=1, move is (1,2), computer places at (2,1).

So, remaining unblocked rows and columns are those not in row 1,2 and column 1,2, which are rows 3,4 and columns 3,4.

So, m = 4 - 2 = 2.

But in this m=2 subboard, there are positions (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4).

Option 1: I place at (3,4), computer places at (4,3). Configuration: (3,4) white, (4,3) black.

Option 2: I place at (4,3), computer places at (3,4). Same as Option 1.

Option 3: I place at (3,3), computer skips. Then I place at (4,4), computer skips. Configuration: (3,3) white, (4,4) white.

Option 4: I place at (4,4), computer skips. Then I place at (3,3), computer skips. Same as Option 3.

So, only two unique configurations.

But the example says 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in the first move, I can also choose to place at (3,3), and then the computer skips, and then I can't place anymore.

Wait, in m=2, there are more possibilities.

Wait, in m=2, let's consider:

- Option 1: I place at (3,4), computer at (4,3). No more moves.

- Option 2: I place at (4,3), computer at (3,4). Same as Option 1.

- Option 3: I place at (3,3), computer skips. Then I can place at (4,4), computer skips.

- Option 4: I place at (4,4), computer skips. Then I can place at (3,3), computer skips.

- Option 5: I place at (3,3), computer skips. Then I don't place any more rooks.

- Option 6: I place at (4,4), computer skips. Then I don't place any more rooks.

Wait, so in addition to the configurations where I place two white rooks at (3,3) and (4,4), I can also choose to place only one of them.

But according to the problem, I must continue playing until no valid moves remain.

So, in Option 3, after placing at (3,3), I still have a valid move at (4,4), so I must place it.

Similarly, in Option 4, after placing at (4,4), I must place at (3,3).

In Option 5 and Option 6, I choose not to place the second rook, but according to the problem, I have to continue playing until no valid moves are left.

Therefore, I must place both if possible.

Hence, only two unique configurations: one with (3,4) white and (4,3) black; and another with (3,3) white and (4,4) white.

But the example says 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, in the explanation for the first test case, it says there are three possible configurations:

1. I place at (3,4), computer at (4,3).

2. I place at (4,3), computer at (3,4).

3. I place at (3,3), then at (4,4), or the other way around, but both result in the same configuration.

So, according to the explanation, it's considering the sequence of moves, but in the final configuration, only the positions and colors matter.

In configurations 1 and 2, the rooks are placed at (3,4) white and (4,3) black, or at (4,3) white and (3,4) black.

But in terms of positions and colors, these are different configurations because the colors are different at the positions.

Wait, no. In configuration 1, (3,4) is white and (4,3) is black.

In configuration 2, (4,3) is white and (3,4) is black.

So, these are different configurations.

Then, configuration 3 is placing at (3,3) white and (4,4) white.

So, total of three configurations.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought that placing at (3,4) and (4,3) is one configuration, and placing at (4,3) and (3,4) is the same configuration, but according to the explanation, they are different.

Wait, no, in my earlier reasoning, I mistakenly thought that in Option 1 and Option 2, they are the same configuration, but actually, the positions have different colors.

So, they are indeed different configurations.

Hence, f(2) = 3.

Similarly, for m=1, f(1)=1, and for m=0, f(0)=1.

Now, I need to find a general formula for f(m).

Looking at m=0: f(0)=1

m=1: f(1)=1

m=2: f(2)=3

Let's try m=3.

For m=3, let's enumerate:

Option 1: Place at (1,2), computer at (2,1). Then, remaining positions are (3,3).

I can place at (3,3), computer skips.

Configuration: (1,2) white, (2,1) black, (3,3) white.

Option 2: Place at (1,3), computer at (3,1). Then, no more moves.

Configuration: (1,3) white, (3,1) black.

Option 3: Place at (2,3), computer at (3,2). Then, no more moves.

Configuration: (2,3) white, (3,2) black.

Option 4: Place at (1,1), computer skips. Then, place at (2,2), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips.

Configuration: (1,1) white, (2,2) white, (3,3) white.

Option 5: Place at (2,2), computer skips. Then, place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips.

Same as Option 4.

Option 6: Place at (3,3), computer skips. Then, place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (2,2), computer skips.

Same as Option 4.

Option 7: Place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips.

Configuration: (1,1) white, (3,3) white.

Option 8: Place at (2,2), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips.

Configuration: (2,2) white, (3,3) white.

Option 9: Place at (3,3), computer skips, then place at (1,1), computer skips.

Same as Option 7.

Option 10: Place at (3,3), computer skips, then place at (2,2), computer skips.

Same as Option 8.

Option 11: Place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (2,2), computer skips.

Same as Option 4, but without placing at (3,3).

Wait, but according to the problem, I must continue playing until no valid moves are left.

So, in Option 4, after placing at (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3), no more moves are possible.

In Option 7, after placing at (1,1) and (3,3), I still have a valid move at (2,2), so I must place it.

Wait, no, if I place at (1,1) and (3,3), then row 1 and column 1 are blocked by (1,1), and row 3 and column 3 are blocked by (3,3).

So, the only remaining position is (2,2), which is unblocked, so I must place there.

Hence, Option 7 is actually the same as Option 4.

Similarly, Option 8 is the same as Option 4.

Hence, only unique configurations are:

1. (1,2) white, (2,1) black, (3,3) white.

2. (1,3) white, (3,1) black.

3. (2,3) white, (3,2) black.

4. (1,1) white, (2,2) white, (3,3) white.

So, total of 4 configurations for m=3.

Wait, but this seems inconsistent. According to the pattern, for m=0:1, m=1:1, m=2:3, m=3:4.

Is there a formula that fits these values?

Wait, for m=0:1, m=1:1, m=2:3, m=3:4.

This doesn't seem to fit any standard combinatorial formula immediately.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the remaining m x m board, the game is symmetric in some way.

Each pair of moves where r != c corresponds to placing two rooks that block two rows and two columns.

Each move where r == c corresponds to placing one rook that blocks one row and one column, and the computer skips.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think recursively.

Let f(m) be the number of final configurations for an m x m board.

For m=0, f(0)=1.

For m=1, f(1)=1.

For m=2, f(2)=3.

For m=3, f(3)=4.

Wait, looking back at the first test case, n=4, k=1, m=2, output=3.

Second test case, n=8, k=1, m=6 (n - num, where num=2 for k=1 and r != c), output=331.

Third test case, n=1000, k=4, m=n - num, where num depends on the moves.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a general formula for f(m).

Looking at the values:

m | f(m)

0 | 1

1 | 1

2 | 3

3 | 4

Wait, 4 doesn't fit with m=3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted for m=3.

Let me recount for m=3.

Possible configurations:

1. Place at (1,2), computer at (2,1), then no more moves.

Configuration: (1,2) white, (2,1) black.

2. Place at (1,3), computer at (3,1), then no more moves.

Configuration: (1,3) white, (3,1) black.

3. Place at (2,3), computer at (3,2), then no more moves.

Configuration: (2,3) white, (3,2) black.

4. Place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (2,2), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips.

Configuration: (1,1) white, (2,2) white, (3,3) white.

5. Place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips, then place at (2,2), computer skips.

Same as 4.

6. Place at (2,2), computer skips, then place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (3,3), computer skips.

Same as 4.

7. Place at (3,3), computer skips, then place at (1,1), computer skips, then place at (2,2), computer skips.

Same as 4.

So, only two unique configurations: one with two rooks placed in mirrored off-diagonal positions, and one with three white rooks on the diagonal.

Wait, but according to the earlier count, it should be more.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in configuration 4, I can place the diagonal rooks in any order, but they all lead to the same final configuration.

Hence, only one unique configuration with all diagonal rooks.

And three configurations with off-diagonal rooks.

Hence, total of four configurations for m=3.

But according to the pattern, f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=4.

Is there a formula that fits these values?

Looking at f(2)=3, f(3)=4, f(4)=?

Wait, need more data points.

Looking at the second test case, n=8, k=1, m=6, output=331.

Wait, 331 seems too large for m=6 if f(2)=3 and f(3)=4.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps f(m) can be expressed in terms of derangements or permutations.

But derangements don't seem to fit here because of the mirroring.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m! / something.

Wait, for m=0:1, m=1:1, m=2:3, m=3:4.

This doesn't fit with standard factorial or derangement formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of ways to pair rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + m(m-1)/2 or something.

But for m=2, that would be 1 + 1 = 2, but it should be 3.

No, not that.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + m choose 2 * something.

Wait, need a better approach.

Let me consider that each pair of off-diagonal moves (r,c) and (c,r) are considered different configurations.

So, for each off-diagonal pair, it's a separate configuration.

And the all-diagonal configuration is another one.

For m=2:

- Two off-diagonal pairs: (1,2)-(2,1) and (2,1)-(1,2), but they are considered different configurations.

- One all-diagonal configuration: (1,1) and (2,2).

Hence, total of 3 configurations.

For m=3:

- Three off-diagonal pairs: (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,3)-(3,2).

- Each pair is a separate configuration.

- One all-diagonal configuration: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3).

Hence, total of 4 configurations.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were more, but perhaps not.

Hence, f(m) = number of off-diagonal pairs + 1 (for the all-diagonal configuration).

But for m=2, off-diagonal pairs: 2 (since (1,2)-(2,1) and (2,1)-(1,2)), but according to earlier, it's considered as 1 configuration for off-diagonal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + m choose 2.

For m=2: 1 + 1 = 2, but according to the example, it's 3.

No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose 2 + 1 + something.

Wait, need to think differently.

Looking at the output for m=6 (from the second test case), f(6)=331.

Wait, 331 is equal to 3*5^3 +1, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps f(m) = m! / 2 + something.

Wait, m=2: 2! / 2 = 1, plus something to make it 3.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps f(m) = (m choose 2)! +1.

But m=2: 1! +1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose 2 * 2 +1.

For m=2: 1*2 +1=3.

For m=3: 3*2 +1=7, but earlier I thought f(3)=4.

No.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose 2 * something +1.

Wait, need to find a pattern.

Looking at m=0:1, m=1:1, m=2:3, m=3:4, m=6:331.

Is there a recurrence relation?

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*f(m-2).

For m=2: f(2)=f(1)+1*f(0)=1+1=2, but it should be 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*f(m-2) *2.

For m=2: 1 +1*1*2=3.

For m=3: 3 + 2*1*2=3+4=7, but earlier I thought f(3)=4.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*(f(m-2)).

For m=2: 1 +1*1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*f(m-1).

For m=2:1 +1*1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*f(m-2) + something.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for another approach.

Perhaps f(m) is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of the off-diagonal pairs, plus the all-diagonal configuration.

But for m=2, off-diagonal pairs: one pair, so 2 configurations (choose to place it or not) plus the all-diagonal configuration, totaling 3.

For m=3, off-diagonal pairs: three pairs, each can be chosen or not, but with some constraints.

Wait, but in the game, I have to place rooks alternately, so it's not just choosing subsets.

Hence, this approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps f(m) is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of off-diagonal pairs where no two pairs share a row or column, plus the all-diagonal configuration.

For m=2:

- Off-diagonal pairs: only one pair (1,2)-(2,1).

- Choose to place it or not.

- All-diagonal configuration: (1,1)-(2,2).

- Total: 3 configurations.

For m=3:

- Off-diagonal pairs: three pairs: (1,2)-(2,1), (1,3)-(3,1), (2,3)-(3,2).

- Choose to place one pair or none, since placing two pairs would require them not to share rows or columns, which isn't possible for m=3.

- All-diagonal configuration: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3).

- Hence, total configurations: 1 (all-diagonal) + 3 (individual off-diagonal pairs) = 4.

This seems consistent with my earlier count.

Hence, f(m) = 1 + number of ways to choose disjoint off-diagonal pairs.

For m=2, number of off-diagonal pairs is 1.

For m=3, number is 3.

For m=4, it would be 6 (choose any off-diagonal pair, but they can't overlap).

Wait, but for m=4, it's more complicated.

Wait, in m=4, number of off-diagonal pairs is C(m,2)=6 for m=4.

But in the first test case, with m=2, f(2)=3.

Wait, but according to the problem, for m=2, f(2)=3.

In the second test case, m=6, f(6)=331.

Wait, 331 is equal to 1 + 15 (C(6,2)=15) + something.

Wait, 1 + 15 =16, but 331 is much larger.

Hence, this approach is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + C(m,2) * f(m-2).

For m=2:1 +1*1=2, but it should be 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + C(m,2) * f(m-2), with f(0)=1, f(1)=1.

For m=2:1 +1*1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*(m-1)*f(m-2).

For m=2:1 +1*1*1=2, not 3.

No.

This is not leading me anywhere.

Let me consider that in each step, I can choose to place an off-diagonal pair or a diagonal rook.

But the computer mirrors off-diagonal moves, but skips on diagonal moves.

Hence, perhaps f(m) = f(m-2) * C(m,2) + f(m-1).

Wait, not sure.

This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem reduces to choosing a subset of off-diagonal pairs without overlapping rows or columns, plus the all-diagonal configuration.

Hence, f(m) = number of ways to choose a matching of off-diagonal pairs without overlapping rows or columns, plus the all-diagonal configuration.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps f(m) is the number of ways to choose a subset of off-diagonal pairs where no two pairs share a row or column, plus the all-diagonal configuration.

For m=2:

- Off-diagonal pairs: only one pair, so 2 choices: choose it or not.

- Plus the all-diagonal configuration.

- Total: 3.

For m=3:

- Off-diagonal pairs: three pairs.

- Choose at most one pair.

- Plus the all-diagonal configuration.

- Total: 1 (all-diagonal) + 3 (individual off-diagonal pairs) = 4.

For m=4:

- Off-diagonal pairs: C(4,2)=6 pairs.

- Choose at most one pair.

- Plus the all-diagonal configuration.

- Total: 1 + 6 =7.

But according to the second test case, m=6, f(6)=331, which is not 1 + C(6,2)=16.

Hence, this approach is incomplete.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + C(m,2) * f(m-2).

For m=2:1 +1*1=2, but should be 3.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = 1 + C(m,2) * f(m-2), with f(0)=1, f(1)=1.

For m=2:1 +1*1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*(f(m-2)).

For m=2:1 +1*1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = f(m-1) + (m-1)*(m-1)*f(m-2).

For m=2:1 +1*1*1=2, not 3.

No.

This isn't working.

Let me try to find another way.

Perhaps f(m) is related to the number of ways to arrange non-attacking rooks on an m x m board, considering the mirroring.

But in standard non-attacking rooks, it's just m!.

But here, the mirroring complicates it.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m! / 2 for m >=2, plus 1.

For m=2:2!/2=1, plus 1=2, but should be 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m! - (m-1)! for m >=1, with f(0)=1.

For m=1:1! -0!=1-1=0, but should be 1.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = (m-1)! +1 for m >=1.

For m=1:0!+1=1+1=2, but should be 1.

No.

This is not leading me anywhere.

Let me try to look for a different pattern.

Looking at m=0:1, m=1:1, m=2:3, m=3:4.

Wait, 4 doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose floor(m/2).

But for m=2:2 choose 1=2, but should be 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose ceil(m/2).

For m=2:2 choose 1=2, not 3.

No.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose floor(m/2)) *2 -1.

For m=2:2*2-1=3.

For m=3:3*2-1=5, but earlier I thought f(3)=4.

No.

This isn't working.

Wait, perhaps f(m) = m choose floor(m/2)) +1.

For m=2:2+1=3.

For m=3:3+1=4.

For m=6:C(6,3)+1=20+1=21, but according to the test case, f(6)=331.

Not matching.

This approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in each step, I can choose to place an off-diagonal pair or a diagonal rook, and the computer responds
