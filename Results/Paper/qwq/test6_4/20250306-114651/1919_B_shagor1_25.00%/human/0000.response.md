Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each of these substrings, I have to calculate a penalty which is the absolute value of the sum of the substring multiplied by its length. My goal is to minimize the total penalty.

First, I need to understand how the array 'a' is defined from the string 's'. It says that if s_i is "+", then a_i is 1, and if s_i is "-", then a_i is -1. So, the array 'a' is just a numerical representation of the string 's' with "+" as 1 and "-" as -1.

Now, the task is to split this array 'a' into non-empty subarrays, and for each subarray, calculate the penalty as the absolute value of the sum of the subarray multiplied by its length. Then, sum up all these penalties and find the minimum possible total penalty.

I need to think about how to optimally split the array to minimize this total penalty.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1

That's the only way to split it, so the total penalty is 1.

Second example:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: ([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]), each has penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1, total penalty is 5.

Is there a better way? Let's see.

If I split it into two subarrays, say ([-1, -1], [-1, -1, -1])

First subarray: sum is -2, length is 2, penalty is | -2 | * 2 = 4

Second subarray: sum is -3, length is 3, penalty is | -3 | * 3 = 9

Total penalty: 4 + 9 = 13, which is worse than 5.

Or, split into one subarray: a itself, sum is -5, length is 5, penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 25, which is worse.

So, in this case, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty.

Third example:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: penalty for each is |1|*1 = 1, | -1 |*1 =1, etc., total penalty is 6.

But the output says 0, so there must be a better way to split it.

Wait, perhaps splitting it into pairs: [1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1]

Each pair has sum 0, and length 2, penalty |0|*2 = 0 for each, total penalty 0.

Ah, that's better.

Another example:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

Need to find an optimal split.

One way: split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First subarray sum is 4, length 8, penalty |4|*8=32

Second subarray sum is -1, length 1, penalty | -1 |*1=1

Total penalty: 33

But the sample output is 4, which is much better. So, I need a better splitting strategy.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First subarray sum: -2, length 2, penalty | -2 |*2=4

Second subarray sum: 1*5 + (-1) = 5 -1 =4, length 7, penalty |4|*7=28

Total penalty: 4 + 28 = 32, still not 4.

Wait, perhaps split into [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First: sum -1, len 1, penalty 1

Second: sum 6, len 6, penalty 6*6=36

Third: sum -1, len 1, penalty 1

Total: 1+36+1=38, worse.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First: sum -1, len 4, penalty 1*4=4

Second: sum 1, len 3, penalty 1*3=3

Total: 7, still not 4.

Wait, perhaps split into [ -1, -1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First: sum -1, len 3, penalty 1*3=3

Second: sum 2, len 4, penalty 2*4=8

Total: 11

Still not 4.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First: sum 1, len 5, penalty 1*5=5

Second: sum 1, len 3, penalty 1*3=3

Total: 8

Better, but still not 4.

Wait, perhaps [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First: sum 2, len 6, penalty 2*6=12

Second: sum 0, len 2, penalty 0*2=0

Total: 12

Not better.

Hmm, I must be missing something.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

n=6, s=+-+-+-

Optimal split: ([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]), penalty 0+0=0

n=10, s=--+++++++-

Optimal penalty is 4

n=20, s=+---++++-+++++---++-

Optimal penalty is 4

I need to find a general way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

Let me think about the penalty formula: for a subarray, penalty = |sum| * length

To minimize this, I need to make the sum as close to zero as possible, considering the length.

If a subarray has sum zero, its penalty is zero, which is ideal.

So, I should try to split the array into subarrays where each subarray has a sum of zero if possible.

However, in some cases, like the second sample input, all elements are -1, so it's impossible to have a subarray with sum zero unless the subarray has an even number of -1's.

Wait, in the second sample input, n=5, s=-----, which is all -1's.

In this case, splitting into individual elements gives penalty 1 for each, total 5.

Alternatively, splitting into subarrays of two elements each would give sum -2, penalty 2*2=4 for each, and one subarray with one element, penalty 1.

Total penalty: 4 + 4 + 1 = 9, which is worse.

So, splitting into single elements gives the minimal penalty in this case.

In the third sample input, n=6, s=+-+-+-

As I saw earlier, splitting into two subarrays of [1,-1,1,-1] and [1,-1] gives sum zero for both, total penalty zero.

Similarly, for n=10, s=--+++++++-

I need to find a way to split it into subarrays with sum zero or as close to zero as possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me consider the cumulative sum of the array.

Define prefix sum array p, where p[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]

Then, the sum of a subarray from i to j is p[j] - p[i-1]

So, if I can find points where p[j] - p[i-1] = 0, that would be ideal for minimizing penalty.

In other words, splitting the array at points where the prefix sum repeats would allow me to have subarrays with sum zero.

This seems promising.

Let me try this approach.

For example, n=6, s=+-+-+-

Let's compute prefix sums:

a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

p = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

So, p[1]=1, p[2]=0, p[3]=1, p[4]=0, p[5]=1, p[6]=0

I can see that p[2]=0, p[4]=0, p[6]=0

So, if I split at positions 2 and 4, I get subarrays:

b1 = a[1:2] = [1, -1], sum=0

b2 = a[3:4] = [1, -1], sum=0

b3 = a[5:6] = [1, -1], sum=0

Total penalty = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0

Alternatively, splitting at positions where prefix sum repeats.

Another way is to group subarrays where the prefix sum returns to the same value.

This seems to be a way to minimize the penalty.

Now, for n=10, s=--+++++++-

a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

p = [-1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4]

Looking for places where prefix sum repeats or can be balanced.

Looking at the prefix sums: -1, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4

I see that p[1]=-1, p[3]=-1, p[9]=4, p[10]=4

So, perhaps splitting at positions where prefix sum repeats.

For example, from position 1 to 3, p[1]=p[3]=-1, so sum is zero.

Similarly, from position 9 to 10, p[9]=p[10]=4, sum is zero.

So, splitting into subarrays:

b1 = a[1:3] = [-1, -1], sum -2, length 2, penalty 2*2=4

b2 = a[4:9] = [1,1,1,1,1,1], sum 6, length 6, penalty 6*6=36

b3 = a[10:10] = [-1], sum -1, length 1, penalty 1*1=1

Total penalty: 4 + 36 + 1 = 41, which is not matching the sample output of 4.

Wait, perhaps I need a better strategy.

Wait, maybe instead of splitting where prefix sums repeat, I should aim to balance positive and negative sums to make the subarray sums as close to zero as possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a dynamic programming approach to minimize the total penalty.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the minimal total penalty for the subarray a[1..i]

Then, for each i, I can try to split the array at position j (from j=i down to j=1), and set dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + penalty(a[j..i]))

But with n=5000, this would be O(n^2), which might be too slow since t=1000 and total operations could be up to 10^6, which is acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the sample inputs, maybe there's a pattern or formula to directly compute the minimal penalty without dynamic programming.

Looking at the third sample input, n=6, s=+-+-+-

We split into two subarrays, each with sum zero, total penalty zero.

In the second sample input, n=5, s=-----, splitting into single elements gives total penalty 5.

In the fourth sample input, n=10, s=--+++++++-, output is 4.

I need to see if there's a relationship between the number of "-" and "+" signs and the minimal penalty.

Let me count the number of "-" and "+" in each sample input.

First sample:

n=1, s="+", one "+", minimal penalty 1.

Second sample:

n=5, s=-----, five "-", minimal penalty 5.

Third sample:

n=6, s=+-+-+-, three "+" and three "-", minimal penalty 0.

Fourth sample:

n=10, s=--+++++++-, two "-" and eight "+", minimal penalty 4.

Fifth sample:

n=20, s=+---++++-+++++---++-, twelve "+" and eight "-", minimal penalty 4.

Wait, in the third sample, with equal number of "+" and "-", the minimal penalty is 0.

In the fourth sample, with eight "+" and two "-", the minimal penalty is 4.

In the fifth sample, with twelve "+" and eight "-", the minimal penalty is 4.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me think about the minimal penalty in terms of the difference between the number of "+" and "-" in each subarray.

Since each "+" is +1 and each "-" is -1, the sum of a subarray is (number of "+" - number of "-") in that subarray.

The penalty is |sum| * length.

To minimize the total penalty, I need to minimize the sum of |number of "+" - number of "-"| * length over all subarrays.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the overall sum of the array.

But the way we split the array affects the sum of each subarray.

Wait, maybe I can consider the entire array as one subarray, and calculate the penalty, then see if splitting it into smaller subarrays reduces the total penalty.

For example, in the third sample, if I take the whole array as one subarray, sum is 0, penalty 0.

But in the second sample, sum is -5, penalty 25, which is worse than splitting into single elements with total penalty 5.

So, sometimes it's better to split into smaller subarrays, and sometimes it's better to keep them together, depending on the sum.

I need a general strategy.

Let me consider the prefix sums again.

In the third sample, prefix sums are [1,0,1,0,1,0]

I can split at positions where the prefix sum repeats, which allows me to have subarrays with sum zero.

In the second sample, prefix sums are [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]

There are no repeating prefix sums, so I can't have subarrays with sum zero.

In this case, splitting into single elements gives the minimal penalty.

In the fourth sample, prefix sums are [-1,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5,4]

I see that p[3]=-1, which repeats p[1]=-1, so sum of a[2:3] is zero.

Also, p[10]=4 repeats p[9]=4, so sum of a[9:10] is zero.

So, I can split at these points to get subarrays with sum zero.

Let me try that.

Split into:

b1 = a[1:3], sum -2, penalty 2*2=4

b2 = a[4:9], sum 6, penalty 6*6=36

b3 = a[10:10], sum -1, penalty 1*1=1

Total penalty: 4 + 36 + 1 = 41, which is not matching the sample output of 4.

Wait, maybe I need to split differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can split at positions where the prefix sum is the same, but maybe in a different way.

Wait, perhaps instead of splitting into subarrays where prefix sums repeat, I should aim to balance the positive and negative sums in a way that minimizes the penalty.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe there's a different approach.

Let me look at the minimal penalty formula again: |sum| * length

I need to minimize this for each subarray.

One way to minimize |sum| * length is to have sum as close to zero as possible, and preferably zero.

But in cases where sum is not zero, I need to balance positive and negative values to make sum close to zero.

However, in practice, it's better to have sum zero if possible.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to the sum of the absolute values of the unbalanced elements.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the difference between the number of "+" and "-" in the array.

Wait, in the third sample, with equal number of "+" and "-", the minimal penalty is zero.

In the fourth sample, with eight "+" and two "-", the minimal penalty is 4.

In the fifth sample, with twelve "+" and eight "-", the minimal penalty is 4.

Wait, in the fourth sample, difference between "+" and "-" is 8 - 2 = 6, but minimal penalty is 4.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal difference multiplied by the length of the unbalanced part.

This seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray with sum S and length L.

Its penalty is |S| * L.

I need to find a way to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of |S| * L is minimized.

This seems similar to minimizing the weighted sum of absolute deviations.

I recall that in optimization, minimizing the sum of absolute values often involves balancing positive and negative parts.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider dynamic programming.

Define dp[i] as the minimal total penalty for the subarray a[1..i]

Then, for each i, I can try to split the array at position j (from j=1 to j=i), and set dp[i] = min(dp[j-1] + penalty(a[j..i]))

This would be an O(n^2) solution, which might be acceptable for n=5000 and t=1000, but it's pushing it.

I need to see if there's a faster way.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

First sample:

n=1, s="+", output 1

Second sample:

n=5, s=-----, output 5

Third sample:

n=6, s=+-+-+-, output 0

Fourth sample:

n=10, s=--+++++++-, output 4

Fifth sample:

n=20, s=+---++++-+++++---++-, output 4

Looking at these, perhaps the minimal penalty is equal to n - 2*k, where k is the number of "-" signs, but that doesn't match the third sample.

Wait, in the third sample, n=6, k=3, n - 2*k = 0, which matches the output.

In the second sample, n=5, k=5, n - 2*k = -5, but the output is 5.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's 2*k - n, but in the second sample, 2*5 - 5 =5, which matches, but in the third sample, 2*3 -6 =0, which also matches.

Wait, in the fourth sample, k=2, n=10, 2*2 -10 = -6, but the output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's abs(2*k - n)

In the second sample, abs(2*5 -5)=5, matches.

Third sample, abs(2*3 -6)=0, matches.

Fourth sample, abs(2*2 -10)=6, but the output is 4, not matching.

Hmm, not quite.

Alternatively, maybe it's n - 2*min(k, n-k)

In the second sample, n=5, k=5, n -2*k = -5, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps n - 2*min(k, n-k), but taking the absolute value.

Wait, in the second sample, k=5, min(k, n-k)=0, n-2*0=5, matches.

Third sample, k=3, min(k, n-k)=3, n-2*3=0, matches.

Fourth sample, k=2, min(k, n-k)=2, n-2*2=6, but output is 4, not matching.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's n - 2*min(k, n-k), but with some adjustment.

Wait, maybe n - 2*min(k, n-k), but if n == min(k, n-k), then it's n - 2*min(k, n-k), else something else.

Wait, in the fourth sample, k=2, n=10, min(k, n-k)=2, n-2*2=6, but output is 4.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal number of unbalanced elements.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of elements that cannot be paired with opposite signs.

For example, in the third sample, with three "+" and three "-", all can be paired, so minimal penalty is zero.

In the second sample, five "-", and no "+", so all are unpaired, penalty is 5.

In the fourth sample, two "-" and eight "+", so two "-" can be paired with two "+", leaving six "+" unpaired, but the output is 4, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimal number of unpaired elements, multiplied by something.

This seems unclear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider the entire array as one subarray.

Then, the penalty is |sum(a)| * n.

In the third sample, sum(a)=0, so penalty=0.

In the second sample, sum(a)=-5, penalty=5*5=25, which is worse than splitting into single elements with penalty 5.

So, sometimes it's better to split into smaller subarrays.

I need a way to group elements such that the sum of each group is as close to zero as possible.

This sounds like a bin packing problem, where I want to balance the positive and negative values in each bin (subarray).

But bin packing is NP-hard, and I need an efficient solution.

Perhaps there's a greedy approach.

For example, try to pair "+" and "-" together to make sum zero, and handle the remaining elements individually.

In the third sample, three "+" and three "-", so I can pair them into two groups of three each, with sum zero.

In the fourth sample, two "-" and eight "+", so I can pair two "-" with two "+", making two groups with sum zero, and have six "+" left, which I can group together into one subarray with sum 6, penalty 6*6=36, which is worse than the sample output of 4.

Wait, but the sample output is 4, so there must be a better way.

Wait, maybe I should group the remaining six "+" into subarrays of length two, each with sum 2, penalty |2|*2=4 per subarray, total penalty 4*3=12, still not 4.

Wait, perhaps grouping them into subarrays of length three, sum 3, penalty |3|*3=9, total penalty 9*2=18, worse
