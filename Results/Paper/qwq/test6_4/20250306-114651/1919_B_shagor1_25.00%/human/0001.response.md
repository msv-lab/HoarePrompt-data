Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and I need to split this string into substrings in such a way that when I concatenate them, they form the original string. For each of these substrings, I have to calculate a penalty, which is the absolute value of the sum of the corresponding values (1 for "+" and -1 for "-") multiplied by the length of the substring. My goal is to minimize the total penalty sum.

First, I need to understand what the penalty represents. For a substring, if it has more "+" than "-", its sum will be positive; if more "-", negative. Taking the absolute value and multiplying by the length means that the penalty is higher for longer substrings with a larger imbalance between "+" and "-".

I need to find a way to split the string to minimize this total penalty. Let's consider some examples to get a feel for the problem.

Take the first example:

n = 1

s = "+"

So, a = [1]

If I split it into [1], the penalty is |1| * 1 = 1.

That's the only way to split it, so the minimum penalty is 1.

Second example:

n = 5

s = "-----"

So, a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]

If I split it into individual elements: p([-1]) * 5 = 1 * 5 = 5

Alternatively, split into [ -1, -1, -1, -1, -1 ], penalty is | -5 | * 5 = 5 * 5 = 25

Or split into [ -1, -1 ], [ -1, -1 ], [ -1 ], each penalty is | -2 | * 2 = 4, and | -1 | * 1 = 1, total 4 + 4 + 1 = 9

So, splitting into individual elements gives the minimal penalty of 5 in this case.

Third example:

n = 6

s = "+-+-+-

So, a = [1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]

If I split into [1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1], each sum is 0, so penalty is 0 for each, total 0.

That's interesting. So, if I can split the string into substrings where the sum is zero, the penalty is zero.

Fourth example:

n = 10

s = "--+++++++-

So, a = [-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]

If I split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First substring sum is 7, penalty |7| * 9 = 63

Second substring sum is -1, penalty | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total penalty 64, which is bad.

Alternatively, split into [ -1, -1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring sum is -2, penalty 2 * 2 = 4

Second substring sum is 6 -1 = 5, penalty 5 * 8 = 40

Total 44, still bad.

But maybe there's a better way. If I split into [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ -1 ]

First substring: | -1 | * 1 = 1

Second substring: |6| * 7 = 42

Third substring: | -1 | * 1 = 1

Total 44 again.

Wait, maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring sum: -1 -1 +1 +1 = 0, penalty 0

Second substring sum: 1 +1 +1 -1 = 2, penalty |2| * 4 = 8

Total penalty 8, which is better.

But the example output says 4, so there must be a better split.

Maybe split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First substring sum: -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 = 1, penalty |1| * 5 = 5

Second substring sum: 1 +1 -1 = 1, penalty |1| * 3 = 3

Total 8 again.

Alternatively, [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First: | -1 | *1 =1

Second: -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =2, |2| *5 =10

Third: 1 -1 =0, |0| *2 =0

Total 11, worse.

So, 8 is better, but the example output is 4. Maybe I'm missing a better split.

Let's try [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First: -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =2, penalty |2| *6 =12

Second: 1 -1 =0, penalty 0

Total 12.

Worse than 8.

Wait, maybe [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

Same as before, total 8.

I need to find a way to get total penalty 4.

Maybe split into [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ]

First: -1 +1 =0, penalty 0

Second: -1 +1 =0, penalty 0

Third: 1 +1 -1 =1, penalty |1| *3 =3

Total 3, which is better than 8, but still not 4.

Wait, 3 is better than 8, but the example output is 4. Maybe I misread.

Wait, no, the example output for this case is 4, but I just got 3, which is better. But according to the example, it's 4. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, if I split into [ -1, 1 ], [ -1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, -1 ], the third substring has sum 1, penalty 3, total 0+0+3=3.

But according to the example, it's 4. Maybe I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps the example output is incorrect, or maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, looking back, the third example has n=6, s=+-+-+-, and the output is 0, which matches my earlier calculation.

The fourth example has n=10, s=--+++++++-, and the output is 4.

But in my calculation, I got 3, which is less than 4, so perhaps my calculation is wrong.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the sum for the third substring.

Let's recalculate:

First substring: [ -1, 1 ] sum=0, penalty 0

Second substring: [ -1, 1 ] sum=0, penalty 0

Third substring: [ 1, 1, -1 ] sum=1, penalty |1| *3 =3

Total penalty=3

But the example output is 4, which is higher. Maybe there's a mistake in the example, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe there's a constraint I didn't consider.

Wait, no, the problem allows splitting into any number of non-empty substrings, as long as their concatenation is the original string.

So, perhaps the example output is incorrect, or maybe I need to reconsider the splitting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to split that gives a lower penalty.

Wait, perhaps splitting into [ -1 ], [ -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First: | -1 | *1 =1

Second: -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =3, |3| *6 =18

Third: 1 -1 =0, |0| *2 =0

Total penalty=19, which is worse than 3.

So, 3 seems better.

Wait, perhaps the example output is wrong, or maybe I misread the string.

Wait, the fourth example input is "--+++++++-", which is n=10.

s = [ -, -, +, +, +, +, +, +, +, - ]

a = [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

Split into [ -1, -1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

First sum: -1 -1 +1 +1 =0, penalty 0

Second sum: 1 +1 +1 -1 =2, penalty |2| *4 =8

Total penalty=8

Wait, that's better than 3? No, 3 is better.

Wait, perhaps the example output is wrong, or maybe I need to look again.

Wait, in the example, n=10, s=--+++++++-, output=4.

But according to my calculation, splitting into [ -1,1 ], [ -1,1 ], [ 1,1,-1 ] gives total penalty 3, which is less than 4.

So, perhaps the example is incorrect, or maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint on the number of splits or something else.

Wait, no, the problem allows any number of splits, as long as it's into non-empty arrays and their concatenation is the original array.

So, I think the example might have a mistake, or perhaps I misread the input string.

Wait, let's check the input again.

Input:

10

--+++++++-

So, n=10, s="--+++++++-"

a = [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1 ]

Split into [ -1,1 ], [ -1,1 ], [ 1,1,-1 ]

Penalties: 0, 0, 3 â†’ total 3

But the example output is 4, which is higher.

So, perhaps there's a better split that gives 4, but 3 is better, so maybe the example is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the penalty.

Wait, let's check the penalty formula again.

Penalty for a substring is |sum of its elements| * length of substring.

In the split [ -1,1 ], [ -1,1 ], [ 1,1,-1 ]

First two have sum 0, penalty 0.

Third has sum 1, length 3, penalty 3.

Total 3.

But the example output is 4, which is higher.

So, perhaps the optimal split is different, giving penalty 4, but 3 is better, so maybe the example is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the input or output.

Wait, perhaps the string is different.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's:

10

--+++++++-

But in my earlier calculation, I considered s="--+++++++-", which is 10 characters.

Wait, no, it's "--+++++++-", which is also 10 characters.

Wait, count: --+++++++- is 10 characters.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's "--+++++++-", which is also 10 characters.

Wait, but in my calculation, splitting into [ -1,1 ], [ -1,1 ], [ 1,1,-1 ] gives total penalty 3, but the example output is 4.

So, perhaps I need to consider different splits.

Wait, maybe splitting into [ -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ], [ 1, -1 ]

First sum: -1 -1 +1 +1 +1 +1 =2, penalty |2| *6 =12

Second sum: 1 -1 =0, penalty 0

Total 12

Worse than 3.

So, 3 seems better.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a mistake in the example output.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the minimal penalty is 3, but the example says 4.

Wait, perhaps there's a misprint in the example output.

Wait, checking the problem statement again, the fifth example has a larger n=20, and output 4.

But for n=10, output is 4, but according to my calculation, it should be 3.

So, perhaps the problem statement has a typo.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the penalty.

Wait, perhaps the penalty is different.

Wait, no, the penalty is |sum of substring| * length of substring.

In my split, [ -1,1 ] sum=0, penalty 0

[ -1,1 ] sum=0, penalty 0

[ 1,1,-1 ] sum=1, penalty 3

Total 3

But according to the problem, it's 4.

So, perhaps the problem expects 4, but according to my calculation, 3 is possible.

Wait, maybe I need to check if there's a split that gives exactly 4, but 3 is better.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a constraint that the splits must be of certain lengths, but no, the problem allows any non-empty splits.

So, I'm a bit confused about this discrepancy.

Anyway, moving forward, I need to find a general solution for any input string.

Looking back, in the first example, n=1, s="+", output=1, which matches my understanding.

Second example, n=5, s="-----", output=5, which also matches splitting into individual elements.

Third example, n=6, s="+-+-+-", output=0, which matches splitting into substrings with sum zero.

Fourth example, n=10, s="--+++++++-", output=4, but according to my calculation, 3 is possible, so perhaps the example is incorrect.

Fifth example, n=20, s="+---++++-+++++---++-", output=4.

I need to find a general approach to minimize the total penalty.

Let me think about dynamic programming, as it's a minimization problem over substrings.

Let's define dp[i] as the minimum total penalty for the substring s[0 to i-1].

Our goal is dp[n].

We can try all possible ways to split the substring s[0 to i-1], i.e., try all possible split points j, where 0 < j < i, and compute dp[j] + penalty for s[j to i-1].

The base case is dp[0] = 0, as there's no substring.

So, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + penalty(s[j to i-1]))

This would have a time complexity of O(n^2), which is acceptable since n <= 5000.

Now, I need a way to calculate the penalty for any substring s[j to i-1].

To calculate the penalty, I need the sum of the substring and its length.

Sum can be calculated using a prefix sum array.

Let's define prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[1] = a[0]

prefix_sum[2] = a[0] + a[1]

...

prefix_sum[k] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]

Then, sum of s[j to i-1] is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

Penalty is |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

So, dp[i] = min over j from 0 to i-1 of (dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j))

This seems correct.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need to compute dp[i] for i from 0 to n, using the above formula.

Given that n can be up to 5000, and t up to 1000, the total time complexity would be O(t * n^2), which is 1000 * 5000^2 = 25 billion operations, which is too slow.

Wait, that's not acceptable.

I need a better approach.

Is there a way to optimize this dynamic programming solution?

Let me see.

Looking back at the examples, in the third example, n=6, s=+-+-+-, the optimal split gives penalty 0, which is achieved by splitting into substrings where each substring has a sum of zero.

In the second example, n=5, s=-----, splitting into individual elements gives penalty 5, which is the minimal possible.

In the fourth example, according to my earlier calculation, splitting into [ -1,1 ], [ -1,1 ], [ 1,1,-1 ] gives penalty 3, but the example output is 4, which is higher.

So, perhaps in some cases, splitting into substrings with sum zero is optimal, and in other cases, it's not possible, so we have to accept some penalty.

Wait, but in the second example, splitting into individual elements is necessary because there are only "-" characters, so each substring has sum -1, and penalty 1.

If I try to make longer substrings, the penalty would be higher because the sum is more negative and the length is longer.

So, in that case, splitting into individual elements is optimal.

In the third example, splitting into substrings with sum zero gives minimal penalty.

In the fourth example, splitting into substrings with sum zero or as close to zero as possible minimizes the penalty.

So, perhaps the general strategy is to split the string into substrings where the sum is zero whenever possible.

But, in cases where the sum cannot be zero, minimize the absolute sum multiplied by the length.

Is there a smarter way to do this without O(n^2) time complexity?

Let me think about it.

Suppose I iterate through the string and keep track of the current sum.

Whenever the sum returns to zero, I can split the substring up to that point, as it has sum zero and penalty zero.

Then, continue with the remaining part.

But, in some cases, it might be better to continue even if the sum is not zero.

For example, in the fourth example, if I split at positions where the sum is zero, I get penalty zero for those parts, and then handle the remaining parts.

But, in practice, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem with slope optimization or some other technique to reduce the time complexity.

Alternatively, maybe there's a greedy approach.

Let me consider the greedy approach.

Start from the beginning of the string and try to extend the current substring as long as possible while keeping the penalty as low as possible.

But I'm not sure how to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the cumulative sum array.

Let's define prefix_sum[0] = 0

prefix_sum[i] = a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[i-1]

Then, for any substring from j to i-1, its sum is prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]

And its penalty is |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j)

So, in the dynamic programming approach, dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j))

This is similar to some DP problems where we can optimize the DP using convex hull or other techniques.

I recall that when the transition cost has a form like |A[i] - A[j]| * C[i][j], where C[i][j] is a function of i and j, sometimes we can optimize the DP using slope tricks.

In particular, this resembles the "minimum sum of absolute differences times a coefficient" problem, which can be solved using a convex hull optimization.

Let me try to see if I can apply such an optimization here.

First, let's rewrite the DP transition:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]| * (i - j))

Let me denote P[i] = prefix_sum[i]

Then,

dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + |P[i] - P[j]| * (i - j))

This looks similar to problems where we can maintain a set of lines and perform point queries.

But, in standard slope trick problems, the transition is often dp[i] = min over j < i of (dp[j] + C * |i - j|), where C is a constant.

In this case, the coefficient is (i - j), which depends on i and j, and it's multiplied by the absolute difference of P[i] and P[j].

This seems more complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that (i - j) is always positive since i > j.

So, |P[i] - P[j]| * (i - j) is always non-negative.

I need to minimize the sum of such terms.

Is there a way to group substrings such that the sum of |sum of substring| * length is minimized?

Wait, perhaps I can consider the difference between consecutive prefix sums.

Wait, perhaps looking at the differences between prefix sums can help.

Let me consider that.

Let's say I have prefix_sum[0], prefix_sum[1], ..., prefix_sum[n]

Then, the sum of a substring from j to i-1 is P[i] - P[j]

And its penalty is |P[i] - P[j]| * (i - j)

I need to choose j for each i to minimize dp[i] = dp[j] + |P[i] - P[j]| * (i - j)

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider two cases: P[i] >= P[j] and P[i] < P[j]

Then, |P[i] - P[j]| = P[i] - P[j] if P[i] >= P[j], else P[j] - P[i]

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of {

dp[j] + (P[i] - P[j]) * (i - j) if P[i] >= P[j]

dp[j] + (P[j] - P[i]) * (i - j) if P[i] < P[j]

}

This can be rewritten as:

dp[i] = min over j < i of {

dp[j] + (P[i] - P[j]) * (i - j) if P[i] >= P[j]

dp[j] + (P[j] - P[i]) * (i - j) if P[i] < P[j]

}

This seems complicated to optimize directly.

Maybe I can consider maintaining two separate minimizations: one for P[j] <= P[i] and one for P[j] > P[i]

Let me define dp1[i] = min over j < i with P[j] <= P[i] of (dp[j] + (P[i] - P[j]) * (i - j))

dp2[i] = min over j < i with P[j] > P[i] of (dp[j] + (P[j] - P[i]) * (i - j))

Then, dp[i] = min(dp1[i], dp2[i])

Now, I need to efficiently compute dp1[i] and dp2[i]

Let me consider dp1[i] = min over j < i with P[j] <= P[i] of (dp[j] + (P[i] - P[j]) * (i - j))

Rearranging terms:

dp1[i] = min over j < i with P[j] <= P[i] of (dp[j] + P[i] * (i - j) - P[j] * (i - j))

= min over j < i with P[j] <= P[i] of (dp[j] - P[j] * (i - j)) + P[i] * (i - j)

Similarly, dp2[i] = min over j < i with P[j] > P[i] of (dp[j] + (P[j] - P[i]) * (i - j))

= min over j < i with P[j] > P[i] of (dp[j] + P[j] * (i - j) - P[i] * (i - j))

= min over j < i with P[j] > P[i] of (dp[j] + P[j] * (i - j)) - P[i] * (i - j)

So, for dp1[i], it's min over j with P[j] <= P[i] of (dp[j] - P[j] * (i - j)) + P[i] * (i - j)

Similarly, dp2[i] = min over j with P[j] > P[i] of (dp[j] + P[j] * (i - j)) - P[i] * (i - j)

This seems a bit messy, but perhaps I can maintain two data structures: one for j where P[j] <= P[i] and one for P[j] > P[i]

Wait, maybe I can sort the j's based on P[j] and use that to find the minimum.

But that would still be O(n^2) in the worst case.

I need a way to optimize this.

Let me consider that for dp1[i], I need to find j < i with P[j] <= P[i], and minimize dp[j] - P[j] * (i - j)

Similarly, for dp2[i], j < i with P[j] > P[i], minimize dp[j] + P[j] * (i - j)

Is there a way to maintain these minima efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can maintain j's in increasing order of P[j], and use a sliding window or some kind of heap.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the fact that (i - j) is positive and think about the slope between points.

This seems similar to the convex hull optimization in DP, where we maintain a set of lines and perform queries on them.

In standard slope trick problems, we deal with minimizing the sum of absolute differences, but here we have an additional factor of (i - j).

This complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can think of (i - j) as a weight, and |P[i] - P[j]| as the difference.

This seems similar to weighted absolute differences.

I need to find a way to minimize the sum of such weighted differences.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty can be achieved by splitting the string into substrings where the sum is as close to zero as possible.

In other words, substrings with sum zero have zero penalty, which is ideal.

So, I should try to maximize the number of such substrings.

But, in practice, it's not always possible to have all substrings sum to zero.

So, perhaps I need to group the "+" and "-" in such a way that the imbalances are minimized, multiplied by the substring lengths.

Wait, perhaps I can look for substrings where the sum is zero or as small as possible in absolute value.

But I need to minimize the sum of |sum| * length over all substrings.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider small values of n and try to find a pattern.

For n=1:

If s="+", dp[1] = 1

If s="-", dp[1] = 1

For n=2:

If s="++", possible splits:

[ "+", "+" ] â†’ 1 + 1 = 2

[ "++" ] â†’ |2| * 2 = 4

So, minimal is 2.

If s="+-", possible splits:

[ "+", "-" ] â†’ 1 + 1 = 2

[ "+-" ] â†’ |0| * 2 = 0

So, minimal is 0.

If s="-+", similar to above.

If s="--", possible splits:

[ "-", "-" ] â†’ 1 + 1 = 2

[ "--" ] â†’ |-2| * 2 = 4

So, minimal is 2.

Wait, but according to the DP approach, dp[2] = min over j=0,1 of (dp[j] + |P[2] - P[j]| * (2 - j))

For j=0: dp[0] + |P[2]
