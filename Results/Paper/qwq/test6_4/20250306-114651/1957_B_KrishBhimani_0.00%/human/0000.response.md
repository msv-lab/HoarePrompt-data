Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to construct a sequence of n non-negative integers that sum up to k. Additionally, I need to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers.

First, I need to understand what the bitwise OR of the sequence does. The bitwise OR of a set of numbers sets a bit in the result to 1 if any of the numbers have that bit set to 1. So, to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the OR, I need to have as many bits set to 1 in the OR result as possible.

Given that, I need to distribute the value k across n numbers such that their sum is k and the OR of these numbers has as many 1 bits as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to try to set as many different bits across the numbers as possible because each unique bit set in any number will contribute to a 1 in the OR's binary representation.

For example, if I have n=2 and k=3, I can choose numbers like 1 and 2. The OR of 1 (binary 01) and 2 (binary 10) is 3 (binary 11), which has two 1s. If I choose 3 and 0, the OR is 3 (binary 11), which is the same. So, in this case, both options give the maximum number of 1s in the OR.

But I need a general strategy. Maybe I can start by identifying all the bits that are set in k and then distribute these bits among the n numbers.

Wait, no. I need to maximize the number of bits set in the OR, not just use the bits from k. But since the numbers have to sum to k, I need to be careful how I distribute the values.

Let me consider the binary representation of k. Suppose k is 5, which is 101 in binary. To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to have as many bits set to 1 in the OR as possible.

If n=1, then the sequence just has one number, which is k itself. So, for n=1, it's straightforward.

For n>1, I can try to distribute the bits across different numbers. For example, if k=5 and n=2, I can have numbers like 1 (01) and 4 (100), whose OR is 5 (101), which has two 1s. Alternatively, I can have 1 (01) and 2 (10), summing to 3, but that doesn't sum to 5. Wait, I need to make sure the sum is k.

Wait, in the example given in the problem, for n=2 and k=5, they have 5 and 0, which sums to 5, and the OR is 5 (101), which has two 1s. Another option could be 4 and 1, which also sum to 5 and OR to 5 (101). So, both are valid.

But is there a way to get more than two 1s in the OR? Let's see. If I choose numbers like 2 (010) and 3 (011), their sum is 5 and OR is 3 (011), which has two 1s. So, it seems that the maximum number of 1s in the OR is two for k=5.

Wait, another example: n=6 and k=51. In the sample output, they have 3,1,1,32,2,12, which sum to 51, and the OR is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 35 (binary 100011), which has five 1s.

So, the strategy seems to be to select numbers that cover as many different bit positions as possible.

To generalize, I need to select numbers that collectively set as many unique bits as possible, while ensuring their sum is k.

One way to approach this is to identify all the bits that are set in k, and then assign each of these bits to different numbers in the sequence, if possible.

For example, if k has m bits set, and n >= m, I can assign each of these m bits to m different numbers, and set the remaining numbers to 0. This way, the OR will have m bits set.

But if n < m, then I need to combine some of these bits into the same numbers.

Wait, but actually, since the OR operation combines all the set bits from any of the numbers, I can assign each set bit to a different number, even if n > m.

Wait, but n can be larger than m, and I need to fill n numbers.

Let me think differently.

First, find the binary representation of k and identify all the bit positions that are set.

Then, for the sequence of n numbers, I need to distribute these set bits across the numbers such that as many unique bits as possible are set in at least one of the numbers.

To maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I should aim to have each number set a unique set of bits, as much as possible.

So, if k has m bits set, and n >= m, I can assign each of the m bits to a different number, and set the remaining n - m numbers to 0.

In this way, the OR will have m bits set, which is the maximum possible.

If n < m, then I need to assign multiple bits to some numbers, but the OR will still have m bits set, as long as each set bit in k is assigned to at least one number.

Wait, but in the case where n < m, I might have to assign multiple bits to some numbers, but as long as each bit is assigned to at least one number, the OR will have all m bits set.

So, in general, the maximum number of 1s in the OR is equal to the number of set bits in k, provided that n is at least the number of set bits in k.

But in the example with n=6 and k=51, k=51 is binary 110011, which has 4 bits set, but the OR in the sample output has 5 bits set. Wait, that seems inconsistent with my current understanding.

Wait, let's check the binary of 51: 51 in binary is 110011, which is 6 bits with 4 set bits.

But in the sample output, the OR of [3,1,1,32,2,12] is 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 35 in decimal, which is binary 100011, which has three 1s.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the OR has five 1s.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Let me compute the OR of 3,1,1,32,2,12.

- 3 is 000011

- 1 is 000001

- 1 is 000001

- 32 is 100000

- 2 is 000010

- 12 is 001100

OR of these is 101111, which is binary 101111, which is decimal 47, and it has five 1s.

Yes, that makes sense now.

So, in this case, even though k=51 has four 1s in binary, the OR of the sequence has five 1s.

Wait, how is that possible? The OR can have more 1s than k itself.

Wait, but k is the sum of the numbers, and the sum is k, but the OR is a different operation.

Wait, but in this case, the OR has more 1s than k because some bits are set in multiple numbers.

Wait, no, the OR sets a bit if any of the numbers have that bit set.

So, it's possible for the OR to have more bits set than k itself, as long as the sum is k.

For example, if I have numbers like 1 (00001), 2 (00010), and 3 (00011), their sum is 6, and their OR is 3 (00011), which has two 1s.

But if I have numbers like 1 (00001), 2 (00010), and 3 (00011), sum is 6, OR is 3 (00011), which has two 1s.

Wait, but in the sample input, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sum to 51 and OR to 47 (101111), which has five 1s.

So, it's possible to have more 1s in the OR than in k itself.

Wait, but k=51 is 110011 (positions 1,4,5), and the OR is 101111 (positions 1,2,3,5), which indeed has an additional bit set in position 3.

So, how is that possible?

Because some numbers in the sequence can have bits that are not set in k, but as long as their sum is k, it's acceptable.

Wait, but in this case, the sum is 3+1+1+32+2+12=51.

And the OR is 101111, which is 47.

But 47 is less than 51, so some bits that are set in k are not set in the OR.

Wait, no, 51 is 110011, and 47 is 101111.

Wait, 51 in binary is 110011, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1 = 51.

47 is 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 47.

Wait, but in the OR, bit positions 0,1,2,4,5 are set.

Wait, but in k=51, bit positions 1,4,5 are set.

So, how did we get additional bits in the OR?

Because some numbers in the sequence have bits set that are not in k, but their sum still adds up to k.

For example, if I have numbers like 3 (000011), 1 (000001), 1 (000001), 32 (100000), 2 (000010), and 12 (001100), their sum is 51, and their OR is 101111 (47), which has bits in positions 1,2,3,4,5 set.

So, even though k doesn't have bit 3 set, some number in the sequence can have bit 3 set, as long as the sum is k.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to include numbers that have bits set that are not necessarily in k, but their sum still reaches k.

Wait, but k is the sum of the sequence, so as long as the numbers sum to k, it's fine.

So, perhaps the strategy is to include as many distinct powers of 2 as possible in the sequence, while ensuring their sum is k.

For example, if k=51, which is 32 + 16 + 2 + 1, but I can choose to split 16 into smaller powers, like 8 + 4 + 4, etc., as long as the sum remains 51.

By doing so, I can set more unique bits in the OR.

Wait, but in the sample input, they have numbers like 3,1,1,32,2,12, which include bits in positions 0,1,2,3,5.

So, to maximize the number of 1s in the OR, I need to include numbers that set as many unique bits as possible.

Hence, the strategy is to include numbers that are distinct powers of 2, as much as possible, while ensuring their sum is k.

But sometimes, I might need to use numbers that are not pure powers of 2, especially when n is larger than the number of set bits in k.

Wait, but in the sample input, they have numbers like 3 (000011), which sets bits 0 and 1, and 12 (001100), which sets bits 2 and 3.

So, perhaps it's better to use numbers that set multiple bits, to cover more bits with fewer numbers.

But the goal is to maximize the number of unique bits set in the OR.

Wait, but in the sample input, they have n=6, and they use numbers like 3,1,1,32,2,12, which set bits 0,1,2,3,5.

But k=51 has bits 1,4,5 set.

So, they are including additional bits in some numbers to maximize the OR.

So, perhaps the strategy is to use the smallest possible numbers to cover as many bits as possible.

Wait, perhaps a greedy approach: start with the smallest possible numbers that set new bits, and fill up the sum to k.

For example, for n=6 and k=51, start with 1, set bit 0.

Then 2, set bit 1.

Then 4, set bit 2.

Then 8, set bit 3.

Then 16, set bit 4.

Then 25, to make the sum 51 (1+2+4+8+16=31, so need 20 more, but 25 is too big.

Wait, need to adjust.

Alternatively, use 1,2,4,8,16, and adjust the last number to make the sum k.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign the required sum to the last number, and assign the smallest possible numbers to the first few numbers to set as many unique bits as possible.

So, for n=6 and k=51:

- Assign 1 (sets bit 0)

- Assign 2 (sets bit 1)

- Assign 4 (sets bit 2)

- Assign 8 (sets bit 3)

- Assign 16 (sets bit 4)

- Assign k - (1+2+4+8+16) = 51 - 2+4+8+16=31, so 51-31=20.

Wait, 1+2+4+8+16=31, so 51-31=20.

So, assign 20 to the last number.

But 20 is 16+4, but 16 is already assigned, so perhaps adjust.

Wait, but in this approach, we're trying to set as many unique bits as possible with the first n-1 numbers, and assign the remaining sum to the last number.

But in this case, 20 is 16+4, but 16 and 4 are already assigned, but it's fine because the OR will still have those bits set.

Wait, but 16 is already set by the earlier number, so adding 16 again doesn't change the OR.

Similarly, adding 4 again doesn't change the OR.

So, perhaps in this case, assigning 20 to the last number is acceptable, because the OR will still have bits 0 through 4 set.

But in the sample input, they have [3,1,1,32,2,12], which sets bits 0,1,2,3,5.

Wait, but k=51 is 110011 (positions 1,4,5), and the OR is 101111 (positions 1,2,3,4,5).

So, they have an extra bit set at position 3.

How is that possible?

Because some numbers in the sequence have bit 3 set, even though k doesn't have bit 3 set.

But since OR is a bitwise OR, it's acceptable as long as the sum is k.

So, in this approach, I need to maximize the number of unique bits set in the OR, regardless of whether those bits are set in k or not, as long as the sum of the numbers is k.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is to assign numbers that are distinct powers of 2, as much as possible, and adjust the last number to make the sum k.

But in the sample input, they have numbers like 3 (000011), 1 (000001), 1 (000001), 32 (100000), 2 (000010), 12 (001100).

So, 3 sets bits 0 and 1, 1 sets bit 0, 1 sets bit 0, 32 sets bit 5, 2 sets bit 1, and 12 sets bits 2 and 3.

The OR of these is 101111, which has bits 1,2,3,4,5 set.

So, in this way, they are setting more bits than just those in k.

But is there a better way to maximize the number of bits set in the OR?

I think this approach is trying to set as many unique bits as possible across the sequence, while ensuring the sum is k.

So, perhaps the general algorithm is:

1. Identify the bits that are set in k.

2. Assign numbers that are distinct powers of 2 corresponding to these bits.

3. If n is larger than the number of set bits in k, assign 0 to the remaining numbers.

But in the sample input, they are assigning numbers that set additional bits beyond those in k.

So, perhaps the algorithm can be:

- Assign the smallest possible distinct numbers that set unique bits, and adjust the last number to make the sum k.

Wait, but in the sample input, they have numbers like 3, which sets bits 0 and 1, and 12, which sets bits 2 and 3.

So, perhaps it's better to assign numbers that set multiple bits if necessary, to cover more bits.

But it's getting a bit complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

l1 = input().split()

(n, k) = list(map(int, l1))

arr = []

k0 = k

i = 0

while k:

if k & 1 == 1:

arr.append(i)

k = k >> 1

i += 1

ans = []

c = 0

for i in arr:

if c == n - 1:

ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))

break

c += 1

ans.append(1 << i)

ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

print(*ans)

So, let's understand this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Initialize an empty list arr.

- Copy k to k0.

- Initialize i to 0.

- While k is not zero:

- If the least significant bit of k is 1, append i to arr.

- Right shift k by 1.

- Increment i by 1.

So, arr contains the indices of the set bits in k, starting from the least significant bit.

For example, if k=5 (101), arr will contain 0 and 2.

Then, it initializes ans as an empty list.

c is a counter, starting at 0.

Then, it iterates over arr:

- If c == n - 1, append (k0 - sum(ans)) to ans and break.

- Else, increment c by 1.

- Append (1 << i) to ans for each i in arr.

Then, it appends zeros to ans if necessary to make its length n.

Finally, print the sequence.

So, in essence, it's assigning the smallest possible numbers that correspond to the set bits in k, and assigning the remainder to the last number in the sequence.

Let's see with an example.

Take n=2, k=5.

arr will be [0,2].

Initialize ans=[].

c=0.

First i=0.

c != 1, so c=1, ans.append(1<<0)=1.

Second i=2.

c ==1 (n-1=1), so append k0 - sum(ans)=5-1=4.

So, ans=[1,4].

Which is valid, since 1 | 4 = 5, which has two 1s.

Another example: n=6, k=51.

k=51 is 110011, so arr=[0,1,4,5].

Initialize ans=[].

c=0.

i=0: c !=5, c=1, ans.append(1<<0)=1.

i=1: c !=5, c=2, ans.append(1<<1)=2.

i=4: c !=5, c=3, ans.append(1<<4)=16.

i=5: c !=5, c=4, ans.append(1<<5)=32.

Then, append zeros to make length 6: ans=[1,2,16,32,0,0].

But sum is 1+2+16+32=51.

OR is 1 | 2 | 16 | 32 | 0 | 0 = 31 (11111), which has five 1s.

Which is similar to the sample output, but the sample output has [3,1,1,32,2,12], which also sums to 51 and has OR with five 1s.

So, both are valid.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

It maximizes the number of unique bits set in the OR by assigning the smallest possible numbers corresponding to the set bits in k, and assigning the remainder to the last number.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
