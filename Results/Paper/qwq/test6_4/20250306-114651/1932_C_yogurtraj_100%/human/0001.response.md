Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array `a` of length `n`, a positive integer `m`, and a string `s` of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command in the string, I need to output the product of the current array elements modulo `m`, and then remove either the leftmost or rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This process is repeated for each command in order, and I have to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what the problem is really asking. For each test case, I have to process a sequence of commands on the array and output a sequence of remainders after taking the product of the array elements modulo `m`. After each command, I remove an element from the array, so the array gets smaller each time until it's empty.

I need to make sure that my solution is efficient because the constraints are quite large. The number of test cases can be up to 10,000, and the array can be up to 200,000 elements long, with the total sum of all `n` across test cases being up to 200,000. So, I need an algorithm that's linear per test case, or at least very efficient.

Let me think about how to approach this. The straightforward way would be, for each command, to calculate the product of the current array modulo `m` and then remove the appropriate element. However, calculating the product from scratch each time would be too slow because it would be O(n^2), which is not acceptable for n up to 200,000 in total.

I need a smarter way to keep track of the product as I remove elements from either end. One idea is to precompute the product of all elements and then, as I remove elements, divide the product by the removed element and take modulo `m`. However, division in modular arithmetic is not straightforward unless `m` is a prime or I can compute modular inverses, which might be complicated and time-consuming.

Another approach is to maintain two products: one from the left and one from the right, and keep track of how many elements I've removed from each side. But I'm not sure if that's the best way.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the process backwards. That is, start from the end of the sequence of commands and build up the product step by step. Since I know the entire sequence of commands in advance, maybe I can process them in reverse and keep track of the product accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this idea. If I process the commands in reverse, I can start from the last command and build the product by adding elements that would have been removed last. This way, I can maintain the current product and update it as I "undo" the removals.

So, for the last command, the array has only one element left, and the product is simply that element modulo `m`. Then, for the previous command, I add back the element that was removed and update the product accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to keep track of which elements are still in the array at each step. But that seems inefficient.

Let's look at the example provided to see if that gives me any insight.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

The output is: 0 2 4 1

Let's see what's happening step by step.

1. Initial array: [3, 1, 4, 2]

Product: 3*1*4*2 = 24, 24 mod 6 = 0

Command: 'L', remove leftmost element (3)

Array becomes: [1, 4, 2]

2. Product: 1*4*2 = 8, 8 mod 6 = 2

Command: 'R', remove rightmost element (2)

Array becomes: [1, 4]

3. Product: 1*4 = 4, 4 mod 6 = 4

Command: 'R', remove rightmost element (4)

Array becomes: [1]

4. Product: 1, 1 mod 6 = 1

Command: 'L', remove leftmost element (1)

Array becomes empty.

So, the outputs are: 0, 2, 4, 1

Now, thinking about how to compute this efficiently.

I need to compute the product of the current array modulo m at each step.

If I can maintain the product of the current array, and update it efficiently when removing elements, that would be ideal.

But directly dividing is problematic in modular arithmetic.

Another idea: Since we're removing elements from either end, perhaps I can use prefix and suffix products.

Let me define:

- prefix[i]: product of first i elements modulo m

- suffix[i]: product of last i elements modulo m

But I'm not sure if that directly helps, because as I remove elements from one end, the prefix or suffix products change.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the elements that are still present in the array.

Suppose I have two pointers, one for the left and one for the right, indicating the current range of the array that's still present.

As I process each command, I remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element, adjusting the pointers accordingly.

I need a way to compute the product of the elements between these two pointers, modulo m.

Computing this directly for each step would be too slow.

Is there a way to maintain this product efficiently?

Let me consider processing the commands in order and maintaining the current product.

Initially, the product is a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[n-1] modulo m.

For each command:

- Output the current product modulo m.

- Remove the leftmost or rightmost element, depending on the command.

- Update the product accordingly.

The problem is updating the product when removing an element.

If I remove an element, I need to divide the product by that element, but in modular arithmetic, division is not straightforward.

One way to handle this is to compute the modular inverse of the removed element and multiply the product by this inverse.

But computing the inverse for each removal would be inefficient if done naively, especially since m can be up to 10^4 and n up to 2*10^5.

There must be a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the inverses of all elements.

Since a[i] are up to 10^4, and m is up to 10^4, I can precompute the inverses if they exist.

But not all numbers have inverses modulo m unless m is prime.

In this problem, m can be any positive integer, not necessarily prime.

So, this might not work.

I need another approach.

Let me consider the fact that I'm removing elements from either end, and the sequence of removals is given in advance.

Maybe I can process the removals in order and keep track of the product dynamically.

But I still face the problem of efficiently updating the product when removing an element.

Another idea: Instead of maintaining the product of the entire array, maintain the product of the remaining elements.

Wait, that's essentially the same.

I need a way to update the product quickly when removing an element.

Perhaps I can precompute the prefix products and suffix products modulo m, and then for each step, calculate the product of the remaining elements using these precomputed values.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define:

- prefix[0] = 1

- prefix[1] = a[0]

- prefix[2] = a[0]*a[1] mod m

- ...

- prefix[k] = (a[0]*a[1]*...*a[k-1]) mod m

Similarly, define suffix[k] = (a[n-k]*...*a[n-1]) mod m

Then, at any step, the product of the current array is prefix[l] * suffix[r] mod m, where l and r are the number of elements removed from the left and right, respectively.

Wait, no. Actually, the product of the current array would be prefix[l] * suffix[r] mod m only if the remaining array is a[l] to a[n-r-1], but I need to make sure that the product is correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two pointers, left and right, indicating the current range of the array that's still present.

Initially, left = 0 and right = n-1.

At each step:

- Output the product of a[left] to a[right] modulo m.

- If the command is 'L', set left += 1

- If the command is 'R', set right -= 1

The problem is computing the product of a[left] to a[right] modulo m efficiently for each step.

If I precompute the prefix products:

prefix[0] = 1

prefix[1] = a[0]

prefix[2] = a[0]*a[1] mod m

...

prefix[k] = (a[0]*a[1]*...*a[k-1]) mod m

Similarly, suffix[k] = (a[n-k]*...*a[n-1]) mod m

Then, the product of a[left] to a[right] can be computed as prefix[right+1] * inverse(prefix[left]) mod m, provided that inverse exists.

But again, inverses may not exist for all numbers modulo m.

So, this seems problematic.

I need another way.

Let me consider that m can be up to 10^4, which is manageable for factorization.

Maybe I can factorize m into its prime factors and handle each prime separately, then use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results.

But this seems too complicated for this problem, and it might not lead to a simpler solution.

Is there a way to avoid division altogether?

Wait, perhaps I can process the commands in reverse, starting from the end when the array is empty, and simulate adding elements back in.

Wait, in reverse, I would be adding elements back to the array, and keeping track of the product as I do so.

This might be a better approach.

Let me try this.

Start from the last command, where the array has only one element left.

The product is simply that one element modulo m.

Then, for the previous command, I would be adding back either the leftmost or rightmost element that was removed.

So, I can keep track of the current product and update it by multiplying it by the added back element, modulo m.

Wait, but in reverse, adding back an element corresponds to multiplying the current product by the element being added back.

This seems promising.

Let me try this with the first example.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[3,1,4,2]

s="LRRL"

Let's reverse the sequence of commands:

Last command: 'L' -> in reverse, I add back the leftmost element that was removed last, which is a[1]=1.

Before that, the array was [1,4,2], and I removed the leftmost element, which is a[1]=1.

So, in reverse, I add back a[1]=1 to the left.

Similarly, before that, the array was [4,2], and I removed the rightmost element, which is a[3]=2.

In reverse, I add back a[3]=2 to the right.

And so on.

Wait, maybe I need to keep track of which elements are being added back in reverse order.

This seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to compute the product for each step without explicitly removing elements each time.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of the entire array, then update it as I remove elements.

But again, removing elements requires division in modular arithmetic, which is tricky.

I need a better approach.

Let me look at the code provided and see if I can understand what it's doing.

The code is:

def func():

for ii in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

t = input()

l = t.count('L')

k = 0

q1 = 0

q2 = 0

if t[-1] == 'L':

k = a[l - 1] % m

q1 = l - 2

q2 = l

else:

k = a[l] % m

q1 = l - 1

q2 = l + 1

y = [0] * n

y[-1] = k

for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):

if t[i] == 'R':

k = k * a[q2] % m

q2 += 1

else:

k = k * a[q1] % m

q1 -= 1

y[i] = k

print(*y)

So, the code reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, m, the array a, and the string t of commands.

It counts the number of 'L's in t and stores it in l.

Then, it initializes k, q1, and q2 based on the last command.

If the last command is 'L', it sets k to a[l-1] % m, q1 to l-2, and q2 to l.

Otherwise, it sets k to a[l] % m, q1 to l-1, and q2 to l+1.

Then, it initializes a list y with n zeros and sets y[-1] to k.

Then, it loops from n-2 down to 0:

- If t[i] is 'R', it multiplies k by a[q2] % m and increments q2

- Else, it multiplies k by a[q1] % m and decrements q1

- Sets y[i] to k

Finally, it prints the elements of y separated by spaces.

I need to understand what this code is doing.

It seems like it's trying to compute the product in reverse, as I was thinking earlier.

Let me try to see how this corresponds to the first test case.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=6

a=[3,1,4,2]

t="LRRL"

l = t.count('L') = 2

So, l=2

Last command is 'L', so k = a[1] % 6 = 1 % 6 = 1

q1 = 0

q2 = 2

y = [0,0,0,1]

Then, i=2:

t[2] = 'R'

k = 1 * a[2] % 6 = 1 * 4 % 6 = 4

q2 = 3

y[2] = 4

Then, i=1:

t[1] = 'R'

k = 4 * a[3] % 6 = 4 * 2 % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2

q2 = 4

y[1] = 2

Then, i=0:

t[0] = 'L'

k = 2 * a[0] % 6 = 2 * 3 % 6 = 6 % 6 = 0

q1 = -1

y[0] = 0

So, y = [0,2,4,1], which matches the example output.

Okay, so this seems to be working.

But I need to understand why this works.

It seems like it's building the product from the end to the beginning.

Let me try to generalize this approach.

First, count the number of 'L's in the command string, let's call it l.

This represents the total number of left removals.

Then, depending on the last command:

- If it's 'L', the last element left in the array is a[l-1], because 'L' removes from the left.

- If it's 'R', the last element left is a[l].

So, initialize k to a[l-1] % m or a[l] % m accordingly.

Then, set up pointers q1 and q2 to track the next elements to add.

In the loop from n-2 down to 0:

- If the current command is 'R', it means that in the forward process, we removed the rightmost element, so in reverse, we're adding back the rightmost element that was removed. So, multiply k by a[q2] % m and increment q2.

- If the current command is 'L', it means we're adding back the leftmost element that was removed. So, multiply k by a[q1] % m and decrement q1.

This way, we're building the product step by step, starting from the last step and moving backward.

This seems correct, as it matches the example.

I need to make sure that this logic holds for other cases as well.

Let's consider the second test case:

n=5, m=1

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

s="LLLLL"

Output: 0 0 0 0 0

Since m=1, any product modulo 1 is 0, which matches the output.

Third test case:

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s="RLLLRR"

Output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

Let's see:

l = s.count('L') = 3

Last command is 'R', so k = a[3] % 8 = 4 % 8 = 4

q1 = 2

q2 = 4

y = [0,0,0,4,4,4]

Then, for i=4, t[4]='L', so k = 4 * a[2] % 8 = 4 * 3 % 8 = 12 % 8 = 4, q1=1

y[4]=4

for i=3, t[3]='L', k=4 * a[1] % 8 = 4 * 2 % 8 = 8 % 8 = 0, q1=0

y[3]=0

for i=2, t[2]='L', k=0 * a[0] % 8 = 0 * 1 % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0, q1=-1

y[2]=0

for i=1, t[1]='R', k=0 * a[4] % 8 = 0 * 5 % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0, q2=5

y[1]=0

for i=0, t[0]='R', k=0 * a[5] % 8 = 0 * 6 % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0, q2=6

y[0]=0

Wait, but the expected output is 0 0 0 4 4 4, but according to this, it should be 0 0 0 0 0 0. There's a discrepancy here.

Hmm, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the third test case:

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s="RLLLRR"

l = s.count('L') = 3

Last command is 'R', so k = a[3] % 8 = 4 % 8 = 4

q1 = 2

q2 = 4

y = [0,0,0,4,4,4]

Then, for i=4 (command 'L'), k = 4 * a[2] % 8 = 4 * 3 % 8 = 12 % 8 = 4, q1=1

y[4]=4

for i=3 (command 'L'), k = 4 * a[1] % 8 = 4 * 2 % 8 = 8 % 8 = 0, q1=0

y[3]=0

for i=2 (command 'L'), k = 0 * a[0] % 8 = 0 * 1 % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0, q1=-1

y[2]=0

for i=1 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[4] % 8 = 0 * 5 % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0, q2=5

y[1]=0

for i=0 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[5] % 8 = 0 * 6 % 8 = 0 % 8 = 0, q2=6

y[0]=0

But the expected output is 0 0 0 4 4 4, which doesn't match. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in my understanding.

Wait, maybe I miscounted the indices.

Let's see:

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6] (indices 0 to 5)

s="RLLLRR"

l = 3

Last command is 'R', so k = a[3] % 8 = 4 % 8 = 4

q1 = l-1 = 2

q2 = l+1 = 4

y = [0,0,0,4,4,4]

Then, for i=4 (command 'L'), k = k * a[q1] % m = 4 * a[2] % 8 = 4*3=12%8=4, q1=1

y[4]=4

for i=3 (command 'L'), k = 4 * a[1] % 8 = 4*2=8%8=0, q1=0

y[3]=0

for i=2 (command 'L'), k = 0 * a[0] % 8 = 0*1=0%8=0, q1=-1

y[2]=0

for i=1 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[4] % 8 = 0*5=0%8=0, q2=5

y[1]=0

for i=0 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[5] % 8 = 0*6=0%8=0, q2=6

y[0]=0

But the expected output is 0 0 0 4 4 4, which doesn't match. So, perhaps there's an error in the code.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust how q1 and q2 are initialized.

Let me look back at the code:

if t[-1] == 'L':

k = a[l - 1] % m

q1 = l - 2

q2 = l

else:

k = a[l] % m

q1 = l - 1

q2 = l + 1

y = [0] * n

y[-1] = k

for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):

if t[i] == 'R':

k = k * a[q2] % m

q2 += 1

else:

k = k * a[q1] % m

q1 -= 1

y[i] = k

print(*y)

In the third test case:

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s="RLLLRR"

l = 3

Last command is 'R', so k = a[3] % 8 = 4

q1 = 2

q2 = 4

y = [0,0,0,4,4,4]

Then, for i=4 (command 'L'), k = k * a[q1] % m = 4 * 3 % 8 = 12 % 8 = 4, q1=1

y[4]=4

for i=3 (command 'L'), k = 4 * a[1] % 8 = 4*2=8%8=0, q1=0

y[3]=0

for i=2 (command 'L'), k = 0 * a[0] % 8 = 0*1=0%8=0, q1=-1

y[2]=0

for i=1 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[4] % 8 = 0*5=0%8=0, q2=5

y[1]=0

for i=0 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[5] % 8 = 0*6=0%8=0, q2=6

y[0]=0

But the expected output is 0 0 0 4 4 4, which suggests that perhaps the initialization is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that l is the number of 'L's, which indicates how many left removals there are.

The total number of left removals is l, so the number of right removals is n - l.

In the end, when only one element is left, its position depends on the sequence of 'L's and 'R's.

Perhaps I need to find the index of the last remaining element.

Wait, perhaps I can find the index of the last remaining element and set k to that element, then build up the product from there.

Alternatively, maybe I need to simulate the process to find out which element is last remaining, but that would be O(n) per test case, which is too slow.

Wait, but in the code, l is simply the count of 'L's, which may not directly correspond to the index of the last remaining element.

Maybe I need to track the range of the array that's still present.

Let me consider maintaining two pointers, left and right, initialized to 0 and n-1, respectively.

Then, for each command:

- If 'L', remove a[left], left +=1

- If 'R', remove a[right], right -=1

The product at each step is the product of a[left:right+1].

But computing this product directly each time is too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the product of the entire array, then divide by the removed elements appropriately.

But again, division in modular arithmetic is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all elements, and then for each step, divide by the product of the removed elements.

But I still need to handle modular inverses, which might not exist for all m.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be building the product from the end, multiplying by the appropriate elements based on the commands.

In the third test case, it's producing [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the expected output is [0,0,0,4,4,4].

This suggests that there might be an error in the code.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the initial value of k differently.

Let me consider that k should be the product of the last remaining element.

In the third test case, with s="RLLLRR", let's simulate the process:

Initial array: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Command 'R': remove rightmost element (6), product=1*2*3*4*5=120, 120%8=0

Command 'L': remove leftmost element (1), array=[2,3,4,5], product=2*3*4*5=120%8=0

Command 'L': remove leftmost element (2), array=[3,4,5], product=3*4*5=60%8=4

Command 'L': remove leftmost element (3), array=[4,5], product=4*5=20%8=4

Command 'R': remove rightmost element (5), array=[4], product=4%8=4

Command 'R': remove rightmost element (4), array empty

So, the outputs should be: 0,0,4,4,4,0

Wait, but the example output is 0 0 0 4 4 4.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Let me simulate again:

Start: [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Command 'R': remove 6, array=[1,2,3,4,5], product=1*2*3*4*5=120%8=0

Command 'L': remove 1, array=[2,3,4,5], product=2*3*4*5=120%8=0

Command 'L': remove 2, array=[3,4,5], product=3*4*5=60%8=4

Command 'L': remove 3, array=[4,5], product=4*5=20%8=4

Command 'R': remove 5, array=[4], product=4%8=4

Command 'R': remove 4, array empty

So, the outputs should be: 0,0,0,4,4,4

Which matches the example output.

But according to my earlier simulation with the code, it produced [0,0,0,0,0,0], which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simulating the code.

Let's re-examine the code with the third test case.

n=6, m=8

a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]

s="RLLLRR"

l = s.count('L') = 3

Last command is 'R', so k = a[l] % m = a[3] % 8 = 4 % 8 = 4

q1 = l -1 = 2

q2 = l +1 = 4

y = [0,0,0,4,4,4]

Then, for i=4 (command 'L'), k = k * a[q1] % m = 4 * a[2] % 8 = 4*3%8=12%8=4, q1=1

y[4]=4

for i=3 (command 'L'), k = 4 * a[1] % 8 = 4*2%8=8%8=0, q1=0

y[3]=0

for i=2 (command 'L'), k = 0 * a[0] % 8 = 0*1%8=0%8=0, q1=-1

y[2]=0

for i=1 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[q2] % m = 0 * a[4] % 8 = 0*5%8=0%8=0, q2=5

y[1]=0

for i=0 (command 'R'), k = 0 * a[5] % 8 = 0*6%8=0%8=0, q2=6

y[0]=0

So, y=[0,0,0,4,4,4], which matches the expected output.

Wait, but according to my earlier manual simulation, the outputs should be 0,0,0,4,4,4.

So, the code seems to be correct in this case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in simulating the manual process.

Let me try again.

Start with array [1,2,3,4,5,6]

Command 'R': remove rightmost (6), array=[1,2,3,4,5], product=1*2*3*4*5=120%8=0

Command 'L': remove leftmost (1), array=[2,3,4,5], product=2*3*4*5=120%8=0

Command 'L': remove leftmost (2), array=[3,4,5], product=3*4*5=60%8=4

Command 'L': remove leftmost (3), array=[4,5], product=4*5=20%8=4

Command 'R': remove rightmost (5), array=[4], product=4%8=4

Command 'R': remove rightmost (4), array empty

So, outputs are: 0,0,0,4,4,4

Which matches the code's output.

Earlier, I thought there was a discrepancy, but actually, it's correct.

So, the code seems to be working correctly.

Let me check another test case.

Fourth test case:

n=1, m=10000

a=[10000]

s="R"

Output: 0

Let's see:

l = s.count('L') = 0

Last command is 'R', so k = a[0] % 10000 = 10000 % 10000 = 0

q1 = -1

q2 = 1

y = [0]

So, y=[0], which matches the expected output.

Seems correct.

So, overall, the code appears to be correct.

But to be thorough, let me think about edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=1, m=1, a=[1], s="L"

Expected output: 0

Because 1 % 1 = 0

Code:

l = 1 (since s="L")

k = a[0] % 1 = 1 % 1 = 0

y=[0]

Correct.

Edge case 2: n=2, m=5, a=[2,3], s="LR"

Process:

Command 'L': remove 2, array=[3], product=3%5=3

Command 'R': remove 3, array empty, product=1%5=1

Expected output: 6%5=1, 3%5=3

Wait, product of [2,3]=6%5=1, then remove 2, product=3%5=3

So, output should be 1 3

Let's see what the code does:

l = 1 (one 'L')

Last command is 'R', so k = a[1] % 5 = 3%5=3

q1=0

q2=2

y=[0,3]

Then, for i=1 (command 'L'), k = k * a[0] % 5 = 3*2%5=6%5=1, q1=-1

y[1]=1

for i=0 (command 'R'), k = 1 * a[2] % 5 = 1* (a[2] doesn't exist, index out of range)

Wait, a has only two elements, a[0]=2, a[1]=3

q2=2 is out of range.

This seems like an error.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how q2 is initialized.

In the code, q2 is set to l+1, which is 1+1=2, which is out of range for a.

So, in this case, when n=2, l=1, s="LR", a=[2,3]

According to the code:

k = a[1] % 5 = 3

q1=0

q2=2

y=[0,3]

Then, for i=1, t[i]='L', k = k * a[q1] % m = 3*2%5=6%5=1, q1=-1

y[1]=1

for i=0, t[i]='R', k = k * a[q2] % m = 1 * a[2] % 5, but a[2] doesn't exist.

This is an error.

So, the code has a bug in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the initialization of q2.

Maybe q2 should be initialized to l, not l+1.

Let me modify the code slightly.

if t[-1] == 'L':

k = a[l - 1] % m

q1 = l - 2

q2 = l

else:

k = a[l] % m

q1 = l - 1

q2 = l + 1

But in this case, l=1, last command 'R', so k = a[1] % 5 = 3

q1=0

q2=2

Which leads to an index out of range.

So, perhaps I need to adjust q2 to be l, not l+1.

Let me try modifying the code:

if t[-1] == 'L':

k = a[l - 1] % m

q1 = l - 2

q2 = l

else:

k = a[l] % m

q1 = l - 1

q2 = l + 1

But in this case, l=1, last command 'R', so k = a[1] % 5 = 3

q1=0

q2=2

Which is out of range.

So, perhaps in the loop, when t[i]=='R', q2 should be l, not l+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe q2 should be initialized to l, and then incremented when t[i]=='R'.

In the above case, n=2, l=1, s="LR"

Initialize k = a[1] % 5 = 3

q1=0

q2=1

y=[0,3]

Then, for i=1, t[i]='L', k = k * a[q1] % m = 3*2%5=6%5=1, q1=-1

y[1]=1

for i=0, t[i
