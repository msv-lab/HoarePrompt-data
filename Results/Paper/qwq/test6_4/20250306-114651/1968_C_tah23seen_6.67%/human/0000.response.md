Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements from a_1 to a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. Each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

2. For each i from 2 to n, x_i should be equal to a_i modulo a_{i-1}.

And I need to do this for multiple test cases, with constraints on the input sizes.

First, I need to understand what the modulo operation means in this context. The modulo operation gives the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

My goal is to find values for a_1 to a_n that satisfy this relationship for each x_i.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Starting with a_1, since there's no a_0, I can choose a_1 freely as long as it's within the range. But actually, a_1 doesn't depend on any other a, so I can choose it based on x_2.

Given that x_2 = a_2 % a_1, I need to find a_1 and a_2 such that this holds.

One way to think about this is to choose a_1 such that a_2 % a_1 = x_2.

I can choose a_1 to be greater than x_2, because the remainder when dividing by a_1 should be less than a_1. So, a_1 should be at least x_2 + 1 to make x_2 = a_2 % a_1 possible.

For example, if x_2 = 2, I can choose a_1 = 3. Then, a_2 can be 5, because 5 % 3 = 2.

Wait, but a_2 can also be 5 + 3*k for any integer k, because (5 + 3*k) % 3 = 2.

So, to keep a_2 as small as possible, I can choose a_2 = x_2 + a_1.

But I need to make sure that a_2 is within 1 to 10^9.

Let me try to generalize this.

Let's say I set a_1 = x_2 + 1. Then, a_2 = x_2 + a_1 = x_2 + x_2 + 1 = 2*x_2 + 1.

Then, x_3 = a_3 % a_2. So, a_3 should be such that a_3 % a_2 = x_3.

Similarly, I can set a_3 = x_3 + a_2.

And so on, for each a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}.

Wait, but is this always going to work?

Let me check with the first example in the problem.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

According to my approach:

a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

a_2 = x_2 + a_1 = 2 + 3 = 5

a_3 = x_3 + a_2 = 4 + 5 = 9

a_4 = x_4 + a_3 = 1 + 9 = 10

But in the sample output, a_4 is 9, not 10.

Wait, in the sample output, a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Wait, so a_3 = 4, which is different from my calculation.

Wait, in my approach, a_3 = x_3 + a_2 = 4 + 5 = 9, but in the sample, a_3 = 4.

Hmm, so my initial approach doesn't match the sample output.

Maybe my approach is too simplistic.

Let me think differently.

Given x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}, I need to find a_i such that when divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

So, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k >= 0.

My previous approach sets k = 1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But in the sample, a_3 = 4, a_2 = 5, and x_3 = 4.

So, 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3 = 4.

But according to my formula, a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9, which also satisfies 9 % 5 = 4.

So both 4 and 9 are valid for a_3, given a_2 = 5 and x_3 = 4.

But the sample output chose a_3 = 4.

So, my approach of setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i is valid, but not the only possible solution.

The problem says "any" array a that satisfies the conditions, so both are acceptable.

But perhaps there are cases where setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i leads to a_i exceeding 10^9, given the constraints.

Wait, n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500, so a_i could be up to around 500*500 = 250,000, which is well below 10^9.

But to be safe, I should ensure that a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

Alternatively, I can choose a_{i-1} such that a_i is minimized.

But the problem doesn't require a_i to be minimized, just to be within the range.

Let me look at the second test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Sample output: 2 5 11

So, a_1 = 2, a_2 = 5, a_3 = 11

Check:

5 % 2 = 1 (matches x_2 = 1)

11 % 5 = 1 (matches x_3 = 1)

In my previous approach:

a_1 = x_2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

a_2 = x_2 + a_1 = 1 + 2 = 3

a_3 = x_3 + a_2 = 1 + 3 = 4

But the sample output has a_3 = 11, which is also valid because 11 % 5 = 1.

So again, multiple solutions are possible.

I need to find any a that satisfies the conditions.

Perhaps I should stick with my initial approach of a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let me verify if this always works.

Assume a_1 = x_2 + 1

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = (x_2 + 1) + x_2 = 2*x_2 + 1

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = (2*x_2 + 1) + x_3

a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = (2*x_2 + 1 + x_3) + x_4

And so on.

This seems to work, but maybe there are cases where a_i < x_i, which would violate the modulo condition.

Wait, no, since a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, and a_{i-1} >= x_i + 1 (because a_{i-1} = x_{i-1} + 1 + previous terms), so a_i should always be greater than x_i.

Wait, maybe I need to think recursively.

Let me try to formalize this.

Set a_1 = x_2 + 1

Then, for each i from 2 to n:

a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i

Then, x_i = a_i - a_{i-1}

But x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}

So, a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i - a_{i-1}

Which implies that a_i - a_{i-1} = a_i % a_{i-1}

This is true because a_i = q * a_{i-1} + (a_i - a_{i-1}), where q is the quotient.

Wait, but if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, which is not equal to a_i - a_{i-1}.

So, my approach assumes that a_i >= a_{i-1}, which may not always hold.

Wait, in the sample input, a_3 = 4 and a_2 = 5, so a_3 < a_{i-1}, and x_3 = 4.

This works because 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3.

So, my initial approach of setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i assumes a_i >= a_{i-1}, but in some cases, a_i can be less than a_{i-1}, as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

So, my approach might not cover all possible cases, but it's a valid approach as long as it satisfies the conditions.

Given that, perhaps I should stick with it, since it's simple and ensures that a_i >= x_i + 1, which should be sufficient.

Let me check the constraints:

n can be up to 500, t up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, time complexity should be O(n) per test case, which is acceptable.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func_1(arr, n):

ans = [0] * n

ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

for i in range(n - 2):

ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:

while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]

return ans

So, it initializes ans[0] = x_2 + 1, which matches my initial approach.

Then, for i from 0 to n-3:

ans[i+1] = x_{i+2} + ans[i]

If ans[i+1] < x_{i+2}, it enters a loop where it keeps adding ans[i] to ans[i+1] until ans[i+1] > x_{i+2}.

Finally, ans[-1] = ans[-2] + x_n

I need to understand why this is done.

I think the condition ans[i+1] < x_{i+2} is to ensure that ans[i+1] >= x_{i+2}, because in the modulo operation, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, and a_i should be >= x_i.

But actually, in modulo operation, a_i can be less than a_{i-1}, as long as a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

For example, a_i = x_i if a_i < a_{i-1}.

So, the condition ans[i+1] < x_{i+2} might not be necessary.

In the sample input, for n=4, x=[2,4,1]:

ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3

ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5, which is > 4, so no loop

ans[2] = 4 + 5 = 9

ans[3] = 9 + 1 = 10

But in the sample output, a_4 is 9, not 10.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the function.

Looking back at the function, it sets ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1], which corresponds to a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n.

But in the sample, a_4 = 9, which is a_{n-1} + x_n - a_{n-1}, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the sample, a_4 = 9, which is a_{n-1} + x_n = 5 + 4 = 9.

Wait, no, x_n is x_4 = 1, so ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1] = 9 + 1 = 10, but sample has 9.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the function or in the sample.

Wait, in the sample, a = [3,5,4,9], which matches:

a_1 = 3

a_2 = 5

a_3 = 4

a_4 = 9

But according to the function, it would be [3,5,9,10], but the sample is [3,5,4,9].

So, perhaps the function is incorrect.

Wait, but the problem says "any" a that satisfies the conditions, so multiple solutions are possible.

In the function, it seems that sometimes it enters a loop to increase ans[i+1] if it's less than x_{i+2}.

But I'm not sure why that's necessary.

Let me consider a case where ans[i+1] < x_{i+2}.

Suppose n=3, x=[1,2]

According to the function:

ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3, which is > 2, so no loop

ans[2] = 3 + 2 = 5

So, a = [2,3,5]

Check:

3 % 2 = 1 (matches x_2=1)

5 % 3 = 2 (matches x_3=2)

This works.

Another case: n=3, x=[2,1]

ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3

ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5

ans[2] = 5 + 1 = 6

Check:

5 % 3 = 2 (matches x_2=2)

6 % 5 = 1 (matches x_3=1)

Works.

Another case: n=3, x=[3,1]

ans[0] = 3 + 1 = 4

ans[1] = 3 + 4 = 7

ans[2] = 7 + 1 = 8

Check:

7 % 4 = 3 (matches x_2=3)

8 % 7 = 1 (matches x_3=1)

Works.

Wait, what if x=[1,1]

ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3

ans[2] = 3 + 1 = 4

Check:

3 % 2 = 1 (matches x_2=1)

4 % 3 = 1 (matches x_3=1)

Which matches the sample output of [2,5,11], but [2,3,4] also works.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

Now, what if x=[1,2,3]

n=4

ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3

ans[2] = 2 + 3 = 5

ans[3] = 5 + 3 = 8

Check:

3 % 2 = 1 (matches x_2=1)

5 % 3 = 2 (matches x_3=2)

8 % 5 = 3 (matches x_4=3)

Works.

Another case: x=[2,1,1]

ans[0] = 2 + 1 = 3

ans[1] = 2 + 3 = 5

ans[2] = 1 + 5 = 6

ans[3] = 6 + 1 = 7

Check:

5 % 3 = 2 (matches x_2=2)

6 % 5 = 1 (matches x_3=1)

7 % 6 = 1 (matches x_4=1)

Works.

Wait, what if x=[3,2,1]

ans[0] = 3 + 1 = 4

ans[1] = 3 + 4 = 7

ans[2] = 2 + 7 = 9

ans[3] = 9 + 1 = 10

Check:

7 % 4 = 3 (matches x_2=3)

9 % 7 = 2 (matches x_3=2)

10 % 9 = 1 (matches x_4=1)

Works.

Seems consistent.

But let's consider a case where ans[i+1] < x_{i+2}.

Suppose x=[1,3]

n=3

ans[0] = 1 + 1 = 2

ans[1] = 1 + 2 = 3

ans[2] = 3 + 3 = 6

Check:

3 % 2 = 1 (matches x_2=1)

6 % 3 = 0, but x_3=3, which is not matching.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, x_3=3, but 6 % 3 = 0, which is not equal to 3.

So, in this case, the function would set ans[1]=3, and ans[2]=3+3=6.

But 6 % 3 = 0 != 3.

So, this doesn't work.

Wait, but according to the problem, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}, and a_i % a_{i-1} can't be equal to a_{i-1} unless a_i >= 2*a_{i-1}.

Wait, no, a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, and x_i < a_{i-1}, generally, unless a_i >= k*a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k.

Wait, but in this case, x_i=3 and a_{i-1}=3, so a_i % 3 = 3 is impossible because the modulo is always less than the divisor.

Unless a_i < a_{i-1}, but then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, so if a_i =3, a_i % 3=0, not 3.

Wait, but if a_i < a_{i-1}, then a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i.

So, to have a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, if x_i >= a_{i-1}, that's impossible.

Wait, but in this case, x_i=3 and a_{i-1}=3, so x_i >= a_{i-1}, which is invalid.

So, perhaps I need to ensure that x_i < a_{i-1}.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that x_i < a_{i-1}; it's part of the output.

So, perhaps in this case, no solution exists, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that a solution exists, so maybe such cases aren't present in the input.

But according to the constraints, 1 <= x_i <= 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9.

Wait, but in the earlier example, x_i=3 and a_{i-1}=3, which is invalid.

So, perhaps I need to handle cases where x_i >= a_{i-1}.

Looking back at the function, it has a condition:

if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:

while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

So, in the earlier example, ans[1]=3, arr[1]=3, ans[1] <= arr[1], so it enters the loop and adds ans[i]=3 to ans[1] repeatedly until ans[1] > arr[1].

So, ans[1] starts at 3, adds 3 to become 6, which is still <= 3 (no, wait, the condition is while ans[i+1] <= arr[i+1], so 6 > 3, so it stops.

Wait, but in the earlier example, arr[1]=3, ans[1]=3, enters the loop, adds ans[i]=2 to ans[1], making ans[1]=5, which is > arr[1]=3, so stops.

Wait, no, in that case, arr[1]=3, ans[1]=3, ans[i]=2.

Wait, in the function, arr is x_2 to x_n, so arr[i] is x_{i+1}.

Wait, let's clarify indices.

Given arr = [x_2, x_3, ..., x_n]

So, arr[0] = x_2

arr[1] = x_3

...

arr[n-2] = x_n

In the loop, for i in range(n - 2):

ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]

if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:

while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:

ans[i + 1] += ans[i]

So, in the earlier example with n=3, x=[1,3]

arr[0]=1, arr[1]=3

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

Then, ans[1]=3 < arr[1]=3? Wait, 3 <= 3, so enter the loop.

In the loop, ans[i]=2, so ans[1] += 2, making ans[1]=5.

Then, 5 > 3, so exit the loop.

Then, ans[2]=ans[1] + arr[1]=5+3=8

So, a=[2,5,8]

Check:

5 % 2 =1 (matches x_2=1)

8 % 5=3 (matches x_3=3)

So, it works.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought ans[1] was 3 + 3=6, but according to the function, ans[i]=ans[i-1], which is 2.

So, ans[1] starts at 1+2=3, then since 3 <= 3, adds ans[i]=2, making ans[1]=5.

Then, ans[2]=5+3=8.

Which works: 5%2=1, 8%5=3.

So, the function seems to handle this case correctly.

Another example: n=3, x=[2,2]

ans[0]=2+1=3

ans[1]=2+3=5

Check if 5 <= 2? No, so no loop.

ans[2]=5+2=7

Check:

5%3=2 (matches x_2=2)

7%5=2 (matches x_3=2)

Works.

Another example: n=3, x=[3,2]

ans[0]=3+1=4

ans[1]=3+4=7

Check if 7 <= 2? No, so no loop.

ans[2]=7+2=9

Check:

7%4=3 (matches x_2=3)

9%7=2 (matches x_3=2)

Works.

Another tricky case: n=3, x=[1,1]

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

Check if 3 <=1? No, so no loop.

ans[2]=3+1=4

Check:

3%2=1 (matches x_2=1)

4%3=1 (matches x_3=1)

Which matches the sample output of [2,5,11], but [2,3,4] also works.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

Another case: n=4, x=[1,2,3]

ans[0]=1+1=2

ans[1]=1+2=3

Check if 3 <=2? No, so no loop.

ans[2]=2+3=5

Check if 5 <=3? No, so no loop.

ans[3]=5+3=8

Check:

3%2=1 (matches x_2=1)

5%3=2 (matches x_3=2)

8%5=3 (matches x_4=3)

Works.

Another case: n=3, x=[2,1]

ans[0]=2+1=3

ans[1]=2+3=5

Check if 5 <=1? No, so no loop.

ans[2]=5+1=6

Check:

5%3=2 (matches x_2=2)

6%5=1 (matches x_3=1)

Works.

Seems consistent.

Wait, what about n=2, x=[500]

ans[0]=500+1=501

ans[1]=500+501=1001

Check:

1001 % 501=1001 - 501*1=500 (matches x_2=500)

Works.

Seems like the function is correct.

So, perhaps I was mistaken earlier.

Hence, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an array `a` such that for each `i` from 2 to `n`, the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` holds true, given the array `x` with elements `x_2` to `x_n`.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - For `a_1`, we set it to `x_2 + 1` to ensure that `a_1` is greater than `x_2` and within the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **Building the Array `a`**:
   - For each subsequent element `a_i` (from `a_2` to `a_{n-1}`), we initially set `a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to `x_{i+1}`, we repeatedly add `a_{i-1}` to `a_i` until `a_i` exceeds `x_{i+1}`. This ensures that `a_i` is sufficiently large to satisfy the modulo condition with the next element.
   - Finally, set `a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n` to ensure the last condition is met.

### Solution Code

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - `a_1` is set to `x_2 + 1` to ensure it is greater than `x_2`.

- **Building Subsequent Elements**:
  - For each `a_i` from `a_2` to `a_{n-1}`, we initially set `a_i = x_i + a_{i-1}`.
  - If `a_i <= x_{i+1}`, we repeatedly add `a_{i-1}` to `a_i` until `a_i > x_{i+1}`. This ensures that `a_i` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition with the next element.

- **Final Element**:
  - Set `a_n = a_{n-1} + x_n` to ensure the last condition `x_n = a_n % a_{n-1}` holds.

This approach ensures that all conditions are met and provides a valid array `a` for the given array `x`.
