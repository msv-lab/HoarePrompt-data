Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where I'm placing white rooks and the computer is placing black rooks in response. The rules are that no two rooks can attack each other, which means they can't share the same row or column. Also, the computer mirrors my moves by swapping rows and columns, unless I place a rook on the diagonal where row equals column, in which case the computer skips its turn.

I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible after continuing the game until no more valid moves are left, starting from a given state where I've already made k moves. Each configuration is unique based on the positions and colors of the rooks.

First, I need to understand the initial state. I'm given n, the size of the chessboard, and k, the number of moves I've already made. Then, for each of the k moves, I have the row and column where I placed my white rook.

The key here is that the computer mirrors my moves by swapping rows and columns, unless I place on the diagonal, in which case it skips its turn. So, for each of my moves (r, c), if r != c, the computer places a black rook at (c, r). If r == c, the computer doesn't make a move.

Now, after these initial k moves and the computer's responses, I need to continue the game until no more valid moves are left, and count how many different final configurations are possible.

I need to think about the state of the board after the initial moves. Specifically, I need to know which rows and columns are already occupied by rooks, because rooks cannot share rows or columns.

Let me consider the impact of each of my k moves:

1. If I place a white rook at (r, c), and r != c:

- The computer places a black rook at (c, r).

- This occupies row r and column c for white, and row c and column r for black.

- So, rows r and c, and columns r and c are now occupied.

2. If I place a white rook at (r, r) (diagonal):

- The computer skips its turn.

- This occupies row r and column r for white.

So, for each move, I need to track which rows and columns are occupied by either white or black rooks.

The goal is to continue placing rooks until no more valid moves are possible, and count the number of different final configurations that can be reached from the current state.

I need to find a way to model this game and compute the number of possible final configurations efficiently, especially since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n across all test cases up to 3*10^5.

This seems like a combinatorial problem, and given the constraints, I need an O(n) or O(1) per test case solution, or something that processes all test cases in total O(3*10^5) time.

Let me try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula that can compute the number of final configurations based on the current state.

First, let's think about the game without any initial moves. If I have an empty n x n board, and I and the computer take turns placing rooks without attacking each other, with me starting first, and the computer mirroring my moves except when I place on the diagonal, how many final configurations are there?

This seems complex. Maybe I can model this as choosing pairs of positions, considering the mirroring, and accounting for the diagonal moves.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of available rows and columns that are still free.

Let me define:

- Let s be the size of the board.

- Let’s say that after the initial k moves, there are certain rows and columns that are already occupied.

- I need to calculate how many ways I can place rooks in the remaining free positions, following the rules.

But tracking each individual move seems infeasible due to time constraints. I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the degrees of freedom left after the initial moves.

Each time I place a rook at (r, c), depending on whether r == c or not, certain rows and columns are occupied.

I need to find out how many free rows and columns are left after the initial k moves, and then compute based on that.

Wait, perhaps I can model this by considering the number of free rows and free columns separately, and then find a formula based on that.

But rooks affect both rows and columns, so it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of graph theory, where rows and columns are vertices, and placing a rook creates edges between row and column vertices.

But that might be overcomplicating things.

Let me look back at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n = 4, k = 1

My move: (1,2)

Computer's move: (2,1)

Now, rows 1 and 2 are occupied for white and black rooks, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied for white and black rooks.

So, only rows 3 and 4, and columns 3 and 4 are free.

From there, the possible configurations are:

1. Place a white rook at (3,4), computer places black at (4,3)

2. Place a white rook at (4,3), computer places black at (3,4)

3. Place a white rook at (3,3), no computer move, then place another white rook at (4,4), no computer move.

So, three possible final configurations.

Looking at this, it seems like the number of ways depends on the number of free rows and columns left, and how I can pair them.

Wait a minute, in the first case, after the initial moves, there are 2 free rows and 2 free columns.

In the first two configurations, I place rooks in off-diagonal positions, which forces the computer to place mirrored rooks.

In the third configuration, I place a rook on the diagonal, which doesn't allow the computer to place a rook.

So, perhaps the number of ways is related to the number of ways to pair the remaining free rows and columns, considering that pairing row i with column j corresponds to placing a rook at (i,j).

But this seems a bit vague.

Let me consider that after the initial moves, there are certain rows and columns that are free.

Let’s define:

- Let free_rows be the number of rows that are not occupied by any rook.

- Let free_cols be the number of columns that are not occupied by any rook.

But since rooks occupy both rows and columns, free_rows should be equal to free_cols.

Wait, no. Because each rook occupies one row and one column, but multiple rooks can occupy the same row or column if they are placed in different columns or rows respectively.

Wait, no. Actually, in this problem, since no two rooks can attack each other, each row and each column can have at most one rook.

Wait, actually, the problem says "no two rooks attack each other", meaning no two rooks share the same row or column.

Therefore, each row and each column can have at most one rook.

Given that, the number of free rows equals the number of free columns.

Let me denote f as the number of free rows (or free columns) left after the initial k moves.

Then, the number of ways to continue the game should be based on how I pair these free rows and columns.

Given that I start first and place white rooks, and the computer mirrors my moves except when I place on the diagonal.

So, in each of my moves, I can choose to place a white rook at (r,c), and the computer will place a black rook at (c,r), unless r == c.

Therefore, each of my moves except for diagonal moves leads to the computer placing a rook in response.

This seems similar to pairing rows and columns in pairs, with the option to place on the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing perfect matchings in a bipartite graph, where one part is the free rows and the other part is the free columns.

But it's not exactly a bipartite matching, because placing a rook at (r,c) and (c,r) are related.

Wait, maybe it's similar to choosing a permutation, but with some restrictions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to choosing a subset of pairs from free rows to free columns, with certain constraints based on mirroring.

This is getting complicated.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case:

n = 4, k = 1 with move (1,2)

Output: 3

Second test case:

n = 8, k = 1 with move (7,6)

Output: 331

Third test case:

n = 1000, k = 4 with moves (4,4), (952,343), (222,333), (90,91)

Output: 671968183

I need to find a pattern or formula that can compute these outputs based on n, k, and the moves made.

Looking at the first test case:

After the initial move (1,2), computer places (2,1). So, rows 1 and 2 are occupied, columns 1 and 2 are occupied.

Thus, free_rows = n - number of unique rows occupied by my moves and computer's moves.

Wait, let's think differently.

Each time I place a rook at (r,c), if r != c, the computer places a rook at (c,r). So, both rows r and c are occupied, and columns r and c are occupied.

If r == c, only row r and column r are occupied, and the computer doesn't place a rook.

So, for each of my moves:

- If r != c:

- Rows r and c are occupied.

- Columns r and c are occupied.

- Computer places a rook at (c,r).

- If r == c:

- Only row r and column r are occupied.

- Computer doesn't place a rook.

Therefore, after k moves, the total number of occupied rows and columns can be calculated.

Let me try to model this.

Let’s keep track of the unique rows and columns occupied.

Initialize two sets: occupied_rows and occupied_cols.

For each of my k moves:

- If r != c:

- Add r to occupied_rows.

- Add c to occupied_rows.

- Add r to occupied_cols.

- Add c to occupied_cols.

- Computer places at (c,r), which doesn't add any new occupied rows or columns since c and r are already added.

- If r == c:

- Add r to occupied_rows.

- Add r to occupied_cols.

- Computer skips.

So, in essence, for each move:

- If r != c:

- Add both r and c to occupied_rows and occupied_cols.

- If r == c:

- Add r to occupied_rows and occupied_cols.

Therefore, the total number of unique occupied rows and columns is the size of occupied_rows and occupied_cols.

But since rows and columns are independent in this context, but they are related through the moves.

Wait, actually, since I'm adding r to occupied_rows and c to occupied_cols, but in reality, placing a rook at (r,c) occupies row r and column c.

So, for r != c:

- occupied_rows.add(r)

- occupied_cols.add(c)

- computer places at (c,r):

- occupied_rows.add(c)

- occupied_cols.add(r)

Similarly, for r == c:

- occupied_rows.add(r)

- occupied_cols.add(r)

- computer skips.

Wait, actually, in the initial approach, I thought that adding r to occupied_rows and c to occupied_cols for my move, and then adding c to occupied_rows and r to occupied_cols for the computer's move.

But actually, since the computer's move is to place a rook at (c,r), which occupies row c and column r.

So, overall, for r != c:

- occupied_rows = {r, c}

- occupied_cols = {r, c}

And for r == c:

- occupied_rows = {r}

- occupied_cols = {r}

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Initially, occupied_rows and occupied_cols are empty.

First, I place a rook at (r,c):

- occupied_rows.add(r)

- occupied_cols.add(c)

Then, computer places a rook at (c,r):

- occupied_rows.add(c)

- occupied_cols.add(r)

So, in total:

- occupied_rows = {r, c}

- occupied_cols = {r, c}

Similarly, if r == c:

- Only I place at (r,r):

- occupied_rows.add(r)

- occupied_cols.add(r)

- Computer skips.

So, in general, after k moves, occupied_rows and occupied_cols both contain the union of all r and c from my moves and the computer's moves.

Therefore, occupied_rows and occupied_cols are the same set.

Hence, the number of free rows is n - len(occupied_rows)

And the number of free columns is n - len(occupied_cols)

But since occupied_rows and occupied_cols are the same, the number of free rows equals the number of free columns.

Let’s denote f = n - len(occupied_rows) = n - len(occupied_cols)

So, f is the number of rows (or columns) that are still free.

Now, I need to find out how many different final configurations are possible starting from this state, where there are f free rows and f free columns.

In other words, how many ways can I place rooks in the remaining f x f grid, following the same rules: I place white rooks and the computer mirrors with black rooks, unless I place on the diagonal.

This sounds like I need to count the number of possible ways to pair the remaining free rows and columns, considering the mirroring rule.

Let me try to find a recursive formula or a combinatorial formula for this.

Let’s define dp[f] as the number of ways to place rooks in an f x f grid, following the rules.

I need to compute dp[f], where f is the number of free rows/columns left.

Base case: dp[0] = 1 (only one way: do nothing)

Now, consider choosing a move.

I can choose to place a rook at (r,c), where r and c are free.

Case 1: r != c

- I place a white rook at (r,c)

- Computer places a black rook at (c,r)

- Now, rows r and c are occupied

- Columns r and c are occupied

- So, the remaining free rows and columns are f - 2

- Therefore, the number of ways in this case is choose(r,c) * dp[f - 2], where choose(r,c) is the number of ways to choose r and c.

But need to consider that r != c.

Case 2: r == c

- I place a white rook at (r,r)

- Computer skips

- Now, row r and column r are occupied

- Remaining free rows and columns are f - 1

- Therefore, the number of ways in this case is choose(r) * dp[f - 1], where choose(r) is the number of ways to choose r.

Now, I need to sum over all possible choices of r and c.

But this seems too vague. Let's try to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[f] can be expressed in terms of previous dp values.

Looking back at the first test case:

f = 2 (since n=4, k=1 with move (1,2), occupied_rows={1,2}, so f=4-2=2)

And dp[2] = 3, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for n=8, k=1 with move (7,6), f=8-2=6

dp[6] = 331, as per the sample output.

For n=1000, k=4 with moves that occupy certain rows and columns, resulting in some f, and dp[f] = 671968183.

I need to find a way to compute dp[f], given f.

Looking at the sample outputs:

dp[2] = 3

dp[6] = 331

dp[1000 - something] = 671968183

I need to find a pattern or a recursive formula for dp[f].

Let me try to find a recursive relation.

Considering that in each move:

- If I choose to place a rook at (r,c) with r != c:

- Computer places at (c,r)

- Remaining f -= 2

- If I choose to place a rook at (r,r):

- Computer skips

- Remaining f -=1

So, dp[f] = number of ways to choose pairs (r,c) with r != c, times dp[f-2], plus number of ways to choose r == c, times dp[f-1]

But need to formalize this.

Let me try to write a recursive formula.

First, the number of ways to choose r != c is f*(f-1)

And the number of ways to choose r == c is f

So, dp[f] = f*(f-1)*dp[f-2] + f*dp[f-1]

But wait, this seems similar to the recurrence for the number of permutations or something.

Let me check for f=2:

dp[2] = 2*1*dp[0] + 2*dp[1]

Assuming dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = ?

What is dp[1]?

If f=1:

I have only one row and one column free.

I can place a white rook at (1,1), and computer skips.

So, only one configuration.

Therefore, dp[1] = 1

Now, dp[2] = 2*1*dp[0] + 2*dp[1] = 2*1*1 + 2*1 = 2 + 2 = 4

But according to the sample, dp[2] = 3

Hmm, discrepancy here.

Maybe my recursive formula is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps dp[f] = dp[f-1] + (f-1)*dp[f-2]

Wait, that resembles the recurrence for derangements or something similar.

But in this problem, it's not exactly derangements.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the recurrence for the number of ways to pair elements.

Wait, perhaps dp[f] = dp[f-1] + (f-1)*dp[f-2]

But let's check for f=2:

dp[2] = dp[1] + 1*dp[0] = 1 + 1*1 = 2

But sample dp[2] = 3

Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe dp[f] = dp[f-1] + (f-1)*dp[f-2]

But that gives dp[2] = 1 + 1*1 = 2, which is not 3.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[f] = dp[f-1] + (f-1)*dp[f-2] + something else.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that placing a rook on the diagonal doesn't allow the computer to place a rook, so it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps dp[f] = dp[f-1] + (f-1)*dp[f-2]

But as per above, it doesn't match the sample.

Wait, maybe dp[f] = dp[f-1] + (f-1)*dp[f-2] + (f-1)*dp[f-2]

Let me try dp[f] = dp[f-1] + 2*(f-1)*dp[f-2]

For f=2: dp[2] = dp[1] + 2*(1)*dp[0] = 1 + 2*1*1 = 1 + 2 = 3

Which matches the sample.

For f=3: dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*2*dp[1] = 3 + 4*1 = 7

Not sure, but let's see.

For f=4: dp[4] = dp[3] + 2*3*dp[2] = 7 + 6*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

But according to the sample, for f=6, dp[6] should be 331.

Wait, let's check:

f=6:

dp[6] = dp[5] + 2*5*dp[4]

But we don't know dp[5].

Continuing:

dp[0] = 1

dp[1] = 1

dp[2] = 1 + 2*1*1 = 1 + 2 = 3

dp[3] = 3 + 2*2*1 = 3 + 4 = 7

dp[4] = 7 + 2*3*3 = 7 + 18 = 25

dp[5] = 25 + 2*4*7 = 25 + 56 = 81

dp[6] = 81 + 2*5*25 = 81 + 250 = 331

Yes, matches the sample!

So, dp[f] = dp[f-1] + 2*(f-1)*dp[f-2]

With base cases dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1

This seems correct.

Therefore, the number of final configurations is given by dp[f], where f = n - len(occupied_rows)

And dp[f] can be computed using the above recurrence.

Now, to implement this efficiently, since n can be up to 3*10^5 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n across all test cases up to 3*10^5, I need an O(f) per test case, or better, solution.

But since f can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but sum of f across all test cases is up to 3*10^5, I can process all test cases in total O(3*10^5) time.

To do this, I can precompute dp[f] for all f up to 3*10^5, and then for each test case, compute f = n - len(occupied_rows), and output dp[f].

But wait, I need to compute dp[f] modulo 10^9 + 7.

Also, I need to handle the initial k moves to compute len(occupied_rows).

Let me outline the steps:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and k.

b. For each of the k moves:

i. Read r and c.

ii. Add r and c to occupied_rows (since for each move, both r and c are occupied).

c. Compute f = n - len(occupied_rows)

d. Output dp[f] modulo 10^9 + 7

3. To compute dp[f], use the recurrence dp[f] = dp[f-1] + 2*(f-1)*dp[f-2], with dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1

4. Precompute dp[f] for f up to 3*10^5.

But wait, in the initial analysis, for f=2, dp[2] = 3, which matches the sample.

For f=6, dp[6] = 331, which also matches.

For f=1000 - something, dp[f] = 671968183, which seems correct based on the recurrence.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I can precompute dp[f] up to 3*10^5, and for each test case, compute f = n - len(occupied_rows), and output dp[f] modulo 10^9 + 7.

But I need to compute len(occupied_rows) for each test case based on the k moves.

Given that for each move, if r != c, then occupied_rows add r and c.

If r == c, then occupied_rows add r.

So, for each test case, I need to process k moves and compute the total number of unique rows occupied.

Given that n can be up to 3*10^5 and k up to n, and t up to 10^4, but sum of n across all test cases is up to 3*10^5, I need an efficient way to compute len(occupied_rows) for each test case.

To do this, I can use a set for occupied_rows for each test case, but since sum of n is 3*10^5, it's manageable.

Alternatively, since n can be up to 3*10^5, and k up to n, using a set for each test case should be fine.

Wait, but t is up to 10^4, and sum of n across all test cases is up to 3*10^5, so total operations are acceptable.

Therefore, the plan is:

- Precompute dp[f] for f up to 3*10^5 using the recurrence dp[f] = dp[f-1] + 2*(f-1)*dp[f-2], with dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1, modulo 10^9 + 7.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Initialize a set occupied_rows.

- For each of the k moves:

- Read r and c.

- Add r and c to occupied_rows.

- Compute f = n - len(occupied_rows)

- Output dp[f] modulo 10^9 + 7

Wait, but in the initial analysis, for f=2, dp[2]=3, which matches the sample.

Similarly, for f=6, dp[6]=331, which also matches.

Therefore, this seems correct.

But let me verify with another value.

Compute dp[3]:

dp[3] = dp[2] + 2*(2)*dp[1] = 3 + 4*1 = 7

Not sure, but according to the pattern, it seems correct.

Another way to think about it is that each pair of free rows and columns can be either paired together (r,c and c,r), or placed on the diagonal.

But I think the recurrence dp[f] = dp[f-1] + 2*(f-1)*dp[f-2] captures the essence:

- dp[f-1]: placing a rook on the diagonal, which occupies one row and one column, and the computer doesn't place a rook.

- 2*(f-1)*dp[f-2]: placing a rook at (r,c) with r != c, which occupies two rows and two columns, and the computer places at (c,r).

Therefore, the recurrence makes sense.

Hence, the given program seems to be implementing this correctly.

In the program:

- It reads t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Reads L = [n, k]

- Initializes occupied_rows as an empty set.

- For each of the k moves:

- Reads L1 = [a, b]

- Adds a and b to occupied_rows.

- Computes f = n - len(occupied_rows)

- Calls func_1(f) and prints it.

- func_1(n) computes dp[n] using the recurrence dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2], with dp[0] = 1 and dp[1] = 1, modulo 10^9 + 7.

This matches the analysis above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of different final configurations of rooks on an n x n chessboard after a series of moves, considering the constraints provided.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup and Constraints Handling**:
   - We handle multiple test cases efficiently, given the constraints.
   - We use sets to track occupied rows for each test case.

2. **Dynamic Programming Solution**:
   - Precompute the number of configurations using a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[f]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an f x f grid without any attacks.
   - The recurrence relation is `dp[f] = (dp[f-1] + 2 * (f-1) * dp[f-2]) % (10**9 + 7)` for f >= 2, with base cases `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, read the board size `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - Track the occupied rows and columns based on the moves.
   - Calculate the number of free rows (and columns) `f = n - len(occupied_rows)`.
   - Output the precomputed `dp[f]` for each test case.

## Solution Code

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def precompute_dp(max_n):
    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    dp[1] = 1
    for i in range(2, max_n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % MOD
    return dp

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    max_n = 0
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        k = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        occupied = set()
        for _ in range(k):
            r = int(data[idx])
            c = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            occupied.add(r)
            occupied.add(c)
        f = n - len(occupied)
        if f > max_n:
            max_n = f
        test_cases.append(f)
    dp = precompute_dp(max_n)
    for f in test_cases:
        print(dp[f])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Precomputation**:
  - We precompute the number of configurations using the dynamic programming array `dp` up to the maximum required `f` value across all test cases.
  
- **Processing Moves**:
  - For each test case, we track the occupied rows and columns using a set.
  - Calculate the number of free rows (and columns) `f` as `n - len(occupied_rows)`.
  
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the precomputed `dp[f]` value, which gives the number of possible final configurations modulo 10^9 + 7.

This approach ensures efficient handling of the constraints and provides the correct count of final configurations for each test case.
