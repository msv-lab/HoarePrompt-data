Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a straight line, and I'm at point 0. There are n monsters, each with some health a_i and initial positions x_i. Every second, I can fire up to k bullets at any monsters I choose. Each bullet reduces a monster's health by 1. After I fire the bullets, any monster with health 0 or less dies. Then, all alive monsters move one point closer to me. If any monster reaches point 0, I lose.

My goal is to determine if I can survive and kill all n monsters without any of them reaching me.

First, I need to understand the sequence of events each second:

1. I fire up to k bullets at any monsters I choose. I can distribute the bullets among the monsters as I see fit.

2. Monsters with health <= 0 die.

3. Remaining monsters move one step closer to me.

If any monster reaches me (position 0), I lose.

I need to make sure that before any monster reaches me, I've killed it.

So, I need a strategy to分配我的子弹，使得在任何怪物到达我之前，我能够将其血量降低到0。

Let me think about how to model this.

Each monster has a position x_i, which is its initial distance from me. Since the line is straight, and monsters move closer to me by 1 unit each second, the time it takes for a monster to reach me is equal to its initial absolute position, assuming it doesn't get killed along the way.

Wait, no. The time it takes for a monster to reach me is equal to its initial distance minus the number of seconds it's been moving towards me. But actually, since it moves 1 unit closer each second, the time to reach me is simply |x_i| seconds, if it's not killed before that.

But, if I kill it before it reaches me, it stops moving. So, for each monster, I need to ensure that I've fired enough bullets at it before it reaches me.

The challenge is that I have a limited number of bullets per second (up to k), and I need to distribute them optimally among the monsters.

I need to find a way to calculate whether it's possible to distribute the bullets in such a way that each monster is killed before it reaches me.

Let me consider sorting the monsters based on their distance from me. Specifically, I should consider the time each monster takes to reach me, which is |x_i| seconds.

I should sort the monsters in order of increasing time to reach me, i.e., by increasing |x_i|.

Wait, but the positions are given in increasing order, and x_i != 0.

But to prioritize which monsters to kill first, I should consider the monsters that are closest to me, because they will reach me sooner.

So, sorting the monsters by increasing |x_i| makes sense.

Then, for each monster, I need to ensure that I've killed it before it reaches me.

Let me try to think of an algorithm:

1. Sort the monsters by their distance from me, i.e., by |x_i| in ascending order.

2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the total bullets used so far, say bullets_used = 0.

3. Iterate through each monster in the sorted order:

a. For the current monster, calculate the time it takes to reach me, which is |x_i| seconds.

b. Calculate the total bullets needed to kill this monster before it reaches me. Since I can fire up to k bullets per second, in t seconds, I can fire up to t * k bullets.

c. The monster needs a_i bullets to be killed. So, to kill it before it reaches me, I need to fire a_i bullets in the first |x_i| seconds.

d. However, I also need to account for the bullets used to kill previous monsters.

e. So, for the current monster, the total bullets needed is bullets_used + a_i.

f. This total should be less than or equal to |x_i| * k, because in |x_i| seconds, I can fire up to |x_i| * k bullets.

g. If bullets_used + a_i > |x_i| * k, then it's impossible to kill this monster before it reaches me.

h. Otherwise, I can allocate a_i bullets to this monster over the first |x_i| seconds, and update bullets_used += a_i.

4. If I can allocate bullets for all monsters without violating the condition, then it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach me.

Let me see if this makes sense.

Essentially, for each monster, I need to ensure that the sum of the bullets used for all previous monsters plus the bullets needed for this monster does not exceed the total bullets I can fire in the time before this monster reaches me.

By sorting the monsters by their distance, I ensure that I'm considering the constraints in the order they become tightest.

This seems similar to a scheduling problem where I need to allocate resources (bullets) over time to meet certain deadlines (preventing monsters from reaching me).

Let me test this logic with the first example:

Example 1:

3 2

1 2 3

-1 2 3

So, n=3, k=2

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=1, x=-1 -> distance = 1

Monster 2: a=2, x=2 -> distance = 2

Monster 3: a=3, x=3 -> distance = 3

Sorted by increasing distance: Monster 1 (distance 1), Monster 2 (distance 2), Monster 3 (distance 3)

Initialize bullets_used = 0

Process Monster 1:

distance = 1, a=1

total bullets needed = 0 + 1 = 1

Compare to distance * k = 1 * 2 = 2

1 <= 2, so okay, allocate 1 bullet.

bullets_used = 1

Process Monster 2:

distance = 2, a=2

total bullets needed = 1 + 2 = 3

Compare to 2 * 2 = 4

3 <= 4, okay, allocate 2 more bullets.

bullets_used = 3

Process Monster 3:

distance = 3, a=3

total bullets needed = 3 + 3 = 6

Compare to 3 * 2 = 6

6 <= 6, okay, allocate 3 more bullets.

bullets_used = 6

All monsters can be killed before they reach me, so output YES.

This matches the first example.

Example 2:

2 1

1 1

-1 1

n=2, k=1

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=1, x=-1 -> distance=1

Monster 2: a=1, x=1 -> distance=1

Sorted by distance: both have distance=1

Initialize bullets_used=0

Process Monster 1:

distance=1, a=1

total bullets needed=0+1=1

Compare to 1*1=1

1<=1, okay, allocate 1 bullet.

bullets_used=1

Process Monster 2:

distance=1, a=1

total bullets needed=1+1=2

Compare to 1*1=1

2 > 1, impossible.

So, output NO.

Matches the second example.

Example 3:

4 10

3 4 2 5

-3 -2 1 3

n=4, k=10

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=3, x=-3 -> distance=3

Monster 2: a=4, x=-2 -> distance=2

Monster 3: a=2, x=1 -> distance=1

Monster 4: a=5, x=3 -> distance=3

Sorted by distance: Monster 3 (1), Monster 2 (2), Monster 1 (3), Monster 4 (3)

Initialize bullets_used=0

Process Monster 3:

distance=1, a=2

total bullets needed=0+2=2

Compare to 1*10=10

2<=10, okay, allocate 2 bullets.

bullets_used=2

Process Monster 2:

distance=2, a=4

total bullets needed=2+4=6

Compare to 2*10=20

6<=20, okay, allocate 4 more bullets.

bullets_used=6

Process Monster 1:

distance=3, a=3

total bullets needed=6+3=9

Compare to 3*10=30

9<=30, okay, allocate 3 more bullets.

bullets_used=9

Process Monster 4:

distance=3, a=5

total bullets needed=9+5=14

Compare to 3*10=30

14<=30, okay, allocate 5 more bullets.

bullets_used=14

All monsters can be killed before they reach me, so output YES.

Matches the third example.

Example 4:

5 3

2 1 3 2 5

-3 -2 3 4 5

n=5, k=3

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=2, x=-3 -> distance=3

Monster 2: a=1, x=-2 -> distance=2

Monster 3: a=3, x=3 -> distance=3

Monster 4: a=2, x=4 -> distance=4

Monster 5: a=5, x=5 -> distance=5

Sorted by distance: Monster 2 (2), Monster 1 (3), Monster 3 (3), Monster 4 (4), Monster 5 (5)

Initialize bullets_used=0

Process Monster 2:

distance=2, a=1

total bullets needed=0+1=1

Compare to 2*3=6

1<=6, okay, allocate 1 bullet.

bullets_used=1

Process Monster 1:

distance=3, a=2

total bullets needed=1+2=3

Compare to 3*3=9

3<=9, okay, allocate 2 more bullets.

bullets_used=3

Process Monster 3:

distance=3, a=3

total bullets needed=3+3=6

Compare to 3*3=9

6<=9, okay, allocate 3 more bullets.

bullets_used=6

Process Monster 4:

distance=4, a=2

total bullets needed=6+2=8

Compare to 4*3=12

8<=12, okay, allocate 2 more bullets.

bullets_used=8

Process Monster 5:

distance=5, a=5

total bullets needed=8+5=13

Compare to 5*3=15

13<=15, okay, allocate 5 more bullets.

bullets_used=13

All monsters can be killed before they reach me, so output YES.

Matches the fourth example.

Example 5:

2 1

1 2

1 2

n=2, k=1

Monsters:

Monster 1: a=1, x=1 -> distance=1

Monster 2: a=2, x=2 -> distance=2

Sorted by distance: Monster 1 (1), Monster 2 (2)

Initialize bullets_used=0

Process Monster 1:

distance=1, a=1

total bullets needed=0+1=1

Compare to 1*1=1

1<=1, okay, allocate 1 bullet.

bullets_used=1

Process Monster 2:

distance=2, a=2

total bullets needed=1+2=3

Compare to 2*1=2

3>2, impossible.

So, output NO.

Matches the fifth example.

Seems like the logic is correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

if __name__ == '__main__':

func_1()

def func_1():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

x = list(map(int, input().split()))

monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))

bullets_used = 0

can_survive = True

for (pos, health) in monsters:

distance = abs(pos)

total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health

if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:

can_survive = False

break

bullets_used += health

print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')

It seems to match the logic I described.

It sorts the monsters by their distance from me (abs(x_i)) in ascending order.

Then, for each monster, it calculates the total bullets needed so far (bullets_used + current monster's health) and checks if it's less than or equal to the maximum bullets that can be fired in the time before the monster reaches me (distance * k).

If at any point the total bullets needed exceed the maximum possible bullets that can be fired in that time, it sets can_survive to False and breaks out of the loop.

Otherwise, it adds the current monster's health to bullets_used and continues.

Finally, it prints 'YES' if can_survive is True, otherwise 'NO'.

This seems correct.

Let me check if there are any edge cases that might fail.

Consider a case where all monsters are at the same distance.

For example:

n=2, k=2

a=[1,1]

x=[-1,1]

Sorted monsters: both at distance 1.

total bullets needed for first monster: 0 + 1 = 1 <= 1*2=2, allocate 1 bullet.

bullets_used=1

total bullets needed for second monster: 1 + 1 = 2 <= 1*2=2, allocate 1 bullet.

bullets_used=2

So, it should output YES.

Another case:

n=1, k=1

a=[1]

x=[1]

distance=1, total bullets needed=1 <= 1*1=1, allocate 1 bullet.

Output YES.

n=1, k=1

a=[2]

x=[1]

distance=1, total bullets needed=0 + 2 = 2 > 1*1=1, impossible. Output NO.

Seems correct.

Another edge case:

n=0, but n >=1 as per constraints.

Wait, n >=1 according to constraints, but t can be from 1 to 3*10^4.

Wait, no, n can be from 1 to 3*10^5 per test case, and t from 1 to 3*10^4.

But in the problem statement, it says 1 <= n <= 3*10^5, and t from 1 to 3*10^4, with sum of n over all test cases <= 3*10^5.

So, n >=1.

Another consideration: x_i !=0, so no monster starts at position 0.

Also, positions are unique and sorted.

I think the logic holds.

Time complexity: For each test case, sorting n monsters takes O(n log n), and then iterating through them takes O(n). Since t can be up to 3*10^4 and n up to 3*10^5 per test case, but sum of n over all test cases <= 3*10^5, the total time should be acceptable.

But wait, in the constraints, it says sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3*10^5, so total time should be O(3*10^5 log 3*10^5), which is acceptable.

I think the program is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reaches our character in a game. We achieve this by strategically allocating bullets to reduce the health of monsters before they can reach us.

## Approach
1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the number of monsters (n) and the maximum bullets that can be fired per second (k).
   - Read the health values of the monsters (a) and their initial positions (x).

2. **Sorting Monsters:**
   - Sort the monsters based on their distance from the character (absolute value of their positions). This ensures we handle the closest threats first.

3. **Bullet Allocation:**
   - Initialize a counter for bullets used.
   - Iterate through each monster in the sorted order.
   - For each monster, calculate the total bullets needed to kill it (current bullets used plus the monster's health).
   - Check if the total bullets needed exceed the maximum bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches the character (distance * k).
   - If at any point the bullets needed exceed the available bullets, it's impossible to survive, and we break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, update the bullets used by adding the health of the killed monster.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - For each test case, print 'YES' if all monsters can be killed before reaching the character, otherwise 'NO'.

## Solution Code
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        bullets_used = 0
        can_survive = True
        for (pos, health) in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
```

## Explanation
- **Step-by-step Execution:**
  - We process each test case individually.
  - Monsters are sorted by their distance from the character to prioritize closer threats.
  - We keep track of the cumulative bullets used and ensure that for each monster, the bullets required do not exceed the bullets that can be fired before the monster reaches us.
  
- **Efficiency:**
  - Sorting the monsters takes O(n log n) per test case.
  - Iterating through the sorted list is O(n).
  - Given the constraints, the total time complexity is acceptable.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - All monsters at the same distance.
  - Single monster scenarios.
  - Minimum and maximum values for n and k.

This approach ensures that we optimally allocate our bullets to survive the onslaught of monsters.
