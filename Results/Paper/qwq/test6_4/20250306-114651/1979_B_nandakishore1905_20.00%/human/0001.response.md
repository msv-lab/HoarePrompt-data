Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two distinct non-negative integers, x and y. Then, there are two infinite sequences defined:

- a_n = n XOR x

- b_n = n XOR y

Where XOR is the bitwise XOR operation.

I need to find the length of the longest common subsegment of these two sequences. A subsegment is just a consecutive sequence of elements from the original sequence.

First, I need to understand what a common subsegment means in this context. It means I'm looking for the longest sequence of consecutive elements that appear in both a and b in the same order.

Since the sequences are infinite, I can't generate them entirely. I need a smarter way to find this longest common subsegment.

Let me think about the properties of XOR. XOR is a bitwise operation where each bit of the result is 1 if the corresponding bits of the two operands are different, and 0 if they are the same.

Given that, a_n = n XOR x and b_n = n XOR y.

I need to find m, the maximum length such that there exist some i and j where:

a_i = b_j

a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}

...

a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1}

So, for m elements starting from some i in a and some j in b, the sequences match.

This seems tricky because the sequences are infinite, and I need to find matching subsegments.

Let me consider the difference between x and y. Since x and y are distinct, their XOR is non-zero.

Let k = x XOR y. Because x != y, k != 0.

Now, a_n = n XOR x

b_n = n XOR y

But y = x XOR k, since k = x XOR y.

So, b_n = n XOR (x XOR k) = (n XOR x) XOR k = a_n XOR k

Therefore, b_n = a_n XOR k

So, each element in b is the corresponding element in a XORed with k.

Now, I need to find the longest sequence of consecutive elements in a that match some sequence of consecutive elements in b.

Given that b_n = a_n XOR k, the equality a_i = b_j implies a_i = a_j XOR k.

Similarly, a_{i+1} = b_{j+1} implies a_{i+1} = a_{j+1} XOR k

And so on, up to a_{i+m-1} = b_{j+m-1} = a_{j+m-1} XOR k

So, for m elements starting from i in a and j in b, we have:

a_i = a_j XOR k

a_{i+1} = a_{j+1} XOR k

...

a_{i+m-1} = a_{j+m-1} XOR k

Now, since a_n = n XOR x, and n starts from 1, I can express a_n in terms of n.

Similarly, a_j = j XOR x.

So, from a_i = a_j XOR k, and k = x XOR y, we have:

i XOR x = (j XOR x XOR y) XOR k

Wait, k = x XOR y, so XORing with k is the same as XORing with x XOR y.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let's consider that b_n = a_n XOR k, where k = x XOR y.

So, b_n = a_n XOR k.

Therefore, for a_i to equal b_j, we have a_i = b_j = a_j XOR k.

So, a_i = a_j XOR k.

But a_j = j XOR x, and a_i = i XOR x.

So, i XOR x = j XOR x XOR k

Simplify:

i XOR x = j XOR x XOR k

Applying XOR x on both sides:

i = j XOR k

So, j = i XOR k

That's interesting. So, j is determined by i XOR k.

Similarly, for the next element:

a_{i+1} = (i+1) XOR x

b_{j+1} = (j+1) XOR y

But y = x XOR k, so b_{j+1} = (j+1) XOR x XOR k

We need a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}, so:

(i+1) XOR x = (j+1) XOR x XOR k

Again, apply XOR x:

(i+1) = (j+1) XOR k

So, j+1 = (i+1) XOR k

But earlier, j = i XOR k

So, j+1 = (i XOR k) + 1

And (i+1) XOR k should equal (i XOR k) + 1

Is this always true?

Let me check with some values.

Suppose i = 1, k = 2.

Then, j = 1 XOR 2 = 3

Then, j+1 = 4

And (1+1)=2 XOR 2 = 0

Wait, 2 XOR 2 = 0, which is not equal to 4.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Given that j = i XOR k

And I need to check if for this j, the sequences a_i to a_{i+m-1} match b_j to b_{j+m-1}

But b_j = a_j XOR k

And j = i XOR k

So, b_j = a_{i XOR k} XOR k

But a_{i XOR k} = (i XOR k) XOR x = i XOR k XOR x

So, b_j = (i XOR k XOR x) XOR k = i XOR x

But a_i = i XOR x

So, b_j = a_i

Similarly, b_{j+1} = b_{(i XOR k) + 1} = a_{(i XOR k) + 1} XOR k

But a_{(i XOR k) + 1} = ((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x

And b_{j+1} = a_{(i XOR k) + 1} XOR k = ((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x XOR k

Meanwhile, a_{i+1} = (i + 1) XOR x

So, for a_{i+1} to equal b_{j+1}, we need:

(i + 1) XOR x = ((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x XOR k

Let me simplify the right side:

((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x XOR k

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the sequences a and b.

Since b_n = a_n XOR k, where k = x XOR y.

So, every element in b is the corresponding element in a XORed with k.

Now, if k is a power of two, meaning k is of the form 2^p for some p, then the sequences a and b are related in a specific way.

Wait, in general, XORing with a constant k shifts the bits in a certain way.

But I need to find the longest run of consecutive elements that match in a and b.

Given that b_n = a_n XOR k, the sequences a and b will have some elements equal only if a_n = a_n XOR k, which only happens if a_n = 0, but since a_n = n XOR x, and n starts from 1, a_n is never zero unless n = x.

But x is non-negative and n starts from 1, so it's possible only if x = 0 and n = 0, but n starts from 1.

Wait, no, if x = 0, then a_n = n XOR 0 = n.

But n starts from 1, so a_n is at least 1.

So, a_n is never zero in this context.

Therefore, a_n != a_n XOR k for any k != 0.

So, a_n != b_n for all n, since k != 0.

But the problem is to find m, the maximum length such that a_i to a_{i+m-1} equals b_j to b_{j+m-1} for some i and j.

Given that b_j = a_j XOR k, and j = i XOR k, as derived earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for runs where a_{i} to a_{i+m-1} equals b_{j} to b_{j+m-1}, which is a_{j} XOR k to a_{j+m-1} XOR k.

But a_j = j XOR x, and j = i XOR k.

So, a_j = (i XOR k) XOR x = i XOR x XOR k

And b_j = a_j XOR k = (i XOR x XOR k) XOR k = i XOR x

Which is equal to a_i.

Similarly, a_{j+1} = (j+1) XOR x

And b_{j+1} = a_{j+1} XOR k = ((j+1) XOR x) XOR k

But j = i XOR k, so j+1 = (i XOR k) + 1

So, a_{j+1} = ((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x

And b_{j+1} = ((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x XOR k

Meanwhile, a_{i+1} = (i+1) XOR x

So, for a_{i+1} to equal b_{j+1}, we need:

(i+1) XOR x = ((i XOR k) + 1) XOR x XOR k

This seems messy. Maybe there's a pattern in the differences.

Let me consider the difference between a_n and b_n.

a_n = n XOR x

b_n = n XOR y

So, b_n = a_n XOR (x XOR y) = a_n XOR k

So, b_n = a_n XOR k

Now, if I look at the sequences a and b, they are related by XORing with k.

I need to find the longest run of consecutive elements in a that match some run of consecutive elements in b.

Given that b is a shifted version of a by XORing with k, the sequences will only match if the run in a is such that XORing with k transforms it into another run in a.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the binary representations and how XOR affects them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the longest run where the difference between corresponding elements is constant.

Wait, but XOR doesn't directly translate to a constant difference.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Example 1:

x = 0, y = 1

So, k = 0 XOR 1 = 1

a_n = n XOR 0 = n

b_n = n XOR 1

So, a = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,...]

b = [0,3,2,5,4,7,6,...]

Looking for the longest common subsegment.

From the example, it says the answer is 1.

Indeed, no subsegment of length 2 or more appears in both a and b.

So, m=1 is correct.

Example 2:

x=12, y=4

k=12 XOR 4 = 16 (since 12=1100, 4=0100, XOR is 10000)

a_n = n XOR 12

b_n = n XOR 4

First few elements:

a: [13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,...]

b: [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...]

Looking for the longest common subsegment.

From the example, the answer is 8.

Looking at the sequences:

a: 13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,...

b: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,...

I don't see a common subsegment of length 8.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the subsegment is not starting from n=1.

Maybe there is a shift.

Wait, perhaps the sequences align at some point.

Wait, maybe for a certain i and j, a_i to a_{i+7} equals b_j to b_{j+7}.

Let me check:

From a, starting at a_13:

a_13 = 13 XOR 12 = 1

a_14 = 14 XOR 12 = 6

a_15 = 15 XOR 12 = 7

a_16 = 16 XOR 12 = 4

a_17 = 17 XOR 12 = 5

a_18 = 18 XOR 12 = 10

a_19 = 19 XOR 12 = 11

a_20 = 20 XOR 12 = 12

From b, starting at b_1:

b_1 = 1 XOR 4 = 5

b_2 = 2 XOR 4 = 6

b_3 = 3 XOR 4 = 7

b_4 = 4 XOR 4 = 0

b_5 = 5 XOR 4 = 1

b_6 = 6 XOR 4 = 2

b_7 = 7 XOR 4 = 3

b_8 = 8 XOR 4 = 12

Wait, no common subsegment of length 8 here.

Maybe I need to look differently.

Perhaps the sequences repeat every 2^p for some p.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the binary lengths.

Wait, perhaps the longest common subsegment has a length related to the number of trailing zeros in k.

Wait, in the first example, k=1, which has no trailing zeros, and m=1.

In the second example, k=16, which has 4 trailing zeros, but m=8.

Hmm, not matching directly.

Wait, maybe it's 2^(number of trailing zeros).

2^3=8, which matches the second example.

Wait, but in the first example, k=1 has 0 trailing zeros, 2^0=1, which matches m=1.

Interesting.

So, perhaps the length of the longest common subsegment is 2^(trailing zeros in k).

Wait, but in the third test case, x=57, y=37.

k=57 XOR 37.

Let's calculate that.

57 in binary is 111001, 37 is 100101.

XOR is 111001 XOR 100101 = 011100, which is 12, which is 1100 in binary, having 2 trailing zeros.

So, 2^2=4, which matches the sample output of 4.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, x=316560849, y=14570961.

Let's find k = x XOR y.

But I don't have the binary representation handy, but the output is 33554432, which is 2^25.

So, perhaps the number of trailing zeros in k is 25, and 2^25=33554432.

This seems to hold.

So, the pattern is that the length of the longest common subsegment is 2 raised to the number of trailing zeros in k = x XOR y.

Wait, but in the first test case, k=1, which has 0 trailing zeros, and m=1=2^0.

In the second, k=16=10000, which has 4 trailing zeros, and m=16, but the sample output is 8.

Wait, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Hmm, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k -1).

In the second case, k=16 has 4 trailing zeros, 2^(4-1)=8, which matches.

In the third case, k=12 has 2 trailing zeros, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but in the second case, k=16 has 4 trailing zeros, and 2^3=8 matches.

Wait, 4-1=3, 2^3=8.

In the third case, k=12 has 2 trailing zeros, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k).

In the first case, k=1 (0b1), 0 trailing zeros, 2^0=1.

Second case, k=16 (0b10000), 4 trailing zeros, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k -1), in second case 4-1=3, 2^3=8.

In the third case, k=12 (0b1100), 2 trailing zeros, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but in second case, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k -1), but in third case, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4.

Hmm, not consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(position of the least significant 1 in k).

In the first case, k=1 (0b1), least significant 1 is at position 0, 2^0=1.

Second case, k=16 (0b10000), least significant 1 is at position 4, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's 2^(position of the least significant 1 in k -1), 2^(4-1)=8, matches second case.

Third case, k=12 (0b1100), least significant 1 at position 2, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but in third case, trailing zeros are 2, 2^2=4, matches.

Second case, trailing zeros are 4, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of bits in k.

Wait, no, k=16 is 5 bits, but sample output is 8, which is 2^3.

Wait, maybe it's 2^(floor(log2(k))), but k=16 is 2^4, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's the largest power of 2 that divides k.

For k=16, which is 16, the largest power is 16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, 16 divided by 2 is 8.

Similarly, for k=12 (0b1100), which is divisible by 4, sample output is 4.

For k=1, which is not divisible by any higher power of 2, output is 1.

Wait, so perhaps it's the largest power of 2 that divides k.

But for k=16, it's 16, but sample output is 8, which is 16 divided by 2.

Wait, maybe it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, divided by 2.

No, for k=16, that would be 16/2=8, matches.

For k=12, which is divisible by 4, 4 divided by 1 is 4, matches sample output.

For k=1, which is not divisible by any higher power of 2, output is 1.

Wait, but 12 is divisible by 4, which is 2^2, and 2^2=4, matches sample output of 4.

For k=16, which is 2^4, divided by 2 is 8, matches sample output.

For k=1, which is 2^0, divided by 2 is 0.5, but rounded down to 1.

Wait, no, 2^0 is 1, divided by 2 is 0.5, but perhaps it's ceiling to 1.

But in programming terms, it's likely floor.

Wait, perhaps it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, without dividing by 2.

Wait, for k=16, largest power is 16, sample output is 8, which is 16 divided by 2.

For k=12, largest power is 4, sample output is 4.

For k=1, largest power is 1, sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, divided by 2, but rounded up to 1 when k=1.

Wait, maybe it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, divided by 2, but if k is 1, it's 1.

But in the second case, it's 16 divided by 2 is 8.

In the third case, 12 divided by 3 is 4, which is 2^2.

Wait, perhaps it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, but for k=16, it's 16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, maybe it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, divided by 2, but rounded up to 1 when it would be less.

Wait, perhaps it's the largest power of 2 that divides k, divided by 2, but if k is 1, it's 1.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of elements in the sequence where a_n equals b_n.

Wait, but from earlier, a_n != b_n for all n, since k != 0.

But the sequences can have equal subsegments.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the period of the sequences where a_i to a_{i+m-1} equals b_j to b_{j+m-1} for some i and j.

Given that b_n = a_n XOR k, and I need a_i to a_{i+m-1} equal to b_j to b_{j+m-1}, which is a_j XOR k to a_{j+m-1} XOR k.

So, a_i to a_{i+m-1} = a_j XOR k to a_{j+m-1} XOR k.

This implies that a_i to a_{i+m-1} is equal to a_j to a_{j+m-1} XOR k.

This seems recursive.

Wait, perhaps I need to find m such that for some i and j, a_i to a_{i+m-1} equals a_j to a_{j+m-1} XOR k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the binary representations.

Given that a_n = n XOR x and b_n = n XOR y, and y = x XOR k.

So, b_n = n XOR (x XOR k) = (n XOR x) XOR k = a_n XOR k.

So, b_n = a_n XOR k.

Now, if I look at the difference between a_n and b_n, it's k.

So, the sequences a and b are related by a constant XOR of k.

Now, I need to find the longest run of consecutive elements in a that matches some run in b.

Given that b is a is XORed with k, the sequences will only match in runs where the XOR with k transforms one run into another.

Given that XOR is a bijection, each a_n maps to a unique b_n, and vice versa.

So, the sequences a and b are permutations of each other, but not necessarily in the same order.

Wait, but they are infinite sequences, and for each n, a_n and b_n are related by XOR with k.

But I need to find the longest common subsegment, meaning consecutive elements that match in both sequences.

Given that b_n = a_n XOR k, for a_n to equal b_j, we have a_n = a_j XOR k.

So, a_n XOR a_j = k.

Similarly, for a_{n+1} to equal b_{j+1}, a_{n+1} = a_{j+1} XOR k, so a_{n+1} XOR a_{j+1} = k.

This suggests that for each position, the XOR of corresponding elements in a and b is k.

So, if I can find m consecutive elements in a and b where a_i to a_{i+m-1} equal b_j to b_{j+m-1}, that implies that for each position, a_{i+p} = b_{j+p} for p from 0 to m-1.

But b_{j+p} = a_{j+p} XOR k.

So, a_{i+p} = a_{j+p} XOR k for p from 0 to m-1.

Therefore, a_{i+p} XOR a_{j+p} = k for p from 0 to m-1.

This means that for m consecutive elements, the XOR of corresponding elements in a is constant and equal to k.

I need to find the maximum m where such i and j exist.

This seems complex.

Perhaps I need to look for runs in a where shifting by some amount and XORing with k aligns with another run in a.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that XOR is associative and commutative.

So, a_{i+p} XOR a_{j+p} = k for p from 0 to m-1.

This implies that the difference (in terms of XOR) between a_{i+p} and a_{j+p} is constant.

Given that a_n = n XOR x, and a_{j+p} = (j+p) XOR x.

Similarly, a_{i+p} = (i+p) XOR x.

So, a_{i+p} XOR a_{j+p} = ((i+p) XOR x) XOR ((j+p) XOR x) = (i+p) XOR (j+p)

Because XOR is associative and commutative.

So, (i+p) XOR (j+p) = k for p from 0 to m-1.

This simplifies to (i+p) XOR (j+p) = k.

Now, let's consider that p is varying from 0 to m-1.

I need this equation to hold for all p from 0 to m-1.

So, (i+p) XOR (j+p) = k for p from 0 to m-1.

Let me see what i and j need to satisfy.

Let me set p=0: i XOR j = k

For p=1: (i+1) XOR (j+1) = k

Similarly, for p=2: (i+2) XOR (j+2) = k

And so on up to p=m-1.

Now, given that i XOR j = k, and (i+1) XOR (j+1) = k, and so on, up to (i+m-1) XOR (j+m-1) = k.

Given that i XOR j = k, and j = i XOR k.

So, j is uniquely determined by i and k.

Now, substitute j = i XOR k into the equations.

So, (i+p) XOR (j+p) = (i+p) XOR ((i XOR k) + p) = k

Now, simplify (i+p) XOR ((i XOR k) + p) = k

This needs to hold for p from 0 to m-1.

This seems complex.

Let me consider specific values.

Take p=0: i XOR (i XOR k) = k, which holds.

p=1: (i+1) XOR ((i XOR k) +1) = k

Let me compute (i+1) XOR ((i XOR k) +1)

Let me assume that addition and XOR are in binary.

This seems too abstract.

Maybe I need to consider the binary representations.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mathematical property here related to the binary representations aligning in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that (i+p) XOR ((i XOR k) + p) = k for p from 0 to m-1.

Let me see.

Let me denote that as f(p) = (i+p) XOR ((i XOR k) + p) = k

I need f(p) = k for p from 0 to m-1.

Let me compute f(p):

f(p) = (i+p) XOR ((i XOR k) + p)

Let me see if I can simplify this.

Let me consider that addition is in binary, and XOR is bitwise.

This seems too involved.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the sequences a and b are related by XORing with k.

Given that, perhaps the longest common subsegment corresponds to the number of trailing zeros in k.

From the earlier observations, in the first sample, k=1 (no trailing zeros), m=1.

Second sample, k=16 (4 trailing zeros), m=8, which is 2^(4-1).

Third sample, k=12 (2 trailing zeros), m=4, which is 2^(2).

Fourth sample, k=316560849 XOR 14570961 = some value, and m=33554432, which is 2^25.

Wait, perhaps it's 2^(trailing zeros in k).

In the second sample, k=16 (10000 in binary), trailing zeros=4, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8, which is 2^(4-1).

In the third sample, k=12 (1100 in binary), trailing zeros=2, 2^2=4, matches sample output.

In the fourth sample, assuming k has 26 trailing zeros, 2^25=33554432, matches sample output.

Wait, but in the second sample, 2^(4-1)=8 matches.

Similarly, in the fourth sample, if k has 26 trailing zeros, 2^(26-1)=2^25=33554432 matches.

So, perhaps the general formula is m = 2^(t - (t mod 1)), where t is the number of trailing zeros in k.

Wait, that seems convoluted.

Looking at the pattern, m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k - 1), but in the first sample, k=1 (0 trailing zeros), m=1=2^0.

Wait, perhaps it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but in the second sample, trailing zeros=4, 2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, unless it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k - 1), but in the first sample, trailing zeros=0, 2^(0-1)=2^-1, which is 0.5, but sample output is 1.

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but for k=1, it's 2^0=1, matches.

For k=16, trailing zeros=4, m=2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k -1), but in second sample, 2^(4-1)=8, matches.

In the third sample, k=12, trailing zeros=2, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but in third sample, 2^2=4, matches.

In second sample, perhaps the number of trailing zeros is 3, not 4.

Wait, k=16 is 10000 in binary, which has 4 trailing zeros.

But sample output is 8, which is 2^3.

So, m=2^t, where t is the number of trailing zeros in k minus 1.

In second sample, t=4-1=3, m=2^3=8.

In third sample, t=2, m=2^2=4.

In first sample, t=0, m=2^0=1.

In fourth sample, k=316560849 XOR 14570961=301989888, which is 10010001100110001100000000000 in binary, which has 8 trailing zeros.

Wait, but sample output is 33554432, which is 2^25.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the XOR.

Wait, perhaps the formula is m = 2^(trailing zeros in k).

But in the second sample, k=16=10000, trailing zeros=4, m=2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k -1), in second sample, 2^(4-1)=8, matches.

In third sample, 2^(2-1)=2, but sample output is 4, which is 2^(2).

Wait, inconsistency.

Wait, perhaps it's m = 2^(number of trailing zeros in k), unless k is a power of 2 greater than 1, then m=2^(t-1).

In second sample, k=16=2^4, m=2^(4-1)=8.

In third sample, k=12=1100, which is not a pure power of 2, m=2^t=4.

Wait, doesn't match.

I must be misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the position of the highest set bit in k.

In second sample, k=16=2^4, highest set bit is at position 4, m=2^(4-1)=8.

In third sample, k=12=2^2*3, highest set bit is at position 3 (8), but m=4=2^2.

In fourth sample, k=301989888=2^11 * 1455, highest set bit is at position 28 (2^28=268435456), but sample output is 33554432=2^25.

Wait, no, 2^25=33554432.

Wait, perhaps it's m=2^(position of the least significant 1 in k).

Wait, in second sample, k=16=10000, least significant 1 at position 4, m=2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, perhaps it's m=2^(position of the least significant 1 in k -1), 2^(4-1)=8.

In third sample, k=12=1100, least significant 1 at position 2, m=2^(2)=4.

In fourth sample, k=301989888=10010001100110001100000000000, least significant 1 at position 11, m=2^(11)=2048, but sample output is 33554432=2^25.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's m=2^(number of bits in k - number of trailing zeros in k).

In second sample, k=16=10000, number of bits=5, trailing zeros=4, m=2^(5-4)=2^1=2, but sample output is 8.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m=2^(number of trailing zeros in k), but in fourth sample, k has 11 trailing zeros, but m=2^25.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the trailing zeros in k.

Wait, 316560849 XOR 14570961=301989888.

Binary of 301989888 is 10010001100110001100000000000.

Counting the trailing zeros: 10010001100110001100000000000

Starting from the right, there are 9 zeros, then a 1, then more zeros.

Wait, let's count carefully: 000000000 (9 zeros), then 1, then more bits.

Wait, no, 000000000 (9 zeros), then 1, then more bits.

Wait, actually, it's 10010001100110001100000000000.

Let's write it out:

Position: 31 30 ... 21 20 19 ...12 11 ...3 2 1 0

Bits: 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Wait, leading zeros are not significant in this context.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the binary representation from the least significant bit.

Looking at the binary: 10010001100110001100000000000

Counting from the right:

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1

So, trailing zeros are from position 0 to position 9 (10 zeros), but the least significant 1 is at position 10.

Wait, but in my earlier count, I miscounted.

Actually, the binary is 10010001100110001100000000000, which has 10 trailing zeros.

Wait, let's check:

From the right: 0000000000 (10 zeros), then 1, then more bits.

So, trailing zeros=10, m=2^10=1024, but sample output is 33554432=2^25.

Discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's not directly related to trailing zeros.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the position of the least significant 1 in k.

In second sample, k=16=10000, least significant 1 at position 4, m=2^(4-1)=8.

In third sample, k=12=1100, least significant 1 at position 2, m=2^2=4.

In fourth sample, k=301989888=10010001100110001100000000000, least significant 1 at position 10, m=2^(10-1)=2^9=512, but sample output is 33554432=2^25.

Wait, still discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps it's m=2^(position of the least significant 1 in k).

In second sample, position 4, m=2^4=16, but sample output is 8.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's m=2^(position of the least significant 1 in k -1), in second sample, 2^(4-1)=8, matches.

In third sample, position 2, 2^(2)=4, matches.

In fourth sample, position 10, 2^(10-1)=512, but sample output is 33554432=2^25.

Wait, doesn't match.

I must be missing something.

Let me look for another approach.

Given that b_n = a_n XOR k, and I need to find the longest m where a_i to a_{i+m-1} equals b_j to b_{j+m-1}.

Which means a_i = b_j, a_{i+1}=b_{j+1}, ..., a_{i+m-1}=b_{j+m-1}.

Given that b_n = a_n XOR k, this implies a_i = a_j XOR k, a_{i+1}=a_{j+1} XOR k, ..., a_{i+m-1}=a_{j+m-1} XOR k.

Since a_n = n XOR x, we have a_i = i XOR x, a_j = j XOR x, etc.

So, i XOR x = j XOR x XOR k ⇒ i = j XOR k.

Similarly, i+1 = j+1 XOR k ⇒ i = j XOR k.

This holds for all p from 0 to m-1: i+p = j+p XOR k.

Which simplifies to i = j XOR k.

So, j = i XOR k.

Therefore, the sequences a_i to a_{i+m-1} and b_{j} to b_{j+m-1} match if and only if for each p, a_{i+p} = b_{j+p} = a_{j+p} XOR k.

But since j = i XOR k, we have a_{i+p} = a_{(i XOR k)+p} XOR k.

Wait, this seems circular.

Let me consider that a_{n} = n XOR x.

So, a_{i+p} = (i+p) XOR x.

b_{j+p} = (j+p) XOR y.

But y = x XOR k.

So, b_{j+p} = (j+p) XOR x XOR k.

Given that j = i XOR k, we have b_{j+p} = ((i XOR k)+p) XOR x XOR k.
