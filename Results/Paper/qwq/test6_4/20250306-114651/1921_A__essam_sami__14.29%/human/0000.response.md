Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, I'm given coordinates of the corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. I need to find the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it has a positive area, meaning it's not degenerate.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis.

Given four points, I need to determine which ones form the square and then calculate its area.

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line is an integer t indicating the number of test cases. Each test case has four lines, each containing two integers: the coordinates (x, y) of the square's corners.

It's guaranteed that the points form a valid square with positive area.

My task is, for each test case, to compute and print the area of the square.

Let me look at the example to understand better.

Example Input:

3

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Example Output:

9

4

784

So, for the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Visually, if I plot these points, I can see that they form a square.

Similarly for the other test cases.

Now, how to approach this programmatically.

Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the sides are either horizontal or vertical.

Given four points, I need to find the side length and then compute the area.

But since the points are given in random order, I need a way to determine the side lengths without worrying about the order.

One way is to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and identify the unique distances.

In a square, there should be two unique distances: the side length and the diagonal length.

But since the squares are aligned with the axes, the side lengths will be equal in length, and the diagonals will also be equal.

Wait, in a square aligned with the axes, all sides are equal, and both diagonals are equal.

But in this case, since it's aligned with the axes, maybe there's a simpler way.

Perhaps I can find the minimal bounding rectangle and since it's a square, the width and height should be equal.

Wait, but since it's a square with sides parallel to the axes, the width and height should be equal, and that would be the side length.

So, maybe I can find the difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the side length.

But because the points are given in random order, I need to figure out which points correspond to which corners.

Hmm.

Let me think differently.

In a square aligned with the axes, the x-coordinates of the points will have only two unique values, and the y-coordinates will also have only two unique values.

For example, in the first test case:

x-coordinates: 1, 4, 1, 4

y-coordinates: 2, 5, 5, 2

So, the unique x-values are 1 and 4, and unique y-values are 2 and 5.

The side length would be the difference between the x-values (4-1=3) or the y-values (5-2=3), which matches the area of 9 (3*3).

Similarly, in the second test case:

x: -1, 1, 1, -1

y: 1, -1, 1, -1

Unique x: -1 and 1

Unique y: -1 and 1

Side length: 1 - (-1) = 2

Area: 4

Which matches the example.

And the third test case:

x: 45, 45, 17, 17

y: 11, 39, 11, 39

Unique x: 45 and 17

Unique y: 11 and 39

Side length: 45 - 17 = 28

Area: 784

Perfect.

So, the approach is:

- For each test case, collect the four points.

- Find the unique x-coordinates; there should be exactly two.

- Find the unique y-coordinates; there should be exactly two.

- Compute the difference between the two unique x-values; this is the side length.

- Compute the difference between the two unique y-values; this should be the same as the side length.

- If they are not the same, something is wrong, but since it's guaranteed to be a square, we can assume they are equal.

- Then, compute the area by squaring the side length.

This seems efficient and straightforward.

Now, looking at the provided program:

import math

def func():

t = int(input())

for steps in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

(c, d) = map(int, input().split())

(e, f) = map(int, input().split())

(g, h) = map(int, input().split())

n = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)

x = (c - g) * (c - g) + (d - h) * (d - h)

if x > n:

print(n)

else:

print(x)

So, the program reads t, the number of test cases, and for each test case, reads four pairs of coordinates.

Then, it calculates two distances: n and x, which are the squared distances between points (a,b) and (e,f), and between points (c,d) and (g,h).

Then, it prints the smaller of these two distances.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I thought of finding the unique x and y values, computing the differences, and then squaring that to get the area.

But in this program, it's calculating the squared distances between specific pairs of points and printing the smaller one.

Is this correct?

Let me think.

In a square aligned with the axes, the sides are either horizontal or vertical.

The distance between two adjacent points should be equal to the side length.

But in this program, it's calculating the Euclidean distance between two pairs of points and printing the smaller squared distance.

But in my approach, I thought of finding the unique x and y values and computing the difference between them.

I think my approach is correct, but is this program's approach correct?

Let me consider the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Calculating n: squared distance between (1,2) and (1,5): (1-1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

x: squared distance between (4,5) and (4,2): (4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

So, it prints 9, which is correct.

Second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

n: squared distance between (-1,1) and (1,1): (-1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

x: squared distance between (1,-1) and (-1,-1): (1 - (-1))^2 + (-1 - (-1))^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

Prints 4, which is correct.

Third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

n: squared distance between (45,11) and (17,11): (45-17)^2 + (11-11)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

x: squared distance between (45,39) and (17,39): (45-17)^2 + (39-39)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

Prints 784, which is correct.

So, in these cases, it works.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let's consider another test case.

Test case:

0 0

0 1

1 0

1 1

This should be a square with side length 1, area 1.

Calculating n: squared distance between (0,0) and (1,0): 1 + 0 = 1

x: squared distance between (0,1) and (1,1): 1 + 0 = 1

Prints 1, which is correct.

Another test case:

0 0

0 2

2 0

2 2

Side length 2, area 4.

n: squared distance between (0,0) and (2,0): 4 + 0 = 4

x: squared distance between (0,2) and (2,2): 4 + 0 = 4

Prints 4, correct.

Wait, but what if the points are ordered differently?

Test case:

0 0

1 1

2 0

1 -1

In this case, points are (0,0), (1,1), (2,0), (1,-1)

These points form a square aligned with the axes.

Calculating n: squared distance between (0,0) and (2,0): 4 + 0 = 4

x: squared distance between (1,1) and (1,-1): 0 + 4 = 4

Prints 4, which is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the squared distances are both equal to the side length squared.

But in general, in a square aligned with the axes, the squared distance between any two adjacent points should be equal to the side length squared.

But in this program, it's calculating the squared distance between two pairs of points and printing the smaller one.

But in the cases I've tested, it seems to work.

Is there any case where this approach would fail?

Let me think of a scenario where the squared distances are not equal.

Wait, in a square aligned with the axes, all sides are equal, so the squared distances between adjacent points should all be equal to the side length squared.

But the program is picking two specific pairs of points and calculating their squared distances.

But in the way the program is written, it assumes that the pairs (a,b) and (e,f), and (c,d) and (g,h) are adjacent points.

But since the points are given in random order, there's no guarantee that these pairs are adjacent.

Wait a minute, that seems like a problem.

Let me check the first test case again.

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

In the program, n is the squared distance between (1,2) and (1,5), which are verticaly aligned, and x is between (4,5) and (4,2), which are also vertically aligned.

In this case, both n and x are equal to the side length squared.

Similarly in the second test case, n and x are both equal to the side length squared.

In the third test case, same thing.

So, in these cases, it works because both n and x are equal to the side length squared, so printing either one works.

But what if, in a different ordering, one of n or x corresponds to the diagonal instead of the side?

Wait, in a square aligned with the axes, the diagonals are longer than the sides.

But in the way the program is written, it prints the smaller of n and x.

But if one of them is a diagonal, it would be larger than the side.

Wait, in the earlier test cases, n and x are both side lengths, so they are equal.

But if by some chance, one of them is a diagonal, then printing the smaller one would still give the side length squared.

Let me try to construct such a case.

Suppose the points are:

(0,0)

(0,1)

(1,1)

(1,0)

Now, suppose in the input, they are ordered as:

(0,0)

(1,1)

(0,1)

(1,0)

Then, in the program:

n = squared distance between (0,0) and (0,1): 0 + 1 = 1

x = squared distance between (1,1) and (1,0): 0 + 1 = 1

Prints 1, correct.

Another ordering:

(0,0)

(1,0)

(0,1)

(1,1)

n = squared distance between (0,0) and (0,1): 0 +1 =1

x = squared distance between (1,0) and (1,1): 0 +1 =1

Prints 1, correct.

Wait, but in these cases, n and x are both side lengths.

Is there a way that one of them becomes the diagonal?

Let's try:

Points: (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0)

Suppose input order:

(0,0)

(1,1)

(0,1)

(1,0)

Then, n = (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 0 +1 =1

x = (1-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 =0 +1=1

Prints 1, correct.

Another order:

(0,0)

(1,0)

(0,1)

(1,1)

n = (0-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 =0 +1=1

x = (1-1)^2 + (0-1)^2 =0 +1=1

Again, 1.

Wait, but in a square aligned with the axes, the diagonals are longer than the sides.

But in the way the program is written, it seems to always pick side lengths.

But is there a possibility that it picks a diagonal?

Let's try:

Points: (0,0), (0,2), (2,2), (2,0)

Suppose input order:

(0,0)

(2,2)

(0,2)

(2,0)

Then, n = squared distance between (0,0) and (0,2): 0 +4=4

x = squared distance between (2,2) and (2,0): 0 +4=4

Prints 4, which is correct.

But what if:

(0,0)

(2,0)

(0,2)

(2,2)

n = squared distance between (0,0) and (0,2): 0+4=4

x = squared distance between (2,0) and (2,2): 0+4=4

Again, 4.

Seems consistent.

Wait, maybe in all cases, n and x are equal to the side length squared.

But is that always true?

Wait, in a square aligned with the axes, any two points that share an x or y coordinate are either adjacent or the same point.

Wait, no, in a square aligned with the axes, points share either x or y coordinates with their adjacent points.

Wait, no, in a square aligned with the axes, adjacent points share one coordinate and differ in the other.

For example, from (0,0) to (0,1), they share x=0.

From (0,1) to (1,1), they share y=1.

Wait, but in the program, it's calculating the squared distance between (a,b) and (e,f), and between (c,d) and (g,h).

But in the way the points are read, there's no guarantee that these pairs are adjacent.

Yet, in all the cases I've tried, n and x both turn out to be the side length squared.

Is this always the case?

Let me think about it.

In a square aligned with the axes, the points can be grouped into two pairs that share the same x-coordinate and two pairs that share the same y-coordinate.

The program is calculating the squared distance between one pair of points that share the same x or y, and another pair.

But in all cases, these distances are equal to the side length squared.

Is that always true?

Wait, maybe not.

Consider a square with points (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0).

Possible pairings:

- (0,0) and (0,1): distance squared = 1

- (0,0) and (1,0): distance squared = 1

- (0,0) and (1,1): distance squared = 2 (diagonal)

- (0,1) and (1,0): distance squared = 2 (diagonal)

- (0,1) and (1,1): distance squared = 1

- (1,0) and (1,1): distance squared = 1

So, in this square, there are distances squared of 1 (sides) and 2 (diagonals).

In the program, it calculates n and x as squared distances between specific pairs.

If both pairs are sides, then n and x are both 1, and it prints 1.

If one pair is a side and the other is a diagonal, n and x are 1 and 2, and it prints the smaller one, which is 1.

If both pairs are diagonals, n and x are both 2, and it prints 2, which is not the side length squared.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the points form a valid square with positive area.

But in a square aligned with the axes, the diagonals are equal, and the sides are equal.

So, in the program, it's calculating two squared distances.

If both are sides, it prints the side squared.

If one is a side and one is a diagonal, it prints the side squared.

If both are diagonals, it prints the diagonal squared.

But in the earlier test cases, it worked because both were sides.

But in the third test case, both were sides, so it worked.

But what if, in some ordering, both n and x are diagonals?

Let's construct such a case.

Consider the square with points (0,0), (0,1), (1,1), (1,0).

Suppose the input order is:

(0,0)

(1,1)

(0,1)

(1,0)

Then:

n = squared distance between (0,0) and (0,1): 0 +1=1

x = squared distance between (1,1) and (1,0): 0 +1=1

Prints 1, correct.

Another order:

(0,0)

(1,1)

(1,0)

(0,1)

Then:

n = squared distance between (0,0) and (1,0):1 +0=1

x = squared distance between (1,1) and (0,1):1 +0=1

Prints 1, correct.

Another order:

(0,0)

(0,1)

(1,1)

(1,0)

Then:

n = squared distance between (0,0) and (1,1):1 +1=2

x = squared distance between (0,1) and (1,0):1 +1=2

Prints 2, which is the diagonal squared, which is incorrect for the area.

Wait, but in this case, the area is 1, not 2.

So, in this ordering, the program would print 2, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the program, it prints the smaller of n and x.

Wait, in this case, n and x are both 2, so it prints 2.

But the area should be 1.

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the program.

Looking back at the program:

n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2

x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2

Then, it prints the smaller of n and x.

In the last test case I constructed, n and x are both 2, so it prints 2.

But the correct area is 1.

So, in this case, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it worked because n and x were both equal to the side squared.

But in this particular ordering, n and x are both equal to the diagonal squared.

Hence, it prints the diagonal squared, which is not the area.

So, this suggests that the program is incorrect in general.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the points form a valid square with positive area.

So, perhaps in all valid orderings, n and x are both side squared or one is side squared and the other is diagonal squared.

But in the example I just gave, both are diagonal squared, which leads to incorrect output.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

But in the earlier test cases, it happened to work because n and x were both side squared.

Perhaps in the way the program is written, it assumes that n and x are both side squared, but that's not always the case.

Hence, the correctness is False.

But wait, perhaps there's another way to interpret the program.

Looking back, in the provided program, it's printing the smaller of n and x.

In the case where n and x are both diagonal squared, it would print the diagonal squared, which is larger than the side squared.

But in the earlier test cases, n and x were both side squared, so printing either works.

But in the case where one is side squared and the other is diagonal squared, it would print the side squared, which is correct.

But in the case where both are diagonal squared, it would print the diagonal squared, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

As I thought earlier, a better approach would be to collect all x-coordinates, find the unique ones, compute their difference, which is the side length, and then square it to get the area.

Similarly for y-coordinates.

Since it's guaranteed to be a square aligned with the axes, there should be exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values, and their differences should be equal.

Then, the area is (max(x) - min(x))^2.

This would be a correct approach.

Hence, the provided program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: False

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to compute the area of a square given its four coordinates, which are provided in a random order. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed that the inputs form a valid square with positive area.

### Approach
1. **Input Structure**: Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the square's corners.
2. **Key Insight**: For a square aligned with the axes:
   - There should be exactly two unique x-coordinates.
   - There should be exactly two unique y-coordinates.
   - The difference between the unique x-coordinates gives the side length of the square.
   - Similarly, the difference between the unique y-coordinates should match the side length.
3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is the square of the side length.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        x_coords = []
        y_coords = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x = int(data[index])
            y = int(data[index + 1])
            x_coords.append(x)
            y_coords.append(y)
            index += 2
        unique_x = set(x_coords)
        unique_y = set(y_coords)
        if len(unique_x) != 2 or len(unique_y) != 2:
            raise ValueError("Invalid square coordinates")
        side_length = max(unique_x) - min(unique_x)
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - Extract the coordinates of the four points.
   - Store x and y coordinates in separate lists.
   - Find unique x and y values using sets.
3. **Validation and Area Calculation**:
   - Ensure there are exactly two unique x and y values.
   - Calculate the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x values.
   - Compute the area by squaring the side length.
   - Print the area for each test case.
