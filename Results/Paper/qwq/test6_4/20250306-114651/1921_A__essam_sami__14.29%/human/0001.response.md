Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of four points, which are the corners of a square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it has a positive area. My task is to find the area of this square.

First, I need to understand what it means for a square to have sides parallel to the coordinate axes. That means the sides of the square are either horizontal or vertical, aligning with the x-axis and y-axis. So, the coordinates should reflect that arrangement.

Given four points, I need to determine the area of the square they form. Since it's a square, all sides should be equal, and the angles should be right angles. But since it's given that the sides are parallel to the axes, it simplifies things a bit.

I need to think about how to calculate the area based on the coordinates provided. One way to approach this is to calculate the distances between the points and identify the side length of the square.

Let me recall that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by the formula:

distance = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)

Since it's a square, the distance between adjacent points should be equal, and the distance between diagonally opposite points should be equal as well.

But perhaps there's a better way to approach this, given the constraints.

Wait, since the squares have sides parallel to the axes, the coordinates should have some patterns. For example, for any two points that are adjacent, one coordinate should be the same, and the other should differ by the side length.

But maybe there's a smarter way to find the area without explicitly identifying which points are adjacent.

Let me consider the unique x-coordinates and y-coordinates among the four points.

Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the unique x-coordinates should correspond to the x-coordinates of the vertical sides, and the unique y-coordinates should correspond to the horizontal sides.

So, if I have four points with coordinates (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), (x4, y4), and the square has sides parallel to the axes, then there should be exactly two distinct x-values and two distinct y-values among these points.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

If the square has sides parallel to the axes, then for each pair of points that share the same x-coordinate, their y-coordinates should differ by the side length, and similarly for points sharing the same y-coordinate.

But perhaps it's easier to find the minimal bounding box that contains all four points, given that it's a square with sides parallel to the axes.

Wait, but it's given that the four points are the corners of the square, so the minimal bounding box should be the square itself.

So, the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates should be equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, and that should be the side length of the square.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, to find the area, I can:

1. Find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.

2. Find the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates.

3. Since it's a square, these differences should be equal.

4. The area would then be the square of that difference.

But wait, in the code provided, it's doing something different. Let's look at the code and see what it's doing.

The code is:

import math

def func():

t = int(input())

for steps in range(t):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

(c, d) = map(int, input().split())

(e, f) = map(int, input().split())

(g, h) = map(int, input().split())

n = (a - e)**2 + (b - f)**2

x = (c - g)**2 + (d - h)**2

if x > n:

print(n)

else:

print(x)

So, it's reading four points: (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), (g,h).

Then it calculates two distances squared: n is the squared distance between (a,b) and (e,f), and x is the squared distance between (c,d) and (g,h).

Then it prints the smaller of n and x.

Wait, is this correct?

Given that it's a square with sides parallel to the axes, the distances between points should reflect the side lengths.

But in this approach, it's calculating squared distances between arbitrary pairs of points and choosing the smaller one to print.

But in a square, all sides are equal, and the diagonals are longer than the sides.

But in this case, since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the sides are either horizontal or vertical, and the diagonals run at 45 degrees.

Wait, but in a square with sides parallel to the axes, the sides have equal lengths, and the diagonals are longer, specifically, the diagonal is side * sqrt(2).

But in this code, it's calculating squared distances, so for sides, it would be (side)^2, and for diagonals, it would be (side * sqrt(2))^2 = 2*(side)^2.

So, if it's choosing the smaller of n and x, which are squared distances between two pairs of points, it's assuming that one of them is a side and the other is a diagonal.

But in reality, in a square, there are four sides and two diagonals.

But since it's a square with sides parallel to the axes, perhaps there's a pattern in the coordinates that can be exploited.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to pick the squared side length and print that as the area.

But area is side^2, so if n or x is equal to side^2, then printing n or x would give the area.

But the problem is that the code is picking the smaller of n and x, assuming that n and x are side^2 and diagonal^2, or something similar.

But in reality, in a square, you have sides and diagonals, and in this setup, it's possible that both n and x are side^2, or one is side^2 and the other is diagonal^2.

Wait, but in the code, it's printing the smaller one, assuming that's the side^2.

But in the example provided:

Input:

3

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Output:

9

4

784

Let's verify the first testcase:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Let's plot these points:

(1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Indeed, these form a square with side length 3 (since horizontal and vertical distances are 3 units).

Area should be 9, which matches the first output.

Second testcase:

(-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

These points form a square with side length 2.

Area is 4, which matches the second output.

Third testcase:

(45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

These points form a square with side length 22 (horizontal distance) and 28 (vertical distance), but wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, (45,11) to (45,39) is a vertical distance of 28 (39-11=28).

(45,11) to (17,11) is a horizontal distance of 28 (45-17=28).

So, it's a square with side length 28.

Area should be 784, which matches the third output.

But according to the code, it's calculating squared distances between two pairs of points and choosing the smaller one.

In the first testcase:

n = (1-1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

x = (4-17)^2 + (5-39)^2 = 169 + 1156 = 1325

So, n=9, x=1325, smaller is 9, which is correct.

In the second testcase:

n = (-1-1)^2 + (1-(-1))^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

x = (1-(-1))^2 + (-1-(-1))^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

Smaller is 4, which is correct.

Wait, but the output is 4, which is correct, but according to the earlier reasoning, n and x are squared distances, and in this case, n=8, x=4.

But in the first testcase, n=9, x=1325, which corresponds to side^2 and diagonal^2.

Wait, in the first testcase, side^2=9, diagonal^2=18, but in the code, x=1325, which is not 18. Wait, that's strange.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the first testcase:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 = (1 - 1)^2 + (2 - 5)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 = (4 - 4)^2 + (5 - 2)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

So, n=9, x=9, smaller is 9, which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought x=1325, but that was a mistake.

So, in the first testcase, n=9, x=9, print 9.

In the second testcase:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

n = (-1 - 1)^2 + (1 - 1)^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

x = (1 - (-1))^2 + (-1 - (-1))^2 = 4 + 0 = 4

So, n=4, x=4, print 4.

Third testcase:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

n = (45 - 17)^2 + (11 - 11)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

x = (45 - 17)^2 + (39 - 39)^2 = 784 + 0 = 784

So, n=784, x=784, print 784.

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I thought x=1325, but that was incorrect.

So, in all testcases, n and x are equal and correspond to side^2.

So, the code is picking the smaller one, which is correct.

But is this approach general? Will it always work?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose the points are: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

These form a square with side length 1, area 1.

According to the code:

n = (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2 = 1 + 0 = 1

x = (0-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 + 0 = 1

Smaller is 1, which is correct.

Another example: (0,0), (2,0), (2,2), (0,2)

Square with side 2, area 4.

n = (0-2)^2 + (0-2)^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

x = (2-0)^2 + (0-2)^2 = 4 + 4 = 8

Smaller is 8, but wait, the area should be 4.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, according to the code, it prints the smaller of n and x, which are both 8, but the area is 4.

Wait, this suggests that the code is incorrect.

But in the earlier testcases, it worked because n and x were equal to side^2.

But in this case, n and x are equal to diagonal^2.

Wait, no, in the first testcase, n and x were side^2.

In this new example, n and x are diagonal^2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, in the code, it's calculating squared distances between two pairs of points.

In the first testcase, the pairs were chosen such that they were adjacent points.

In the second testcase, the pairs were also adjacent points.

In the third testcase, the pairs were also adjacent points.

But in my new example, if I choose (0,0) and (2,2), that's a diagonal, and (2,0) and (0,2), that's also a diagonal.

So, n and x would both be diagonal^2=8, and the code would print 8, but the area is side^2=4.

So, in this case, the code is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the four points form a valid square with positive area, sides parallel to the axes.

But in my new example, the points do form such a square, but the code fails to compute the correct area.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the points are being paired in the code.

In the code, it's pairing the points as:

(a,b) and (e,f) for n, and (c,d) and (g,h) for x.

But in the input, the points are given in random order.

So, it's possible that n and x correspond to either sides or diagonals, depending on how the points are paired.

In the first testcase, by chance, both n and x were side^2.

In the second testcase, same.

In the third testcase, same.

But in my new example, n and x are both diagonal^2.

So, the code is incorrect because it doesn't ensure that it's picking the side^2.

Wait, but in the first testcase, n and x were both side^2, and in my new example, they are both diagonal^2.

But according to the code, it's printing the smaller of n and x.

In both cases, it's printing n or x, which coincidentally matched the side^2 in the first testcase and diagonal^2 in my new example.

But in the new example, it would print 8, which is incorrect, as area should be 4.

So, the code is flawed.

But in the given testcases, it worked because n and x were side^2.

But it's not a general solution.

So, the correctness should be False.

But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the four points form a valid square with positive area and sides parallel to the axes.

So, perhaps there's a pattern in how the coordinates are related.

Let me think differently.

Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the x-coordinates of the points will have only two distinct values, and the y-coordinates will also have only two distinct values.

For example, in the first testcase:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Unique x: 1 and 4

Unique y: 2 and 5

So, the side length is the difference between the x's or y's: 4-1=3, 5-2=3.

Area is 3^2=9.

Similarly, in the second testcase:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Unique x: -1 and 1

Unique y: -1 and 1

Side length: 1 - (-1) = 2

Area: 4

Third testcase:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Unique x: 45 and 17

Unique y: 11 and 39

Side length: 45 - 17 = 28

Area: 784

So, in all these cases, the side length is the difference between the unique x-values or y-values, and both differences should be equal since it's a square.

Therefore, a correct approach would be:

- Collect all x-coordinates and find the difference between the maximum and minimum x.

- Collect all y-coordinates and find the difference between the maximum and minimum y.

- Ensure both differences are equal (since it's a square).

- The area would be (max_x - min_x)^2.

But in the code, it's calculating squared distances between arbitrary pairs of points and choosing the smaller one.

This approach is flawed because it doesn't guarantee that it's selecting the side length.

In my earlier example:

Points: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

Unique x: 0 and 1

Unique y: 0 and 1

Side length: 1

Area: 1

But according to the code:

n = (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2 = 1 + 0 = 1

x = (0-1)^2 + (1-1)^2 = 1 + 0 = 1

Smaller is 1, which is correct.

But in another pairing:

n = (0-1)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2

x = (0-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2

Smaller is 2, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, it's pairing the first and third points for n, and second and fourth points for x.

In the input, points are given in four lines, so the pairing is fixed.

But in the problem, points are given in random order.

So, it's possible that n and x correspond to sides or diagonals.

In the first testcase, they corresponded to sides.

In my new example, they correspond to sides.

But if the points are paired differently, it might pick diagonals.

Wait, in the third testcase, n and x were both side^2.

So, perhaps in the way the code pairs the points, n and x are always side^2.

But in my new example, if I input points in a certain order, it might pick diagonals.

Let me try reordering the points in my new example.

Suppose points are: (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)

Then:

(a,b) = (0,0)

(c,d) = (1,0)

(e,f) = (1,1)

(g,h) = (0,1)

n = (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 = (0-1)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2

x = (c - g)^2 + (d - h)^2 = (1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 = 1 + 1 = 2

Smaller is 2, but actual area is 1.

So, in this ordering, the code is incorrect.

But in the first ordering I tried, it coincidentally worked.

So, the code is flawed because it depends on the ordering of the points.

But according to the problem, points are given in random order, so it's not safe to assume a particular pairing.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

A better approach would be to collect all x-coordinates, find the difference between max and min x, similarly for y, and ensure they are equal, then compute the area.

So, the correct code should be something like:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

x = []

y = []

for _ in range(4):

a, b = map(int, input().split())

x.append(a)

y.append(b)

width = max(x) - min(x)

height = max(y) - min(y)

assert width == height  # guaranteed by the problem

area = width * width

print(area)

This ensures that we correctly calculate the side length and then the area, regardless of the order of points.

Therefore, the given code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
