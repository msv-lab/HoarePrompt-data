Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Monocarp has n friends, and he wants at least 2 of them to come to his party. Each friend has a best friend, and this best friend relationship is defined by p_i, which is the best friend of the i-th friend. The conditions are that all p_i are distinct and p_i is not equal to i, which makes sense because nobody is their own best friend.

Now, the way friends come to the party is a bit specific. The i-th friend will come to the party only if both they and their best friend (p_i) receive an invitation. Importantly, the best friend doesn't have to come, just receive an invitation. Each invitation is sent to exactly one friend.

So, my task is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least two friends come to the party.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i are distinct and p_i != i, this forms a permutation of the friends where no element is in its own position. In other words, it's a derangement.

Let me think about what this means. If I have friend 1, and their best friend is friend 3, and friend 3's best friend is friend 2, and friend 2's best friend is friend 1, then they form a cycle of length 3. In general, the relationships can form cycles of various lengths.

Now, for friends to come to the party, both they and their best friend need to receive invitations. So, if I invite friend 1 and friend 3, then friend 1 will come because both they and their best friend (friend 3) are invited. Similarly, friend 3 will come because both they and their best friend (friend 2) are invited. But wait, friend 2 needs to be invited for friend 3 to come, but in this scenario, friend 2 hasn't been invited yet.

Wait, I need to be careful here. Let's re-examine the condition: friend i comes if both they and p_i are invited. So, for friend 1 to come, both friend 1 and friend 3 need to be invited. For friend 3 to come, both friend 3 and friend 2 need to be invited. For friend 2 to come, both friend 2 and friend 1 need to be invited.

So, in this cycle of three friends, if I invite friend 1 and friend 3, then friend 1 will come because both they and friend 3 are invited. Friend 3 will come because both they and friend 2 are invited, but friend 2 hasn't been invited, so friend 3 doesn't come. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, the condition is that friend i comes if both they and p_i are invited. So, for friend 3 to come, both friend 3 and friend 2 need to be invited. But in this scenario, friend 2 hasn't been invited, so friend 3 doesn't come. Therefore, only friend 1 comes, which isn't enough.

So, in this case, to get at least two friends to come, I need to ensure that for at least two friends, both they and their best friends are invited.

Let me consider different cycle structures.

Case 1: A single cycle of length 3.

Suppose n=3, p=[2,3,1].

If I invite friend 1 and friend 2, then:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so friend 1 comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited? No, friend 3 isn't invited, so friend 2 doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes, which is not enough.

If I invite friend 1, friend 2, and friend 3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

All three come, which is more than enough, but I'm trying to minimize the number of invitations.

Is there a way to invite fewer than 3 to get at least 2 to come? Let's see.

If I invite friend 1 and friend 3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes, which is not enough.

If I invite friend 1, friend 2, and friend 3, that's 3 invitations, and all come.

Is there a way to invite only 2 and get at least 2 to come? Seems not, because in a cycle of 3, inviting any 2 will only result in one coming, since the best friend of the second invited isn't invited.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose I invite friend 1 and friend 2.

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes.

Alternatively, invite friend 1 and friend 3.

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes.

Invite friend 2 and friend 3.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

Both friend 2 and friend 3 come, which is at least 2.

So, in this case, inviting friend 2 and friend 3 results in both coming, satisfying the condition with only 2 invitations.

Wait, but earlier when I tried inviting friend 1 and friend 3, only friend 3 came, but inviting friend 2 and friend 3 makes both come.

So, in a cycle of 3, inviting any 2 adjacent friends in the cycle makes both come.

Wait, in this cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1.

If I invite friend 2 and friend 3:

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friend 2 and friend 3 come.

Similarly, inviting friend 1 and friend 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes, which is not enough.

Wait, so in this case, inviting friend 1 and friend 3 doesn't work because friend 1 doesn't come (since p_1=2 isn't invited), and friend 3 comes (since p_3=1 is invited). So, only friend 3 comes.

But inviting friend 2 and friend 3 works because both come.

Similarly, inviting friend 1 and friend 2 doesn't work because only friend 1 comes.

So, in a cycle of 3, inviting any two who are directly connected in the cycle works, but inviting two who are not directly connected might not work.

Wait, in this cycle, every pair is directly connected except for friend 1 and friend 3, which are connected through friend 2.

Wait, no, in a cycle of 3, every friend is directly connected to two others.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of edges in a graph.

Let me model this as a graph where friends are nodes, and best friend relationships are directed edges.

So, for p=[2,3,1], we have:

1 -> 2

2 -> 3

3 -> 1

This forms a cycle.

In this graph, to make a friend come, we need to invite both the friend and their best friend.

So, for friend i to come, we need to invite i and p_i.

In the above example, inviting friend 2 and friend 3:

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, two come.

Similarly, inviting friend 1 and friend 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes.

Wait, but according to the earlier example, inviting friend 1 and friend 3 results in only friend 3 coming.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a cycle of length 3, inviting any two friends who are not directly connected doesn't work.

Wait, in this cycle, every two friends are directly connected, since it's a triangle.

Wait, no, in a cycle of 3, every friend is directly connected to two others.

So, in this case, inviting any two friends works, because in a cycle of 3, any two friends are directly connected.

Wait, but earlier, inviting friend 1 and friend 2 only makes friend 1 come, because friend 2 doesn't have their best friend (friend 3) invited.

Wait, no, wait:

- Invite friend 1 and friend 2.

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes.

But inviting friend 2 and friend 3:

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

Both friend 2 and friend 3 come.

Similarly, inviting friend 1 and friend 3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes.

So, in this case, to get at least two friends to come, I need to invite three friends.

Wait, no, in the second scenario, inviting friend 2 and friend 3 makes two come.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=4 with p=[2,3,4,1], the sample input says the answer is 3.

Wait, let's look back at the sample input.

Sample Input:

3

5

3 1 2 5 4

4

2 3 4 1

2

2 1

Sample Output:

2

3

2

Wait, in the first test case, n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], and the output is 2.

In the explanation, it says Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5, and both will come because they are each other's best friends.

Wait, in p, friend 4's best friend is 5, and friend 5's best friend is 4.

So, they form a cycle of length 2.

In this case, inviting both friend 4 and friend 5 makes both come, since each has the other invited.

So, in cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come.

In cycles of length 3, as in the earlier example, inviting two adjacent friends makes both come.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=3, p=[2,3,1], inviting friend 2 and friend 3 makes both come.

Similarly, in n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], which is a cycle of length 4.

In the problem statement, it says the answer is 3.

Wait, but in a cycle of 4, inviting 3 friends might be sufficient to have at least two come.

Let me see.

Suppose n=4, p=[2,3,4,1].

If I invite friend 1, friend 2, and friend 3:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friend 1 and friend 2 come.

Alternatively, inviting friend 2, friend 3, and friend 4:

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friend 2 and friend 3 come.

Similarly, inviting friend 1, friend 3, and friend 4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

So, friend 3 and friend 4 come.

In all these cases, inviting 3 friends makes 2 come.

Is it possible to invite only 2 friends and have at least 2 come?

Let's try inviting friend 1 and friend 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 1 comes.

Inviting friend 2 and friend 3:

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 2 comes.

Inviting friend 3 and friend 4:

- Friend 3: invited and p_3=4 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 1: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 3 comes.

Inviting friend 1 and friend 4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: not invited, so doesn't come.

- Friend 3: not invited, so doesn't come.

Only friend 4 comes.

So, in this case, inviting any two friends only makes one come, whereas inviting three makes two come.

Hence, the minimum number of invitations is 3.

Now, in the third test case, n=2, p=[2,1], which is a cycle of length 2.

Inviting both friend 1 and friend 2:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so comes.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=1 is invited, so comes.

Both come, so inviting 2 friends makes both come.

Hence, the minimum number of invitations is 2.

From these observations, it seems that:

- In cycles of length 2, inviting both makes both come, so minimum invitations are 2.

- In cycles of length 3, inviting any two adjacent friends makes both come, so minimum invitations are 2.

- In cycles of length 4, inviting any three consecutive friends makes two come, so minimum invitations are 3.

Wait, but in the first test case with n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4], which has a cycle structure, Monocarp can invite friend 4 and friend 5, who are each other's best friends, forming a cycle of length 2, and both come.

Similarly, in n=4 with p=[2,3,4,1], which is a cycle of length 4, inviting any three consecutive friends makes two come.

In n=2 with p=[2,1], inviting both makes both come.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If there is a cycle of length 2, inviting both friends in that cycle makes both come, so minimum invitations are 2.

- In cycles of length greater than 2, inviting k friends in a way that covers at least two friendships (i.e., two friends coming) requires inviting k friends, where k is less than the cycle length.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting a set of friends such that at least two of them have their best friends also invited.

In graph terms, it's like selecting a set S where for at least two nodes in S, their best friend is also in S.

Given that the best friend relationship is a permutation with no fixed points and all p_i are distinct, it forms a collection of disjoint cycles.

In each cycle, to have at least two friends come, we need to select a subset of the cycle such that at least two friends have their best friend also in the subset.

This sounds similar to selecting a dominating set in a graph, but adapted to this specific structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about selecting edges in the cycle such that at least two edges are "covered".

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in a cycle of length c, to have at least two friends come, I need to select a subset of the cycle such that at least two friends and their best friends are both selected.

In a cycle of length c, the minimum number of invitations needed to have at least two friends come is:

- If c = 2, then 2 invitations.

- If c >= 3, then c - floor(c/3).

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a single cycle of length c.

To have at least two friends come, I need to select a subset S of the cycle such that at least two friends in S have their best friends also in S.

In other words, in S, there are at least two friends i and j such that p_i and p_j are both in S.

In a cycle, this can be achieved by selecting certain friends.

In a cycle of length 2, selecting both makes both come.

In a cycle of length 3, selecting any two makes at least one come, but in the earlier example, it made two come.

Wait, in the earlier n=3 example, selecting two friends made two come, but in the n=4 example, selecting three made two come.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of length c >= 3, the minimum number of invitations to have at least two come is floor(c/2) + 1.

Wait, for c=3, floor(3/2)+1=2, which matches the earlier observation.

For c=4, floor(4/2)+1=3, which matches the sample input.

For c=2, floor(2/2)+1=2, which also matches.

So, perhaps the formula is floor(c/2) + 1 for each cycle.

But let's verify for c=1, but c=1 is not possible since p_i != i.

Wait, but in the problem, p_i != i, so no cycles of length 1.

So, for cycles of length c >= 2, the minimum number of invitations is floor(c/2) + 1.

But in the n=3 case, floor(3/2)+1=2, which matches.

In n=4, floor(4/2)+1=3, which matches.

In n=5, with a cycle of length 2 and a cycle of length 3, the minimum is 2, as per the sample input.

Wait, but in n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], which is two cycles: 1-3-2 and 4-5.

In this case, since there are two separate cycles, I can handle them independently.

To have at least two friends come, I can choose to invite in such a way that at least two friends from one cycle come, or one from each cycle, etc.

But in this case, inviting friend 4 and friend 5 makes two come from the cycle of length 2.

Similarly, in the cycle 1-3-2, inviting any two makes two come.

But in the sample input, it's n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], and the output is 2.

So, in this case, with two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2, inviting two friends from the cycle of length 2 is sufficient to have two come.

Hence, the minimum number of invitations is 2.

Similarly, in n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], which is one cycle of length 4, the minimum is 3.

In n=2, p=[2,1], which is one cycle of length 2, the minimum is 2.

So, in general, for multiple cycles, the minimum number of invitations is the minimum over all possible ways to have at least two friends come from the combined cycles.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to model this as a graph where friends are nodes and best friend relationships are edges.

Since p_i are distinct and p_i != i, this forms a simple graph where each node has exactly one outgoing edge and one incoming edge, forming disjoint cycles.

Now, to have at least two friends come, we need to select a subset S of nodes such that at least two nodes in S have their best friend also in S.

This is similar to selecting a subset S where the number of nodes i in S such that p_i is in S is at least two.

This is somewhat similar to a dominating set, but not exactly.

An efficient way to compute this is to look for cycles in the permutation and determine the minimal number of invitations per cycle.

Given that, for a single cycle of length c:

- If c = 2, inviting both makes both come, so 2 invitations.

- If c >= 3, inviting floor(c/2) + 1 invitations is sufficient to have at least two come.

Wait, in c=3, inviting 2 makes two come.

In c=4, inviting 3 makes two come.

In c=5, inviting floor(5/2)+1=3 invitations would make at least two come.

But in the sample input with n=5 and two cycles: one of length 3 and one of length 2, the minimum is 2 invitations.

Similarly, in n=4 with one cycle of length 4, it's 3 invitations.

In n=2 with one cycle of length 2, it's 2 invitations.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

For a graph consisting of disjoint cycles, the minimal number of invitations is the minimum number needed to have at least two friends come from any cycle.

But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the minimal number across all cycles.

But in the n=5 case, with cycles of length 2 and 3, the minimal is 2, which is the minimal of the two.

Similarly, in n=4 with one cycle of length 4, it's 3.

In n=2 with one cycle of length 2, it's 2.

So, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is the minimal over the minimal invitations required for each cycle.

In other words, for each cycle, calculate the minimal invitations needed to have at least two friends come from that cycle, and then take the minimal across all cycles.

But in the n=5 case, with cycles of length 2 and 3, the minimal for the cycle of length 2 is 2, and for the cycle of length 3 is 2, so the overall minimal is 2.

In n=4 with one cycle of length 4, the minimal is 3.

In n=2 with one cycle of length 2, the minimal is 2.

This seems consistent.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of invitations is the minimal of the minimal invitations required for each cycle.

But wait, in n=5 with cycles of length 2 and 3, the minimal is 2, which is the minimal of the two cycles' minimal invitations.

Similarly, in n=4 with one cycle of length 4, the minimal is 3.

So, perhaps the general formula is:

Find the minimal number of invitations required for each cycle, and then take the minimal across all cycles, but ensure that at least two friends come in total.

Wait, but in n=5 with cycles of length 2 and 3, inviting 2 from the cycle of length 2 makes two come, which satisfies the condition.

Similarly, in n=4 with one cycle of length 4, inviting 3 makes two come.

In n=2 with one cycle of length 2, inviting 2 makes two come.

Hence, perhaps for multiple cycles, the minimal number of invitations is the minimal among the minimal invitations required for each cycle to have at least two friends come from that cycle.

But in n=5, both cycles require at least 2 invitations to have at least two friends come from that cycle, and inviting 2 from the cycle of length 2 suffices.

Similarly, in n=4 with one cycle of length 4, it's 3 invitations.

In n=2, it's 2 invitations.

Hence, perhaps the general formula is:

For each cycle, calculate the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least two friends from that cycle come, and then take the minimal across all cycles.

But in n=5, both cycles require 2 invitations to have at least two friends come from that cycle, so the minimal is 2.

In n=4, the single cycle of length 4 requires 3 invitations to have at least two come from that cycle.

In n=2, the single cycle of length 2 requires 2 invitations.

Hence, in general, for a graph with multiple cycles, the minimal number of invitations is the minimal of the minimal invitations required for each cycle to have at least two friends come from that cycle.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, in n=5 with cycles of length 2 and 3, inviting 2 from the cycle of length 2 makes two come from that cycle, which satisfies the condition.

Similarly, in n=4 with one cycle of length 4, inviting 3 makes two come from that cycle.

In n=2 with one cycle of length 2, inviting 2 makes two come from that cycle.

Hence, this seems consistent.

Therefore, to generalize, for each cycle of length c:

- If c = 2, minimal invitations are 2.

- If c >= 3, minimal invitations are floor(c/2) + 1.

Then, the overall minimal number of invitations is the minimal across all cycles' minimal invitations.

But in n=5, both cycles have minimal invitations of 2, so overall minimal is 2.

In n=4, one cycle of length 4 has minimal invitations of 3, so overall minimal is 3.

In n=2, one cycle of length 2 has minimal invitations of 2, so overall minimal is 2.

This matches the sample inputs.

Hence, this seems correct.

But let's verify with another example.

Suppose n=6, with cycles: one of length 2 and one of length 4.

According to this formula, the minimal invitations would be 2 (from the cycle of length 2), which should be correct, as inviting two from the cycle of length 2 makes two come.

Similarly, in n=6 with cycles of length 3 and 3, minimal invitations would be 2 for each cycle, so overall minimal is 2.

Wait, but in n=6 with two cycles of length 3, inviting two from one cycle makes two come from that cycle, which satisfies the condition.

Hence, this seems consistent.

Another way to think about it is to select the smallest cycle and calculate the minimal invitations for that cycle.

Since the minimal invitations for cycles of length 2 is 2, and for cycles of length c >= 3 is floor(c/2) + 1, the overall minimal is the minimal of these across all cycles.

Hence, in the earlier n=5 case, with cycles of length 2 and 3, the minimal is 2.

In n=4 with one cycle of length 4, the minimal is 3.

In n=2 with one cycle of length 2, the minimal is 2.

This seems correct.

Hence, to solve the problem, I need to:

1. Decompose the permutation into its disjoint cycles.

2. For each cycle, determine the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least two friends come from that cycle.

3. The overall minimal number of invitations is the minimal across all cycles' minimal invitations.

Now, in terms of implementation, decomposing the permutation into cycles can be done by traversing the permutation and marking visited nodes.

Given that n can be up to 50 and t can be up to 5000, efficiency is important, but since n is small, even O(n^2) per test case should be acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to be attempting something different.

Let's look at the code:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

v = [0] * (n + 1)

v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if v[v[i]] == i:

print(2)

return

print(3)

So, it reads t test cases, and for each, calls func_1.

In func_1:

- Read n.

- Read the permutation p into v, with v[0] = 0.

- Then, for each i from 1 to n, check if v[v[i]] == i.

- If for any i, v[v[i]] == i, print 2 and return.

- Otherwise, print 3.

So, it's checking if there exists an i such that p_{p_i} = i.

What does this mean?

Given that p_i is the best friend of i, p_{p_i} is the best friend of the best friend of i.

So, if p_{p_i} = i, then i and p_i form a cycle of length 2: i -> p_i -> i.

In other words, they are each other's best friends.

Hence, if such a pair exists, then inviting these two makes both come, so minimal invitations are 2.

Otherwise, in the absence of such a pair, the minimal invitations are 3.

This seems consistent with the earlier observations.

In the first sample input with n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4], there is a cycle of length 2: 4 and 5 are each other's best friends.

Hence, minimal invitations are 2.

In the second sample input with n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1], there are no such pairs where p_{p_i} =
