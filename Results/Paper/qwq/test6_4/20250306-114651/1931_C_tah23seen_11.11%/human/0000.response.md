Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that it can always be done.

First, I need to consider what it means to make all elements equal. If all elements are already equal, then I don't need to do anything, and the cost is 0. That seems straightforward.

But if the array has different elements, I need to decide which part of the array to set to a particular value to minimize the cost.

The operation allows me to set a contiguous subarray to a single value x. I can do this operation at most once, meaning I can set one subarray to a uniform value, and the rest of the array remains as is. After this operation, all elements should be equal.

Wait, but if I set a subarray to a certain value, the elements outside this subarray remain unchanged. For all elements to be equal, the value I choose for the subarray must be the same as the value of the elements outside the subarray.

But the elements outside the subarray might not all be the same. So, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that after the operation, all elements in the array should be equal to some value, say y. So, I need to set all elements that are not equal to y to y.

But I can only perform the operation once, which allows me to set a single contiguous subarray to a value x.

Wait, but I need to make the entire array equal to y. So, if I set a subarray to y, the rest of the array must already be y, or I need to set them to y as well.

But I can only perform one operation, which sets only one subarray to x.

This seems tricky. Maybe I need to choose a value y that is already present in the array and minimize the cost of setting the necessary elements to y.

Wait, perhaps I should think about finding the longest subarray where all elements are already equal, and then set the remaining parts to that value.

But no, because I can only set one subarray to a single value.

Wait, perhaps I need to set the entire array to a single value, which would cost n burles, but maybe I can find a better way by setting only a part of the array and letting the rest remain as is, but ensuring that everything ends up equal.

This is confusing. Let me look at the example provided.

In the first example:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

The sample output is 4.

In the explanation, it says that by choosing i=2, j=4, x=8, the array becomes [1,8,8,8,5,1]. But this doesn't make all elements equal. So maybe I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, no. The problem says "make all the elements of the array equal", but in the example, after the operation, the array is not fully equal. So perhaps I need to perform additional operations, but the problem says I can perform the operation at most once.

Wait, but the problem says "no more than once", meaning I can choose to perform the operation zero or one time.

But in the example, to make all elements equal, I might need to perform the operation more than once, but the constraint is to perform it at most once.

Wait, no, the problem says "no more than once", but the example provided seems to suggest otherwise.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Let me read the problem again carefully.

"You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers i, j, x (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x. The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles."

"Make all the elements of the array equal."

"Output the minimum number of burles that will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal."

Wait, but in the example, with input:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Output is 4.

How can I make all elements equal with one operation costing 4 burles?

Wait, maybe I need to set a subarray to a value such that the remaining elements are already equal to that value.

Wait, in the first example, if I set indices 2 to 5 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which costs 4 burles.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in general, I need to find a value y, and a subarray to set to y, such that the rest of the array already equals y, or I can set the subarray in a way that makes the entire array equal to y.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose a value y that appears in the array, and find the minimal subarray to set to y such that the rest of the array is already y.

But if y is already present in the array, and I set a subarray to y, I need to ensure that the parts outside the subarray are already y.

Wait, that seems too restrictive.

Maybe I need to consider that after setting a subarray to y, the entire array should be y.

So, I need to set a subarray to y, and ensure that the elements outside this subarray are already y.

But that would require that the elements outside the subarray are already y.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to choose y not necessarily present in the array.

Wait, but I need to set a subarray to x, and the rest remains as is, but to make the entire array equal, the rest must already be equal to x.

This seems too limiting.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that I can set the entire array to a single value in one operation, which would cost n burles.

But perhaps there are better ways by choosing a subarray to set to a value that matches the rest.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the size of the smallest subarray that, when set to a certain value, makes the entire array equal to that value.

But I need to think about it differently.

An alternative approach is to find the largest subarray where the elements are already equal, and then set the remaining parts to that value.

Wait, that makes sense.

If I find the largest subarray where all elements are equal to some value y, and set the rest of the array to y, the cost would be the size of the rest of the array.

But since I can perform at most one operation, I need to set one subarray to y, and assume that the rest is already y.

Wait, but in reality, the rest may not be y.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a value y, find the minimal subarray to set to y such that the entire array becomes y.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me consider that I can set one subarray to a value x, and the rest remains as is, but to make the entire array equal, x must be equal to the value in the rest of the array.

But the rest of the array may have different values.

So, perhaps I need to choose x such that the rest of the array is already x, or I need to set the rest of the array to x as well, but I can only set one subarray.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I need to think about the entire array being set to a single value, and the operation allows me to set one subarray to that value, and the rest must already be that value.

But that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is the size of the array minus the maximum number of consecutive elements that are already equal.

Wait, that could be a possibility.

Let me think about the first example:

Array: [1,2,3,4,5,1]

The longest subarray with equal elements is of length 1 (since no elements are equal).

So, the minimal cost would be 6 - 1 = 5 burles.

But in the sample input, the output is 4, not 5.

So, that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's the size of the array minus the maximum number of equal elements in any subarray.

But in this case, the maximum number of equal elements in any subarray is 1, and 6 - 1 = 5, but the sample output is 4.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's the minimal number of elements that need to be set to make all elements equal.

For example, choose to set elements at positions 2,3,4 to 1, so the array becomes [1,1,1,1,5,1], and then set element at position 5 to 1, but that would require two operations, which is not allowed.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, in the first sample input, setting i=2 to j=4 to 1 makes the array [1,1,1,1,5,1], which still has a 5 in position 5.

So, to make the entire array equal to 1, I would need to set position 5 to 1, but that's a second operation, which is not allowed.

Wait, but according to the problem, I can perform the operation at most once, meaning zero or one time.

So, in this case, to make all elements equal, I need to set positions 2 to 5 to 1, which costs 4 burles, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], which is all equal.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, in this case, the minimal cost is 4 burles.

Another sample input:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Output: 0

Which makes sense because all elements are already equal.

Another sample input:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Output: 2

If I set positions 4 and 5 to 8, which costs 2 burles, the array becomes [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8], which is all equal.

Yes, that makes sense.

Another sample input:

1

1

Output: 0

Since there's only one element, it's already equal.

Another sample input:

2

1 2

Output: 1

If I set either element to the other's value, it costs 1 burle.

For example, set position 1 to 2, array becomes [2,2], or set position 2 to 1, array becomes [1,1].

Another sample input:

3

1 2 3

Output: 2

If I set positions 1 and 2 to 3, cost is 2, array becomes [3,3,3].

Alternatively, set positions 2 and 3 to 1, cost is 2, array becomes [1,1,1].

Another sample input:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

Output: 6

If I set positions 1 to 6 to 1, cost is 6, array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set position 7 to 1, but that's two operations.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps setting positions 1 to 6 to 1 costs 6, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all equal, so I need to set position 7 to 1 in a second operation, which is not allowed.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

If I set positions 2 to 7 to 1, cost is 6, array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is not all equal, so I need to set position 1 to 1 in a second operation, which is not allowed.

Alternatively, set positions 1 to 5 to 1, cost is 5, array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then set position 7 to 1, which is a second operation.

Alternatively, set positions 3 to 7 to 1, cost is 5, array becomes [4,3,1,1,1,1,1], which is not all equal.

Seems like the minimal cost is indeed 6 burles.

Last sample input:

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Output: 7

If I set positions 1 to 9 to 5, cost is 9, array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5].

Alternatively, set positions 3 to 9 to 5, cost is 7, array becomes [9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5], then set positions 1 and 2 to 5, but that's a second operation.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation, so setting positions 3 to 9 to 5 costs 7 burles, and the array becomes [9,9,5,5,5,5,5,5,5]. To make the entire array equal to 5, I would need to set positions 1 and 2 to 5, but that's a second operation, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps setting positions 1 to 7 to 5, cost is 7, array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3], which is not all equal, so I need to set position 9 to 5, which is a second operation.

Alternatively, set positions 1 to 5 to 5, cost is 5, array becomes [5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,3], then set position 9 to 5, which is a second operation.

Seems like the minimal cost is indeed 7 burles.

From these observations, it seems that the minimal cost is the size of the smallest subarray that needs to be set to a certain value to make the entire array equal.

But how do I find that efficiently?

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I choose a value y, and I want to set some subarray to y, and ensure that the entire array becomes y.

That means, all elements outside this subarray must already be y.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the size of the subarray that is already y, and set the remaining parts to y.

Wait, but I can only set one subarray to y.

Wait, perhaps I need to set the subarray that is not equal to y to y.

Wait, but I can only set one subarray to y.

So, I need to choose a value y, and a subarray to set to y, such that the entire array becomes y.

This means that the parts of the array outside this subarray must already be y.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to choose y and a subarray such that the subarray is as small as possible, but still makes the entire array equal to y.

This seems tricky to compute directly.

An alternative approach is to realize that the minimal cost is equal to the size of the array minus the maximum number of consecutive elements that are already equal.

Wait, in the first sample input, the size is 6, and the maximum number of consecutive equal elements is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, but the sample output is 4, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the size minus the maximum number of equal elements in any subarray.

But in the first sample, the maximum number of equal elements in any subarray is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, but the output is 4, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's the size minus the maximum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the most frequent value.

But in the first sample, the most frequent value is 1, which appears twice, in positions 1 and 6, which are not consecutive, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, but output is 4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's the size minus the maximum number of consecutive elements that are equal, regardless of the value.

In the first sample, the maximum number of consecutive equal elements is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, but output is 4.

Not matching.

Wait, maybe it's the size minus the maximum run length of any value.

But in the first sample, the maximum run length is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, but output is 4.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the size minus the maximum number of elements that are equal to the most frequent value, assuming I set the rest to that value.

In the first sample, the most frequent value is 1, appearing twice, so 6 - 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, in the second sample, all elements are 1, so 7 - 7 = 0, matches output.

In the third sample, there are three 8's in a row, so 8 - 3 = 5, but the output is 2, so doesn't match.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Wait, in the third sample, 8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8, the most frequent value is 8, appearing six times, so 8 - 6 = 2, which matches the sample output.

Yes, that seems correct.

In the fourth sample, n=1, only one element, so cost is 0.

In the fifth sample, n=2, [1,2], most frequent value appears once, so 2 - 1 = 1, matches output.

In the sixth sample, n=3, [1,2,3], most frequent value appears once, so 3 - 1 = 2, matches output.

In the seventh sample, n=7, [4,3,2,7,1,1,3], most frequent value is 1 or 3, appearing twice, so 7 - 2 = 5, but sample output is 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's not the most frequent value, but the value with the maximum run length.

In the first sample, maximum run length is 1, so 6 - 1 = 5, but output is 4.

In the third sample, maximum run length is 3 (for 8), so 8 - 3 = 5, but output is 2.

Wait, doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps it's the size minus the maximum number of elements that can be made equal with zero cost.

But I need a better approach.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I choose to make the entire array equal to a specific value y.

I need to set some subarray to y, and the rest must already be y.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already y outside the subarray.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

An alternative approach is to consider that I can set one subarray to a value x, and the rest of the array must be x already.

But since the rest may not be x, I need to choose x such that the rest of the array is already x, or as close as possible.

But I need to minimize the cost, which is the size of the subarray set.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a value y that appears in the array, and find the minimal subarray to set to y such that the entire array becomes y.

This would involve setting the parts of the array that are not y to y by setting an appropriate subarray.

To minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already y, so that the subarray I set is as small as possible.

Wait, that makes sense.

So, for each possible value y, calculate the minimal subarray that needs to be set to y to make the entire array equal to y.

Then, choose the y that minimizes this cost.

How do I calculate the minimal subarray for a given y?

I need to cover all positions where the array is not equal to y with one subarray.

So, find the minimal subarray that covers all non-y elements.

If there are multiple non-y elements, the minimal subarray would be from the first non-y to the last non-y.

If there are no non-y elements, the cost is 0.

So, for each y, find the minimal subarray that covers all non-y elements.

The cost would be the size of this subarray.

Then, choose the y that minimizes this cost.

This seems efficient.

Let me test this approach with the first sample input.

Array: [1,2,3,4,5,1], n=6

Possible y values are 1,2,3,4,5.

For y=1:

Non-1 elements are at positions 2,3,4,5.

The minimal subarray covering positions 2 to 5 has size 4.

Cost is 4.

For y=2:

Non-2 elements are at positions 1,3,4,5,6.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 6 has size 6.

Cost is 6.

For y=3:

Non-3 elements are at positions 1,2,4,5,6.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 6 has size 6.

Cost is 6.

For y=4:

Non-4 elements are at positions 1,2,3,5,6.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 6 has size 6.

Cost is 6.

For y=5:

Non-5 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,6.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 6 has size 6.

Cost is 6.

So, the minimal cost is 4, which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another sample input:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Possible y values are 1,2,8.

For y=8:

Non-8 elements are at positions 4 and 5.

Minimal subarray covering positions 4 to 5 has size 2.

Cost is 2.

For y=1:

Non-1 elements are at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7,8.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 8 has size 8.

Cost is 8.

For y=2:

Non-2 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,6,7,8.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 8 has size 8.

Cost is 8.

So, the minimal cost is 2, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

Possible y values are 4,3,2,7,1.

For y=1:

Non-1 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 5 has size 5.

Cost is 5.

For y=3:

Non-3 elements are at positions 1,2,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 7 has size 7.

Cost is 7.

For y=2:

Non-2 elements are at positions 1,3,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 7 has size 7.

Cost is 7.

For y=7:

Non-7 elements are at positions 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 7 has size 7.

Cost is 7.

For y=4:

Non-4 elements are at positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Minimal subarray covering positions 2 to 7 has size 6.

Cost is 6.

So, the minimal cost is 5, but the sample output is 6. Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in this approach, for y=1, non-1 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,7.

Wait, the array is [4,3,2,7,1,1,3].

So, positions:

1:4, 2:3, 3:2, 4:7, 5:1, 6:1, 7:3.

So, for y=1, non-1 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,7.

So, the minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 7, which has size 7.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 6.

Wait, maybe I need to choose y=1 and set positions 1 to 6 to 1, which costs 6, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], then I need to set position 7 to 1, but that's a second operation, which is not allowed.

Wait, but according to my approach, for y=1, the minimal subarray to cover positions 1,2,3,4,7 is from position 1 to 7, which has size 7.

But in the sample output, it's 6.

Wait, maybe I need to find the minimal subarray that covers all non-y elements, but perhaps there's a way to cover them with a smaller subarray.

Wait, in this case, positions 1,2,3,4,7 are non-1 elements.

To cover positions 1,2,3,4,7, I need to cover from position 1 to 7, which is size 7.

But the sample output is 6, which suggests that there might be a better way.

Wait, perhaps I need to set positions 1 to 6 to 1, which costs 6, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all 1's, but I can't perform a second operation.

So, it's invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to set positions 2 to 7 to 1, which costs 6, and the array becomes [4,1,1,1,1,1,1], which is not all 1's, so I need to set position 1 to 1, but that's a second operation.

Wait, so it seems like setting any subarray of size 6 won't make the entire array equal to 1, because there will always be one element outside that subarray that's not 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to set positions 1 to 5 to 1, which costs 5, and the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,3], which is not all 1's, so I need to set position 7 to 1, which is a second operation.

Similarly, setting positions 3 to 7 to 1 costs 5, and the array becomes [4,3,1,1,1,1,1], which is not all 1's, so I need to set positions 1 and 2 to 1, which is a second operation.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is indeed 7, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, in the sample input, it's:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

Output:6

But according to my approach, it should be 7.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that setting a subarray to y, and the rest of the array is already y, but I can choose y to be a value that is not in the array.

Wait, but the problem states that x can be any integer, including those not in the array.

But the problem says "assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x", where x can be any integer.

So, I can choose x to be a value not in the array.

But in that case, the rest of the array is not equal to x, so I need to set the entire array to x, which costs n burles.

But that's the worst-case scenario.

I need to find a better way.

Wait, perhaps choosing x to be a value not in the array is suboptimal, because I'd have to set the entire array to x, which costs n.

So, it's better to choose x to be a value that is already in the array.

So, my approach should be to choose x as a value in the array, and find the minimal subarray to set to x such that the rest of the array is already x.

Which is what I did earlier.

But in the seventh sample input, my approach gives 7, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the minimal subarray for y=1.

Let me recalculate.

For y=1:

Non-1 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,7.

To cover positions 1,2,3,4,7, I need to set a subarray that includes positions 1 to 4 and position 7.

The minimal subarray that covers positions 1 to 4 and 7 is from position 1 to 7, which has size 7.

Alternatively, setting positions 1 to 5 and position 7, but that's not a single subarray.

So, it seems like the minimal subarray is from 1 to 7, which is size 7.

But the sample output is 6, which contradicts my approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose y=3.

For y=3:

Non-3 elements are at positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Minimal subarray covering positions 1 to 6 has size 6.

Set positions 1 to 6 to 3, array becomes [3,3,3,3,3,3,3], which is all equal to 3.

So, cost is 6, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, setting positions 1 to 6 to 3 makes the entire array equal to 3.

So, in this case, choosing y=3 with a minimal subarray of size 6 is better than choosing y=1 with a minimal subarray of size 7.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation for y=1, I thought the minimal subarray was 7, but actually, for y=3, it's 6.

So, my approach needs to be adjusted.

I need to choose y such that the minimal subarray to set to y covers all non-y elements, and among all possible y, choose the one with the smallest such subarray.

In this case, choosing y=3 gives a smaller subarray than y=1.

So, in general, for each y, find the minimal subarray that covers all non-y elements, and choose the y with the smallest such subarray.

This seems correct.

So, to implement this, for each y, find all positions where a[i] != y, and find the minimal subarray that covers all these positions.

The minimal subarray that covers all non-y elements is from the first non-y element to the last non-y element.

So, for each y, find the first and last occurrence of a[i] != y, and set the subarray from first to last to y.

The cost is last - first + 1.

If there are no non-y elements, the cost is 0.

So, for each y, compute the minimal subarray cost, and take the minimum over all y.

This should work.

In the first sample input:

y=1: first non-1 is position 2, last non-1 is position 5, cost=4.

y=2: first non-2 is position 1, last non-2 is position 6, cost=6.

y=3: first non-3 is position 1, last non-3 is position 6, cost=6.

y=4: first non-4 is position 1, last non-4 is position 6, cost=6.

y=5: first non-5 is position 1, last non-5 is position 6, cost=6.

Minimum cost is 4.

In the third sample input:

y=8: first non-8 is position 4, last non-8 is position 5, cost=2.

y=1: first non-1 is position 1, last non-1 is position 8, cost=8.

y=2: first non-2 is position 1, last non-2 is position 8, cost=8.

Minimum cost is 2.

In the seventh sample input:

y=1: first non-1 is position 1, last non-1 is position 7, cost=7.

y=2: first non-2 is position 1, last non-2 is position 7, cost=7.

y=3: first non-3 is position 1, last non-3 is position 6, cost=6.

y=4: first non-4 is position 2, last non-4 is position 7, cost=6.

y=7: first non-7 is position 1, last non-7 is position 6, cost=6.

Minimum cost is 6.

So, this approach matches the sample outputs.

Good.

Now, how do I implement this efficiently?

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution.

For each test case, I need to process the array efficiently.

For each possible y in the array, find the first and last occurrence of a[i] != y, and compute the cost as last - first + 1.

Then, take the minimum over all y.

To optimize, I can precompute the first and last occurrence of non-y elements for each y.

But iterating over all y in the array could be time-consuming if there are many unique y.

Wait, but since a[i] can be from 1 to n, and n can be up to 2e5, iterating over all possible y could be too slow.

I need a better way.

An optimization is to iterate over all unique values in the array, and compute the cost for each.

To get the unique values, I can use a set of the array elements.

But building a set for each test case might be time-consuming.

Wait, but since n is up to 2e5 and t is up to 1e4, but the total n over all test cases is up to 2e5, it should be manageable.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n and the array a.

b. Find all unique values in a.

c. For each unique value y:

i. Find the first position where a[i] != y.

ii. Find the last position where a[i] != y.

iii. If there are no non-y elements, cost = 0.

iv. Else, cost = last - first + 1.

d. Take the minimum cost over all y.

e. Output the minimum cost.

This should work.

To optimize, I can precompute the indices where each y occurs.

But that might not be necessary.

Let me think about how to implement this efficiently.

I can iterate through the array and collect the positions where a[i] == y for each y.

Then, for each y, the first non-y is the first position before the first y position, and the last non-y is the last position after the last y position.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to iterate through the array and find the first and last positions where a[i] != y.

For example, iterate through the array, keep track of the positions where a[i] != y, and find the first and last such positions.

Then, the minimal subarray to cover all non-y elements is from first to last.

The cost is last - first + 1.

If there are no non-y elements, cost is 0.

To implement this efficiently, for each y, I can find the first and last occurrence of a[i] != y.

But iterating over all unique y for each test case might be time-consuming if there are many unique y.

To optimize, I can observe that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal number of consecutive elements that need to be set to make the entire array equal.

This is equivalent to finding the minimal window that, when set to a certain value, makes the entire array equal to that value.

An alternative approach is to find the maximal subarray where all elements are equal, and then the minimal cost is n - max_length, where max_length is the length of the longest subarray with equal elements.

Wait, in the first sample input, max_length=1, n=6, n - max_length=5, but the sample output is 4, so that doesn't match.

In the third sample input, max_length=3, n=8, n - max_length=5, but the sample output is 2, so that doesn't match.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Back to the previous approach.

Implementing the approach of choosing y and finding the minimal subarray to cover non-y elements.

To optimize, I can iterate through the array and keep track of the first and last occurrence of each y.

Wait, actually, for each y, I can find the first and last position where a[i] != y.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through the array once for each y.

But that would be O(n * number of unique y), which is acceptable since the total n across all test cases is up to 2e5.

An optimization is to iterate through the array once and collect the positions for each y.

Then, for each y, find the first and last non-y positions.

Wait, perhaps I can do better.

Let me think about the entire array.

I can find the minimal number of elements that need to be set to make the entire array equal.

This is equivalent to n - max_frequency, where max_frequency is the maximum number of times any value appears in the array.

Wait, no, because setting the rest of the array to that value would cost n - max_frequency.

But in the first sample input, n=6, max_frequency=2 (for y=1), so n - max_frequency=4, which matches the sample output.

In the third sample input, n=8, max_frequency=6 (for y=
