Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation involves selecting three integers i, j, and x, where 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n, and then setting all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is basically the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I need to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that it can always be done, so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. By selecting i, j, and x, I'm choosing a subarray from i to j and setting all its elements to x, and this costs (j - i + 1) burles. I can do this operation at most once.

So, if I don't perform any operation, that means the array is already equal, and the cost is 0. If I need to perform the operation, I need to choose the subarray and the value x in such a way that after setting that subarray to x, the entire array becomes equal to x or to some other value.

Wait, actually, after performing the operation, the subarray from i to j is set to x, and the rest of the array remains as it is. Then, for the entire array to be equal, the parts outside of i to j must already be equal to x, or I need to set them in some way. But since I can perform the operation only once, I need to find a way to make the whole array equal with at most one operation.

Let me think differently. If I choose a value x that will be the final value for the entire array, then I need to set all elements that are not equal to x to x, but I can only do this in one operation by selecting a subarray and setting it to x.

So, I need to choose x such that the cost of setting all elements not equal to x to x is minimized, but I can only do this in one operation.

Wait, but I can only set a single subarray to x in one operation. So, I need to choose x and a subarray in such a way that after setting that subarray to x, the entire array becomes equal to x.

This means that outside of this subarray, the elements must already be equal to x.

So, I need to choose x such that the number of elements outside the subarray that are already equal to x is maximized, or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should look for the value x that appears the most in the array, and then find the minimal subarray that needs to be set to x to make the entire array equal to x.

But actually, if I choose x and set a subarray to x, the parts outside this subarray must already be equal to x.

So, I need to find x such that the parts outside the subarray are already equal to x.

In other words, I need to find x and a subarray such that all elements outside this subarray are already equal to x.

So, the minimal cost would be the length of the subarray from i to j that needs to be set to x, where x is chosen such that all elements outside this subarray are already equal to x.

If such a subarray exists, then the cost is (j - i + 1). If not, then I need to set the entire array to x, which would cost n.

But according to the problem, it's always possible, so I don't need to worry about impossible cases.

Wait, but in the sample input, there are cases where the cost is 0, meaning the array is already equal.

Let me look at the sample inputs and outputs to understand better.

Sample Input 1:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Sample Output: 4

Explanation: Maybe set indices 2 to 5 to 1, so the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], costing 4 burles.

Sample Input 2:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Sample Output: 0

Explanation: The array is already equal, so no operation needed.

Sample Input 3:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Sample Output: 2

Explanation: Set indices 4 and 5 to 8, costing 2 burles, making the array [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8].

Sample Input 4:

1

1

Sample Output: 0

Explanation: Only one element, already equal.

Sample Input 5:

2

1 2

Sample Output: 1

Explanation: Set either index 1 or 2 to the other's value, costing 1 burle.

Sample Input 6:

3

1 2 3

Sample Output: 2

Explanation: Set indices 1 and 2 to 3, costing 2, making [3,3,3], or set indices 2 and 3 to 1, costing 2, making [1,1,1].

Wait, in this case, setting indices 1 and 2 to 3 costs 2, or setting indices 2 and 3 to 1 costs 2.

So, the minimal cost is 2.

Another sample:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

Output: 6

Perhaps set indices 1 to 6 to 3, costing 6, making [3,3,3,3,3,3,3].

Last sample:

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Output: 7

Maybe set indices 3 to 9 to 9, costing 7, making [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9].

Okay, so from these examples, it seems that the strategy is to find the value that appears the most in the array, and then find the smallest subarray that, when set to this value, makes the entire array equal to this value.

Wait, but in the third sample, setting indices 4 and 5 to 8 makes the array all 8's, costing 2.

But 8 appears in positions 1,2,3,6,7,8.

So, outside the subarray from 4 to 5, all are 8's.

Hence, cost is 2.

Similarly, in the first sample, setting indices 2 to 5 to 1 makes the array all 1's, costing 4.

In the second sample, the array is already all 1's, so cost is 0.

In the fifth sample, setting either index 1 or 2 to the other's value costs 1.

In the sixth sample, setting indices 1 and 2 to 3 costs 2, making all 3's.

So, the strategy seems to be: find the value that appears the most in the array, and find the smallest subarray that needs to be set to this value to make the entire array equal to this value.

But how to find that subarray?

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to finding the minimal number of elements that are not equal to the most frequent value, and set them to that value in one operation.

But since I can only set a contiguous subarray in one operation, it's not exactly the same.

I need to find a subarray such that, by setting it to x, all elements outside this subarray are already equal to x.

So, x must be equal to the value that appears in the positions outside this subarray.

Hence, x must be equal to the value that appears in the prefix and suffix of the array.

Wait, maybe I should find the largest prefix and suffix that are already equal to some value x, and then set the middle part to x.

The cost would be the length of the middle part.

I need to minimize this cost, so I need to maximize the combined length of the prefix and suffix that are already equal to x.

So, the minimal cost is n minus the maximum combined length of prefix and suffix that are equal to the same value x.

Wait, that makes sense.

Let's formalize this.

For each possible x, find the longest prefix that is equal to x and the longest suffix that is equal to x, and then the cost would be n minus (length of prefix + length of suffix - overlap).

But since prefix and suffix might overlap if the array is equal to x throughout, I need to be careful.

Wait, no, in this problem, I can set a subarray to x, and the parts outside this subarray must already be equal to x.

So, for each x, find the maximal subarray such that all elements outside this subarray are equal to x.

Then, the cost is the length of this subarray.

Wait, but I need to minimize the cost, so I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x outside the subarray.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate through the array and find the minimal length of a subarray such that, by setting it to x, the entire array becomes equal to x.

But this seems inefficient for large n.

Let me think of a better way.

An optimal strategy is to choose a value x that appears the most in the array, and then find the smallest subarray that needs to be set to x to make the entire array equal to x.

To find this subarray, I can find the minimal number of elements that are not equal to x and find a contiguous subarray that covers all these elements.

Wait, but it's possible that not all elements not equal to x are contiguous.

In that case, I would need to set multiple subarrays to x, but I can only perform one operation.

Hence, I need to find a single subarray that covers all elements not equal to x.

But since I can only perform one operation, I need to cover all elements not equal to x with a single subarray.

Wait, but that might not always be possible.

Wait, no, according to the problem, it's always possible, so perhaps there's a way to choose x and a subarray such that setting that subarray to x makes the entire array equal to x.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I choose x, and there are elements not equal to x in the array.

I need to set a subarray to x such that all elements not equal to x are covered by this subarray.

So, I need to find the minimal subarray that covers all the positions where the array is not equal to x.

Then, the cost is the length of this subarray.

So, for each x, find the positions where a[i] != x, and find the minimal subarray that covers all these positions.

Then, the cost is the length of this subarray.

Then, among all possible x, choose the one that minimizes this cost.

But iterating over all possible x might be too slow, since x can be up to n, and n can be up to 2e5, and t can be up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5.

So, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think of a better approach.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal number of elements that need to be set to some value x, in a contiguous subarray, such that the entire array becomes equal to x.

This is equivalent to finding a subarray that covers all the elements that are not equal to x, for some x.

To minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x outside the subarray.

So, for each x, compute the maximal combined length of the prefix and suffix that are equal to x, and then the cost is n minus this combined length.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the prefix and suffix are contiguous and both equal to x.

Wait, perhaps for each x, find the longest prefix that is equal to x and the longest suffix that is equal to x, and then the cost is n minus (prefix_length + suffix_length - overlap), if they overlap.

But this seems a bit complicated.

Let me try to formalize it.

For each x, find the largest integer p such that a[1] = a[2] = ... = a[p] = x.

Similarly, find the largest integer q such that a[n - q + 1] = ... = a[n] = x.

Then, the combined length is p + q, but if p + q > n, there is an overlap, so the actual combined length is min(p + q, n).

Then, the cost is n - (p + q - overlap) = n - (p + q - min(p + q, n)).

Wait, this seems messy.

Actually, the minimal subarray to set to x is n - p - q, if p + q <= n, else 0.

Wait, let's see.

If p + q <= n, then the subarray from p+1 to n - q needs to be set to x, which has length n - p - q.

If p + q >= n, then the entire array is already equal to x, or the parts that are not equal to x are covered within the overlap, so the cost is 0.

Wait, that seems promising.

So, for each x, compute p and q as the length of the prefix and suffix equal to x.

Then, the minimal subarray to set is n - p - q, if p + q >= n, then cost is 0.

Otherwise, cost is n - p - q.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of (n - p - q), where p and q are the lengths of the prefix and suffix equal to x.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the prefix and suffix are both equal to x.

So, for each x, find the length of the longest prefix equal to x and the longest suffix equal to x.

Then, the cost is n - (p + q - overlap), but I think it's simpler to just compute n - p - q + overlap, where overlap is min(p + q - n, 0).

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider:

- If p + q <= n, then the minimal subarray to set is n - p - q.

- If p + q > n, then the entire array is already equal to x, so cost is 0.

Hence, for each x, compute p and q as the lengths of the prefix and suffix equal to x.

Then, the cost is max(n - p - q, 0).

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of max(n - p - q, 0).

This seems efficient, as for each test case, I can iterate through the array once to find p and q for each x.

But since x can be up to n, and n can be up to 2e5, and t can be up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, for each test case:

- Read n and the array a.

- For each possible x, compute p and q.

- p is the length of the longest prefix equal to x.

- q is the length of the longest suffix equal to x.

- Then, compute cost = n - p - q if p + q >= n, else cost = n - p - q.

- But according to the previous conclusion, cost = max(n - p - q, 0).

- Then, take the minimum cost over all x.

Wait, but x can be any integer between 1 and n, inclusive, as per the input constraints.

So, I need to iterate over all possible x in [1, n] and compute p and q for each x.

But this would be O(n^2) in total, since t can be up to 1e4 and n up to 2e5, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, so it's acceptable.

But I need to optimize it further.

Wait, perhaps I can optimize by observing that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal number of elements that need to be set to some x to make the entire array equal to x, with the constraint that they must be set in a single subarray.

But I need to ensure that the elements being set form a contiguous subarray.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal length of a subarray such that, by setting this subarray to some x, the entire array becomes equal to x.

This subarray must cover all elements that are not equal to x.

So, for each x, find all positions where a[i] != x, and find the minimal subarray that covers all these positions.

If there are no such positions, then cost is 0.

If the positions are not contiguous, but I need to cover them with a single subarray, then I need to cover from the first position where a[i] != x to the last position where a[i] != x.

Hence, the minimal subarray that covers all positions where a[i] != x is from the first non-x element to the last non-x element.

So, for each x, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x, and set the subarray from first to last to x.

If there are no such positions, then cost is 0.

Hence, the cost is last - first + 1, if first <= last, else 0.

So, for each x, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

Then, the cost is last - first + 1 if first <= last, else 0.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of (last - first + 1) if first <= last, else 0.

This seems more efficient, as I can precompute for each x, the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

But iterating over all x in [1, n] for each test case would be too slow, since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, so it's acceptable.

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal subarray that, when set to some x, makes the entire array equal to x.

To minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x outside this subarray.

So, the optimal x is the one that appears the most in the array, and the subarray to set is the minimal subarray that covers all elements not equal to x.

Hence, the minimal cost is the number of elements not equal to x, provided that these elements form a contiguous subarray.

But if they don't form a contiguous subarray, then I cannot set them in one operation.

But according to the problem, it's always possible, so I assume that there exists an x such that all elements not equal to x form a contiguous subarray.

Wait, but I need to confirm this.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I choose x such that all elements not equal to x form a contiguous subarray.

Then, by setting this subarray to x, the entire array becomes equal to x.

Hence, the cost is the length of this subarray.

To minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the number of elements not equal to x is minimized, and they form a contiguous subarray.

So, the minimal cost is the minimal number of elements that need to be set to x, in a contiguous subarray, such that the entire array becomes equal to x.

Hence, for each x, find the minimal subarray that covers all positions where a[i] != x.

As discussed earlier, this subarray is from the first position where a[i] != x to the last position where a[i] != x.

Hence, for each x, compute first != x and last != x, then cost = last - first + 1.

If there are no positions where a[i] != x, then cost = 0.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of these costs.

To implement this efficiently, I can iterate over all x in [1, n], and for each x, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x, and compute the cost.

But since n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

Alternatively, I can optimize it further by observing that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal number of consecutive elements that need to be set to make the entire array equal.

This can be found by finding the maximal length of a subarray where all elements are equal, and then the minimal cost is n minus this maximal length.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me see.

If there is a subarray where all elements are equal to some x, and this subarray is of length m, then by setting the remaining n - m elements to x, the entire array becomes equal to x, with a cost of n - m.

But this doesn't take into account that the remaining elements must form a contiguous subarray.

Hence, this approach is not correct.

Wait, no, it does take into account, because if I set the subarray of length n - m to x, then the entire array becomes x.

But in this case, the subarray being set is the part outside the maximal equal subarray.

Hence, the cost is n - m, where m is the maximal length of a subarray with all elements equal.

But according to the earlier approach, for each x, the cost is n - (p + q), where p and q are the lengths of the prefix and suffix equal to x.

So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps they are equivalent.

Let me see.

Suppose I have an array like [1,1,2,1,1].

Then, for x=1:

p=2 (prefix [1,1])

q=2 (suffix [1,1])

n=5

cost = 5 - 2 - 2 = 1

Which would correspond to setting the subarray [2] (from position 3) to 1, costing 1.

But in reality, to make the entire array equal to 1, I can set position 3 to 1, costing 1, which matches.

Another example: [1,2,2,2,1]

For x=2:

p=0 (no prefix of 2's)

q=0 (no suffix of 2's)

cost = 5 - 0 - 0 = 5

But actually, the minimal subarray to set to 2 is from position 1 to 5, costing 5.

But if I choose x=1:

p=1

q=1

cost = 5 - 1 -1 = 3

Which corresponds to setting positions 2 to 5 to 1, costing 4, but according to the formula, it's 3.

Wait, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding.

Let me recast this approach.

Actually, for each x, the cost should be n - (p + q - overlap), where p and q are the lengths of the prefix and suffix equal to x.

But I need to make sure that the prefix and suffix do not overlap.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to find the largest m such that the first m elements and the last m elements are equal to x.

Then, the cost is n - 2*m.

But this is not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I should find the largest m where the first i and the last j elements equal to x, with i + j - overlap <= m.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look back at the initial approach.

Initial approach was to find, for each x, the first and last positions where a[i] != x, and set the subarray from first to last to x.

Hence, cost = last - first + 1.

Then, minimal cost is the minimum over all x of (last - first + 1), or 0 if there are no positions where a[i] != x.

This seems correct based on the sample inputs.

For example, in the first sample:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Choose x=1:

first !=1 is position 2, last !=1 is position 5.

cost = 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.

Which matches the sample output.

In the second sample:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Choose x=1:

no positions where a[i]!=1, so cost=0.

Third sample:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Choose x=8:

first !=8 is position 4, last !=8 is position 5.

cost=5-4+1=2.

Which matches the sample output.

Fourth sample:

1

1

Choose x=1:

no positions where a[i]!=1, cost=0.

Fifth sample:

2

1 2

Choose x=1:

first !=1 is position 2, last !=1 is position 2, cost=1.

Choose x=2:

first !=2 is position 1, last !=2 is position 1, cost=1.

Minimal cost is 1.

Sixth sample:

3

1 2 3

Choose x=1:

first !=1 is position 2, last !=1 is position 3, cost=2.

Choose x=2:

first !=2 is position 1, last !=2 is position 3, cost=3.

Choose x=3:

first !=3 is position 1, last !=3 is position 2, cost=2.

Minimal cost is 2.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

So, to implement this, for each test case, I need to iterate over all possible x in [1, n], find first and last positions where a[i] != x, and compute cost = last - first + 1 if first <= last, else 0.

Then, take the minimal cost over all x.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but total n across all test cases is up to 2e5, this should be efficient enough.

However, to optimize it further, I can observe that I don't need to iterate over all x in [1, n], but only over the unique values in the array, because choosing an x that doesn't appear in the array would mean that the entire array needs to be set to x, which would cost n.

But according to the problem, x can be any integer, not necessarily present in the array.

But in the earlier samples, x was chosen as values present in the array.

Wait, but in the operation, x can be any integer, not necessarily present in the array.

So, I need to consider all possible x in [1, n], as per the problem's input constraints.

Wait, the problem says "x (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n ) and assign all elements of the array with indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles."

It says x is any integer, but in the input constraints, "1 ≤ a_i ≤ n", but x can be any integer, not necessarily in the array.

But in the sample inputs, x was chosen from the existing values in the array.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's mentioned that x can be any integer, not necessarily in the array.

Hence, x can be any integer, not necessarily present in the array.

But in terms of implementation, x can be any integer, but since a_i ≤ n, and x can be any integer, but to avoid issues, perhaps x can be considered in [1, n], assuming that x must be in [1, n], as a_i is in [1, n].

But the problem allows x to be any integer, but to simplify, perhaps x is in [1, n].

Given that a_i is in [1, n], and x can be any integer, but to make it efficient, perhaps x is in [1, n].

Wait, in the problem statement, it's given that "1 ≤ a_i ≤ n", but x can be any integer.

But probably, x can be assumed to be in [1, n], as a_i is in [1, n], and the problem is about making all elements equal to some x, which could be a value not in the array.

But to simplify, perhaps x is in [1, n].

Alternatively, x can be any integer, including those not in the array.

But to make it efficient, perhaps x is in [1, n].

Wait, in the sample inputs, x was chosen from the existing values or possibly new values.

But to make it efficient, I'll assume x is in [1, n].

Hence, for each test case, I'll iterate over x from 1 to n, find first and last positions where a[i] != x, and compute the cost as last - first + 1 if first <= last, else 0.

Then, take the minimal cost over x from 1 to n.

This should work efficiently, given the constraints.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

t = int(input())

while t:

n = int(input())

arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

print(func_1(arr))

t -= 1

def func_1(arr):

i = 0

j = len(arr) - 1

while i <= j:

if arr[i] == arr[j]:

i += 1

j -= 1

else:

break

if i > j:

return 0

while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:

i += 1

if j != len(arr) - 1:

return j - i + 1

return j - i

So, the function func_1 is supposed to compute the minimal cost.

Let's see what it's doing.

It initializes i=0 and j=n-1.

Then, it has a while loop that runs as long as i <= j.

Inside the loop, it checks if arr[i] == arr[j].

If they are equal, it increments i and decrements j.

If they are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.

After the loop, if i > j, it returns 0, meaning the array is already equal.

Otherwise, it has another while loop that runs as long as arr[i] == arr[i+1], incrementing i each time.

Then, it checks if j != n-1, and if so, returns j - i + 1.

Otherwise, it returns j - i.

Wait, this seems different from the approach I was considering earlier.

This seems like an attempt to find the minimal subarray to set so that the array becomes a palindrome, but the problem is to make all elements equal, not necessarily a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Let me step through an example.

Take the first sample input:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

So, arr = [1,2,3,4,5,1]

Initialize i=0, j=5

Check arr[0]==arr[5]: 1==1, so i=1, j=4

Check arr[1]==arr[4]: 2==5, not equal, break

Now, i=1, j=4

Enter the second while loop: arr[1]==arr[2]? 2==3? No, so don't increment i.

Then, check if j != n-1: j=4 != 5, so return j - i +1 = 4 -1 +1 =4

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Initialize i=0, j=6

Check arr[0]==arr[6]:1==1, i=1,j=5

Check arr[1]==arr[5]:1==1, i=2,j=4

Check arr[2]==arr[4]:1==1, i=3,j=3

Check arr[3]==arr[3]:1==1, i=4,j=2

Now, i=4 > j=2, so return 0

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

Initialize i=0, j=7

Check arr[0]==arr[7]:8==8, i=1,j=6

Check arr[1]==arr[6]:8==8, i=2,j=5

Check arr[2]==arr[5]:8==8, i=3,j=4

Check arr[3]==arr[4]:1==2, not equal, break

Now, i=3, j=4

Enter second while loop: arr[3]==arr[4]?1==2? No, so don't increment i.

Check if j != n-1: j=4 !=7, so return j - i +1=4-3+1=2

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

1

1

Initialize i=0,j=0

Check arr[0]==arr[0]:1==1, i=1,j=-1

i=1 > j=-1, return 0

Correct.

Another sample:

2

1 2

Initialize i=0,j=1

Check arr[0]==arr[1]:1==2? No, break

Now, i=0, j=1

Enter second while loop: arr[0]==arr[1]?1==2? No, don't increment i.

j != n-1:1 !=1, False, so return j - i =1 -0=1

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

3

1 2 3

Initialize i=0,j=2

Check arr[0]==arr[2]:1==3? No, break

Enter second while loop: arr[0]==arr[1]?1==2? No, don't increment i.

j != n-1:2 !=2, False, return j - i =2 -0=2

Which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

7

4 3 2 7 1 1 3

Initialize i=0,j=6

Check arr[0]==arr[6]:4==3? No, break

Enter second while loop: arr[0]==arr[1]?4==3? No, don't increment i.

j != n-1:6 !=6, False, return j -i=6-0=6

Which matches the sample output.

Last sample:

9

9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3

Initialize i=0,j=8

Check arr[0]==arr[8]:9==3? No, break

Enter second while loop: arr[0]==arr[1]?9==9? Yes, increment i to 1

Check arr[1]==arr[2]?9==2? No, stop incrementing i.

j != n-1:8 !=8, False, return j -i=8-1=7

Which matches the sample output.

So, in all the sample inputs, this function seems to produce the correct output.

Now, let's see if this function implements the logic I described earlier.

In my earlier approach, for each x from 1 to n, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x, and set the subarray from first to last to x, with cost last - first +1, or 0 if no such positions.

Then, take the minimal over all x.

But in this function, it doesn't iterate over x at all.

It seems to be doing something different.

So, how does this function work?

Looking back, it seems to be finding the minimal subarray to set so that the array becomes a palindrome.

But the problem is to make all elements equal, not necessarily a palindrome.

However, in the samples, it seems to work correctly.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to look at it.

Let's see what the function is doing.

It starts with i=0 and j=n-1.

It compares arr[i] and arr[j].

If they are equal, it moves i forward and j backward.

If they are not equal, it breaks.

At the end, if i > j, meaning the entire array is a palindrome, it returns 0.

Otherwise, it finds the first position i where arr[i] != arr[j], and then finds the extent of the mismatch by moving i forward as long as arr[i] == arr[i+1].

Then, if j != n-1, it returns j - i +1, else returns j - i.

Wait, this seems like an attempt to find the minimal subarray to set so that the array becomes a palindrome.

But the problem is to make all elements equal, which is different.

However, in the samples, it seems to work correctly.

Perhaps there's a connection between making the array a palindrome and making all elements equal.

Wait, maybe not directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose x to be the value at arr[0].

Then, I need to set the subarray from the first position where a[i] != x to the last position where a[i] != x to x.

In the first sample:

x=1

first !=1 is position 2 (a[1]=2), last !=1 is position 5 (a[4]=5)

cost=5-2+1=4

Which matches the function's output.

In the second sample:

x=1

no positions where a[i]!=1, cost=0

In the third sample:

x=8

first !=8 is position 4 (a[3]=1), last !=8 is position 5 (a[4]=2)

cost=5-4+1=2

Which matches.

In the fourth sample:

x=1

no positions where a[i]!=1, cost=0

In the fifth sample:

x=1

first !=1 is position 2 (a[1]=2), last !=1 is position2, cost=1

x=2

first !=2 is position1 (a[0]=1), last !=2 is position1, cost=1

Minimal cost is1

In the sixth sample:

x=1

first !=1 is position2 (a[1]=2), last !=1 is position3 (a[2]=3), cost=2

x=2

first !=2 is position1 (a[0]=1), last !=2 is position3 (a[2]=3), cost=3

x=3

first !=3 is position1 (a[0]=1), last !=3 is position2 (a[1]=2), cost=2

Minimal cost is2

So, in all these cases, the function seems to correctly compute the minimal cost.

But how does it do that without iterating over x?

Let's see.

In the function, it seems to find the minimal subarray that needs to be set to make the array a palindrome, but it's working for making all elements equal.

Wait, perhaps it's because in the operation, we can set a subarray to a value x, and to make the array equal, we can choose x to be the value at arr[0], and set the subarray from the first position where a[i]!=arr[0] to the last position where a[i]!=arr[0] to arr[0].

Hence, the cost is last - first +1, which is what the function seems to be computing.

In the function, it finds the range [i,j] where the array is not a palindrome, and then sets the
