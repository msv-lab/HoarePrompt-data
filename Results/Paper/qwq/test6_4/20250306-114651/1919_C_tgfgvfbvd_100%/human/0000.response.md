Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array has to be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called penalty. The penalty for a sequence b is the number of indices where b_i < b_{i+1}. So, basically, for each subsequence, I count how many times a number is followed by a larger number. The total penalty is the sum of penalties from both s and t. I need to find the minimum possible total penalty by splitting the array optimally.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the original array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, s and t are both subsequences of the original array a, and together they include all elements of a.

The goal is to split the array into s and t in such a way that the sum of their penalties is minimized.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

5

1 2 3 4 5

One possible split is s = [2,4,5] and t = [1,3]. The penalty for s is 2 because 2 < 4 and 4 < 5. The penalty for t is 1 because 1 < 3. So, total penalty is 3.

But is this the minimal possible? Maybe there's a better split that results in a lower total penalty.

Another split could be s = [1,3,5] and t = [2,4]. For s, 1 < 3 and 3 < 5, so penalty is 2. For t, 2 < 4, so penalty is 1. Total penalty is 3 again.

Or s = [1,2,3,4] and t = [5]. For s, 1 < 2 < 3 < 4, so penalty is 3. For t, no elements except 5, so penalty is 0. Total penalty is 3.

Wait, another split: s = [1,3,5] and t = [2,4]. Same as above.

Hmm, seems like 3 is the best I can do for this example.

But according to the first test case, the output is 3, so that seems correct.

Second test case:

8

8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3

A possible split is s = [8,3,1] and t = [2,1,7,4,3]. Penalty for s is 0 because 8 > 3 > 1, so no increasing pairs. For t, 2 < 1 is not true, 1 < 7 is true, 7 < 4 is not, 4 < 3 is not, so only one increasing pair: 1 < 7. So total penalty is 1.

Is there a better split? Let's try another split: s = [8,2,1,1] and t = [3,7,4,3]. For s, 8 > 2 > 1 > 1, no increasing pairs, penalty 0. For t, 3 < 7 > 4 < 3, so only one increasing pair: 3 < 7. Total penalty is 1 again.

Another split: s = [8,1,1,3] and t = [2,3,7,4]. For s, 8 > 1 > 1 > 3 is not true because 1 < 3, so penalty is 1 for s. For t, 2 < 3 < 7 > 4, so one increasing pair: 2 < 3. Total penalty is 2, which is worse than 1.

So, the minimal penalty seems to be 1 for this test case.

Third test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

All elements are equal. So, no matter how I split, there will be no increasing pairs in any subsequence because all elements are equal. So, penalty should be 0 for both s and t, total penalty 0.

Fourth test case:

1

1

Only one element, so whichever subsequence it goes to, there are no increasing pairs, so penalty is 0.

Fifth test case:

2

2 1

Possible splits:

- s = [2], t = [1]: penalty for s is 0, for t is 0, total 0.

- s = [2,1], t = []: penalty for s is 0 because 2 > 1, no increasing pair.

So, minimal penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal penalty is related to how we can arrange the elements in two subsequences to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

I need to find a general approach for any given array.

Let me think about what causes a penalty. A penalty is incurred whenever there is an increasing pair in a subsequence. To minimize the total penalty, I need to minimize the number of such increasing pairs across both subsequences.

One way to minimize increasing pairs is to maximize the number of decreasing subsequences because in a decreasing subsequence, there are no increasing pairs.

So, perhaps I should try to split the array into two decreasing subsequences.

Wait, but that might not always be possible, especially if there are elements that are greater than previous ones.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,3,5] is increasing, so if I put it in one subsequence, its penalty would be 2, and [2,4] would have penalty 1, total 3.

But if I try to make both subsequences decreasing, for example, s = [1,4], t = [2,5,3], then s is 1 < 4, which is increasing, so penalty is 1. t is 2 < 5 > 3, so one increasing pair: 2 < 5. Total penalty is 2.

Wait, that's better than 3, but according to the first test case, the minimal penalty is 3. Wait, no, the output says 3, but maybe there's a mistake in the problem or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read the problem again.

"Define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1}."

So, p(b) counts the number of increasing pairs in b.

Then, the total penalty is p(s) + p(t), and I need to minimize this by optimally splitting a into s and t.

In the first test case, s = [2,4,5], t = [1,3]. p(s) = 2 (2<4,4<5), p(t) = 1 (1<3), total 3.

Another split: s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]. p(s) = 2 (1<3,3<5), p(t) = 1 (2<4), total 3.

Another split: s = [1,4], t = [2,5,3]. p(s) = 1 (1<4), p(t) = 1 (2<5), total 2.

Wait, but according to the output, it's 3, but this split gives 2, which is better.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the constraints for splitting.

It says that s and t are subsequences, and every element of a is in either s or t.

In the first test case, s = [1,4], t = [2,5,3]. Is this a valid split? 1 and 4 are in s, and 2,5,3 are in t. But the original array is [1,2,3,4,5]. So, s = [1,4], which are positions 1 and 4. t = [2,5,3], which are positions 2,5,3. Wait, but 3 is before 5 in the original array, so t = [2,3,5], which maintains the order.

Wait, but in t, it's [2,3,5], which is position 2,3,5. So, it's a valid subsequence.

Similarly, s = [1,4], positions 1 and 4.

So, this seems valid.

But according to the first test case, the output is 3, but this split gives a total penalty of 2, which is better.

Is there a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding?

Wait, maybe I miscounted the penalties.

For s = [1,4], p(s) = 1 because 1 < 4.

For t = [2,3,5], p(t) = 2 because 2 < 3 and 3 < 5.

Total penalty is 3, matching the output.

So, my earlier miscalculation was wrong.

Another split: s = [2,4,5], t = [1,3]. p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1, total 3.

Another split: s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]. p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1, total 3.

Seems like 3 is the minimal penalty.

Wait, but is there a way to get a lower penalty?

Let's try s = [1,2,3], t = [4,5]. For s, 1 < 2 < 3, p(s) = 2. For t, 4 < 5, p(t) = 1. Total penalty 3.

Another split: s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]. Same as above.

Seems like 3 is the minimal penalty.

Wait, perhaps the minimal penalty is indeed 3 for this test case.

Moving on to the second test case:

8

8 2 3 1 1 7 4 3

A possible split is s = [8,3,1], t = [2,1,7,4,3]. p(s) = 0 (8 > 3 > 1), p(t) = 1 (1 < 7). Total penalty 1.

Another split: s = [8,2,1,1], t = [3,7,4,3]. p(s) = 0 (8 > 2 > 1 > 1), p(t) = 1 (3 < 7). Total penalty 1.

Another split: s = [8,1,1,3], t = [2,3,7,4]. p(s) = 1 (1 < 3), p(t) = 1 (2 < 3). Total penalty 2.

So, the minimal penalty is 1.

In the third test case:

5

3 3 3 3 3

All elements are equal, so no increasing pairs in any subsequence. So, penalty is 0.

Fourth test case:

1

1

Only one element, so penalty is 0.

Fifth test case:

2

2 1

Possible splits:

- s = [2], t = [1]: p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0, total 0.

- s = [2,1], t = []: p(s) = 0 (2 > 1), total 0.

So, minimal penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that to minimize the total penalty, I need to maximize the number of decreasing runs in the two subsequences combined.

I need a way to split the array into two subsequences such that the total number of increasing pairs is minimized.

This sounds similar to covering the array with two decreasing subsequences, minimizing the number of increasing pairs.

I recall that in sequences, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the sequence is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But here, we have two subsequences, so perhaps it's related to the longest increasing subsequence.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I have the minimal number of decreasing subsequences that cover the array. If I can cover the array with two decreasing subsequences, then the total penalty would be the number of increasing pairs in these two subsequences combined.

Wait, but in a decreasing subsequence, there are no increasing pairs, so p(b) = 0 for each decreasing subsequence.

But in reality, if I split the array into two decreasing subsequences, then p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0, which is the minimal possible penalty.

But in the first test case, that's not achievable because any split into two decreasing subsequences doesn't cover the entire array.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5], to split into two decreasing subsequences, for example, s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4]. But s is not decreasing; 1 < 3 < 5 is increasing. So, s is not decreasing.

Wait, perhaps it's not possible to cover the array with two decreasing subsequences in some cases.

Wait, in the first test case, [1,2,3,4,5], the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array is 5, because the longest increasing subsequence is of length 5.

But since we are allowed only two subsequences, it's impossible to cover it with two decreasing subsequences.

Hence, there will be some increasing pairs in the subsequences.

So, perhaps the minimal total penalty is related to the minimal number of increasing pairs when splitting into two subsequences, at least one of which may not be entirely decreasing.

I need to find a way to minimize p(s) + p(t).

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the following approach:

- I can model this problem as a dynamic programming problem.

- I can iterate through the array and decide for each element which subsequence to assign it to: s or t.

- When assigning an element to a subsequence, I need to maintain the order, as subsequences must preserve the original order.

- To minimize p(s) + p(t), I need to keep track of the number of increasing pairs in s and t as I assign elements to them.

- Perhaps I can keep track of the minimal element in s and the minimal element in t.

- Wait, but p(s) counts the number of times an element is followed by a larger one in s.

- This seems tricky.

Let me think about another way.

I recall that in a single sequence, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

Similarly, perhaps there's a way to relate this to two subsequences.

If I can cover the array with two decreasing subsequences, then p(s) + p(t) = 0.

But if not, then I need to distribute the increasing pairs between s and t in a way that minimizes their sum.

Wait, perhaps the minimal total penalty is equal to the minimal number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided when splitting into two decreasing subsequences.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

I can iterate through the array and try to assign each element to one of the two subsequences, s or t, in a way that minimizes the total penalty.

To do this, I can keep track of the minimal element in s and the minimal element in t.

Wait, perhaps I need to track the maximal element in s and t, because for a subsequence to be decreasing, each new element should be less than or equal to the previous one.

Wait, actually, for a subsequence to be decreasing, each new element should be less than or equal to the previous one.

But in reality, in the penalty calculation, p(b), it counts the number of times an element is followed by a larger one, not necessarily that the subsequence is decreasing.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concepts.

Let me rephrase.

I need to assign each element to s or t, and for each subsequence, count the number of times an element is followed by a larger one, and sum these counts for s and t.

I need to minimize this sum.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of increasing pairs in s and t combined.

I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs across both s and t.

I need to distribute the elements into s and t in a way that minimizes the total number of increasing pairs.

This seems similar to partitioning the array into two subsequences where the sum of the number of increasing pairs in each subsequence is minimized.

I recall that in graph theory, the number of increasing pairs can be seen as the number of edges in a graph where each pair (i,j) with i < j and a_i < a_j is an edge.

Then, partitioning into two subsequences with minimal total increasing pairs is like partitioning the graph into two chains with minimal total number of increasing edges.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think of a simpler approach.

Suppose I iterate through the array and maintain two sequences, s and t.

For each element, I decide whether to append it to s or t.

When deciding, I need to consider how this affects the penalty.

If I append the element to s, I need to check if it forms an increasing pair with the previous element in s.

Similarly for t.

To minimize the total penalty, perhaps I should try to append the element to the subsequence where it forms fewer increasing pairs, or preferably doesn't form any.

Wait, perhaps I can track the maximum element in s and t.

If the current element is less than or equal to the maximum in s, I can append it to s without increasing the penalty for s.

Similarly for t.

If it's greater than the maximum in s, then appending it to s would increase the penalty for s by one.

Similarly for t.

So, for each element, I have two choices: append to s or append to t.

If I append to s:

- If a[x] <= max_s, then p(s) remains the same.

- Else, p(s) increases by 1.

Similarly for t.

I need to choose the option that results in the minimal increase in the total penalty.

So, I can keep track of the maximum in s and t, and decide for each element which subsequence to append it to, based on which choice increases the total penalty the least.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach.

Let me formalize this.

Let's define dp[x][s][t], where x is the current index, s is the maximum in s, and t is the maximum in t.

But since n can be up to 2e5, this approach is too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Initialize max_s and max_t to infinity.

Iterate through the array.

For each element a[x]:

- If a[x] <= max_s, assign it to s and set max_s = a[x].

- Else if a[x] <= max_t, assign it to t and set max_t = a[x].

- Else, assign it to s, set max_s = a[x], and increment the penalty by 1.

This seems similar to the logic in the provided code.

Looking at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

(a, b) = (float('inf'), float('inf'))

c = 0

for x in range(n):

if a > b:

(a, b) = (b, a)

if l[x] <= a:

a = l[x]

elif l[x] <= b:

b = l[x]

else:

a = l[x]

c += 1

print(c)

So, it maintains two variables, a and b, initialized to infinity.

It iterates through the array and for each element:

- If a > b, swap a and b. This ensures that a is the smaller of the two.

- If l[x] <= a, set a = l[x].

- Else if l[x] <= b, set b = l[x].

- Else, set a = l[x] and increment c by 1.

Finally, it prints c.

So, c seems to count the number of times an element is larger than both a and b.

Wait, but in the beginning, a and b are both infinity, so the first element will be assigned to a, setting a = l[0].

The second element:

- If l[1] <= a, set a = l[1].

- Else if l[1] <= b, set b = l[1].

- Else, set a = l[1] and c += 1.

And so on.

This seems to be trying to assign elements to s or t, where s corresponds to a and t corresponds to b.

But I need to verify if this logic correctly minimizes the total penalty.

Let me test this logic with the first test case:

n = 5

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize a = inf, b = inf

c = 0

x=0: l[0]=1

a > b: swap a and b, so a=inf, b=inf

1 <= inf, set a=1

x=1: l[1]=2

a=1, b=inf

a > b: no swap

2 <= a=1? No

2 <= b=inf, set b=2

x=2: l[2]=3

a=1, b=2

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=1? No

3 <= b=2? No

Else, set a=3, c=1

x=3: l[3]=4

a=3, b=2

a > b: swap a and b, a=2, b=3

4 <= a=2? No

4 <= b=3? No

Else, set a=4, c=2

x=4: l[4]=5

a=4, b=3

a > b: swap a and b, a=3, b=4

5 <= a=3? No

5 <= b=4? No

Else, set a=5, c=3

Total c=3, which matches the first test case.

Seems correct for this case.

Second test case:

n=8

a=[8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize a=inf, b=inf

c=0

x=0: l[0]=8

a > b: swap a and b, a=inf, b=inf

8 <= a=inf, set a=8

x=1: l[1]=2

a=8, b=inf

a > b: no swap

2 <= a=8, set a=2

x=2: l[2]=3

a=2, b=inf

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=2? No

3 <= b=inf, set b=3

x=3: l[3]=1

a=2, b=3

a > b: no swap

1 <= a=2? Yes, set a=1

x=4: l[4]=1

a=1, b=3

a > b: no swap

1 <= a=1? Yes, set a=1

x=5: l[5]=7

a=1, b=3

a > b: no swap

7 <= a=1? No

7 <= b=3? No

Else, set a=7, c=1

x=6: l[6]=4

a=7, b=3

a > b: swap a and b, a=3, b=7

4 <= a=3? No

4 <= b=7? Yes, set b=4

x=7: l[7]=3

a=3, b=4

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=3? Yes, set a=3

Total c=1, matches the second test case.

Third test case:

n=5

a=[3,3,3,3,3]

Initialize a=inf, b=inf

c=0

x=0: l[0]=3

a > b: swap a and b, a=inf, b=inf

3 <= a=inf, set a=3

x=1: l[1]=3

a=3, b=inf

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=3? Yes, set a=3

x=2: l[2]=3

a=3, b=inf

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=3? Yes, set a=3

x=3: l[3]=3

a=3, b=inf

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=3? Yes, set a=3

x=4: l[4]=3

a=3, b=inf

a > b: no swap

3 <= a=3? Yes, set a=3

Total c=0, matches the third test case.

Fourth test case:

n=1

a=[1]

Initialize a=inf, b=inf

c=0

x=0: l[0]=1

a > b: swap a and b, a=inf, b=inf

1 <= a=inf, set a=1

Total c=0, matches the fourth test case.

Fifth test case:

n=2

a=[2,1]

Initialize a=inf, b=inf

c=0

x=0: l[0]=2

a > b: swap a and b, a=inf, b=inf

2 <= a=inf, set a=2

x=1: l[1]=1

a=2, b=inf

a > b: no swap

1 <= a=2? Yes, set a=1

Total c=0, matches the fifth test case.

So, in all the provided test cases, this code produces the correct output.

Now, I need to understand why this logic works.

Let's try to interpret what a and b represent.

a and b seem to represent the smallest possible ending elements of the two subsequences s and t.

By maintaining a and b as the smallest possible ending elements, the code tries to minimize the number of times it has to start a new increasing sequence, which would increment c.

Wait, but c is incremented when an element is larger than both a and b, meaning it can't be appended to either subsequence without creating an increasing pair.

So, in such a case, we have to "reset" one of the subsequences by setting a to this new element, and increment c by 1, indicating that we had to create a new increasing pair.

Wait, but in the code, when l[x] <= a, we set a = l[x], meaning we're assigning this element to the subsequence corresponding to a without creating a new increasing pair.

If l[x] <= b, we assign it to the subsequence corresponding to b without creating a new increasing pair.

If l[x] > both a and b, we have to assign it to a, setting a = l[x], but since l[x] > a, this creates a new increasing pair, hence c += 1.

So, c counts the number of times we have to create a new increasing pair by assigning an element to a, when it's larger than both a and b.

This seems to align with the penalty definition.

Moreover, by always assigning the element to the subsequence with the smallest maximum (after swapping if a > b), we ensure that we're trying to minimize the number of times we have to create new increasing pairs.

This seems like a correct greedy approach to minimize the total penalty.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See explanation for the code and reasoning.}} \]
