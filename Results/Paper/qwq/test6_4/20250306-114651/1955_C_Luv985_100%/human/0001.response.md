Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n ships, each with some durability a_i, and the Kraken attacks them k times. The attacks alternate between the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time. If a ship's durability drops to 0, it sinks and is removed from the line, affecting who the first and last ships are for subsequent attacks.

My task is to figure out how many ships are sunk after k attacks.

First, I need to understand the process clearly. The Kraken starts by attacking the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the target ship by 1. If a ship's durability reaches 0, it sinks and is removed from the lineup. This means that the first and last ships can change after each sinking.

Given that, I need an efficient way to simulate this process, especially since n can be up to 2*10^5 and k can be up to 10^15, which suggests that a naive simulation where I simulate each attack one by one would be too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the pattern of attacks. The attacks alternate between the first and last ships. So, in the first attack, the first ship is attacked, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

If no ships sink, the sequence would just keep alternating between the first and last ships, each losing durability by 1 each time they are attacked.

But ships can sink, which changes the lineup.

This seems tricky to simulate directly for large k.

Maybe I can find a way to calculate how many attacks are needed until a ship sinks, and then update the lineup accordingly.

Wait, but with k up to 10^15, that approach would be inefficient.

Let me consider another angle. Suppose I group the attacks in pairs: one attack on the first ship and one on the last ship. Each pair of attacks reduces the durability of both the first and last ships by 1, unless one of them has already sunk.

If I can calculate how many such pairs can be performed before any ship sinks, and then handle the sinking ships accordingly, that might be efficient.

But I need to handle the cases where ships sink carefully, because sinking a ship changes the lineup.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the minimum durability between the current first and last ships, and see how many pairs of attacks can be performed before one of them sinks.

Let's formalize that.

At each step, I have a range from left to right, where left starts at 0 and right starts at n-1.

I can find the minimum durability between a[left] and a[right]. Let's say min_val = min(a[left], a[right]).

If I perform min_val pairs of attacks (i.e., 2*min_val attacks), both a[left] and a[right] will be reduced by min_val.

If min_val * 2 <= k, then I can perform that many pairs of attacks, and both a[left] and a[right] will be reduced by min_val.

After that, if a[left] becomes 0, I increment left and count that ship as sunk. Similarly, if a[right] becomes 0, I decrement right and count that ship as sunk.

I can repeat this process until k is less than min_val * 2, meaning I can't perform a full pair of attacks without one of the ships sinking.

At that point, with the remaining k attacks, I need to see which ships are attacked and whether they sink.

Since attacks alternate between the first and last ships, I can determine how many attacks are performed on each by looking at k and seeing how many times the first and last ships are attacked.

For example, if k is odd, the last attack is on the first ship.

I need to calculate how much durability is reduced for the first and last ships with the remaining k attacks.

Then, check if their durability drops to 0, and count them as sunk accordingly.

This seems like a plausible approach.

Let me try to walk through the example given to see if this works.

Example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1:

min_val = min(1,3) = 1

Since 1*2=2 <=5, perform 2 attacks: first ship goes to 0, last ship to 2.

Set k = 5 - 2 = 3

First ship is now sunk, so left =1

Array is now [2,4,3]

Step 2:

min_val = min(2,3) =2

2*2=4 <=3? No, 4 >3

So, perform remaining k=3 attacks:

First attack on first ship (2 ->1)

Last attack on last ship (3->2)

First attack on first ship (1->0)

So, first ship sinks again, left=2

Array is now [4,2]

Step 3:

k=0, so stop.

Total ships sunk: 2

Which matches the example.

Another example:

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Following the same steps:

Step 1:

min_val=1, 1*2=2 <=6

Perform 2 attacks: first ship to 0, last to 2

k=6-2=4

left=1, array=[2,4,3]

Step 2:

min_val=2, 2*2=4 <=4

Perform 4 attacks: first ship to 0, last to 0

k=4-4=0

Both ships sink, left=2, right=1

But left >= right, so stop.

Total ships sunk: 3

Which matches the example.

Another example:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Step 1:

min_val=min(2,2)=2

2*2=4 <=20

Perform 4 attacks: first ship to 0, last to 0

k=20-4=16

left=1, right=3, array=[7,1,8]

Step 2:

min_val=min(7,8)=7

7*2=14 <=16

Perform 14 attacks: first ship to 0, last to1

k=16-14=2

left=2, right=2, array=[1]

Step 3:

k=2, left=2, right=2

Only one ship left, attack it twice: 1-> -1, but since durability can't be negative, it sinks.

Total ships sunk: 5

Which matches the example.

Seems like this approach works.

Now, in the code provided, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

T = int(input())

while T:

T -= 1

(n, k) = input().split()

n = int(n)

k = int(k)

a = input().split()

a = list(map(lambda x: int(x), a))

l = 0

r = n - 1

ans = 0

while l < r and k > 0:

mi = min(a[l], a[r])

if mi * 2 <= k:

a[l] -= mi

a[r] -= mi

k -= mi * 2

if a[l] == 0:

ans += 1

l += 1

if a[r] == 0:

ans += 1

r -= 1

else:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:

ans += 1

break

if l == r:

ans += k >= a[l]

print(ans)

This seems to follow the logic I described.

It has a while loop that continues as long as l < r and k > 0.

Inside the loop, it calculates mi = min(a[l], a[r])

If mi * 2 <= k, it reduces a[l] and a[r] by mi, subtracts mi*2 from k, and increments l or decrements r if a[l] or a[r] become 0, counting them as sunk.

Else, it handles the remaining k attacks.

Finally, if l == r, it checks if the remaining k is enough to sink the last ship.

This seems correct.

Let's verify with the examples.

First example:

n=4, k=5, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1:

mi=min(1,3)=1

1*2=2 <=5

a[l]=1-1=0, a[r]=3-1=2

k=5-2=3

ans+=1, l=1

Now a=[2,4,2], l=1, r=2

Step 2:

mi=min(4,2)=2

2*2=4 >3, so else clause

t = 3 % 2 =1

if a[l] - t - k//2 ==0:

a[l]=4 -1 -1=2 !=0

So, no increment in ans

Break the loop

Then, l=1, r=2, l != r

But k=3 is used up in the else clause

Then, outside the loop, check if l==r, which is not the case

So, ans=1

But according to the earlier manual simulation, it should be 2

Wait, discrepancy here.

In my earlier manual simulation, after the first mi=1, k=3, a=[2,4,2]

Then, mi=2, but 2*2=4 >3, so go to else clause

In else clause, t=k%2=1

if a[l]-t -k//2 ==0:

a[l]=4 -1 -1=2 !=0

So, no increment in ans, and break

But in manual simulation, I had two ships sunk

Seems like the code is missing something here.

Wait, in the manual simulation, after mi=1, k=3, a=[2,4,2], l=1

Then, mi=min(4,2)=2, but 2*2=4 >3

So, remaining k=3 attacks:

First attack on a[l]=4 ->3

Last attack on a[r]=2 ->1

First attack on a[l]=3 ->2

But in the code, it's handling this differently.

In the else clause, it seems to handle the remaining k attacks, but perhaps not correctly.

Looking back at the code, in the else clause:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 ==0:

ans +=1

break

This seems to be trying to handle the remaining k attacks, but it's not clear.

In the first example, after mi=1, k=3

t=3%2=1

a[l]=4 -1 -1=2 !=0, so no increment in ans, and break

But in reality, two ships are sunk: the first one and the fourth one.

But according to this code, only one ship is counted as sunk.

So, it seems there's an error in the code's logic.

Looking back, perhaps the else clause needs to handle the remaining k attacks more carefully.

Instead of just checking if a[l] - t - k//2 ==0, it should actually simulate the remaining attacks.

Let me think differently.

After the while loop where mi*2 <=k, and handling full pairs, when k is less than mi*2, meaning we can't perform a full pair, we need to see how many attacks can be performed with the remaining k attacks.

Since attacks alternate between first and last, the number of attacks on first is ceil(k/2), and on last is floor(k/2).

So, for example, if k=5, attacks on first: 3, on last:2

Then, reduce a[l] by min(ceil(k/2), a[l]), and a[r] by min(floor(k/2), a[r])

Then, check if a[l] and a[r] become 0, and count them accordingly.

Wait, but we need to make sure that if a ship's durability reaches 0, it's removed, which might affect the number of attacks on the other ship.

Wait, but with k being up to 10^15, and n up to 2*10^5, we need an efficient way.

Perhaps, in the else clause, calculate how many attacks can be performed on first and last with the remaining k attacks.

Number of attacks on first: (k +1)//2

Number of attacks on last: k //2

Then, reduce a[l] by min(a[l], (k+1)//2)

Similarly, reduce a[r] by min(a[r], k//2)

Then, check if a[l] <=0 or a[r] <=0, and count them accordingly.

But need to handle the case where one ship sinks before the other.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate how much durability is reduced for each ship, and then see if they sink.

Let me adjust the else clause accordingly.

So, in the else clause:

attacks_first = (k +1)//2

attacks_last = k //2

a[l] -= attacks_first

a[r] -= attacks_last

if a[l] <=0:

ans +=1

if a[r] <=0:

ans +=1

But need to consider that if one ship sinks, it's removed, which might affect the other ship.

Wait, but in this approach, since k is small enough that mi*2 >k, meaning neither ship will sink in this step, but in reality, with the remaining k attacks, it's possible that one ship sinks.

But given that mi*2 >k, it's unlikely that a ship sinks, because mi is the minimum of a[l] and a[r], and k < 2*mi, so even if we attack first ceil(k/2) times and last floor(k/2) times, since a[l] and a[r] are both at least mi, they won't sink unless ceil(k/2) >= a[l] or floor(k/2) >= a[r].

But in the first example, after mi=1, k=3

attacks_first=2, attacks_last=1

a[l]=4-2=2 >0

a[r]=2-1=1>0

So, no ships sink.

But in manual simulation, two ships sank.

Wait, confusion here.

Wait, in manual simulation:

After mi=1, k=3

attacks_first=2, attacks_last=1

a[l]=4-2=2

a[r]=2-1=1

Neither sinks.

Then, l=1, r=2, a=[2,4,2]

But in manual simulation, first ship (now a[1]=4) is attacked twice, last ship (a[2]=2) is attacked once.

So, a[1]=4-2=2, a[2]=2-1=1

No ships sink.

Then, l=1, r=2

But in manual simulation, first ship is a[1]=4-2=2, last ship a[2]=2-1=1

Then, k=0, so stop.

Total ships sunk:1

But earlier I thought it was 2, but actually, in the first step, only the first original ship sank, and in the second step, no ships sank.

So, total ships sunk:1

But according to the example, output is 2.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the first step, first ship a[0]=1-1=0, sinks, so l=1

Then, attacks_first=2, attacks_last=1

a[l]=a[1]=2-2=0, sinks, l=2

a[r]=a[3]=3-1=2>0

So, total ships sunk:2

Wait, but according to the code, in the else clause, it would have a[l]=2-2=0, so ans +=1, and l=2

a[r]=2-1=1>0, no sink

So, ans=2, which matches the example.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

I must have misread it earlier.

Let me check again.

In the else clause:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 ==0:

ans +=1

break

But in reality, to handle the remaining k attacks, I need to reduce a[l] by (k+1)//2 and a[r] by k//2

Then, check if they become <=0

So, perhaps the code is incomplete or incorrect in handling the else clause.

Looking back, the else clause should be:

attacks_first = (k +1)//2

attacks_last = k //2

a[l] -= attacks_first

a[r] -= attacks_last

if a[l] <=0:

ans +=1

if a[r] <=0:

ans +=1

break

But in the provided code, it's:

t = k % 2

if a[l] - t - k // 2 ==0:

ans +=1

break

This seems incorrect.

In the first example:

After mi=1, k=3

attacks_first=2, attacks_last=1

a[l]=4-2=2>0

a[r]=2-1=1>0

So, no ships sink.

But according to the code:

t=3%2=1

a[l] - t - k//2 =4 -1 -1=2 !=0

So, no increment in ans, and break

Which is correct, because no ships sink in this step.

But in manual simulation, two ships sank: the first original ship and the second original last ship.

Wait, but in the first step, mi=1, k=5

mi*2=2<=5, so reduce a[l]=1-1=0, a[r]=3-1=2, k=5-2=3

ans +=1, l=1

Then, mi=min(2,2)=2

2*2=4>3

So, else clause:

t=3%2=1

a[l]-t -k//2=2-1-1=0==0, so ans +=1, break

Total ans=2, which matches the example.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

if a[l] - t - k//2 ==0:

ans +=1

break

Which in this case, a[l]=2, t=1, k//2=1

2-1-1=0==0, so ans +=1, making ans=2

Which is correct.

So, perhaps it's a coincidence in this example, but the logic might be flawed.

Let me try another example.

n=4, k=6, a=[1,2,4,3]

Step 1:

mi=1, 1*2=2<=6

a[l]=1-1=0, a[r]=3-1=2

k=6-2=4

ans +=1, l=1

Now, a=[2,4,2], l=1, r=2

Step 2:

mi=min(2,2)=2

2*2=4<=4

a[l]=2-2=0, a[r]=2-2=0

k=4-4=0

ans +=1 (for a[l]=0), l=2

ans +=1 (for a[r]=0), r=1

Now, l=2, r=1, so l >=r, stop

Total ans=3, which matches the example.

In the code, it would be:

First iteration: mi=1, 1*2=2<=6, reduce a[l]=0, a[r]=2, k=4, ans=1, l=1

Second iteration: mi=2, 2*2=4<=4, reduce a[l]=0, a[r]=0, k=0, ans+=1 (for a[l]=0), l=2

Then, check a[r]=0, ans+=1 (for a[r]=0), r=1

Now, l=2, r=1, l >=r, stop

Total ans=3, correct.

Another example:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Step1:

mi=1, 1*2=2<=20

a[l]=2-1=1, a[r]=2-1=1, k=20-2=18

ans +=1 (for a[l]=0), l=1

Now, a=[7,1,8], l=1, r=2

Step2:

mi=min(1,8)=1

1*2=2<=18

a[l]=1-1=0, a[r]=8-1=7, k=18-2=16

ans +=1 (for a[l]=0), l=2

Now, a=[7,7], l=2, r=2

Step3:

l == r, check if 16 >=7, ans +=1

Total ans=3, but according to earlier manual simulation, it should be 5.

Wait, discrepancy again.

In manual simulation, I thought it should be 5, but according to this, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps my earlier manual simulation was wrong.

Let's re-simulate:

n=5, k=20, a=[2,7,1,8,2]

Step1:

mi=1, 1*2=2<=20

a[l]=2-1=1, a[r]=2-1=1, k=18

ans +=1 (for a[l]=0), l=1

Now, a=[7,1,8], l=1, r=2

Step2:

mi=min(1,8)=1

1*2=2<=18

a[l]=1-1=0, a[r]=8-1=7, k=16

ans +=1 (for a[l]=0), l=2

Now, a=[7,7], l=2, r=1

l >=r, stop

Total ans=2, but earlier I thought it was 5.

Wait, confusion here.

According to the example in the problem, output is 5, but according to this simulation, ans=2.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example.
