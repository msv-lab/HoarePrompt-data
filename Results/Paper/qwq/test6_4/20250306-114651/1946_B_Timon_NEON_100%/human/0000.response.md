Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have an array of n integers, and we need to perform exactly k operations on it. In each operation, we select any contiguous subarray (which can be empty) and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array. After k operations, I need to find the maximum possible sum of the array, and since it can be very large, I have to output it modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what exactly is happening in each operation. So, in one operation:

1. Choose a contiguous subarray from the current array. This subarray can be empty.

2. Calculate the sum of this subarray.

3. Insert this sum anywhere in the array.

After k such operations, I need to maximize the sum of the array.

Let me consider a simple example to get a better understanding.

Example 1 from the input:

2 2

-4 -7

According to the note, in this case, it's advantageous to take an empty subarray twice and insert zero each time, resulting in the array becoming [-4, -7, 0, 0], with a sum of -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

Another example:

3 3

2 2 8

Here, they take the sum of the entire array (12) and insert it three times, resulting in [2,2,8,12,24,48], with a sum of 96.

In this case, summing the entire array and inserting it again seems beneficial.

Wait, but in the first example, inserting zeros was better. So, it seems that whether to insert the sum of the entire array or an empty subarray depends on the situation.

I need to find a general strategy that maximizes the sum after k operations.

Let me think about what operations can do to increase the sum.

Each operation allows me to insert a sum of a subarray anywhere in the array. The key is to choose which subarray to sum and where to insert it to maximize the total sum.

Inserting a positive sum increases the total sum, while inserting a negative sum decreases it. So, intuitively, I should aim to insert positive sums.

But, since I can choose any contiguous subarray, including an empty one with sum zero, or any subset of the array.

I need to maximize the sum after k insertions.

Wait, but inserting a sum into the array increases its length, which allows for more subarrays to choose from in the next operation.

But, the problem is to maximize the sum of the array after k operations, not to maximize the sum of the inserted values.

Wait, no, it's the sum of the final array.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the initial array a1, a2, ..., an.

After one operation, I choose a subarray from i to j, compute its sum s, and insert s into the array at some position.

The sum of the array after insertion is sum(a) + s.

Because I'm inserting s, which is the sum of some subarray.

Wait, but the subarray's sum is already part of the array's sum. So, by inserting s, I'm effectively adding s to the array's sum.

Wait, but the subarray's sum is already in the array, so adding s again increases the total sum by s.

Wait, no. Let's clarify.

If I have array [a,b,c], and I choose subarray [b,c] with sum s = b + c, and insert s into the array, say at the beginning, the new array becomes [s, a, b, c].

So, the sum is s + a + b + c = (b + c) + a + b + c = a + 2b + 2c.

Wait, so the sum increases by s, but the elements b and c are still present.

Wait, no. In this case, the sum is s + a + b + c, which is (b + c) + a + b + c = a + 2b + 2c.

So, it's like adding s to the original sum.

But in terms of the array's sum, it's sum(a) + s.

Wait, but in this example, sum(a) was a + b + c, and after inserting s = b + c, the new sum is a + b + c + s = a + b + c + b + c = a + 2b + 2c.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array."

So, the sum s is added to the array, but the original subarray remains.

Wait, no, inserting s adds s as a new element in the array, while the original subarray remains.

So, the array's sum increases by s.

Therefore, in each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, compute its sum s, and insert s into the array, increasing the sum by s.

My goal is to maximize the sum after k operations.

So, in each operation, I should choose the subarray with the maximum sum and insert it.

Wait, but I can choose any subarray, including empty subarrays with sum 0.

So, if I choose a subarray with sum s and insert it, the array's sum increases by s.

To maximize the sum after k operations, I should choose the subarray with the maximum possible sum in each operation and insert it.

But, the problem is that after each insertion, the array changes, so the possible subarrays change.

However, if I always choose the subarray with the maximum sum, insert it, and repeat, I might not be getting the optimal sum.

Wait, in the second example:

n=3, k=3

a = [2,2,8]

In each operation, they take the sum of the entire array and insert it.

First operation: sum = 12, insert 12, array becomes [2,2,8,12], sum = 24

Second operation: sum = 24, insert 24, array becomes [2,2,8,12,24], sum = 48

Third operation: sum = 48, insert 48, array becomes [2,2,8,12,24,48], sum = 96

So, in each operation, they are inserting the sum of the current array.

Wait, but in the first operation, the sum of the array is 12, insert 12, sum becomes 24.

In the second operation, the sum is now 24, insert 24, sum becomes 48.

Third operation, insert 48, sum becomes 96.

So, it's like in each operation, they are doubling the sum.

Wait, no, they are adding the current sum, so it's sum += sum of the subarray.

In this case, they are choosing the entire array each time, whose sum is s, and inserting s, so the new sum is s + s = 2s.

Wait, but in reality, if the array is [a,b,c], and I insert s = a + b + c, the new array is [a,b,c,s], sum = a + b + c + s = 2s.

So, sum becomes 2s.

Then, in the next operation, the sum is 2s, insert 2s, new sum is 2s + 2s = 4s.

Then next operation, insert 4s, sum becomes 8s, and so on.

So, after k operations, the sum should be s * 2^k.

Wait, but in the first operation, sum becomes s + s = 2s.

Second operation, sum becomes 2s + 2s = 4s.

Third operation, 4s + 4s = 8s.

So, after k operations, it's s * 2^k.

But in the first test case:

n=2, k=2

a = [-4, -7]

sum s = -11.

After first operation: insert -11, array becomes [-4, -7, -11], sum = -22.

Second operation: insert -22, array becomes [-4, -7, -11, -22], sum = -44.

But according to the note, they take empty subarrays with sum 0 and insert them, resulting in sum = -11 + 0 + 0 = -11, which modulo 10^9 + 7 is 999,999,996.

Wait, that's better than inserting -11 twice.

So, in some cases, inserting zero is better than inserting negative sums.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- If the sum of the array is positive, then in each operation, insert the entire array's sum, effectively doubling the sum each time.

- If the sum is negative, then inserting zero might be better.

But, in the fourth test case:

5 1

4 -2 8 -12 9

According to the note, it's advantageous to take the sum of the first three numbers (4 + (-2) + 8 = 10) and insert it at the beginning, resulting in [10,4,-2,8,-12,9], sum = 17.

Wait, but according to my earlier strategy, if the sum is positive, insert the entire array's sum.

In this case, sum is 4 -2 +8 -12 +9 = 7, which is positive. According to my strategy, insert 7, resulting in sum = 14.

But in the note, they insert 10, resulting in sum = 17.

So, inserting a partial subarray's sum can be better than inserting the entire array's sum.

Hence, my earlier assumption that always inserting the entire array's sum is not always optimal.

So, I need a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

In each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, compute its sum s, and insert s into the array, which increases the total sum by s.

I need to choose s in each operation to maximize the increase in the sum.

Given that I can choose any contiguous subarray, including empty ones, I should choose the subarray with the maximum sum s in each operation.

So, the key is to find the subarray with the maximum sum in the current array and insert it.

But, after each insertion, the array changes, so I need to repeat this process k times.

However, this seems computationally expensive, especially since n and k can be up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the sum after k operations.

Initially, sum = sum(a).

After first operation, sum += s1, where s1 is the sum of the chosen subarray.

After second operation, sum += s2.

And so on, up to k operations.

So, total sum after k operations: sum(a) + s1 + s2 + ... + sk.

I need to maximize this sum, which means I need to choose s1 to sk to be as large as possible.

But s1 to sk depend on the choices made in each operation.

If I always choose the subarray with the maximum sum available at each step, I might maximize the total sum.

But, as seen in the fourth test case, choosing a partial subarray can be better than choosing the entire array's sum.

So, perhaps I need to find the subarray with the maximum sum in the initial array, and then, in each operation, insert that sum.

Wait, but the array changes after each insertion.

Wait, in the fourth test case, they chose a subarray [4,-2,8] with sum 10, and inserted it at the beginning, resulting in [10,4,-2,8,-12,9], sum = 17.

If they had inserted the entire array's sum, which is 7, the sum would have been 14, which is less than 17.

So, in this case, choosing a subarray with a larger sum than the entire array's sum is better.

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, the subarray [4,-2,8] has sum 10, which is larger than the entire array's sum 7.

So, by inserting 10, the sum becomes 17, which is better than inserting 7, which would make sum 14.

So, in this case, there exists a subarray whose sum is larger than the entire array's sum.

This suggests that, in some cases, there are subarrays with sums larger than the total sum, and choosing those can lead to a higher total sum after insertions.

Hence, always choosing the subarray with the maximum sum available at each step seems to be the way to go.

But, as the array changes after each insertion, this might be tricky.

Wait, but perhaps there's a pattern here.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any s, where s is the sum of any contiguous subarray.

But, since I can choose any contiguous subarray, including individual elements or the entire array, the question is which one to choose to maximize the sum.

Wait, but in each operation, I can choose any contiguous subarray, so the best choice is always to choose the one with the maximum sum available at that step.

However, computing this for each of up to 2e5 operations is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any s that is the sum of a contiguous subarray of the current array.

But, after inserting s, the array changes, and new subarrays become available.

This seems complex.

Is there a way to model this more effectively?

Let me consider the total sum after k operations.

Initially, sum = sum(a).

After each operation, I add s, where s is the sum of some contiguous subarray.

So, sum after k operations: sum(a) + s1 + s2 + ... + sk.

I need to maximize this sum.

What is the maximum possible sum I can achieve?

Well, to maximize the sum, I need to choose s1 to sk to be as large as possible.

But s1 to sk are sums of contiguous subarrays of the current array.

I need to find a way to maximize the sum after k operations.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as sum(a) + (sum of k maximum subarrays).

But, the problem is that after each operation, the array changes, so the available subarrays change.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum possible sum that can be added in each operation and find a pattern.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any sum of a contiguous subarray.

But, since I can choose to add the sum of any subarray, including the one with the maximum sum, perhaps I can find the maximum possible sum that can be added in each operation.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the initial array, and then, in each operation, add that maximum sum.

But, in the fourth test case, the maximum subarray sum is 10, which is larger than the total sum of the array, which is 7.

By adding 10 in each operation, the sum becomes sum(a) + k * s_max, where s_max is the maximum subarray sum.

But, in the second test case, s_max is 12, and after k=3 operations, sum is sum(a) + s_max * (2^k -1).

Wait, no, in the second test case, sum becomes sum(a) * 2^k.

Wait, in the second test case, sum(a) = 12, after first operation, sum becomes 24, second operation, 48, third operation, 96.

So, sum(a) * 2^k = 12 * 8 = 96.

So, sum(a) * 2^k.

But in the first test case, sum(a) = -11, sum after k=2 operations is -11 * 2^2 = -44, but according to the note, they choose to insert zero twice, resulting in sum = -11 + 0 + 0 = -11.

So, in this case, inserting zero is better than inserting the maximum subarray sum, which is -4 + (-7) = -11, or individual elements which are negative.

Hence, in cases where sum(a) is negative, inserting zero is better.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, sum(a) = 7, but the maximum subarray sum is 10, so inserting 10 once results in sum = 17.

Wait, but according to my earlier idea, sum(a) * 2^k would be 7 * 4 = 28, but in reality, inserting 10 once gives 17, which is better than 28.

Wait, no, inserting 10 once gives 17, but according to sum(a) * 2^k, it would be 7 * 4 = 28.

But, in reality, if I insert 10 once, sum becomes 17, then if I insert 17, sum becomes 34, then insert 34, sum becomes 68.

So, with k=1, sum=17; k=2, sum=34; k=3, sum=68.

But in the second test case, with k=3, sum=96, which is sum(a) * 2^k = 12 * 8 = 96.

Wait, in the fourth test case, sum(a)=7, after inserting 10 once, sum=17.

Then, if I insert 17, sum=34, then insert 34, sum=68.

So, it seems that inserting the current sum in each operation leads to sum(a) * 2^k.

But, in this case, inserting the maximum subarray sum leads to higher sums.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, inserting 10 once gives sum=17, which is better than sum(a)*2 = 14.

Then, in the next operation, inserting 17 gives sum=34, which is better than sum(a)*4=28.

So, it seems that inserting the current sum in each operation is better.

But, in the first test case, inserting zero is better than inserting negative sums.

Hence, perhaps the strategy is:

- If sum(a) >= 0, then in each operation, insert the current sum, leading to sum(a) * 2^k.

- If sum(a) < 0, then insert zero in all k operations, leading to sum(a) + 0*k = sum(a).

But, in the fourth test case, sum(a)=7, which is positive, and inserting the maximum subarray sum (10) once gives sum=17, which is better than sum(a)*2=14.

But according to my earlier strategy, sum(a)*2^k=7*4=28, but in reality, inserting 10 once and then inserting the new sum leads to sum=68, which is larger than 28.

Wait, perhaps I need to insert the maximum subarray sum in each operation, rather than inserting the current sum.

But, in the second test case, inserting the sum of the entire array leads to sum(a)*2^k=12*8=96, which matches the result.

In the fourth test case, inserting the maximum subarray sum of 10 in each operation would lead to sum(a) + k*s_max = 7 + 1*10 = 17, which matches the note.

Wait, but with k=1, sum=17.

If k=2, sum=17 + 10 = 27.

If k=3, sum=27 +10=37.

But according to my earlier calculation, inserting the current sum each time leads to higher sums.

So, perhaps inserting the maximum subarray sum in each operation is not always optimal.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to insert the maximum subarray sum in the first operation, and then in the subsequent operations, insert the current sum.

In the fourth test case, with k=1, insert 10, sum=17.

With k=2, insert 17, sum=34.

With k=3, insert 34, sum=68.

This seems better than inserting 10 each time, which would give sum=7 + 10*3 = 37.

So, in this case, inserting the current sum in each operation is better.

But, in the fourth test case, inserting the maximum subarray sum once and then inserting the current sum leads to higher sums.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- In the first operation, insert the maximum subarray sum.

- In the next operations, insert the current sum.

But, in the second test case, inserting the entire array's sum (which is the maximum subarray sum) in each operation leads to sum(a)*2^k.

So, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let s be the sum of the array.

Let m be the maximum subarray sum.

If s >= 0, then inserting s in each operation leads to s * (2^k).

If m > s, then inserting m in the first operation and then inserting the current sum in subsequent operations might lead to higher sums.

Wait, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- If m > s, then insert m in the first operation, then insert the new sum in the next operations.

- Else, insert s in each operation.

Wait, let's see.

In the fourth test case, m=10, s=7, m > s.

So, insert m=10, sum becomes 17.

Then, in the next operation, insert 17, sum becomes 34.

And so on.

So, after k operations, sum = m * (2^{k-1}) + s * (2^{k-1} -1).

Wait, no, it's more complicated.

Let me think recursively.

Let sum_k be the sum after k operations.

sum_k = sum_{k-1} + s_k, where s_k is the sum of the chosen subarray in the k-th operation.

To maximize sum_k, we need to choose s_k to be as large as possible.

But s_k depends on the current array, which includes the previously inserted sums.

This seems too recursive and hard to compute directly.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any sum of a contiguous subarray of the current array.

But, the key is that the sum of any contiguous subarray of the current array is bounded by the maximum subarray sum.

Hence, the optimal strategy is to always add the maximum subarray sum in each operation.

But, as the array changes after each insertion, the maximum subarray sum might change.

However, if I insert the current maximum subarray sum, the new array will have a new sum, and potentially a new maximum subarray sum.

But, perhaps, after the first insertion, the maximum subarray sum becomes the newly inserted sum.

Wait, in the second test case, inserting the sum of the array leads to the new maximum subarray sum being the newly inserted sum.

Wait, let's see:

Initial array: [2,2,8], sum=12.

Insert 12, array becomes [2,2,8,12], sum=24.

Now, the maximum subarray sum is 12 (the last element).

Insert 12 again, array becomes [2,2,8,12,12], sum=36.

Again, the maximum subarray sum is 12.

Insert 12 again, array becomes [2,2,8,12,12,12], sum=48.

So, in this case, inserting the maximum subarray sum in each operation leads to sum = 12 + 12*(k-1).

But, according to the earlier observation, sum = sum(a) * 2^k = 12 * 8 = 96 for k=3.

But according to this, sum = 12 + 12*2 = 36, which is less than 96.

Hence, inserting the current sum in each operation is better than inserting the maximum subarray sum.

Wait, but in reality, inserting the current sum in each operation leads to sum *= 2 each time, which matches sum(a) * 2^k.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to insert the current sum in each operation.

But, in the fourth test case, inserting the maximum subarray sum once and then inserting the current sum leads to higher sums.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that, in the first operation, I insert the maximum subarray sum, m.

Then, in the second operation, I insert the current sum, which is sum(a) + m.

In the third operation, insert the current sum again, which is sum(a) + m + (sum(a) + m) = sum(a) + m + sum(a) + m = 2*sum(a) + 2*m.

Wait, this seems messy.

Perhaps, it's better to consider that, after inserting m in the first operation, the new sum is sum(a) + m.

Then, in the next operations, inserting the current sum would be sum(a) + m, then sum(a) + m + sum(a) + m = 2*(sum(a) + m), and so on.

So, after k operations, sum = sum(a) + m * (2^{k-1}).

Wait, no.

Let me formalize it.

Let sum_0 = sum(a)

Let m = maximum subarray sum

Operation 1: insert m, sum_1 = sum_0 + m

Operation 2: insert sum_1 = sum_0 + m, sum_2 = sum_1 + sum_1 = 2*sum_1 = 2*(sum_0 + m)

Operation 3: insert sum_2 = 2*(sum_0 + m), sum_3 = sum_2 + sum_2 = 4*(sum_0 + m)

...

After k operations, sum_k = sum_0 + m * (2^{k-1})

Wait, no, in the second operation, sum_1 is inserted, which is sum_0 + m, so sum_2 = sum_1 + sum_1 = 2*(sum_0 + m)

In the third operation, sum_2 is inserted, sum_3 = sum_2 + sum_2 = 4*(sum_0 + m)

...

So, after k operations, sum_k = sum_0 + m * (2^{k-1})

But in the second test case, sum_0 = 12, m = 12

After k=3 operations, sum = 12 + 12*4 = 60, but according to the note, it's 96.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second test case, sum_0 = 12

Operation 1: insert 12, sum_1 = 12 + 12 = 24

Operation 2: insert 24, sum_2 = 24 + 24 = 48

Operation 3: insert 48, sum_3 = 48 + 48 = 96

So, sum_k = sum_{k-1} + sum_{k-1} = 2*sum_{k-1}

Hence, sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k = 12 * 8 = 96

So, in this case, sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k

But according to my earlier formula, sum_k = sum_0 + m * (2^{k-1}) = 12 + 12*4 = 60, which doesn't match 96.

Hence, my formula is incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct formula is sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k

But, in the fourth test case, sum_0 = 7

If I insert m=10 in the first operation, sum_1 = 7 + 10 = 17

Then, insert 17 in the second operation, sum_2 = 17 + 17 = 34

Then, insert 34 in the third operation, sum_3 = 34 + 34 = 68

So, sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k = 7 * 8 = 56, but according to this, sum_3 = 68, which is larger.

Hence, sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k is not matching.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum_0 + m * (2^{k-1} -1)

In the second test case, sum_k = 12 + 12*(2^{2} -1) = 12 + 12*3 = 48, which doesn't match 96.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k

In the second test case, sum_k = 12 * 8 = 96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, sum_k = 7 * 8 = 56, but according to the operations, sum_k = 68.

Hence, sum_k = sum_0 * 2^k doesn't hold in the fourth test case.

So, perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum_0 + m * (2^k -1)

In the second test case, sum_k = 12 + 12*(7) = 96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, sum_k = 7 + 10*(7) = 77, but according to the operations, sum_k = 68.

So, still not matching.

Hence, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that, in each operation, I can add any sum of a contiguous subarray, which is at least the sum of the array itself.

But, in reality, by inserting the sum of the array, I can double the sum each time.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, inserting the maximum subarray sum once and then inserting the current sum leads to higher sums than just inserting the sum of the array each time.

Hence, perhaps the optimal strategy is:

- If there exists a subarray with sum > sum(a), then insert that subarray's sum once, and then proceed to insert the current sum in the remaining operations.

- Else, just insert sum(a) in each operation.

But, in the fourth test case, inserting m=10 in the first operation gives sum=17, then inserting 17 in the second operation gives sum=34, and inserting 34 in the third operation gives sum=68.

Which is better than inserting m=10 in all operations: sum=7 + 10*3 = 37.

Hence, it's better to insert m once and then insert the current sum in the remaining operations.

But, in the second test case, m=12, which is equal to sum(a), so inserting m in the first operation and then inserting the current sum in the remaining operations leads to sum_k = sum(a) + m*(2^{k-1} -1) = 12 + 12*(7) = 96, which matches the note.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, sum(a)=7, m=10.

sum_k = 7 + 10*(2^{k-1} -1)

For k=1: 7 + 10*(1 -1) = 7 + 0 =7 (but in reality, sum=17)

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum_k = m * 2^{k-1} + sum(a) - m

For k=1: 10*1 +7 -10=7, which doesn't match 17.

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum(a) + m * (2^{k-1} -1)

For k=1: 7 + 10*(1-1)=7 +0=7, but in reality, sum=17.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum(a) + m * 2^{k-1}

For k=1: 7 +10*1=17, which matches.

For k=2: 7 +10*2=27, but in reality, sum=34.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum(a) * 2^{k-1} + m * (2^{k-1} -1)

For k=1: 7*1 +10*(1-1)=7 +0=7, doesn't match 17.

Wait, no.

I need to find a general formula for sum_k.

Let me consider that, in the first operation, I insert m, so sum becomes sum(a) + m.

In the second operation, I insert the current sum, which is sum(a) + m, so sum becomes sum(a) + m + (sum(a) + m) = 2*(sum(a) + m)

In the third operation, insert the current sum again, which is 2*(sum(a) + m), so sum becomes 2*(sum(a) + m) + 2*(sum(a) + m) = 4*(sum(a) + m)

...

So, after k operations, sum_k = sum(a) * 2^{k-1} + m * (2^{k-1} -1)

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_0 = sum(a)

Operation 1: insert m, sum_1 = sum_0 + m

Operation 2: insert sum_1, sum_2 = sum_1 + sum_1 = 2*sum_1 = 2*(sum_0 + m)

Operation 3: insert sum_2, sum_3 = sum_2 + sum_2 = 4*(sum_0 + m)

...

So, sum_k = (sum_0 + m) * 2^{k-1}

Yes, that seems correct.

In the second test case, sum_0 =12, m=12, sum_k = (12 +12)*4 = 24*4=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, sum_0=7, m=10, sum_k=(7+10)*4=17*4=68, which matches the earlier calculation.

Hence, the general formula is sum_k = (sum(a) + m) * 2^{k-1}

Wait, but in the first test case, sum_0=-11, m=0 (since inserting empty subarray), sum_k=(-11 +0)*2^{k-1}=-11*2^{k-1}

For k=2, sum_k=-11*2= -22, but according to the note, they insert zero twice, resulting in sum=-11 +0 +0=-11.

So, my formula gives -22, but the note says -11.

Hence, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me think again.

In the first operation, insert m, sum becomes sum(a) + m.

In the second operation, insert sum(a) + m, sum becomes sum(a) + m + sum(a) + m = 2*sum(a) + 2*m.

Wait, but in the first test case, sum(a)=-11, m=0, sum after first operation: -11 +0=-11.

Sum after second operation: -11 + (-11)= -22.

But according to the note, they insert zero twice, resulting in sum=-11 +0 +0=-11.

Wait, but according to my operations, inserting m=0 in the first operation gives sum=-11 +0=-11.

Then, in the second operation, insert sum(a) + m = -11 +0=-11, sum becomes -11 + (-11)=-22.

But in the note, they insert zero twice, resulting in sum=-11 +0 +0=-11.

So, perhaps there is confusion about what is being inserted.

Wait, perhaps, when they say "insert the sum anywhere in the array", it doesn't add to the sum of the array.

Wait, no, in the first test case, they say inserting zero twice results in sum=-11 +0 +0=-11.

But according to my earlier logic, inserting m in each operation adds m each time.

Hence, inserting 0 twice adds 0 +0=0, sum remains -11.

But according to my formula, sum_k = (sum(a) + m)*2^{k-1} = (-11 +0)*2 = -22, which doesn't match the note.

Hence, my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum_k = sum(a) + m * (2^k -1)

In the first test case, sum_k = -11 +0*(1)= -11, which matches.

In the second test case, sum_k=12 +12*(7)=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, sum_k=7 +10*(7)=77, but according to the operations, sum_k=68.

Hence, still not matching.

I need to find a better formula.

Let me consider that, in the first operation, I insert m, sum becomes sum(a) + m.

In the second operation, I insert m again, sum becomes sum(a) + m + m = sum(a) + 2*m.

In the third operation, insert m again, sum becomes sum(a) + 2*m + m = sum(a) + 3*m.

So, sum_k = sum(a) + k*m

But, in the second test case, sum_k =12 +3*12=48, but according to the note, it's 96.

Hence, this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps in each operation, I can insert the current sum.

Wait, but in the second test case, inserting the current sum leads to sum_k = sum(a) * 2^k =12*8=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, sum_k=7*8=56, but according to the operations, sum_k=68.

Wait, perhaps in the fourth test case, m > sum(a), so sum_k = m * 2^k + sum(a) - m

For k=1: 10*2 +7 -10=20 +7 -10=17, which matches.

For k=2:10*4 +7 -10=40 +7 -10=37, but according to operations, sum_k=34.

Doesn't match.

Hence, still not correct.

I need to find a general formula that works for all cases.

Let me consider that, in the first operation, I insert m, sum becomes sum(a) + m.

In the second operation, I insert sum(a) + m, sum becomes sum(a) + m + sum(a) + m = 2*sum(a) + 2*m.

In the third operation, insert sum(a) + m again, sum becomes 2*sum(a) + 2*m + sum(a) + m = 3*sum(a) + 3*m.

Wait, no, in the second operation, I insert sum(a) + m, so sum becomes sum(a) + m + (sum(a) + m) = 2*(sum(a) + m)

In the third operation, insert sum(a) + m again, sum becomes 2*(sum(a) + m) + sum(a) + m = 3*(sum(a) + m)

Wait, no, 2*(sum(a) + m) + sum(a) + m = 3*sum(a) + 3*m

But, in reality, in the second test case, sum(a)=12, m=12

sum_k =12 +12 +24 +48 =96, which is sum(a) * 2^k =12*8=96

Wait, but according to the operations:

Operation 1: insert 12, sum=24

Operation 2: insert 24, sum=48

Operation 3: insert 48, sum=96

So, sum_k = sum(a) * 2^k

But in the fourth test case, sum(a)=7, m=10

Operation 1: insert 10, sum=17

Operation 2: insert 17, sum=34

Operation 3: insert 34, sum=68

So, sum_k=7*2^k + 10*(2^{k-1})

Wait, for k=1:7*2 +10*1=14+10=24, but actual sum=17

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps sum_k = sum(a) * 2^k + m * (2^{k-1} -1)

In the second test case:7*8 +10*(4 -1)=56 +30=86, which doesn't match 68.

Wait, no.

I need to find a general formula.

Let me consider that, in the first operation, I insert m, sum becomes sum(a) + m.

In the subsequent operations, I insert the current sum, which is sum(a) + m in the second operation, then sum(a) + m + sum(a) + m = 2*(sum(a) + m), and so on.

Hence, sum_k = sum(a) + m + (sum(a) + m) * (2^{k-1} -1)

Wait, in the second test case, sum_k=12 +12 + (12 +12)*(4 -1)=12 +12 +24*3=12 +12 +72=96, which matches.

In the fourth test case, sum_k=7 +10 + (7 +10)*(2 -1)=7
