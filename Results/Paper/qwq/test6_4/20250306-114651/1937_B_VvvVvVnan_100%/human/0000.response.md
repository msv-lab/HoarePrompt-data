Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

We have a 2xN grid filled with 0s and 1s. There's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) and it needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only move one cell right or down. For each path it takes, we construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths produce this string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, each path can be represented by a sequence of moves. For a 2xN grid, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), the grasshopper must make exactly one down move and N-1 right moves, in some order.

Wait, actually, no. Let's think carefully. From (1,1), each move can be either right or down, but it can't go beyond the grid. So, the grasshopper has to make a total of N-1 right moves and 1 down move to reach (2,N). So, the total number of moves is N, with N-1 rights and 1 down.

But actually, that's not always true. Let me think again. If the grasshopper is at (1,j), it can move right to (1,j+1) or down to (2,j). If it's at (2,j), it can only move right to (2,j+1) because down would take it out of the grid.

So, the path can have different numbers of down moves, but in this case, to reach (2,N), it must make exactly one down move somewhere between column 1 and column N.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the grasshopper starts at (1,1) and needs to reach (2,N), it must make exactly one down move at some point. The down move can be at any column from 1 to N-1, but not at column N because it can't move down from (1,N) to (2,N+1), which doesn't exist. Wait, no, from (1,N), it can move down to (2,N), which is the target.

So, the grasshopper must make exactly one down move, and the rest are right moves.

But the sequence of moves can vary. For example, it can move right k times and then down, and then right (N-1-k) times.

Wait, more precisely, from (1,1), it can move right to (1,2), then right to (1,3), and so on, up to (1,N), and then down to (2,N). Or, it can move right once to (1,2), then down to (2,2), then right to (2,3), and so on to (2,N). Or, it can move down to (2,1), then right to (2,2), and so on to (2,N).

So, in general, the down move can be at any step from the first move to the last move.

Now, the binary string is constructed by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order.

I need to find the lexicographically smallest such string among all possible paths.

And also count how many paths produce this string.

First, I need to understand what lexicographical order means for strings. Given two strings of the same length, the first position where they differ determines which one is smaller. So, the smaller the first character, the smaller the string. If the first characters are the same, then look at the second, and so on.

So, to find the smallest string, I need to minimize the sequence of characters in the path.

Given that the grid is 2xN, with rows labeled 1 and 2, and columns from 1 to N.

Let me denote the cells as a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1N}, and a_{21}, a_{22}, ..., a_{2N}.

The grasshopper starts at a_{11} and ends at a_{2N}.

Each path corresponds to a sequence of cells from a_{11} to a_{2N}, with moves only right or down.

I need to collect the values along the path in order and form a string.

I need to find the smallest such string among all possible paths.

I need to think about how to efficiently find this smallest string and count the number of paths that produce it.

One way is to consider all possible paths, construct their strings, find the minimum, and count how many times it appears. But this is inefficient for large N, since the number of paths can be up to binomial(N,1) = N, which is acceptable for small N but we have N up to 2e5, and T up to 1e4, with total N across all test cases up to 2e5.

So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about how to minimize the string lexicographically.

To minimize the string, I need the first character to be as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

So, I need to choose a path where the sequence of cells gives the smallest possible characters at each position.

Given that the grasshopper can choose to move right or down at each step, I need to decide at each step which move leads to the smallest possible sequence.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

I can think of dp[i][j], which represents the smallest string from (1,1) to (i,j).

But dp[i][j] would be a string, and handling strings in dp might be inefficient for large N.

Maybe I can optimize it.

Let me consider that the grid has only two rows, so it's a 2xN grid.

So, the paths are relatively simple.

Let me try to model the paths.

From (1,1), the grasshopper can:

- Move right to (1,2), then continue moving right until some column k, then move down to (2,k), then move right to (2,N).

- Or, move down to (2,1), then move right to (2,2), and so on to (2,N).

So, in essence, the down move can happen at any column from 1 to N.

So, for each possible column k from 1 to N, where the down move occurs, the path would be:

- From (1,1) to (1,k), then down to (2,k), then to (2,N).

So, the string would be a_{11}, a_{12}, ..., a_{1k}, a_{2k}, a_{2,k+1}, ..., a_{2N}.

I need to choose k such that this string is lexicographically smallest.

Wait, but it's not just about choosing one k, because sometimes there might be multiple paths that give the same initial characters, and I need to consider all of them.

But with N up to 2e5, iterating over all possible k is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the grasshopper can choose to stay in row 1 for some columns, and then switch to row 2.

So, the string is determined by the cells in row 1 up to some point, then the remaining cells in row 2 starting from that point.

I need to choose the switch point k, where k ranges from 1 to N, and the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

Wait, more precisely, s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

I need to find the k that minimizes this string.

But again, iterating over all k is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal possible string efficiently.

Let me consider that the string is the concatenation of a prefix from row 1 and a suffix from row 2, starting from the same column.

I need to choose the column where to switch from row 1 to row 2 to get the smallest possible concatenation.

But I need to consider that the switch can happen at any column, and I need to choose the one that gives the smallest string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where row 1 and row 2 differ, and choose the path that picks the smaller value at that point.

But it's not that straightforward.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns from left to right, and at each column, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

I need to choose the path that gives the smallest possible string.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

I can keep track of the current row I am in, and at each column, decide whether to stay in the current row or switch to the other row, based on which choice gives the smallest next character.

But since the grasshopper can only move right or down, and cannot go back, I need to model this carefully.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define that at each column j, the grasshopper is in either row 1 or row 2.

If it's in row 1, it can choose to stay in row 1 (move right) or switch to row 2 (move down).

If it's in row 2, it can only stay in row 2 (move right).

So, I can model this with states.

Let me define dp[j][r], where j is the column index from 1 to N, and r is the current row (1 or 2).

dp[j][r] represents the smallest string from (1,1) to (r,j).

But again, handling strings in dp might be inefficient.

Maybe I can compare the strings step by step.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first position where the paths differ and choose the one with the smaller character at that position.

But it's still not clear.

Let me consider merging the two rows in a way that simulates all possible paths.

Since the grasshopper can switch from row 1 to row 2 at any column, the resulting string is a merge of prefixes of row 1 and suffixes of row 2.

This sounds similar to finding the shortest path in a graph where edges have string labels, but that seems too complicated.

Let me consider that the string is built by appending characters from row 1 up to some point, and then appending characters from row 2 from that point onward.

So, for each k from 1 to N, the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

I need to find the minimal such string among all k.

But iterating over all k is too slow for N up to 2e5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the one where the switch from row 1 to row 2 is done at the earliest possible column where switching doesn't cause the string to become larger.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where s1 and s2 start differing, and choose the row that has the smaller character at that point.

But it's not that simple, because the switch can affect the subsequent characters.

Wait, maybe I can use some kind of two-pointer approach.

Let me try to think of an example.

Take the first test case:

n=2

s1=00

s2=00

So, possible paths:

- Right, right, down: 0->0->0 (string: 000)

- Right, down, right: 0->0->0 (string: 000)

- Down, right, right: 0->0->0 (string: 000)

So, all paths give the same string 000.

But according to the sample output, it's 000 with count=2.

Wait, but in the explanation, there are two paths that give 000.

Wait, in the first test case, n=2, s1=00, s2=00.

Possible paths:

1. (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3): but n=2, so columns are 1 to 2.

Wait, in the sample input, n=2, s1=00, s2=00.

So, grid is:

0 0

0 0

Paths:

- (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2): string 0+0+0=000

- (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2): string 0+0+0=000

So, two paths give 000.

Hence, minimal string is 000, count=2.

In the second test case:

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Possible paths:

- (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(1,4)->(2,4): string 1+1+0+1+0=11010

- (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4): string 1+1+0+0+0=11000

- (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): string 1+1+1+0+0=11100

- (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4): string 1+1+0+0+0=11000

So, the minimal string is 11000, and only one path gives it: (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4).

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 11000 with count=1.

So, in this case, among the paths, 11000 is the minimal, and only one path gives it.

In the third test case:

n=8

s1=00100111

s2=11101101

Possible paths:

Various paths, and the minimal string is 001001101 with count=4.

I need to find a way to efficiently determine the minimal string and count the number of paths that give it.

Let me think about how to find the minimal string.

I need to choose the path where the sequence of characters is smallest.

Given that the grasshopper can choose to stay in row 1 for some columns and then switch to row 2, I need to find the switch column k that minimizes the string s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

But iterating over all k is too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the one where the grasshopper stays in row 1 as long as row 1 has a smaller or equal value than row 2, and switches to row 2 when necessary.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that at each column, I compare the current cell in row 1 and row 2.

If s1[j] < s2[j], then it's better to stay in row 1.

If s1[j] > s2[j], then it's better to switch to row 2.

If s1[j] == s2[j], then I need to look ahead to decide.

This seems similar to merging two sorted arrays.

Wait, perhaps I can treat row 1 and row 2 as two strings, and find the smallest merged string.

But I need to consider that switching from row 1 to row 2 can happen only once, and after switching, the grasshopper stays in row 2.

Wait, no, actually, in this problem, the grasshopper can only switch from row 1 to row 2 once, at any column.

So, effectively, the path is a prefix from row 1 and a suffix from row 2, starting from some switch column k.

Hence, the string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

I need to choose k to minimize s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

Given that s1 and s2 are given, and N is large, I need an efficient way to find the minimal merged string.

I recall that in string algorithms, there are ways to merge two strings to get the smallest lexicographical string, but usually, that's for permutations or different scenarios.

In this case, since the switch can happen only once and it's from row 1 to row 2, at some column k, I need to find the best k.

But iterating over all k is too slow.

I need a way to find the optimal k efficiently.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the smallest among all possible s1[1..k] + s2[k..N], for k from 1 to N.

I need to find the minimal such string.

To do this efficiently, I can think of the strings s1 and s2 as arrays of characters, and find the point k where s1[1..k] + s2[k..N] is minimal.

To optimize this, I can precompute the suffixes of s1 and s2, and find the point where switching gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can use suffix arrays or some string data structure to find the minimal concatenation.

But I need to think simpler, as suffix arrays might be overkill.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the one where the grasshopper stays in row 1 as long as possible without causing a larger string, and switches to row 2 at the earliest possible opportunity to get a smaller string.

So, I can iterate through the columns from left to right, and keep track of the current path.

At each column, I decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2.

I choose the option that gives the smallest possible character at the current position.

If s1[j] < s2[j-1], then stay in row 1.

If s1[j] > s2[j-1], then switch to row 2.

If s1[j] == s2[j-1], then it's a tie, and I need to look ahead.

Wait, but I need to consider that switching affects the entire suffix.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first position where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the row with the smaller character.

But it's more complicated than that.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two strings: s1 and s2.

I need to find the minimal string that is a combination of a prefix of s1 and a suffix of s2, starting from the same index.

So, I need to find k that minimizes s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where s1 starts being larger than s2.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the longest common prefix.

Let me consider that I iterate through the columns, comparing s1 and s2.

I can find the first column where s1[j] != s2[j].

At that point, I choose the row with the smaller character.

But it's not that straightforward.

Let me consider maintaining a current path and deciding at each step which move to make.

I can use a greedy approach.

Start at (1,1).

At each step, choose the move (right or down) that leads to the smallest possible next character.

If moving right from row 1 to row 1 gives a smaller or equal character than moving down to row 2, stay in row 1.

Else, switch to row 2.

But since after switching to row 2, the grasshopper must stay in row 2, I need to decide the switch point carefully.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current row.

Initialize in row 1.

At each column, if s1[j] <= s2[j-1], stay in row 1.

Else, switch to row 2.

But I need to make sure that switching leads to a smaller string.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for the first position where s1[j] > s2[j-1], and switch there.

But I need to handle the equality case carefully.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and keep choosing to stay in row 1 until switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

But I need to consider the entire suffix.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about the strings.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the smallest among all possible s1[1..k] + s2[k..N].

I can precompute the suffixes.

Let me precompute the strings s1_prefix = s1[1..k] and s2_suffix = s2[k..N], for all k from 1 to N.

Then, I need to find the k that minimizes s1_prefix + s2_suffix.

But storing and comparing strings for each k is too slow.

I need a smarter way to compare these concatenated strings.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are arrays of characters.

I can iterate through the columns and find the point where s1 and s2 start differing.

At that point, choose the row with the smaller character.

If s1 and s2 are equal up to some point, then the minimal string is the one where the switch happens at the earliest possible k where s1[k+1..N] + s2[k+1..N] is minimal.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..N], and I need to find the smallest such string among all k.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal string found.

But with N up to 2e5, this is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenated string in linear time.

Let me consider merging s1 and s2 in a way that I choose the smallest possible character at each position.

But it's not that simple because the switch can happen only once.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where s1 starts being larger than s2, and switch there.

But I need to consider the entire string.

Let me consider that the minimal string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..N], and I need to find the k that minimizes this.

To optimize this, I can find the point where s1 and s2 start differing, and choose the k that gives the smallest possible string.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal suffix.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are strings of length N.

I can compute the minimal possible string by choosing the k where s1[1..k] + s2[k..N] is minimal.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute this in O(N).

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums.

Wait, no, that might not help directly.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are strings, and I need to find the minimal possible merge.

I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current choice.

Start with row 1.

At each step, compare s1[j] with s2[j-1] (if j > 1).

If s1[j] < s2[j-1], stay in row 1.

If s1[j] > s2[j-1], switch to row 2.

If s1[j] == s2[j-1], it's a tie, and I need to look ahead.

But looking ahead is time-consuming for large N.

I need a way to decide instantly or with precomputation.

Let me consider that I can precompute the point where s1 starts being larger than s2.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where s1 and s2 differ, and choose the row with the smaller character.

But I need to handle the case where s1 and s2 are equal up to some point.

Let me consider that I iterate through the columns, and keep choosing to stay in row 1 until s1[j] > s2[j], then switch to row 2 at that j.

But I need to be careful with the indices.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and find the first j where s1[j] > s2[j-1], and switch at that point.

But I need to handle the initial switch.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns, and keep choosing to stay in row 1 until switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

But I need to decide this efficiently.

This is getting too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one where the grasshopper stays in row 1 as long as s1[j] <= s2[j-1], and switches to row 2 when s1[j] > s2[j-1].

Then, the minimal string would be s1[1..k] + s2[k..N], where k is the first j where s1[j] > s2[j-1].

But I need to handle the case where s1[j] == s2[j-1].

In that case, I need to look ahead to see which choice gives the smaller string.

This seems similar to merging two sorted arrays.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal suffix.

Let me consider that for each k from 1 to N, I have s1[1..k] + s2[k..N], and I need to find the minimal such string.

To optimize this, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are strings, and I need to find the minimal possible merge.

I can iterate through the columns, and at each step, choose to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on which choice gives the smallest possible string.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach.

Let me define dp[j][r], where j is the column index, and r is the current row (1 or 2).

dp[j][r] represents the minimal string from (1,1) to (r,j).

I can compute dp[j][1] and dp[j][2] for each j from 1 to N.

Then, the answer would be dp[N][2], since the grasshopper must end at (2,N).

But storing strings in dp is inefficient for large N.

Instead, I can store the choices that lead to the minimal string.

Wait, perhaps I can store pointers to the previous step.

But I need to optimize this.

Let me consider that at each step, I can decide to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on which choice gives the smallest possible character at that position.

I can iterate through the columns, and keep track of the current row.

Initialize in row 1.

At each column j:

- If current row is 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append s1[j]

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append s2[j]

- Choose the option with the smaller character.

- If current row is 2:

- Only option: stay in row 2, append s2[j]

But I need to consider that switching to row 2 is a one-time decision.

Wait, no, in this problem, the grasshopper can only switch from row 1 to row 2 once, but once it switches to row 2, it must stay in row 2.

So, I need to decide the column k where to switch from row 1 to row 2.

Hence, dp[j][0] represents being in row 1 at column j, and dp[j][1] represents being in row 2 at column j.

I need to compute dp[j][r] for each j from 1 to N and r from 0 to 1.

But I need to define what dp[j][r] represents.

Let me define dp[j][r] as the minimal string from (1,1) to (r,j).

Then, I can compute dp[j][0] and dp[j][1] based on dp[j-1][0] and dp[j-1][1].

Initialization:

dp[0][0] = empty string

dp[0][1] = invalid (can't be in row 2 at column 0)

Transition:

dp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0] + s1[j]

dp[j][1] = min(dp[j-1][0] + s2[j], dp[j-1][1] + s2[j])

Wait, no.

Let me think again.

Define dp[j][0]: minimal string from (1,1) to (1,j)

dp[j][1]: minimal string from (1,1) to (2,j)

Then:

dp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0] + s1[j]

dp[j][1] = min(dp[j-1][0] + s2[j], dp[j-1][1] + s2[j])

Because from (1,j-1), can move right to (1,j)

From (1,j-1), can move down to (2,j)

From (2,j-1), can move right to (2,j)

Hence, dp[j][1] can be reached from dp[j-1][0] + s2[j] or dp[j-1][1] + s2[j]

Then, the final answer is dp[N][1]

But storing strings in dp is inefficient for large N.

I need a way to compare the strings without storing them.

Perhaps I can store the choices that lead to the minimal string.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the current minimal string and the count of paths that achieve it.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize dp[0][0] = empty string, dp[0][1] = invalid

For j from 1 to N:

dp[j][0] = dp[j-1][0] + s1[j]

dp[j][1] = min(dp[j-1][0] + s2[j], dp[j-1][1] + s2[j])

Then, the minimal string is dp[N][1]

But storing strings for each dp[j][r] is too slow for large N.

I need a way to compare the strings without storing them fully.

Let me consider that at each step, I can compare the current choices based on the current characters.

I can keep track of the minimal string character by character.

Start with an empty string and build it column by column.

At each column, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on which choice gives the smaller character at that position.

But since switching to row 2 is a one-time decision, I need to decide when to switch.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the current path.

Initialize in row 1.

At each column j:

- If in row 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append s1[j]

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append s2[j]

- Choose the smaller option.

- If in row 2:

- Only option: stay in row 2, append s2[j]

But I need to handle the switching properly.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns and keep choosing the smallest possible character at each step, considering both options.

Let me try with the second test case.

n=4

s1=1101

s2=1100

Initialize current string = ''

Start at column 1:

- Option 1: stay in row 1, append '1' -> '1'

- Option 2: switch to row 2, append '1' -> '1'

- Both options give '1', so choose both.

But I need to keep track of the paths.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the possible current strings and their counts.

But it's getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the minimal string will be the one where the grasshopper stays in row 1 as long as s1[j] <= s2[j-1], and switches to row 2 when s1[j] > s2[j-1].

In the second test case:

s1=1101

s2=1100

At column 1:

s1[1]='1', s2[0]=N/A (since j-1=0), so stay in row 1.

At column 2:

s1[2]='1', s2[1]='1', equal, stay in row 1.

At column 3:

s1[3]='0', s2[2]='0', equal, stay in row 1.

At column 4:

s1[4]='1', s2[3]='0', s1[4] > s2[3], switch to row 2.

Hence, switch at column 4.

So, the minimal string is s1[1..3] + s2[3..4] = '110' + '00' = '11000'

And indeed, in the sample, it's 11000 with count=1.

This seems to work.

Let me try with the first test case:

s1=00

s2=00

At column 1:

s1[1]='0', s2[0]=N/A, stay in row 1.

At column 2:

s1[2]='0', s2[1]='0', equal, stay in row 1.

At column 2, no need to switch, so the minimal string is s1[1..2] + s2[2..2] = '00' + '0' = '000'

And indeed, in the sample, it's '000' with count=2.

Wait, but according to this approach, it's '00' + '0' = '000', which matches.

But in the sample, there are two paths that give '000'.

So, this approach seems to work.

Let me try with the third test case:

n=8

s1=00100111

s2=11101101

At column 1:

s1[1]='0', s2[0]=N/A, stay in row 1.

At column 2:

s1[2]='0', s2[1]='1', s1[2] < s2[1], stay in row 1.

At column 3:

s1[3]='1', s2[2]='1', equal, stay in row 1.

At column 4:

s1[4]='0', s2[3]='0', equal, stay in row 1.

At column 5:

s1[5]='0', s2[4]='1', s1[5] < s2[4], stay in row 1.

At column 6:

s1[6]='1', s2[5]='1', equal, stay in row 1.

At column 7:

s1[7]='1', s2[6]='0', s1[7] > s2[6], switch to row 2.

At column 8:

Stay in row 2.

Hence, the minimal string is s1[1..6] + s2[6..8] = '001001' + '0101' = '0010010101'

But according to the sample, it's '001001101' with count=4.

So, my approach gives '0010010101', but the sample has '001001101'.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that switching to row 2 affects the entire suffix.

In my approach, I switch at column 7, but perhaps I need to switch earlier or later.

Let me check the sample output: '001001101' with count=4.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the smallest among s1[1..k] + s2[k..N] for all k.

To find the minimal k, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and choose the one with the smallest concatenation.

But with N up to 2e5, this is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that I can iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

I can keep track of the current minimal string and update it as I iterate.

Wait, perhaps I can use a pointer to track the switch point.

Let me try to implement the following approach:

Initialize the switch point k to N.

This means initially, the string is s1[1..N] + s2[N..N] = s1[1..N] + s2[N], but since s2[N] is already included in s1[1..N] if not switching, it's not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to set k initially to N, meaning stay in row 1 until column N, then switch to row 2 at column N.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me consider that the minimal string is s1[1..k] + s2[k..N], and I need to find the smallest such string.

To optimize this, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

But again, this is too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that s1 and s2 are strings of length N.

I can compute the minimal possible string by choosing the smallest possible character at each position, considering the switch point.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point where s1 starts being larger than s2, and switch there.

But I need to handle the equality cases properly.

Let me consider that I iterate through the columns, and keep choosing to stay in row 1 until s1[j] > s2[j-1], then switch to row 2 at that j.

Wait, in the third test case:

s1=00100111

s2=11101101

At j=1: s1[1]='0', s2[0]=N/A, stay in row 1.

At j=2: s1[2]='0', s2[1]='1', s1[2] < s2[1], stay in row 1.

At j=3: s1[3]='1', s2[2]='1', equal, stay in row 1.

At j=4: s1[4]='0', s2[3]='0', equal, stay in row 1.

At j=5: s1[5]='0', s2[4]='1', s1[5] < s2[4], stay in row 1.

At j=6: s1[6]='1', s2[5]='1', equal, stay in row 1.

At j=7: s1[7]='1', s2[6]='0', s1[7] > s2[6], switch to row 2.

At j=8: stay in row 2.

Hence, switch at j=7.

So, the minimal string is s1[1..6] + s2[7..8] = '001001' + '01' = '00100101'

But according to the sample, it's '001001101' with count=4.

So, my approach is giving '00100101', which is smaller than the sample's '001001101'.

But the sample says '001001101' is the minimal string.

So, my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing the string.

Wait, s1[1..6] = '001001', s2[7..8] = '01', so concatenation is '00100101'.

But in the sample, it's '001001101'.

So, perhaps my approach is missing some paths.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that switching at different points can lead to different strings, and I need to choose the one that gives the smallest string.

In this case, switching at j=7 gives '00100101', which is smaller than '001001101'.

But according to the sample, '001001101' is the minimal string.

So, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that switching at j=7 gives '00100101', but there are multiple paths that give '001001101', and '00100101' is not achievable, or perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, let's see.

If I switch at j=7, the path is s1[1..6] + s2[7..8] = '001001' + '01' = '00100101'

But in the sample, the minimal string is '001001101'.

So, perhaps '00100101' is achievable, but according to the sample, it's not the minimal string.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that s2[7] is '0', but in the path '00100101', the last '1' comes from s2[8], which is '1'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misconstructing the string.

Wait, s1[1..6] = '001001', s2[7..8] = '01', so indeed '00100101'.

But according to the sample, it's '001001101'.

So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal string is the one where the grasshopper stays in row 1 as long as possible without causing a larger string.

So, I need to find the earliest column k where switching to row 2 gives a smaller string.

To do this, I can iterate through the columns from left to right, and find the first position where s1[j] > s2[j], considering that switching at j would affect the entire suffix.

But it's tricky.

Let me consider that I iterate through the columns, and at each column, I check if s1[j] > s2[j-1], and if so, switch at that j.

But in the third test case, s1[7] = '1', s2[6] = '0', so switch at j=7.

Hence, s1[1..6]
