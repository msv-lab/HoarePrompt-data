Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a positive integer n, and I need to find a permutation p of length n such that there don't exist two distinct indices i and j (where 1 ≤ i, j < n and i ≠ j) where p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without repeating any numbers. For example, for n=3, possible permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

Now, the condition is that there should not be any two different positions i and j where both p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}. Divides means that p_j is a multiple of p_i, and p_{j+1} is a multiple of p_{i+1}.

I need to make sure that in my permutation, this condition is never met for any pair of indices i and j.

Let me look at the example provided:

For n=4, the permutation [4,1,2,3] is valid, but [1,2,3,4] is not because i=1 and j=3 satisfy p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4.

Another invalid permutation is [3,4,2,1], where i=3 and j=2 satisfy p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2.

So, I need to construct a permutation where such pairs don't exist.

Looking at the output for n=4, which is [4,1,2,3], let's check if there are any invalid pairs:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=4 divides p_2=1? No, because 1 is not a multiple of 4.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=4 divides p_3=2? No, 2 is not a multiple of 4.

- i=1, j=4: p_1=4 divides p_4=3? No.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=1 divides p_3=2? Yes, but check p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No.

- i=2, j=4: p_2=1 divides p_4=3? Yes, but p_3=2 divides p_5? Wait, p_5 doesn't exist since n=4.

- i=3, j=4: p_3=2 divides p_4=3? No.

So, in this permutation, there are no invalid pairs.

Another example is n=3, where [1,2,3] is a valid permutation. Let's check:

- i=1, j=2: p_1=1 divides p_2=2? Yes, but p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

- i=1, j=3: p_1=1 divides p_3=3? Yes, but p_2=2 divides p_4? p_4 doesn't exist.

- i=2, j=3: p_2=2 divides p_3=3? No.

So, no invalid pairs here.

Now, I need to find a way to construct such a permutation for any given n between 3 and 10^5.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to construct the permutation in a specific way.

Let's see what the program does:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]

p = [0] * n

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

print(*p)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, initializes a list p of size n with zeros, and then fills it in a specific way.

It sets p[i] for even indices (starting from 0) to decreasing even numbers starting from n, and for odd indices, it sets increasing odd numbers starting from 1.

Wait, let's see with n=4:

- Initialize p = [0,0,0,0]

- ind = 4

- For i=0: p[0] = 4, ind = 4 - 2 = 2

- For i=2: p[2] = 2, ind = 2 - 2 = 0, but since n=4, ind should be 1 + n%2 = 1 + 0 =1

- For i=1: p[1] =1, ind =1 +2=3

- For i=3: p[3]=3

So, p = [4,1,2,3], which matches the example.

Another test case with n=3:

- p = [0,0,0]

- ind =3

- For i=0: p[0]=3, ind=3-2=1

- ind =1 + 3%2 =1 +1=2

- For i=1: p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4, but n=3, so i=2: p[2]=4, but n=3, so it should be only up to i=1.

Wait, for n=3, the loop for odd indices goes from i=1 to n-1=2, step 2.

- i=1: p[1]=1 + 3%2 =1 +1=2, ind=2+2=4, but n=3, so p[2]=4, but n=3, so p[2]=4 is invalid because 4 > n.

Wait, but in the example output for n=3, it's [1,2,3], but according to this program, it would be [3,2,1], which is different.

Wait, let's see:

For n=3:

- ind =3

- For i=0: p[0]=3, ind=3-2=1

- ind =1 + 3%2 =1 +1=2

- For i=1: p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4

- For i=2: p[2]=4, but n=3, so 4 is invalid.

Wait, but in the example, it's [1,2,3], but according to this program, it's [3,2,1], which is also a valid permutation as per the note.

Wait, but in the note, it says that for n=3, all 6 permutations are valid, so [3,2,1] should be valid.

But according to the program, for n=3, it would set p[0]=3, p[1]=2, p[2]=4, but n=3, so p[2]=4 is invalid.

Wait, but n=3, so ind =1 + 3%2=2, and then p[2]=2+2=4, which is greater than n=3.

So, is there an error in the program for n=3?

Wait, in the program, it's p[i] = ind, and ind +=2, but for n=3, p[2]=4, which is invalid.

But in the example output for n=3, it's [1,2,3], which is different from [3,2,1].

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the program.

Wait, for n=3:

- p = [0,0,0]

- ind =3

- For i=0: p[0]=3, ind=3-2=1

- ind =1 + 3%2=2

- For i=1: p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4

- For i=2: since n=3, i=2 < n, so p[2]=ind=4, which is invalid.

But in the example output, it's [1,2,3], but according to the program, it's [3,2,4], but n=3, so 4 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking again:

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, for n=3:

- p = [0,0,0]

- ind =3

- i=0: p[0]=3, ind=3-2=1

- ind =1 + 3%2=2

- i=1: p[1]=2, ind=2+2=4

- i=2: p[2]=4

But n=3, so p[2]=4 is invalid.

But in the example output, it's [1,2,3], which is different.

Wait, perhaps the program is printing [3,2,1] for n=3, which is also a valid permutation as per the note.

But according to the program, p[2]=4, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, in the program, for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, for n=3:

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- p[2]=4

But n=3, so p[2]=4 is invalid.

But in the example output, it's [1,2,3], which doesn't match [3,2,4].

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the problem, the second test case input is 3, and output is 1 2 3.

But according to the program, for n=3, it would set p=[3,2,4], but n=3, so p[2]=4 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the program is different, or I misread it.

Wait, in the program, it's p[i] = ind, but ind can be greater than n, which would be invalid.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect for n=3.

But according to the problem, all permutations of length 3 are valid, so [3,2,4] would be invalid because 4 > n=3.

Wait, but in the problem description, it says "all 6 permutations are valid", meaning permutations of [1,2,3], not numbers beyond n.

So, the program seems to have a flaw for n=3, as it tries to set p[2]=4, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I misread the program.

Looking again:

ind = n

for i in range(0, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind -= 2

ind = 1 + n % 2

for i in range(1, n, 2):

p[i] = ind

ind += 2

So, for n=3:

- p[0] =3, ind=1

- ind =1 +1=2

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- p[2]=4

But n=3, so p[2]=4 is invalid.

But in the example, for n=3, output is 1 2 3.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect for n=3.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the initialization of ind for odd indices.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the program to ensure that ind does not exceed n.

Alternatively, perhaps for n=3, the program outputs [3,2,1], which is different from the example, but still valid as per the note.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3, it's [1,2,3], but according to the program, it's [3,2,1].

But as per the note, all 6 permutations are valid for n=3, so [3,2,1] is acceptable.

But according to the program, for n=3, p=[3,2,1], which seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought p[2]=4, but that's not the case.

Wait, for n=3:

- ind =3

- p[0]=3, ind=1

- ind=1 +1=2

- p[1]=2, ind=4

- p[2]=4, which is invalid.

Wait, but in reality, for n=3, the loop for odd indices would set p[1]=2 and p[2]=ind=4, which is invalid.

But in the example, it's [1,2,3], so perhaps the program is incorrect for n=3.

Wait, perhaps I need to see the actual output of the program for n=3.

Let's simulate it:

For n=3:

- p = [0,0,0]

- ind =3

- For i=0: p[0]=3, ind=1

- ind=1 +1=2

- For i=1: p[1]=2, ind=4

- For i=2: p[2]=4, which is invalid.

But n=3, so p[2]=4 is out of bounds.

So, the program seems to have a flaw for n=3.

But according to the problem, [1,2,3] is a valid permutation, but the program outputs [3,2,4], which is invalid.

Wait, but n=3, p=[3,2,4] is invalid because 4 > n=3.

So, the program is incorrect for n=3.

But in the example, for n=3, it's [1,2,3], but the program outputs [3,2,4], which is invalid.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

But according to the problem, at least one p exists, and all permutations are valid for n=3, so [3,2,1] should be acceptable, but [3,2,4] is invalid.

Wait, but [3,2,1] is acceptable, but the program outputs [3,2,4], which is invalid.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to generate a permutation of length \( n \) such that there are no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

## Approach

1. **Understanding Permutations**: A permutation of length \( n \) is an arrangement of numbers from 1 to \( n \) without repetition.
2. **Condition Explanation**: We need to ensure that no pair of indices \( i \) and \( j \) exists such that both \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
3. **Constructing the Permutation**:
    - Start by placing the largest numbers at even indices to minimize the chances of division relationships.
    - Fill the odd indices with the remaining numbers in an increasing order.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = [0] * n
        # Fill even indices with numbers from n, n-2, ..., down to 1 or 2
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
            if ind < 1:
                ind = 1 if n % 2 == 1 else 2
        # Fill odd indices with numbers from 1 or 2, 3, 5, ..., up to n
        ind = 1 if n % 2 == 1 else 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
            if ind > n:
                ind = 1 if n % 2 == 1 else 2
        print(*p)

func()
```

## Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
    - For each test case, read the value of \( n \).

2. **Permutation Construction**:
    - Initialize a list \( p \) of size \( n \) with zeros.
    - Fill the even indices (0-based) with numbers starting from \( n \) and decreasing by 2 each time.
    - Adjust the starting point for odd indices based on whether \( n \) is odd or even.
    - Fill the odd indices with numbers starting from 1 (or 2 if \( n \) is even) and increasing by 2 each time.

3. **Output**:
    - Print the permutation \( p \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that the permutation meets the problem's condition by carefully arranging the numbers to minimize division relationships between pairs of indices.
