Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n possible outcomes in a game, and for each outcome, there's a multiplier k_i. I need to bet some integer amount x_i on each outcome. The goal is to distribute my bets in such a way that no matter which outcome wins, the money I get back is more than the total amount I bet.

Let me try to rephrase that to make sure I understand. I have to choose bets x1, x2, ..., xn for n outcomes. Each outcome has a multiplier k_i, meaning if outcome i wins, I get back k_i * x_i coins. I want this amount to be greater than the total coins I bet, which is x1 + x2 + ... + xn, no matter which outcome wins.

So, for every i from 1 to n, I need k_i * x_i > sum of all x_j for j from 1 to n.

That seems tricky. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a set of x_i's that satisfy these inequalities for all i.

Let me consider the inequalities:

For each i:

k_i * x_i > sum_{j=1 to n} x_j

Since sum_{j=1 to n} x_j = x1 + x2 + ... + xn, I can write:

k_i * x_i > x1 + x2 + ... + xn for each i.

This needs to hold for all i simultaneously.

This seems like a system of inequalities that the x_i's must satisfy.

I need to find positive integer solutions x_i that satisfy all these inequalities at the same time.

Hmm, maybe there's a way to find a common multiple or something like that.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I fix the sum S = x1 + x2 + ... + xn.

Then, for each i, I need k_i * x_i > S.

But since S = x1 + x2 + ... + xn, I can substitute:

k_i * x_i > x1 + x2 + ... + xn.

This can be rewritten as:

k_i * x_i > S.

But S is the sum of all x_j's, including x_i.

So, k_i * x_i > S = x1 + x2 + ... + xn.

I can rearrange this to:

k_i * x_i - x_i > S - x_i

Which simplifies to:

x_i * (k_i - 1) > S - x_i.

Wait, that seems a bit circular. Maybe I should try to express x_i in terms of S.

Let me solve for x_i in terms of S.

From k_i * x_i > S, I can write x_i > S / k_i.

But since x_i must be integers, x_i >= ceil(S / k_i).

But I also have S = sum of all x_j's.

This seems like a system of inequalities that might be hard to solve directly.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think about the least common multiple or something related to the multipliers.

Wait, in the code provided, it seems to be calculating something related to the least common multiple or something similar.

Let me look at the code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and the list of k_i's.

Then, it sets m = 1, and multiplies m by each k_i.

So, m is the product of all k_i's.

Then, it creates a list c, where each c[i] = m / k[i].

Wait, m is the product of all k_i's, so m / k_i is the product of all k_j's except k_i.

Interesting, that's like the product of all k_j for j != i.

Then, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all c[i]'s using func_1, which is just the GCD of the list c.

Then, it divides each c[i] by this HCF (which is the GCD).

Then, it checks if the sum of the new c[i]'s is greater than or equal to m / HCF.

If it is, it prints -1, else it prints the c[i]'s.

Wait, I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about what's happening here.

So, c[i] = m / k_i, where m is the product of all k_j's.

Then, HCF is the GCD of all c[i]'s.

Then, it divides each c[i] by HCF to get the final c[i].

Then, it checks if sum(c[i]) >= m / HCF.

If yes, it's impossible; else, it's possible, and the solution is the c[i]'s.

I need to see if this makes sense.

Let me consider a simple example.

Take n=2, k1=2, k2=2.

So, m = 2 * 2 = 4.

c1 = 4 / 2 = 2

c2 = 4 / 2 = 2

HCF of [2,2] is 2.

Then, c1 = 2 / 2 = 1

c2 = 2 / 2 = 1

Sum(c[i]) = 1 + 1 = 2

m / HCF = 4 / 2 = 2

So, sum(c[i]) = m / HCF = 2.

According to the code, since sum(c[i]) >= m / HCF, it prints -1.

But according to the problem, in this case, betting 1 coin on each outcome should work.

Because total bet is 2 coins.

If outcome 1 wins, get back 2 * 1 = 2 coins, which is equal to total bet, but the problem requires strictly greater than the total bet.

So, 2 > 2 is false, so it should be invalid.

Wait, but the example output shows "1 1" for this case, but in the explanation, it says "one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes."

Wait, but according to the problem, it should be strictly greater than the total bet.

Wait, in the second test case of the example, it's n=2, k=3 3, and output is "1 1", but according to my calculation, with k=3,3:

m = 3*3=9

c1=9/3=3

c2=9/3=3

HCF=3

c1=3/3=1

c2=3/3=1

sum(c[i])=2

m/HCF=9/3=3

2 < 3, so according to the code, it should output "1 1", which matches the example.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation with k=2,2, sum(c[i])=2 and m/HCF=2, so sum(c[i]) >= m/HCF, which should print -1.

But in the example, for k=3,3, sum(c[i])=2 and m/HCF=3, so 2 < 3, hence "1 1" is output.

So, in the first case with k=2,2, it should print -1, because sum(c[i])=2 >= m/HCF=2.

Wait, but in the problem's example, for n=2, k=3 3, it outputs "1 1", which is correct, because sum=2 and m/HCF=3, 2 < 3.

But for n=3, k=6 3 2, it outputs -1, which is correct.

Wait, but what about n=2, k=2 2? Let's see.

If n=2, k=2 2:

m=2*2=4

c1=4/2=2

c2=4/2=2

HCF=2

c1=2/2=1

c2=2/2=1

sum(c[i])=2

m/HCF=4/2=2

sum(c[i])=2 >= 2, so print -1, which is correct, because with x1=1, x2=1, total bet=2, but k*x=2*1=2, which is not greater than 2.

Hence, no solution exists for k=2,2.

So, the code seems to be correctly identifying when a solution exists.

Now, let's see why this works.

The idea seems to be based on finding a solution where x_i = m / (k_i * HCF), where m is the product of all k_j's and HCF is the GCD of all m/k_i.

Wait, in the code, it's c[i] = m / k[i], then c[i] = c[i] / HCF.

So, x_i = c[i] / HCF.

Wait, no, c[i] = m / k[i], then c[i] = c[i] / HCF.

So, x_i = c[i] / HCF.

Wait, no, c[i] is set to m / k[i], then divided by HCF.

So, x_i = c[i] after dividing by HCF.

Wait, in the code, it's c.append(int(m / k[i])), then hcf = func_1(c), then c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf).

So, x_i = c[i] after dividing by HCF.

Hence, x_i = (m / k_i) / HCF.

But m is the product of all k_j's.

And HCF is the GCD of all m / k_i.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to see this.

Let me consider that m is the product of all k_j's.

Then, m / k_i is the product of all k_j's except k_i.

Then, HCF is the GCD of all such m / k_i.

So, HCF is the GCD of the products of all k_j's except k_i, for all i.

This seems related to the least common multiple or something similar.

Wait, perhaps it's finding the least solution where x_i are proportional to the product of all k_j's divided by k_i.

Wait, maybe it's based on the idea of making x_i proportional to the product of all k_j's divided by k_i.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the Chinese Remainder Theorem or something.

Alternatively, maybe it's based on the idea of making x_i such that k_i * x_i is equal to some constant for all i.

Wait, if I set k_i * x_i = L for all i, where L is some common multiple.

Then, x_i = L / k_i.

But x_i must be integers, so L must be a multiple of k_i for all i.

Hence, L must be the least common multiple of all k_i's.

Wait, but in this code, m is the product of all k_i's, which is one possible multiple, but not necessarily the least common multiple.

Wait, perhaps that's what's happening here.

The code sets m as the product of all k_i's, which is a multiple of each k_i, but not necessarily the least common multiple.

Then, c[i] = m / k_i.

Then, HCF is the GCD of all c[i]'s.

Then, x_i = c[i] / HCF.

So, x_i = (m / k_i) / HCF.

Now, I need to see if this choice of x_i satisfies the condition k_i * x_i > sum(x_j).

Given that L = m / HCF, then x_i = (m / k_i) / HCF = (L / k_i).

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of L being a multiple of all k_i's.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider the sum of x_j's.

sum(x_j) = sum_{j=1 to n} (m / k_j) / HCF.

Now, for each i, k_i * x_i = k_i * ((m / k_i) / HCF) = m / HCF.

So, k_i * x_i = m / HCF for all i.

Then, the condition is m / HCF > sum(x_j).

But sum(x_j) = sum_{j=1 to n} (m / k_j) / HCF.

So, m / HCF > sum_{j=1 to n} (m / k_j) / HCF.

Multiply both sides by HCF/m (assuming m > 0, HCF > 0):

1 > sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j).

So, the condition simplifies to sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1.

Is that what the code is checking?

Wait, in the code, it checks if sum(c[i]) >= m / HCF.

But sum(c[i]) = sum_{j=1 to n} (m / k_j) / HCF = (m / HCF) * sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j).

And m / HCF = L, as defined earlier.

So, sum(c[i]) = L * sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j).

The code checks if sum(c[i]) >= m / HCF, which is L.

So, L * sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) >= L.

Dividing both sides by L (assuming L > 0):

sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) >= 1.

So, if sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) >= 1, it prints -1, else it prints the x_i's.

Wait a minute, but according to my earlier derivation, the condition should be sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1 for the solution to exist.

But the code checks if sum(c[i]) >= m / HCF, which is equivalent to sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) >= 1, and if so, prints -1, else prints the x_i's.

So, it aligns with the condition sum_{j=1 to n} (1 / k_j) < 1 for a solution to exist.

Wait, but in the first test case of the example:

n=3, k=[3,2,7]

sum(1/k_j) = 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/7 = (14 + 21 + 6)/42 = 41/42 < 1, so solution exists.

n=2, k=[3,3]

sum(1/k_j) = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3 < 1, solution exists.

n=5, k=[5,5,5,5,5]

sum(1/k_j) = 5*(1/5) = 1, so sum=1, hence -1.

n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

sum(1/k_j) = 1/7 + 1/9 + 1/3 + 1/17 + 1/9 + 1/13.

Let's calculate:

1/7 ≈ 0.1429

1/9 ≈ 0.1111

1/3 ≈ 0.3333

1/17 ≈ 0.0588

1/9 ≈ 0.1111

1/13 ≈ 0.0769

Sum ≈ 0.1429 + 0.1111 + 0.3333 + 0.0588 + 0.1111 + 0.0769 ≈ 0.8341 < 1, so solution exists.

n=3, k=[6,3,2]

sum(1/k_j) = 1/6 + 1/3 + 1/2 = 1/6 + 2/6 + 3/6 = 6/6 = 1, so -1.

n=5, k=[9,4,6,8,3]

sum(1/k_j) = 1/9 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/3.

Let's calculate:

1/9 ≈ 0.1111

1/4 = 0.25

1/6 ≈ 0.1667

1/8 = 0.125

1/3 ≈ 0.3333

Sum ≈ 0.1111 + 0.25 + 0.1667 + 0.125 + 0.3333 ≈ 0.9861 < 1, so solution exists.

Wait, but in the example output, for n=5, k=[9,4,6,8,3], it outputs "8 18 12 9 24".

Let's check:

sum(1/k_j) = 1/9 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/3 ≈ 0.1111 + 0.25 + 0.1667 + 0.125 + 0.3333 = 0.9861 < 1, so solution exists.

Hence, the condition sum(1/k_j) < 1 is correct.

So, the code is correctly checking this condition.

Now, let's see how it calculates the x_i's.

It sets m = product of all k_j's.

Then, c[i] = m / k_i.

Then, HCF = GCD of all c[i]'s.

Then, x_i = c[i] / HCF.

So, x_i = (m / k_i) / HCF.

Now, m is the product of all k_j's.

HCF is the GCD of m / k_i for all i.

So, HCF is the GCD of the products of all k_j's except k_i.

I need to see if this HCF is correctly calculated.

In the first test case, n=3, k=[3,2,7]

m = 3*2*7 = 42

c1 = 42 / 3 = 14

c2 = 42 / 2 = 21

c3 = 42 / 7 = 6

HCF = GCD(14,21,6) = 1

x1 = 14 / 1 = 14

x2 = 21 / 1 = 21

x3 = 6 / 1 = 6

But in the example, it outputs "27 41 12" for this case.

Wait, that doesn't match. So, perhaps the code is not correctly calculating the x_i's.

Wait, perhaps there's a scaling factor or something.

Wait, in the code, it's c.append(int(m / k[i])), then hcf = func_1(c), then c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf).

Then, it prints the c[i]'s.

But in the example, for n=3, k=3 2 7, it outputs "27 41 12", but according to my calculation, it should output "14 21 6".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the code is using a different approach.

Let me check the code again.

The code is:

from math import gcd

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

k = list(map(int, input().split()))

m = 1

for i in range(n):

m = m * k[i]

c = []

for i in range(n):

c.append(int(m / k[i]))

hcf = func_1(c)

for i in range(n):

c[i] = int(c[i] / hcf)

if sum(c) >= m / hcf:

print(-1)

else:

for i in range(n):

print(c[i], end=' ')

print('')

def func_1(numbers):

hcf = numbers[0]

for num in numbers[1:]:

hcf = gcd(hcf, num)

return hcf

Wait, in the first test case, n=3, k=[3,2,7]

m = 3*2*7 = 42

c = [42/3=14, 42/2=21, 42/7=6]

hcf = GCD(14,21,6) = 1

c = [14/1=14, 21/1=21, 6/1=6]

sum(c) = 14+21+6=41

m/hcf = 42/1=42

41 < 42, so it should output "14 21 6"

But in the example, it outputs "27 41 12"

So, either the code is incorrect, or there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the code is not optimal, and there are multiple solutions.

But in the example, for n=3, k=3 2 7, it outputs "27 41 12"

Let's check if this is a valid solution.

Total bet: 27 + 41 + 12 = 80

If outcome 1 wins: 3*27 = 81 > 80

Outcome 2 wins: 2*41 = 82 > 80

Outcome 3 wins: 7*12 = 84 > 80

So, it's a valid solution.

But according to the code, it should output "14 21 6", which also seems valid:

Total bet: 14 + 21 + 6 = 41

Outcome 1: 3*14 = 42 > 41

Outcome 2: 2*21 = 42 > 41

Outcome 3: 7*6 = 42 > 41

So, both "14 21 6" and "27 41 12" are valid solutions.

Perhaps the code is not producing the smallest possible x_i's.

Wait, but in the example, it's outputting "27 41 12" instead of "14 21 6".

So, maybe there's something else going on here.

Wait, perhaps the code is scaling the x_i's by some factor.

Wait, if I multiply "14 21 6" by 2, I get "28 42 12", which is close to "27 41 12".

Wait, maybe it's not exactly multiplying by 2.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach.

Let me consider that the multipliers are not necessarily distinct.

Wait, in the second test case, n=2, k=3 3

m=3*3=9

c=[9/3=3, 9/3=3]

hcf=3

c=[3/3=1, 3/3=1]

sum(c)=2

m/hcf=9/3=3

2 < 3, so output "1 1"

Which matches the example.

In the third test case, n=5, k=5 5 5 5 5

m=5^5=3125

c=[3125/5=625, 625, 625, 625, 625]

hcf=625

c=[625/625=1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

sum(c)=5

m/hcf=3125/625=5

5 >= 5, so print -1

Which matches the example.

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=7 9 3 17 9 13

m=7*9*3*17*9*13= (let's calculate)

7*9=63

63*3=189

189*17=3213

3213*9=28917

28917*13=375921

c=[375921/7=53703, 375921/9=41769, 375921/3=125307, 375921/17=22113, 375921/9=41769, 375921/13=28917]

hcf=GCD of these numbers.

Assuming hcf is 1, then c=[53703,41769,125307,22113,41769,28917]

sum(c)=53703+41769+125307+22113+41769+28917= ?

Let's add them up:

53703 + 41769 = 95472

95472 + 125307 = 220779

220779 + 22113 = 242892

242892 + 41769 = 284661

284661 + 28917 = 313578

m/hcf=375921/1=375921

313578 < 375921, so output the c[i]'s.

But in the example, it outputs "1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071"

Which are different from what I calculated.

So, either the code is incorrect or there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the code is scaling the c[i]'s by dividing by some factor.

Wait, let's see:

In the fourth test case, n=6, k=[7,9,3,17,9,13]

m=7*9*3*17*9*13=375921

c=[375921/7=53703, 375921/9=41769, 375921/3=125307, 375921/17=22113, 375921/9=41769, 375921/13=28917]

hcf=GCD(53703,41769,125307,22113,41769,28917)

Need to find GCD of these numbers.

Let's see, 53703 and 41769.

Compute GCD(53703,41769).

Well, 53703 mod 41769 = 53703 - 41769 = 11934

GCD(41769,11934)

41769 mod 11934 = 41769 - 3*11934 = 41769 - 35802 = 5967

GCD(11934,5967)

11934 / 5967 = 2, no remainder, so GCD is 5967.

Now, check GCD(5967,125307)

125307 / 5967 = 20.99, remainder 125307 - 20*5967 = 125307 - 119340 = 5967

So, GCD is 5967.

Next, GCD(5967,22113)

22113 / 5967 = 3.7, remainder 22113 - 3*5967 = 22113 - 17901 = 4212

GCD(5967,4212)

5967 / 4212 = 1, remainder 5967 - 4212 = 1755

GCD(4212,1755)

4212 / 1755 = 2, remainder 4212 - 2*1755 = 4212 - 3510 = 702

GCD(1755,702)

1755 / 702 = 2, remainder 1755 - 1404 = 351

GCD(702,351)=351

Now, GCD(351,41769)

41769 / 351 = 119, remainder 41769 - 119*351 = 41769 - 41769 = 0

So, GCD is 351.

Finally, GCD(351,28917)

28917 / 351 = 82, remainder 28917 - 82*351 = 28917 - 28782 = 135

GCD(351,135)

351 / 135 = 2, remainder 351 - 270 = 81

GCD(135,81)

135 / 81 = 1, remainder 135 - 81 = 54

GCD(81,54)

81 / 54 = 1, remainder 81 - 54 = 27

GCD(54,27)=27

So, hcf=27

Then, c[i] = [53703/27=1989, 41769/27=1547, 125307/27=4641, 22113/27=819, 41769/27=1547, 28917/27=1071]

Which matches the example output "1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071"

So, the code is correctly calculating the x_i's.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how to distribute coins among various outcomes in a game such that, regardless of which outcome wins, the player ends up with more coins than they initially bet. This requires careful calculation to ensure that the conditions are met for all possible winning outcomes.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Requirements**:
    - For each outcome `i`, there is a multiplier `k_i`. If outcome `i` wins, the player receives `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
    - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)` for all `i`.
    - We need `k_i * x_i > sum(x_j)` for all `i`, meaning the payout for any winning outcome must exceed the total bet.

2. **Key Insight**:
    - We need to find integer values for `x_i` such that for each `i`, `k_i * x_i` is greater than the sum of all `x_j` including `x_i`.
    - This can be approached by ensuring that the payout for each outcome exceeds the total bet.

3. **Algorithm**:
    - Calculate the product of all `k_i`, denoted as `m`.
    - For each outcome `i`, compute `c_i = m / k_i`.
    - Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all `c_i`, denoted as `hcf`.
    - Divide each `c_i` by `hcf` to get the bet amounts `x_i`.
    - Check if the sum of these `x_i` is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, print the `x_i`; otherwise, print `-1`.

## Solution Code

```python
from math import gcd

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        k = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        m = 1
        for num in k:
            m *= num
        c = []
        for num in k:
            c.append(m // num)
        hcf = c[0]
        for num in c[1:]:
            hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        for i in range(n):
            c[i] //= hcf
        if sum(c) >= m // hcf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(' '.join(map(str, c)))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step Execution**:
  1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Read the number of outcomes `n`.
     - Read the multipliers `k` for each outcome.
     - Compute the product of all `k_i` as `m`.
     - Compute `c_i = m / k_i` for each `i`.
     - Compute the GCD (`hcf`) of all `c_i`.
     - Normalize the bets by dividing each `c_i` by `hcf`.
     - Check if the sum of normalized `c_i` is less than `m / hcf`. If so, print the normalized `c_i`; otherwise, print `-1`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The algorithm efficiently computes the required bets using GCD and basic arithmetic operations.
  - It ensures that the solution, if it exists, satisfies the problem constraints and is computationally feasible given the constraints on `n` and `k_i`.

- **Correctness**:
  - The approach ensures that for each outcome, the payout exceeds the total bet by leveraging the properties of the least common multiple and GCD.
  - The solution is verified against the provided sample inputs and outputs, ensuring its correctness.
