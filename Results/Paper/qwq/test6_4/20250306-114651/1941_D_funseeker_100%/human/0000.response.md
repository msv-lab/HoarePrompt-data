Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. They play a game where they throw a ball to each other based on some rules. The ball starts with player x, and there are m throws. Each throw has a distance r_i and a direction c_i, which can be clockwise ('0'), counterclockwise ('1'), or unknown ('?'). My task is to figure out all possible players who could have the ball after m throws, given that some directions are unknown.

First, I need to understand the setup. The players are in a circle, so the concept of distance is modular. For example, if n=6 and a player throws the ball clockwise by 2, player 1 would pass to player 3, player 2 to player 4, and so on. Similarly, counterclockwise by 2 would mean player 1 passes to player 5, player 2 to player 6, etc.

The problem is that some directions are unknown, represented by '?', which means the throw could be either clockwise or counterclockwise. So, for each throw with an unknown direction, the ball could go in either direction.

My goal is to find all possible players who could have the ball after all m throws, considering all possible combinations of directions for the unknown throws.

Let's think about how to approach this.

One way is to simulate all possible sequences of directions for the unknown throws and track where the ball ends up for each sequence. However, if there are many '?' directions, this could become computationally expensive, as the number of possible sequences is 2^k, where k is the number of unknown throws.

Given that m can be up to 1000 and t (the number of test cases) is up to 10^4, with n*m <= 2*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

I need to find a way to efficiently compute the possible positions of the ball after m throws, considering the unknown directions.

Let me consider the positions modulo n. Since the players are in a circle, moving clockwise by r is equivalent to adding r modulo n, and counterclockwise is equivalent to subtracting r modulo n.

However, there's a catch with player numbering: players are numbered from 1 to n, but in programming, indices often start at 0. So, I need to be careful with modulo operations to map between 1-based and 0-based indexing.

Wait, in the code provided, I see that the player numbers are from 1 to n, and in the code, they are directly used without adjusting for 0-based indexing. I need to verify if this is handled correctly.

In the code, ans = {x}, which initializes a set with the starting player x. Then, for each throw, it processes the throw based on the direction c.

If c is '0' or '?', it adds (q + r) % n to the temporary set.

If c is '1' or '?', it adds (q - r) % n to the temporary set.

After all throws, it checks if 0 is in ans, because players are numbered from 1 to n, and 0 would correspond to player n in modulo n.

Then, it prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of those players.

This seems mostly correct, but I need to verify if the modulo operations are handled properly.

Let's consider an example to check.

Take n=6, m=3, x=2, and all r_i=2 with c_i='?' for all throws.

According to the problem, after each throw, the ball can go either clockwise or counterclockwise by 2 positions.

So, after the first throw, from 2, it can go to (2+2)%6=4 or (2-2)%6=0, but 0 corresponds to player 6.

After the second throw, from 4: to 6 or 2; from 6: to 4 or 6.

After the third throw: from 6: to 4 or 6; from 4: to 2 or 6; from 2: to 4 or 6.

So possible final positions are 2,4,6.

According to the code, it should correctly compute this.

Another example: n=12, m=1, x=2, r=3, c='1'.

This means the throw is counterclockwise by 3, so from 2, it goes to (2-3)%12=11.

So, ans should be {11}.

The code should handle this correctly.

Now, consider n=10, m=7, x=4, with various r_i and c_i.

I need to ensure that the code correctly computes the possible positions after all throws.

I need to check if there are any edge cases that the code might not handle correctly.

One potential issue is when n=2, since n can be as small as 2.

For example, n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='?'.

Then, from 1, it can go to (1+1)%2=0, which corresponds to player 2, or (1-1)%2=0, again player 2.

So, ans={2}.

Another case: n=4, m=1, x=1, r=2, c='0'.

Then, it goes clockwise by 2, so (1+2)%4=3.

ans={3}.

Seems correct.

Wait, but in the code, after computing ans, it checks if 0 is in ans, and if so, discards 0 and adds n.

In the first example with n=6, m=3, x=2, r=2, c='?', the possible positions are 2,4,6.

But in the code, if (q + r) % n or (q - r) % n is 0, it's treated as player n.

In the first example, (2 - 2) % 6 = 0, which should be player 6.

Then, from 4: (4 - 2) % 6 = 2, (4 + 2) % 6 = 0 (player 6)

From 6: (6 - 2) % 6 = 4, (6 + 2) % 6 = 0 (player 6)

So, ans={2,4,6}, which matches the expected output.

In the code, it seems to handle this correctly.

Now, is there any case where this might not work?

Wait, what if n=1, but according to constraints, n >= 2, so n=1 is not possible.

Another potential issue: what if r_i = n-1 and c='?'.

For example, n=4, m=1, x=1, r=3, c='?'.

Then, clockwise: (1+3)%4=0 -> player 4

Counterclockwise: (1-3)%4=2

So, ans={2,4}

Which is correct.

Another case: n=5, m=3, x=1, r=4, c='0' for all throws.

So, each throw is clockwise by 4.

After first throw: (1+4)%5=0 -> player 5

Second throw: (5+4)%5=4

Third throw: (4+4)%5=3

So, ans={3}

But according to the code, it would correctly compute this.

Wait, but in this case, c='0', so only clockwise direction is considered.

Seems correct.

Now, let's look at the code structure.

The code reads t test cases, then for each test case, reads n, m, x, then m lines of r and c.

It uses a set to keep track of possible positions.

For each throw, it creates a temporary set and adds possible new positions based on the direction.

Finally, it updates ans to be the temporary set.

After all throws, it checks if 0 is in ans, discards it, and adds n instead.

Then, it prints the number of players in ans and the sorted list of players.

This seems correct.

But I need to make sure that the modulo operation is handled properly.

In Python, negative numbers modulo n still give a positive result.

For example, (1 - 3) % 4 = (-2) % 4 = 2

So, that seems fine.

Also, player numbers are from 1 to n, and 0 corresponds to player n.

Wait, but in the code, it checks if 0 is in ans, discards it, and adds n.

This is correct because in modulo n, 0 corresponds to player n.

For example, in n=5, player 5 is represented as 0 in modulo 5.

Wait, but in the earlier example with n=6, m=3, x=2, r=2, c='?', the positions are 2,4,6.

In the code, (2 - 2) % 6 = 0, which is player 6.

So, ans={0,2,4}

Then, it discards 0 and adds 6, so ans={2,4,6}

Which is correct.

Seems like this handling is correct.

Now, is there any case where this might fail?

Wait, what if n=2, m=1, x=1, r=1, c='0'.

Clockwise by 1: (1+1)%2=0, which is player 2.

So, ans={0}, then discard 0 and add 2, so ans={2}

Which is correct.

Another case: n=4, m=2, x=1, r=2, c='?'

First throw: from 1, can go to (1+2)%4=3 or (1-2)%4=3

Wait, (1-2)%4=3, so ans={3}

Second throw: from 3, can go to (3+2)%4=1 or (3-2)%4=1

So, ans={1}

Which is correct.

Wait, but according to the code, it would consider both directions for each throw, so it should handle this correctly.

Now, I need to check if the code handles multiple '?' correctly, i.e., exponential growth in possibilities.

But since n and m can be up to 1000 and t up to 10^4, with n*m <= 2*10^5, it should be efficient enough, especially since using a set to track possible positions.

Wait, but sets in Python are efficient, and with n up to 1000, and m up to 1000, and t up to 10^4, but n*m <= 2*10^5, it should be manageable.

Now, I need to check if there are any off-by-one errors or misinterpretations of the problem.

One thing to note is that players are numbered from 1 to n, and in the code, modulo n is used, which maps 0 to player n.

I need to ensure that this mapping is correct.

For example, in n=5, players are 1,2,3,4,5.

(1 -1)%5 = 0, which is player 5

(2 -2)%5 = 0, player 5

(3 -3)%5 = 0, player 5

(4 -4)%5 = 0, player 5

(5 -5)%5 = 0, player 5

So, 0 always corresponds to player n.

Hence, the handling in the code seems correct.

Another thing to check is if multiple additions to the set are handled correctly.

Since sets automatically handle duplicates, it should be fine.

Now, let's look at the provided code.

def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

This seems straightforward.

But I need to make sure that there are no corner cases where this might fail.

For example, what if all throws have c='0' or c='1', no '?'

Then, it should correctly follow the specified directions.

What if m=0, but according to constraints, m >=1, so m=0 is not possible.

What if n=2, m=1000, with various c_i.

It should handle large m correctly, but since n is small, the set won't grow too much.

Another thing to check is if r_i can be 0, but according to constraints, 1 <= r_i <= n-1, so r_i >=1.

Good.

I think the code is correctly implementing the required logic.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the possible positions of a ball after a series of throws in a circle of players, where some throw directions are unknown.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start with the initial position of the ball, `x`.
   
2. **Simulate Throws**:
   - For each throw, based on the direction (`0`, `1`, or `?`), calculate the possible new positions:
     - If direction is `0` (clockwise) or `?`, add `(current_position + r) % n` to the possible positions.
     - If direction is `1` (counterclockwise) or `?`, add `(current_position - r) % n` to the possible positions.
   
3. **Handle Modulo Zero**:
   - Since players are numbered from 1 to n, handle the case where position `0` appears by mapping it to player `n`.

4. **Output Results**:
   - Collect and print the sorted list of possible positions after all throws.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys

def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

def main():
    t = func_2()
    for i in range(t):
        func_4()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `n` (number of players), `m` (number of throws), and `x` (starting position).
  
- **Simulate Each Throw**:
  - Use a set to track possible positions of the ball.
  - For each throw, update the set of positions based on the throw's direction and distance.
  
- **Handle Modulo Wrap-around**:
  - Ensure that position `0` is correctly mapped to player `n`.
  
- **Output**:
  - For each test case, print the number of possible positions and the sorted list of those positions.

This approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and correctly computes the possible positions of the ball after the given throws.
