Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has a three-letter word, all lowercase Latin letters, and he encodes it by summing the positions of the letters in the alphabet. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24. But this encoding is ambiguous because other words like "ava" also sum to 24. My task is, given the sum, to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have produced that sum.

First, I need to understand what "lexicographically smallest" means. It means that among all possible three-letter combinations that sum to the given number, I need to find the one that would come first in a dictionary. So, for example, "aav" comes before "aba" because 'a' is smaller than 'b'.

The letters are numbered from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26. The word has exactly three letters, so the sum n is between 3 (aaa) and 78 (zzz).

Looking at the sample input and output:

- 24 -> aav

- 70 -> rzz

- 3 -> aaa

- 55 -> czz

- 48 -> auz

I need to find a pattern or a method to determine the smallest word for any given sum n, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to maximize the letters to the right, making the left letters as small as possible.

Since we want the smallest lexicographical word, we should make the first letter as small as possible, then the second, and so on.

So, start by making the first letter 'a', then make the second letter 'a', and set the third letter to n - 2, since 'a' is 1, so third letter is n - 2.

But wait, the sum is n = first + second + third.

If I set the first letter to 'a' (1), then the sum of the second and third letters is n - 1.

To make the word smallest, I should make the second letter as small as possible, which is 'a' if possible.

So, set the second letter to 'a' (1), then the third letter is n - 2.

But, if n - 2 is greater than 26, which is possible for larger n, then I need to adjust.

Wait, the maximum sum is 78 (3*26), so n can be up to 78.

So, if n - 2 > 26, which happens when n > 28, then the third letter would be 'z', and I need to adjust the second letter accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to consider different ranges for n and handle them separately.

Let's consider the possible ranges:

1. n = 3 to 27:

- In this range, it's possible to have all letters from 'aaa' (3) to 'aay' (27), since 'y' is 25, so 'aay' is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27.

2. n = 28 to 52:

- Here, the third letter can be 'z' (26), and the sum of the first two letters is n - 26.

- So, to minimize the word, set the first letter to 'a', then the second letter is n - 27.

- But n - 27 can be from 1 to 26, so second letter ranges from 'a' to 'z'.

3. n = 53 to 78:

- In this range, even if the third letter is 'z', n - 26 is from 27 to 52.

- So, the sum of the first two letters is n - 26.

- To minimize the word, set the first letter as small as possible.

- If n - 26 > 26, then the first letter needs to be more than 'a'.

- Wait, no. Wait, the first letter can be from 'a' to 'z', and the second letter is determined by n - 26 minus the first letter.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the maximum possible value for the third letter.

If I set the third letter to 'z' (26), then the sum of the first two letters is n - 26.

Similarly, if I set the second letter to 'z', the first letter is n - 52.

But I need to ensure that all letters are between 1 and 26.

So, perhaps I can start by setting the third letter to the maximum possible, which is 'z', and see if the sum of the first two letters is feasible.

Wait, maybe I should start from the end.

Let me try to derive a general formula.

Let the letters be a, b, c, where each is between 1 and 26.

We have a + b + c = n.

We want to minimize the word in lexicographical order.

So, minimize a, then minimize b given a, then minimize c given a and b.

So, set a as small as possible, then b as small as possible, then c is determined.

But c must be between 1 and 26.

So, set a = 1 (if possible), then set b = 1 (if possible), then c = n - 2.

If c > 26, then set b = n - 26 - a, and c = 26.

Wait, perhaps some examples will help.

Take n = 24.

Set a = 1, b = 1, c = 22, which is 'v'. So, "aav".

Another example: n = 70.

Set a = 1, b = 25, c = 26, which is 'rzz'.

Wait, why b = 25?

Wait, let's calculate:

a + b + c = 70.

Set a = 1, then b + c = 69.

Set b = 25, then c = 44, which is greater than 26.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I need to set c = 26, then b = 70 - 1 - 26 = 43, which is greater than 26.

So, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust a.

Set a = 18, b = 26, c = 26, which is 'rzz'.

18 + 26 + 26 = 70.

Yes, that works.

So, in this case, a = 18, b = 26, c = 26.

In terms of letters, 'rzz'.

Similarly, for n = 55, it's 'czz': 3 + 26 + 26 = 55.

For n = 48, it's 'auz': 1 + 21 + 26 = 48.

So, perhaps the strategy is:

- If n <= 27, set a = 1, b = 1, c = n - 2.

- If n > 27 and n <= 52, set a = 1, b = n - 26 - 1, c = 26.

- If n > 52, set a = n - 52, b = 26, c = 26.

Wait, let's verify this.

For n = 24:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 22. Which is 'aav'. Correct.

For n = 27:

a = 1, b = 1, c = 25. 'aay'. Correct.

For n = 28:

a = 1, b = 2, c = 25. Wait, no.

Wait, according to the earlier strategy for n > 27 and n <= 52, set a = 1, b = n - 27, c = 26.

So, for n = 28: a = 1, b = 1, c = 26. 'azz'.

Wait, but in the sample input, n = 24 is 'aav', n = 70 is 'rzz', n = 3 is 'aaa', n = 55 is 'czz', n = 48 is 'auz'.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe consider the maximum possible c, which is 26, and see what a and b need to be.

So, set c = min(26, n - 2), because a and b are at least 1.

Wait, a + b + c = n.

So, to minimize a, set a as small as possible.

Set a = max(1, n - 52), because b and c can be up to 26 each.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that a >= 1, b >= 1, c >= 1, and a + b + c = n.

So, to minimize a, set a = max(1, n - 52).

Wait, why 52? Because b and c can be up to 26 each, so their maximum sum is 52.

So, a = n - 52, but a cannot be less than 1.

So, a = max(1, n - 52).

Then, set b = max(1, n - 26 - a).

Then, set c = n - a - b.

Let's try this for n = 24.

a = max(1, 24 - 52) = max(1, -28) = 1

b = max(1, 24 - 26 - 1) = max(1, -3) = 1

c = 24 - 1 - 1 = 22 -> 'v'

So, 'aav'. Correct.

For n = 70.

a = max(1, 70 - 52) = max(1, 18) = 18

b = max(1, 70 - 26 - 18) = max(1, 26) = 26

c = 70 - 18 - 26 = 26 -> 'rzz'. Correct.

For n = 3.

a = max(1, 3 - 52) = max(1, -49) = 1

b = max(1, 3 - 26 - 1) = max(1, -24) = 1

c = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1 -> 'aaa'. Correct.

For n = 55.

a = max(1, 55 - 52) = max(1, 3) = 3 -> 'c'

b = max(1, 55 - 26 - 3) = max(1, 26) = 26 -> 'z'

c = 55 - 3 - 26 = 26 -> 'z' -> 'czz'. Correct.

For n = 48.

a = max(1, 48 - 52) = max(1, -4) = 1

b = max(1, 48 - 26 - 1) = max(1, 21) = 21 -> 'u'

c = 48 - 1 - 21 = 26 -> 'z' -> 'auz'. Correct.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Therefore, in the code, we can calculate a, b, c as follows:

a = max(1, n - 52)

b = max(1, n - 26 - a)

c = n - a - b

Then, convert a, b, c to their corresponding letters.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

word = ''

if n > 52:

word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'

elif n > 27:

word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'

elif n == 27:

word = 'aay'

else:

word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]

print(word)

Let's see if this matches our earlier logic.

For n > 52:

word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'

So, a = n - 53, b = 26, c = 26.

Wait, but according to our earlier calculation, a = n - 52.

So, a = n - 52, but here it's n - 53. That seems off by one.

Wait, maybe not. Let's check with n = 70.

a = 70 - 53 = 17 -> 'q', but earlier we had 'r' for 18.

Wait, that's incorrect.

For n = 70, according to our logic, a = 18, which is 'r', but according to the code, it's alphabet[70 - 53] = alphabet[17] = 'q'.

That's not matching.

Wait, perhaps they are indexing from 0, since string.ascii_lowercase starts from 'a' as index 0.

So, alphabet[17] is 'q', but in our earlier logic, a = 18, which is 'r'.

So, it's off by one.

Wait, maybe I need to double-check.

string.ascii_lowercase is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', so alphabet[0] = 'a', alphabet[1] = 'b', ..., alphabet[25] = 'z'.

So, for a = 18, which is 'r', it should be alphabet[18 - 1] = alphabet[17] = 'q'.

Wait, no. Letters are numbered from 1 to 26, with 'a' being 1.

So, to get the letter corresponding to value a, it's alphabet[a - 1].

So, a = 18 should be alphabet[17] = 'q', but actually 'r' is alphabet[18].

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in indexing.

Let's clarify:

- In the problem, 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.

- In Python's string.ascii_lowercase, 'a' is at index 0, 'b' at 1, ..., 'z' at 25.

So, to get the letter corresponding to value a, we use alphabet[a - 1].

For a = 18, alphabet[17] = 'q', but 'r' is at alphabet[18].

Wait, that doesn't match. There's confusion here.

Wait, no, string.ascii_lowercase[17] is 'q', string.ascii_lowercase[18] is 'r', and so on.

So, for a = 18, it should be 'r', which is alphabet[18].

But in the code, for n > 52, word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'

For n = 70, alphabet[70 - 53] = alphabet[17] = 'q', so 'qzz', but earlier we determined it should be 'rzz'.

So, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's an off-by-one error.

Wait, let's calculate a based on our earlier logic: a = max(1, n - 52)

For n = 70, a = 70 - 52 = 18, which corresponds to 'r'.

But in the code, it's using n - 53, which for n = 70 is 17, which is 'q'.

So, it's off by one.

That's a mistake.

Similarly, for n = 55, a = 55 - 52 = 3, which is 'c', and the code uses alphabet[55 - 53] = alphabet[2] = 'c', which is correct.

Wait, but for n = 70, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the off-by-one is only for certain values.

Wait, perhaps I need to look again.

Wait, n = 70:

According to the code: word += alphabet[70 - 53] + 'zz' = alphabet[17] + 'zz' = 'qzz'

But according to our logic, it should be 'rzz', which corresponds to a = 18.

So, 70 - 52 = 18, which is 'r', but the code is using 70 - 53 = 17, which is 'q'.

That's incorrect.

Another way to think about it is:

For n > 52, set a = n - 52, b = 26, c = 26.

So, a corresponds to alphabet[a - 1], which for a = 18 is 'r'.

But the code is using alphabet[n - 53], which for n = 70 is alphabet[17] = 'q'.

So, it's using a = n - 53 + 1 = n - 52, which seems correct, but in code, it's off by one.

Wait, perhaps it's correct and I'm miscounting.

Wait, alphabet[n - 53] corresponds to a = n - 53, but a should be n - 52.

Wait, no, alphabet is 0-indexed, so alphabet[n - 53] corresponds to a = n - 53, but according to our logic, a = n - 52.

So, it's off by one.

Hence, the code is incorrect for n > 52.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's check for n = 55.

n = 55:

a = 55 - 52 = 3, which is 'c'

code: alphabet[55 - 53] = alphabet[2] = 'c' -> 'czz', which is correct.

n = 70:

a = 70 - 52 = 18, which is 'r'

code: alphabet[70 - 53] = alphabet[17] = 'q' -> 'qzz', which is incorrect.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be a = n - 52, but in code, it's a = n - 53.

Wait, perhaps it's a miscount.

Wait, in Python, string indexing starts at 0.

So, alphabet[a - 1] gives the letter for a.

So, to get a = n - 52, we should use alphabet[n - 53].

Wait, because a = n - 52, and alphabet[a - 1] = alphabet[(n - 52) - 1] = alphabet[n - 53]

So, alphabet[n - 53] corresponds to a = n - 52.

Wait, but for n = 70, a = 70 - 52 = 18, which should be 'r', but alphabet[17] is 'q'.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, string.ascii_lowercase[17] is 'q', but a = 18 should be 'r'.

So, there's an off-by-one error.

The code is using a = n - 53, which for n = 70 is 17, which is 'q', but it should be a = 18, which is 'r'.

Hence, the code is incorrect for n > 52.

Wait, perhaps the formula should be a = n - 53, b = 26, c = 26.

But in that case, for n = 70, a = 17 ('q'), b = 26 ('z'), c = 26 ('z'), sum is 17 + 26 + 26 = 69, which is less than 70.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps set a = n - 52, b = 26, c = 26, and if a > 26, adjust b and c accordingly.

Wait, but a should be at least 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternative approach:

To get the smallest lexicographical word, we should minimize a, then b, then c.

So, set a as small as possible, given that a + b + c = n and 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 26.

So, a can be from 1 to min(26, n - 2), because b and c are at least 1 each.

Similarly, b can be from 1 to min(26, n - a - 1), because c must be at least 1.

And c is determined by n - a - b.

To minimize the word, set a as small as possible, then b as small as possible, then c is determined.

So, for a from 1 to min(26, n - 2):

b from 1 to min(26, n - a - 1):

c = n - a - b

if 1 ≤ c ≤ 26, then that's a valid word.

Among all such words, the smallest one in lexicographical order is the one with the smallest a, then smallest b, then c determined.

So, to find the smallest word, we can iterate a from 1 to min(26, n - 2), and for each a, iterate b from 1 to min(26, n - a - 1), and take the first valid a and b that satisfy the conditions.

But this is time-consuming for large t (up to 100), but n is small (up to 78), so it's feasible.

However, we can optimize this by directly calculating a, b, c.

As per earlier thoughts, set a = max(1, n - 52), b = max(1, n - 26 - a), c = n - a - b.

Then, ensure that a, b, c are between 1 and 26.

Let's verify this again with n = 70.

a = max(1, 70 - 52) = 18

b = max(1, 70 - 26 - 18) = max(1, 26) = 26

c = 70 - 18 - 26 = 26

So, 'rzz', which is correct.

For n = 55:

a = max(1, 55 - 52) = 3

b = max(1, 55 - 26 - 3) = max(1, 26) = 26

c = 55 - 3 - 26 = 26 -> 'czz', which is correct.

For n = 48:

a = max(1, 48 - 52) = 1

b = max(1, 48 - 26 - 1) = max(1, 21) = 21

c = 48 - 1 - 21 = 26 -> 'auz', which is correct.

For n = 27:

a = max(1, 27 - 52) = 1

b = max(1, 27 - 26 - 1) = max(1, 0) = 1

c = 27 - 1 - 1 = 25 -> 'aay', which is correct.

For n = 24:

a = max(1, 24 - 52) = 1

b = max(1, 24 - 26 - 1) = max(1, -3) = 1

c = 24 - 1 - 1 = 22 -> 'aav', which is correct.

So, this approach seems correct.

Now, looking back at the given code:

def func():

alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

word = ''

if n > 52:

word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'

elif n > 27:

word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'

elif n == 27:

word = 'aay'

else:

word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]

print(word)

For n > 52, it's using alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'

But as we saw, for n = 70, this would be 'qzz', but it should be 'rzz'.

So, it's off by one.

Similarly, for n = 55, it's 'czz', which is correct.

For n = 70, it's 'qzz', which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but maybe there's a different way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is correct and I'm miscounting.

Wait, for n = 70:

a = n - 53 = 17 -> 'q'

b and c are 'z' and 'z', which are 26 and 26.

So, sum is 17 + 26 + 26 = 69, which is less than 70.

So, that's incorrect.

Hence, the code is incorrect for n > 52.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that corresponds to a given sum of the positions of its letters in the alphabet.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Each letter from 'a' to 'z' has a value from 1 to 26.
   - We are given the sum `n` of these values for a three-letter word.
   - We need to find the smallest possible word (in lexicographical order) that sums to `n`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To get the smallest word lexicographically, we should minimize the first letter, then the second, and finally the third.
   - We need to ensure that all letters are between 'a' (1) and 'z' (26).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the first letter `a` as the maximum of 1 and `n - 52` because the maximum sum for the last two letters is 52 (26 + 26).
   - Calculate the second letter `b` as the maximum of 1 and `n - 26 - a`.
   - Calculate the third letter `c` as `n - a - b`.
   - Convert these values to their corresponding letters.

## Solution Code

```python
def find_smallest_word():
    import string
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n > 78 or n < 3:
            raise ValueError("n must be between 3 and 78")
        a = max(1, n - 52)
        b = max(1, n - 26 - a)
        c = n - a - b
        if c > 26 or c < 1:
            raise ValueError("Invalid sum n for three letters")
        word = alphabet[a - 1] + alphabet[b - 1] + alphabet[c - 1]
        print(word)

# Example usage
# find_smallest_word()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step Calculation**:
  - For a given `n`, compute `a` as `max(1, n - 52)`.
  - Compute `b` as `max(1, n - 26 - a)`.
  - Compute `c` as `n - a - b`.
  - Ensure `a`, `b`, and `c` are within 1 to 26.

- **Lexicographical Minimization**:
  - By choosing the smallest possible `a`, then the smallest possible `b`, and determining `c`, we ensure the word is the smallest possible in lexicographical order.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa'.
  - For `n = 27`, the word is 'aay'.
  - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz'.

This approach efficiently finds the smallest possible word for any valid `n` between 3 and 78, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for the given constraints.
