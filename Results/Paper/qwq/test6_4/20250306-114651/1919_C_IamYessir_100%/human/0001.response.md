Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of size n, and I need to split this array into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the array a must be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called penalty, which is the number of times an element is less than the next one in the subsequence. Finally, I need to sum up the penalties of s and t and find the minimum possible value of this sum.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], possible subsequences could be [1, 3, 5], [2, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], or even an empty sequence.

The problem allows me to split the array into two such subsequences, s and t, and I need to minimize the sum of their penalties. The penalty for a subsequence is the number of times an element is less than the next one. So, for instance, in the subsequence [1, 3, 2], there is one penalty because 3 is less than 2.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

5

1 2 3 4 5

Output:

3

In this case, n=5, and the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. If I split it into s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3], then p(s)=2 (since 2<4 and 4<5) and p(t)=1 (since 1<3), so p(s)+p(t)=3.

But is this the minimal possible penalty? Let's see if there's a better split.

Another possible split could be s=[1,2,3] and t=[4,5], then p(s)=2 and p(t)=1, sum is 3 again.

Or s=[1,3,5] and t=[2,4], p(s)=2 and p(t)=1, sum is 3.

Wait, is there a way to get a lower sum?

What if I put all elements in one subsequence and make the other subsequence empty? For example, s=[1,2,3,4,5], t=[], then p(s)=4 (since 1<2,2<3,3<4,4<5) and p(t)=0, sum is 4, which is worse than 3.

Alternatively, s=[1,3,4], t=[2,5], p(s)=2 (1<3,3<4), p(t)=1 (2<5), sum is 3 again.

It seems like 3 is the minimal penalty for this case.

Looking at another example:

Input:

5

3 3 3 3 3

Output:

0

Here, all elements are equal. So, in any subsequence, there are no penalties because no element is less than the next one. So, if I split it into s=[] and t=[3,3,3,3,3], then p(s)=0 and p(t)=0, sum is 0, which is indeed minimal.

Another example:

Input:

1

1

Output:

0

Only one element, so regardless of which subsequence it goes to, the penalty is 0.

And:

Input:

2

2 1

Output:

0

Possible split: s=[2], t=[1], p(s)=0, p(t)=0, sum is 0.

Alternatively, s=[1], t=[2], p(s)=0, p(t)=0, sum is 0.

Or s=[2,1], t=[], p(s)=0 (since 2 is not less than 1), p(t)=0, sum is 0.

Wait, in s=[2,1], is there a penalty? Well, since 2 is not less than 1, there is no penalty.

So, in all cases, the penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems like the minimal penalty is achieved when we try to maximize the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences.

Wait, but actually, we need to minimize the number of times an element is less than the next one in each subsequence.

Wait, no, the penalty is the number of times an element is less than the next one in the subsequence, and we need to minimize the sum of these penalties for s and t.

So, to minimize p(s) + p(t), we need to minimize the total number of increasing adjacent pairs in both subsequences.

But since every element must be in either s or t, and the subsequences are derived by possibly deleting some elements without changing the order, it's about how we assign elements to s and t such that the total number of increasing adjacent pairs is minimized.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of non-decreasing sequences.

Wait, but the penalty is for increasing pairs, not non-increasing.

Wait, no, the penalty is when an element is less than the next one, which means increasing.

Wait, but in the first example, [2,4,5] has p(s)=2 because 2<4 and 4<5, and [1,3] has p(t)=1 because 1<3, total 3.

But in the second example, all elements are equal, so no penalties.

In the third example, single element, no penalties.

In the fourth example, [2,1] has no penalties because 2 is not less than 1.

Wait, but 2 is less than 1 is false, so p(s)=0.

Wait, but 2 is greater than 1, so no penalty.

Similarly, in [1,2], p(s)=1 because 1<2.

But in [2,1], p(s)=0 because 2 is not less than 1.

So, to minimize p(s)+p(t), perhaps we should aim to have as many decreasing pairs as possible in the subsequences.

Wait, but decreasing pairs don't contribute to the penalty, only increasing pairs do.

So, to minimize the penalty, we want to minimize the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences.

One way to do this is to maximize the number of decreasing pairs across both subsequences.

This sounds similar to dividing the sequence into two decreasing subsequences.

Wait, perhaps it's about partitioning the sequence into two decreasing subsequences and minimizing the number of increasing pairs.

But actually, it's about splitting into two subsequences where each subsequence can have some increasing pairs, and we need to minimize the total number of such pairs.

Wait, maybe it's related to the length of the longest decreasing subsequence or something similar.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence, and I need to split it into two subsequences such that the total number of increasing adjacent pairs is minimized.

This is equivalent to maximizing the number of non-increasing adjacent pairs across both subsequences.

Wait, but adjacent pairs in subsequences are not necessarily adjacent in the original sequence.

Wait, no, subsequences are derived by deleting some elements without changing the order, so the relative order is preserved.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Let me consider each element and decide whether to assign it to s or t, while keeping track of the previous elements in each subsequence.

Define dp[i][j], where i is the current index in the sequence, and j indicates which subsequence the last element was assigned to.

Wait, maybe that's too simplistic.

Alternatively, keep track of the last element assigned to s and the last element assigned to t.

But that might be too slow for n up to 2e5.

Wait, the constraints are quite tight, up to 2e5 per test case, and t up to 1e4, but with the total sum of n over all test cases being up to 2e5, so overall time complexity should be O(n*t) = O(2e5*1e4), which is too much.

Wait, no, the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so t is up to 1e4, but n per test case is up to 2e5, but the sum over all n is up to 2e5, so overall time complexity can be O(n), where n is up to 2e5.

Wait, no, sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, so t is up to 1e4, but n per test case can be up to 2e5, but the total across all test cases is up to 2e5, meaning that n per test case is on average low.

But in the worst case, t=1 and n=2e5.

Anyway, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Since I can split the sequence into two subsequences, s and t, and I need to minimize the total number of increasing adjacent pairs in both, perhaps I can model this as finding the minimal number of increasing pairs across both subsequences.

Wait, maybe it's equivalent to finding the minimal number of times I have to "pay" for increasing pairs when splitting into two subsequences.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

Wait, in the standard problem of covering the array with the minimal number of increasing subsequences, it's equivalent to finding the length of the longest decreasing subsequence.

But here, it's a bit different because I have two subsequences and I need to minimize the total number of increasing pairs in both.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of increasing pairs over all possible partitions into two subsequences.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph problem, where elements are nodes, and edges represent increasing relationships, and I need to partition the graph into two chains with minimal increasing edges.

But that seems too complicated.

Let me look back at the reference solution provided.

The reference solution seems to iterate through the array and, for each element, decide whether to append it to s or t based on some conditions involving the last elements of s and t.

Specifically, it maintains two lists, a and b, initialized as empty.

Then, for each element in the array, it checks:

- If a is empty, x = inf; else x = last element of a.

- If b is empty, y = inf; else y = last element of b.

Then, depending on the relationship between x and y, and the current element lit[i], it decides whether to append lit[i] to a or b.

In the first if condition, if x > y:

- If y >= lit[i], append to b.

- Elif lit[i] > x, append to b.

- Elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y, append to a.

Else if x == y:

- Append to a.

Else if x < y:

- If x >= lit[i], append to a.

- Elif lit[i] > y, append to a.

- Elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x, append to b.

After processing all elements, it calculates the penalties for a and b and sums them up.

I need to verify if this approach correctly minimizes the penalty.

Let me try to understand the logic behind this approach.

It seems like the algorithm is trying to maintain two sequences, a and b, and at each step, decides to append the current element to one of them based on the last elements of a and b.

The goal is to minimize the number of increasing pairs in both sequences.

One way to think about this is to try to maximize the number of non-increasing pairs in both sequences, thereby minimizing the increasing pairs.

But I need to see if this specific logic achieves that.

Let me consider the first example:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

Processing element 1:

a is empty, x=inf; b is empty, y=inf.

Since x > y (inf > inf is invalid, but in code, it's x > y, which is False since inf == inf.

Wait, in code, it's if x > y:

But x and y are both inf, so x > y is False.

Then it checks elif x == y:

Yes, x == y, so append to a.

So a=[1], b=[]

Processing element 2:

x = a[-1] =1; y = b[-1] = inf (since b is empty)

x ==1, y == inf

x > y? 1 > inf is False

x == y? 1 == inf is False

x < y? 1 < inf is True

So, x < y branch:

If x >= lit[i], which is 1 >=2, False.

Elif lit[i] > y, which is 2 > inf, False.

Elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x, which is inf >=2 and 2>1, first condition is True, second is True, so append to b.

So b=[2], a=[1]

Processing element 3:

x =1; y=2

x < y, so x < y branch:

If x >=3, 1 >=3, False.

Elif 3 > y, 3 >2, True, so append to a.

a=[1,3], b=[2]

Processing element 4:

x=3; y=2

x > y, 3 >2, True.

If y >=4, 2 >=4, False.

Elif 4 > x, 4 >3, True, so append to b.

b=[2,4], a=[1,3]

Processing element 5:

x=3; y=4

x < y, 3 <4, True.

If x >=5, 3 >=5, False.

Elif 5 > y, 5 >4, True, so append to a.

a=[1,3,5], b=[2,4]

Now, calculate penalties:

For a=[1,3,5]: p(a)=2 (1<3 and 3<5)

For b=[2,4]: p(b)=1 (2<4)

Total penalty=3

Which matches the first example.

Now, let's see the second example:

n=5, a=[3,3,3,3,3]

Processing element 3:

a empty, x=inf; b empty, y=inf.

x == y, so append to a.

a=[3], b=[]

Processing element 3:

x=3, y=inf

x < y, 3 < inf, True.

If x >=3, 3 >=3, True, so append to a.

a=[3,3], b=[]

Processing element 3:

x=3, y=inf

x < y, 3 < inf, True.

If x >=3, 3 >=3, True, so append to a.

a=[3,3,3], b=[]

Processing element 3:

x=3, y=inf

x < y, 3 < inf, True.

If x >=3, 3 >=3, True, so append to a.

a=[3,3,3,3], b=[]

Processing element 3:

x=3, y=inf

x < y, 3 < inf, True.

If x >=3, 3 >=3, True, so append to a.

a=[3,3,3,3,3], b=[]

Now, p(a)=0 (no increasing pairs), p(b)=0, total penalty=0.

Which matches the second example.

Third example:

n=1, a=[1]

Processing element 1:

a empty, x=inf; b empty, y=inf.

x == y, so append to a.

a=[1], b=[]

Penalties: p(a)=0, p(b)=0, total=0.

Fourth example:

n=2, a=[2,1]

Processing element 2:

a empty, x=inf; b empty, y=inf.

x == y, so append to a.

a=[2], b=[]

Processing element 1:

x=2, y=inf

x < y, 2 < inf, True.

If x >=1, 2 >=1, True, so append to a.

a=[2,1], b=[]

Penalties: p(a)=0 (2 is not less than 1), p(b)=0, total=0.

Which matches the fourth example.

Seems correct so far.

Now, let's see if I can find a case where this approach fails.

Consider n=4, a=[1,3,2,4]

According to the algorithm:

Processing 1:

a empty, x=inf; b empty, y=inf.

x == y, append to a.

a=[1], b=[]

Processing 3:

x=1, y=inf

x < y, True.

If x >=3, False.

Elif 3 > y, 3 > inf, False.

Elif y >=3 and 3 > x, inf >=3 and 3>1, first condition True, second True, so append to b.

b=[3], a=[1]

Processing 2:

x=1, y=3

x < y, 1 <3, True.

If x >=2, 1 >=2, False.

Elif 2 > y, 2 >3, False.

Elif y >=2 and 2 > x, 3 >=2 and 2>1, True and True, so append to b.

b=[3,2], a=[1]

Processing 4:

x=1, y=2

x < y, 1 <2, True.

If x >=4, 1 >=4, False.

Elif 4 > y, 4 >2, True, so append to a.

a=[1,4], b=[3,2]

Now, p(a)=1 (1<4), p(b)=0 (3 is not less than 2), total penalty=1.

Is there a better way? Let's see.

Another possible split: s=[1,2,4], t=[3]

p(s)=2 (1<2 and 2<4), p(t)=0, total=2.

Or s=[1,3,4], t=[2]

p(s)=2 (1<3 and 3<4), p(t)=0, total=2.

Or s=[3,4], t=[1,2]

p(s)=1 (3<4), p(t)=1 (1<2), total=2.

Or s=[1,2], t=[3,4]

p(s)=1 (1<2), p(t)=1 (3<4), total=2.

Or s=[1,4], t=[3,2]

p(s)=1 (1<4), p(t)=0, total=1.

Which is the same as the algorithm's result.

Is there a way to get a lower total penalty? Let's see.

If I could have s=[1,3], t=[2,4]

p(s)=1 (1<3), p(t)=1 (2<4), total=2.

Or s=[1,2,3,4], t=[]

p(s)=3 (1<2,2<3,3<4), p(t)=0, total=3.

Or s=[1,3,4], t=[2]

p(s)=2, p(t)=0, total=2.

Seems like 1 is the minimal possible.

Wait, but is there a way to get total penalty less than 1?

I don't think so, because in any split, there will be at least one increasing pair.

So, in this case, the algorithm gives the correct minimal penalty.

Another test case: n=6, a=[1,2,3,2,3,4]

Processing 1:

a=[], b=[]

x=inf, y=inf

x==y, append to a.

a=[1], b=[]

Processing 2:

x=1, y=inf

x < y, True.

If x >=2, False.

Elif 2 > y, False.

Elif y >=2 and 2 > x, inf >=2 and 2>1, True and True, so append to b.

b=[2], a=[1]

Processing 3:

x=1, y=2

x < y, True.

If x >=3, False.

Elif 3 > y, 3 >2, True, so append to a.

a=[1,3], b=[2]

Processing 2:

x=3, y=2

x > y, 3 >2, True.

If y >=2, 2 >=2, True, so append to b.

b=[2,2], a=[1,3]

Processing 3:

x=3, y=2

x > y, 3 >2, True.

If y >=3, 2 >=3, False.

Elif 3 > x, 3 >3, False.

Else, y >=3 and 3 > x, 2 >=3 and 3>3, False and False, so don't append to b.

Wait, the code has:

if x > y:

if y >= lit[i]:

b.append(lit[i])

elif lit[i] > x:

b.append(lit[i])

elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:

a.append(lit[i])

else:

pass

In this case, x=3, y=2, lit[i]=3.

y >= lit[i]: 2 >=3, False.

lit[i] > x: 3 >3, False.

x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y: 3 >=3 and 3>2, True and True, so append to a.

a=[1,3,3], b=[2,2]

Processing 4:

x=3, y=2

x > y, 3>2, True.

if y >=4, 2 >=4, False.

Elif 4 > x, 4>3, True, so append to b.

b=[2,2,4], a=[1,3,3]

Now, p(a): [1,3,3] has p(a)=1 (1<3), p(b)=[2,2,4] has p(b)=1 (2<4), total=2.

Is there a better split?

Another split: s=[1,2,3,4], t=[2,3]

p(s)=3 (1<2,2<3,3<4), p(t)=1 (2<3), total=4.

Or s=[1,2,4], t=[3,2,3]

p(s)=2 (1<2,2<4), p(t)=1 (2<3), total=3.

Or s=[1,3,4], t=[2,2,3]

p(s)=2, p(t)=1, total=3.

Or s=[1,2,3], t=[2,4]

p(s)=2, p(t)=1, total=3.

Seems like the minimal is 2, which matches the algorithm's result.

Another test case: n=4, a=[4,3,2,1]

Processing 4:

a=[], b=[]

x=inf, y=inf

x==y, append to a.

a=[4], b=[]

Processing 3:

x=4, y=inf

x < y, 4 < inf, True.

If x >=3, 4 >=3, True, so append to a.

a=[4,3], b=[]

Processing 2:

x=3, y=inf

x < y, 3 < inf, True.

If x >=2, 3 >=2, True, so append to a.

a=[4,3,2], b=[]

Processing 1:

x=2, y=inf

x < y, 2 < inf, True.

If x >=1, 2 >=1, True, so append to a.

a=[4,3,2,1], b=[]

p(a)=0 (no increasing pairs), p(b)=0, total=0.

Which is correct, since we can have s=[4,3,2,1], t=[], and p(s)=0, p(t)=0.

Another test case: n=3, a=[1,2,1]

Processing 1:

a=[], b=[]

x=inf, y=inf

x==y, append to a.

a=[1], b=[]

Processing 2:

x=1, y=inf

x < y, 1 < inf, True.

If x >=2, 1 >=2, False.

Elif 2 > y, 2 > inf, False.

Elif y >=2 and 2 > x, inf >=2 and 2>1, True and True, so append to b.

b=[2], a=[1]

Processing 1:

x=1, y=2

x < y, 1 <2, True.

If x >=1, 1 >=1, True, so append to a.

a=[1,1], b=[2]

p(a)=0 (1 is not less than 1), p(b)=0, total=0.

Which is correct.

Another test case: n=4, a=[1,3,2,1]

Processing 1:

a=[], b=[]

x=inf, y=inf

x==y, append to a.

a=[1], b=[]

Processing 3:

x=1, y=inf

x < y, 1 < inf, True.

If x >=3, 1 >=3, False.

Elif 3 > y, 3 > inf, False.

Elif y >=3 and 3 > x, inf >=3 and 3>1, True and True, so append to b.

b=[3], a=[1]

Processing 2:

x=1, y=3

x < y, 1 <3, True.

If x >=2, 1 >=2, False.

Elif 2 > y, 2 >3, False.

Elif y >=2 and 2 > x, 3 >=2 and 2>1, True and True, so append to b.

b=[3,2], a=[1]

Processing 1:

x=1, y=2

x < y, 1 <2, True.

If x >=1, 1 >=1, True, so append to a.

a=[1,1], b=[3,2]

p(a)=0, p(b)=0, total=0.

Which seems correct.

Seems like the algorithm works correctly for these cases.

Now, let's see the time complexity.

For each test case, we iterate through the array once, so O(n) per test case.

With t up to 1e4 and sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, total time complexity is O(2e5), which should be acceptable.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
