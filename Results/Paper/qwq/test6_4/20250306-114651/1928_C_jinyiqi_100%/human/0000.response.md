Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned numbers based on their positions and a parameter K. The goal is to figure out how many possible values of K are valid given Vasya's position and the number he received.

First, I need to understand the pattern of how numbers are assigned based on K. It says that the first K people get numbers 1 through K, then the next K-2 people get numbers K-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2K-2 positions.

So, for a given K, the sequence of numbers assigned would look like:

1, 2, 3, ..., K, (K-1), (K-2), ..., 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., K, (K-1), ..., and so on.

And this repeats every 2K-2 positions.

Given that, for each test case, I have Vasya's position N and the number he received X. I need to find how many natural numbers K > 1 satisfy the condition that at position N, the number assigned is X.

Constraints are:

- T (number of test cases) is up to 100.

- N and X are such that 1 ≤ X < N ≤ 10^9.

So, N can be up to a billion, which means any solution needs to be efficient, probably O(1) or O(sqrt(N)) per test case to handle the time limits.

First, I need to model the problem mathematically.

Given position N and number X, I need to find all K > 1 such that the number assigned to position N is X.

From the problem, the sequence repeats every 2K-2 positions.

So, the sequence for a given K is:

1, 2, 3, ..., K, (K-1), (K-2), ..., 2, and then it repeats.

So, the period is 2K-2.

Therefore, the sequence is periodic with period 2K-2.

Given that, the number assigned to position N is determined by the position within the current period.

First, find the position within the period:

Let P = N mod (2K - 2)

If P == 0, then P = 2K - 2

Then, if P <= K, number assigned is P

Else, number assigned is 2K - P

So, for a given K, the number assigned to position N is:

If P <= K, X = P

Else, X = 2K - P

So, we have two cases:

1. P <= K => X = P

2. P > K => X = 2K - P

But P = N mod (2K - 2), and if P == 0, P = 2K - 2

So, let's write this more formally.

Let’s denote M = 2K - 2

Then, P = N mod M

If P == 0, P = M

Then:

If P <= K, X = P

Else, X = 2K - P

We need X to be equal to the number assigned to position N, which depends on P and K.

So, we have:

If P <= K, X = P

Else, X = 2K - P

We need to solve for K in natural numbers greater than 1.

Given that, let's consider both cases.

Case 1: P <= K => X = P

Which implies P = X

But P = N mod M, and M = 2K - 2

So, N mod (2K - 2) = X, if X != 0

But X is at least 1, so P != 0

Therefore, N mod (2K - 2) = X

Which means N - X is divisible by (2K - 2)

So, N - X ≡ 0 mod (2K - 2)

Therefore, 2K - 2 divides N - X

Similarly, 2K - 2 divides N - X

Let’s denote D = 2K - 2

Then, D divides N - X

So, D divides N - X

Also, K = (D + 2)/2

Since K must be an integer greater than 1, D must be even and D >= 2

Because K > 1 => 2K - 2 > 0 => D > 0

And D must be even because K = (D + 2)/2 must be integer.

So, D must be even and positive.

Therefore, D is a positive even divisor of N - X.

Wait, but N - X could be negative if X > N, but according to constraints, X < N, so N - X is positive.

Therefore, D is a positive even divisor of N - X, and D >= 2.

So, for each even divisor D of N - X, where D >= 2, we can compute K = (D + 2)/2

And K must be an integer greater than 1.

Similarly, we have to ensure that in the first case, P <= K, which is already satisfied because P = X and X <= K in this case.

So, this is one set of possible K.

Now, let's consider the second case.

Case 2: P > K => X = 2K - P

But P = N mod M = N mod (2K - 2)

And if P > K, then X = 2K - P

So, X = 2K - P

Which implies P = 2K - X

But P = N mod M, and M = 2K - 2

So, N mod (2K - 2) = 2K - X

Again, N - (2K - X) is divisible by M = 2K - 2

So, N - (2K - X) ≡ 0 mod (2K - 2)

Which means 2K - 2 divides N - 2K + X

Which can be written as 2K - 2 divides -(2K - 2) + (N - 2K + X)

Wait, that seems messy.

Alternatively, since M divides N - (2K - X), we can write:

2K - 2 divides N - 2K + X

Let’s denote D = 2K - 2

Then, D divides N - 2K + X

Substitute K = (D + 2)/2

Then, N - 2*( (D + 2)/2 ) + X = N - (D + 2) + X = N - D - 2 + X

So, D divides N - D - 2 + X

Which is equivalent to D divides (N + X - 2 - D)

But since D divides N - 2K + X, and K = (D + 2)/2, then N - 2K + X = N - (D + 2) + X = N - D - 2 + X = N + X - D - 2

But D divides this expression.

Wait, but D divides N - 2K + X, which is N - D - 2 + X.

But D divides this, so D divides (N + X - 2 - D)

Which implies D divides (N + X - 2) - D

Which implies D divides (N + X - 2)

Wait, because D divides (N + X - 2) - D, and D divides D, hence D divides (N + X - 2)

Therefore, D divides (N + X - 2)

So, in this case, D = 2K - 2 must be a positive even divisor of (N + X - 2)

And again, K = (D + 2)/2 must be an integer greater than 1.

Additionally, in this case, P > K, which means P = N mod M > K

But P = N mod M = N - M*floor(N/M)

But since M = 2K - 2, and K = (D + 2)/2, we can express this, but it might not be necessary.

So, summarizing both cases:

1. D divides (N - X), where D is even and D >= 2, then K = (D + 2)/2

2. D divides (N + X - 2), where D is even and D >= 2, then K = (D + 2)/2

But we need to make sure that in both cases, K is an integer greater than 1, which it is as long as D is even and D >= 2.

Also, we need to ensure that in the first case, P <= K, and in the second case, P > K.

But since we're deriving K from D in both cases, and D is a divisor from different expressions, we need to make sure that the K derived from both cases are distinct.

In other words, there might be overlapping K values from both cases, so we need to collect all possible K from both cases and remove duplicates.

Given that, the approach is:

- Find all positive even divisors D of (N - X), and compute K = (D + 2)/2

- Find all positive even divisors D of (N + X - 2), and compute K = (D + 2)/2

- Combine these K values, remove duplicates, and count how many there are.

Now, to implement this efficiently, especially since N can be up to 10^9, we need an efficient way to find all even divisors of a number.

A number can have up to around 100 divisors if it's highly composite, but for large N, we need an efficient way to generate divisors.

One way is to factorize the number and generate all possible products of its prime factors.

But since we're dealing with large N, and T up to 100, we need an optimized approach.

An efficient way is to iterate from 1 to sqrt(X) and collect divisors.

Given that, for each test case, we can:

- If (N - X) >= 2, find all even divisors D of (N - X), compute K = (D + 2)/2, and collect them.

- If (N + X - 2) >= 2, find all even divisors D of (N + X - 2), compute K = (D + 2)/2, and collect them.

- Remove duplicates and count the total number of unique K.

But, we need to make sure that K is an integer greater than 1, which is already ensured by D being even and >= 2.

Wait, but (D + 2)/2 must be an integer, which is true if D is even.

So, as long as D is even, K will be an integer.

Given that, the approach seems solid.

Now, considering the example:

Test case 1:

N = 10, X = 2

Compute N - X = 8, N + X - 2 = 10

Find even divisors of 8: 2, 4, 8

Compute K = (2+2)/2=2, (4+2)/2=3, (8+2)/2=5

Find even divisors of 10: 2, 10

Compute K = (2+2)/2=2, (10+2)/2=6

Combine K: 2,3,5,6 → 4 unique K

Which matches the first test case output.

Test case 2:

N=3, X=1

N - X=2, N + X - 2=2

Even divisors of 2: 2

K=(2+2)/2=2

So, only K=2 is possible.

Which matches the second test case output.

So, the approach seems correct.

Now, in the code provided, it seems to implement this approach.

Let's look at the code:

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, x) = map(int, input().split())

output = []

if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:

sep = func_1(n + x - 2)

for s in sep:

if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

output.append((s + 2) / 2)

if (n - x) % 2 == 0:

sep = func_1(n - x)

for s in sep:

if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

output.append((s + 2) / 2)

output = list(set(output))

print(len(output))

def func_1(x):

output1 = []

output2 = []

for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

output1.append(i)

output2.append(int(x / i))

output1.reverse()

return output2 + output1

So, func_1 seems to be a function to find all divisors of x.

It iterates from 1 to sqrt(x), and for each i that divides x, it appends i and x/i to output1 and output2 respectively.

Then, it reverses output1 and concatenates output2 + output1.

This is an efficient way to generate all divisors in ascending order.

In the main loop:

For each test case, it reads N and X.

Then, it initializes an empty list output to store possible K values.

First, it checks if (N + X - 2) % 2 == 0.

If true, it calls func_1 to get all divisors of (N + X - 2), and iterates through them.

For each divisor s, it checks if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 (which ensures s is even) and (s + 2)/2 >= X.

If both conditions are met, it appends (s + 2)/2 to output.

Similarly, it checks if (N - X) % 2 == 0.

If true, it calls func_1 to get all divisors of (N - X), and iterates through them.

For each divisor s, it checks if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 (s is even) and (s + 2)/2 >= X.

If both conditions are met, it appends (s + 2)/2 to output.

After considering both cases, it converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list to count the unique K values.

Finally, it prints the length of this list.

Now, analyzing this:

- It's finding divisors of (N + X - 2) and (N - X) only if certain conditions are met.

- It's ensuring that s is even and (s + 2)/2 >= X.

Wait, why the condition (s + 2)/2 >= X?

From earlier reasoning, K must be at least X because in the first case, P <= K implies X <= K, and in the second case, P > K implies X < K (since P = 2K - X > K implies X < K).

Wait, no, in the second case, P = 2K - X > K, which implies X < K.

So, in both cases, K must be at least X.

Wait, but in the first case, P <= K implies X <= K, and in the second case, P > K implies X < K.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the first case, P <= K implies X = P <= K.

In the second case, P > K implies X = 2K - P.

Since P > K, 2K - P < K.

Wait, but P = 2K - X > K implies X < K.

Wait, let's see:

P = 2K - X > K => 2K - X > K => K > X.

So, in the second case, K > X.

But in the first case, X <= K.

Wait, but in the second case, K > X, and in the first case, X <= K.

So, overall, K can be greater than or equal to X in both cases.

Wait, but in the second case, K > X.

So, perhaps it's better to just have K >= X in both cases.

But in the second case, K > X.

So, to cover both cases, K >= X.

Therefore, in the code, it has (s + 2)/2 >= X, which aligns with K >= X.

But in the second case, K > X, so perhaps it should be (s + 2)/2 > X in that case.

Wait, but in the first case, K >= X, and in the second case, K > X.

So, perhaps there's some overlap or need to adjust the conditions accordingly.

But in the code, it's (s + 2)/2 >= X for both cases.

Given that in the second case, K must be strictly greater than X, but the code has >= X for both.

This might be an error.

Looking back at the example:

Test case 1: N=10, X=2

Possible K: 2,3,5,6

All satisfy K >= X=2

Test case 2: N=3, X=1

Possible K:2

Which is >= X=1

But in the second case, K > X.

But in this example, K=2 > X=1.

Wait, but X=1, K=2 >1.

But in general, if X=K-1, for example, in the second case, K > X would hold.

Wait, perhaps it's acceptable to have K >= X in both cases, as in the first case, K >= X is allowed, and in the second case, K > X is enforced.

But in practice, since K is integer, and the division is float division, perhaps it's okay.

But to be precise, perhaps in the second case, we should have (s + 2)/2 > X.

But in the code, it's (s + 2)/2 >= X for both cases.

Given that, perhaps it's acceptable since K is integer and K >= X + 1 in the second case.

But need to verify.

Looking back at the first test case: N=10, X=2

Possible K:2,3,5,6

For K=2: in the first case, P <= K=2, X=2 <= K=2

For K=3: in the first case, P <= 3, X=2 <=3

For K=5: in the first case, P <=5, X=2 <=5

For K=6: in the first case, P <=6, X=2 <=6

So, in this case, all K satisfy K >= X.

Similarly, in the second test case: N=3, X=1

K=2 > X=1

So, perhaps it's safe to have K >= X in both cases.

But need to confirm.

Another test case: N=76, X=4

Possible K: ?

From the output, there are 9 possible K.

Assuming the code is correct, and the output matches the expected results, perhaps the condition K >= X is sufficient.

Moving on.

Also, in the code, it's checking if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0 and (n - x) % 2 == 0 to proceed with finding divisors.

This seems to correspond to the conditions we derived earlier.

Now, regarding the function func_1(x):

It finds all divisors of x by iterating from 1 to sqrt(x), and for each i that divides x, it appends i and x/i to lists, then reverses one list and concatenates them.

This is an efficient way to generate all divisors in sorted order.

Given that, the function seems correct.

Finally, the output is the number of unique K values that satisfy the conditions.

Given that, and considering the example outputs match the expected results, it seems the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
