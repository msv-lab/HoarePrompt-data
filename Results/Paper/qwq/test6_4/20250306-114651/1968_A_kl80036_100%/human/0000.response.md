Alright, so I've got this problem here. It's about finding an integer y that's less than a given integer x, such that when you add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, you get the maximum possible value. I need to check if the provided Python program correctly solves this problem.

First, let's understand the problem statement. I'm given multiple test cases, each with an integer x, and for each x, I need to find a y (where y is less than x) that maximizes the sum of y and gcd(x, y).

GCD, or greatest common divisor, is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. So, gcd(x, y) + y should be maximized.

The program provided is quite simple. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads x, sets y to x - 1, and prints y. So, it's always choosing y = x - 1.

Is this always the correct choice? Let's think about it.

Take the first example from the problem: x = 10. The program would choose y = 9. What's gcd(10, 9)? Since 10 and 9 are consecutive integers, their GCD is 1. So, gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10.

But looking at the example output, for x = 10, the output is 5. Let's check gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10. Same as y = 9.

Wait, so in this case, both y = 5 and y = 9 give the same sum of 10. The problem says that any y that achieves the maximum is acceptable. So, y = 9 is fine.

Let's try another example: x = 7. The program chooses y = 6. gcd(7, 6) is 1, so 1 + 6 = 7. According to the sample output, y = 6 is correct, which matches the program's output.

Next, x = 21. The program chooses y = 20. gcd(21, 20) is 1, so 1 + 20 = 21. The sample output is y = 18. Let's check gcd(21, 18) which is 3, so 3 + 18 = 21. Same as y = 20.

Again, both y = 20 and y = 18 give the same sum of 21.

For x = 2, the program chooses y = 1. gcd(2, 1) is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2. The sample output is y = 1, which is correct.

For x = 100, y = 99. gcd(100, 99) is 1, so 1 + 99 = 100. The sample output is y = 98. gcd(100, 98) is 2, so 2 + 98 = 100. Same as y = 99.

Again, both choices give the same sum.

For x = 1000, y = 999. gcd(1000, 999) is 1, so 1 + 999 = 1000. The sample output is y = 750. gcd(1000, 750) is 250, so 250 + 750 = 1000. Same as y = 999.

Once more, both choices achieve the same sum.

Last example, x = 6, y = 5. gcd(6, 5) is 1, so 1 + 5 = 6. The sample output is y = 3. gcd(6, 3) is 3, so 3 + 3 = 6. Same as y = 5.

In all these cases, choosing y = x - 1 gives the same sum as the sample output. So, it seems that y = x - 1 is a valid choice, even if it's not the only one.

Is there any x where y = x - 1 would not maximize the sum?

Let me think about x = 4. y can be 1 or 2 or 3.

- y = 1: gcd(4, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: gcd(4, 2) = 2, sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 3: gcd(4, 3) = 1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4

So, both y = 2 and y = 3 achieve the maximum sum of 4. The program would choose y = 3, which is correct.

Another example: x = 9.

- y = 1: gcd(9, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: gcd(9, 2) = 1, sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 3: gcd(9, 3) = 3, sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 4: gcd(9, 4) = 1, sum = 1 + 4 = 5

- y = 5: gcd(9, 5) = 1, sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 6: gcd(9, 6) = 3, sum = 3 + 6 = 9

- y = 7: gcd(9, 7) = 1, sum = 1 + 7 = 8

- y = 8: gcd(9, 8) = 1, sum = 1 + 8 = 9

So, y = 6 and y = 8 both achieve the maximum sum of 9. The program would choose y = 8, which is correct.

Wait, but what if x is a prime number? For example, x = 5.

Possible y values: 1, 2, 3, 4.

- y = 1: gcd(5, 1) = 1, sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: gcd(5, 2) = 1, sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 3: gcd(5, 3) = 1, sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 4: gcd(5, 4) = 1, sum = 1 + 4 = 5

So, y = 4 achieves the maximum sum of 5. The program would choose y = 4, which is correct.

Another case: x = 8.

Possible y values: 1 to 7.

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 3: sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 4: sum = 4 + 4 = 8

- y = 5: sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 6: sum = 2 + 6 = 8

- y = 7: sum = 1 + 7 = 8

So, y = 4, y = 6, and y = 7 all achieve the maximum sum of 8. The program would choose y = 7, which is correct.

It seems that in all these cases, choosing y = x - 1 gives a sum that is at least as good as other possible y values. But is there any x where y = x - 1 does not achieve the maximum sum?

Let's consider x = 6.

Possible y values: 1 to 5.

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 3: sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 4: sum = 2 + 4 = 6

- y = 5: sum = 1 + 5 = 6

So, y = 3, y = 4, and y = 5 all achieve the maximum sum of 6. The program would choose y = 5, which is correct.

Another example: x = 12.

Possible y values: 1 to 11.

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 3: sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 4: sum = 4 + 4 = 8

- y = 5: sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 6: sum = 6 + 6 = 12

- y = 7: sum = 1 + 7 = 8

- y = 8: sum = 4 + 8 = 12

- y = 9: sum = 3 + 9 = 12

- y = 10: sum = 2 + 10 = 12

- y = 11: sum = 1 + 11 = 12

Here, y = 6, y = 8, y = 9, y = 10, and y = 11 all achieve the maximum sum of 12. The program would choose y = 11, which is correct.

Wait, is there any x where y = x - 1 does not achieve the maximum sum? Let's think about x = 9.

Earlier, for x = 9, y = 6 and y = 8 both achieve the maximum sum of 9. The program chooses y = 8, which is correct.

Is there a case where y = x - 1 is not optimal?

Let's try x = 4.

Possible y values: 1, 2, 3.

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 3: sum = 1 + 3 = 4

Here, y = 2 and y = 3 both achieve the maximum sum of 4. The program chooses y = 3, which is correct.

Another case: x = 2.

Possible y values: 1.

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

The program chooses y = 1, which is correct.

x = 3.

Possible y values: 1, 2.

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

- y = 2: sum = 1 + 2 = 3

The program chooses y = 2, which is correct.

x = 12.

Earlier, y = 11 gives sum = 1 + 11 = 12, which is optimal.

Wait, but in x = 12, y = 6 gives sum = 6 + 6 = 12, which is the same as y = 11. So, y = x - 1 is still optimal.

Is there any x where y = x - 1 is not optimal?

Let's consider x = 8.

Possible y values:

- y = 7: sum = 1 + 7 = 8

- y = 4: sum = 4 + 4 = 8

- y = 6: sum = 2 + 6 = 8

All achieve the same sum.

Another example: x = 15.

Possible y values:

- y = 14: sum = 1 + 14 = 15

- y = 13: sum = 1 + 13 = 14

- y = 12: sum = 3 + 12 = 15

- y = 10: sum = 5 + 10 = 15

- y = 9: sum = 3 + 9 = 12

- y = 8: sum = 1 + 8 = 9

- y = 7: sum = 1 + 7 = 8

- y = 6: sum = 3 + 6 = 9

- y = 5: sum = 5 + 5 = 10

- y = 4: sum = 1 + 4 = 5

- y = 3: sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 2: sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Here, y = 14, y = 12, and y = 10 all achieve the maximum sum of 15. The program chooses y = 14, which is correct.

So, in this case, y = x - 1 is optimal.

Is there any x where y = x - 1 is not optimal?

Let's try x = 6.

Possible y values:

- y = 5: sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 4: sum = 2 + 4 = 6

- y = 3: sum = 3 + 3 = 6

All achieve the same sum.

Another example: x = 100.

Possible y values:

- y = 99: sum = 1 + 99 = 100

- y = 98: sum = 2 + 98 = 100

- y = 95: sum = 5 + 95 = 100

- y = 90: sum = 10 + 90 = 100

- y = 80: sum = 20 + 80 = 100

- y = 75: sum = 25 + 75 = 100

- y = 70: sum = 10 + 70 = 80

- y = 50: sum = 50 + 50 = 100

- y = 40: sum = 20 + 40 = 60

- y = 25: sum = 25 + 25 = 50

- y = 20: sum = 20 + 20 = 40

- y = 10: sum = 10 + 10 = 20

- y = 5: sum = 5 + 5 = 10

- y = 4: sum = 4 + 4 = 8

- y = 2: sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Here, y = 99, y = 98, y = 95, y = 90, y = 80, y = 75, y = 50 all achieve the maximum sum of 100. The program chooses y = 99, which is correct.

It seems that in all these cases, y = x - 1 achieves the maximum sum, even if there are other y values that also achieve the same sum.

Is there a case where y = x - 1 does not achieve the maximum sum? Let's think about x = 4.

Possible y values:

- y = 3: sum = 1 + 3 = 4

- y = 2: sum = 2 + 2 = 4

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Here, y = 3 and y = 2 both achieve the maximum sum of 4. The program chooses y = 3, which is correct.

Another example: x = 9.

Possible y values:

- y = 8: sum = 1 + 8 = 9

- y = 7: sum = 1 + 7 = 8

- y = 6: sum = 3 + 6 = 9

- y = 5: sum = 1 + 5 = 6

- y = 4: sum = 1 + 4 = 5

- y = 3: sum = 3 + 3 = 6

- y = 2: sum = 1 + 2 = 3

- y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2

Here, y = 8 and y = 6 both achieve the maximum sum of 9. The program chooses y = 8, which is correct.

I can't find a case where y = x - 1 does not achieve the maximum sum. It seems that y = x - 1 always achieves a sum of x - 1 + gcd(x, x - 1). Now, what is gcd(x, x - 1)?

For any two consecutive integers, their GCD is 1. Because consecutive integers are coprime.

So, gcd(x, x - 1) = 1.

Therefore, the sum is y + gcd(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x.

Now, is there any y < x where y + gcd(x, y) > x?

Let's see.

Suppose y < x, then y <= x - 1.

And gcd(x, y) <= y.

So, y + gcd(x, y) <= y + y = 2y <= 2(x - 1).

But in the earlier examples, the maximum sum seems to be x.

Wait, but in some cases, y + gcd(x, y) can be equal to x.

For example, y = x - 1: sum = (x - 1) + 1 = x.

Or, in x = 21, y = 18: gcd(21, 18) = 3, so 18 + 3 = 21.

Similarly, y = 20: gcd(21, 20) = 1, so 20 + 1 = 21.

So, in this case, sum is x.

Is it possible to have y + gcd(x, y) > x?

Let me see.

Suppose y < x.

Then y <= x - 1.

gcd(x, y) divides x and y, so gcd(x, y) <= y.

Thus, y + gcd(x, y) <= y + y = 2y <= 2(x - 1).

But 2(x - 1) <= x only when x <= 2.

For x >= 3, 2(x - 1) > x.

But in practice, y + gcd(x, y) doesn't seem to exceed x in the examples I've checked.

Wait, in x = 100, y = 99: sum = 100.

y = 98: sum = 100.

y = 95: sum = 100.

y = 50: sum = 100.

All achieve sum = x.

Similarly, in x = 6, sum is 6.

In x = 4, sum is 4.

So, it seems that the maximum sum is always x.

Therefore, choosing y = x - 1, which gives sum = x, is correct.

Hence, the program is correct.

But to be thorough, let's check x = 2.

y = 1: sum = 1 + 1 = 2.

Which is equal to x.

So, again, sum = x.

Therefore, in all cases, choosing y = x - 1 gives sum = x, which is the maximum possible.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The program is correct.}} \]
