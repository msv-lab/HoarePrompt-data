Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x and at least 1, such that when I add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, I get the maximum possible value. Also, if there are multiple y's that satisfy this, I can choose any of them.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x, y) is. GCD, or greatest common divisor, is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6, 4) is 2, as you mentioned.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x, y) + y. I need to choose y in a way that this sum is as large as possible.

Let me think about this. Since y is less than x, the possible values for y range from 1 to x-1.

One approach could be to iterate through all possible y values from 1 to x-1, calculate gcd(x, y) + y for each, and keep track of the y that gives the maximum sum. However, this seems inefficient, especially if x is large, but in this problem, x can be up to 1000, and t can be up to 1000, so we need something more efficient.

Is there a smarter way to choose y without checking all possibilities?

Let me consider the properties of gcd. If y divides x (i.e., x is a multiple of y), then gcd(x, y) is y itself because y is a divisor of x. In this case, gcd(x, y) + y would be y + y = 2y.

But y might not divide x, in which case gcd(x, y) would be less than y.

So, if y divides x, gcd(x, y) + y = 2y. If y does not divide x, gcd(x, y) + y < 2y.

Therefore, to maximize gcd(x, y) + y, it's beneficial to have y divide x, because then gcd(x, y) + y = 2y, which is larger than gcd(x, y) + y when y does not divide x.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because if y divides x, then gcd(x, y) is y, so gcd(x, y) + y = 2y. But y is less than x, so 2y could be less than x or approach x, depending on y.

But let's think about it differently. Suppose I choose y such that y is the largest possible divisor of x. Then, gcd(x, y) would be y, and gcd(x, y) + y = 2y, which would be maximized since y is as large as possible.

Wait, but y has to be less than x. So, the largest possible y that divides x is x/2, if x is even, or the largest divisor less than x if x is odd.

Let me test this with an example.

Take x = 10.

Divisors of 10 less than 10 are 5 and 2 and 1.

So, possible y's are 5, 2, 1.

gcd(10,5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10

gcd(10,2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4

gcd(10,1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

So, the maximum is 10, which corresponds to y=5.

Another example: x=7.

Divisors less than 7 are 1.

So, y=1.

gcd(7,1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

But according to the sample output, for x=7, y=6, which is not a divisor of 7.

Wait, that's interesting. So, in this case, y=6 is chosen, but 6 does not divide 7.

Let's calculate gcd(7,6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7.

Wait, that's higher than choosing y=1, which gives 2.

So, in this case, choosing y=6, which does not divide 7, gives a higher sum.

Hmm, so my earlier assumption that choosing y as the largest divisor less than x is always the best might not hold.

Let's see another example.

x=21.

Divisors less than 21 are 7, 3, 1.

Choose y=7: gcd(21,7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14

y=3: 3 + 3 = 6

y=1: 1 + 1 = 2

But according to the sample output, for x=21, y=18.

Calculate gcd(21,18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21.

That's even better than choosing y=7.

So, in this case, choosing y=18, which is not a divisor of 21, gives a higher sum than choosing the largest divisor.

Interesting.

Wait, is there a pattern here?

In the first example, x=10, choosing y=5 (divisor) gives 10, but choosing y=9 would give gcd(10,9)+9=1+9=10, same as y=5.

But in x=7, choosing y=6 gives 7, which is better than y=1's 2.

In x=21, choosing y=18 gives 21, which is better than y=7's 14.

So, perhaps choosing y = x - gcd(x, y), but that seems circular.

Wait, maybe choosing y = x - 1 if x - 1 divides x?

Wait, in x=10, y=5 is chosen in the sample, but in x=7, y=6 is chosen, in x=21, y=18.

Wait, in x=10, y=5 is chosen, which is x - 5.

Wait, perhaps choosing y such that y is the largest possible integer less than x such that gcd(x, y) is as large as possible.

But in x=7, gcd(7,6)=1, which is small, but y=6 gives a high sum because y is large.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is to choose y = x - 1.

Let's see.

For x=10, y=9: gcd(10,9)=1, 1+9=10.

But in the sample, y=5 is chosen, which also gives 10.

For x=7, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, 1+6=7.

Which is better than y=1's 2.

For x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, 3+18=21.

Which is better than y=7's 14.

For x=2, y=1: gcd(2,1)=1, 1+1=2.

As per the sample.

For x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, 2+98=100.

But in the sample, y=98 gives 100, but y=50 would give gcd(100,50)=50, 50+50=100, same as y=98.

For x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, 250+750=1000.

But y=999: gcd(1000,999)=1, 1+999=1000.

So, multiple y's can give the same sum.

In x=6, y=3: gcd(6,3)=3, 3+3=6.

But in the sample, y=3 is chosen, which gives 6.

Alternatively, y=5: gcd(6,5)=1, 1+5=6, same as y=3.

So, both y=3 and y=5 give the same sum.

Hence, as per the problem, any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

Now, looking at these examples, it seems that choosing y = x - 1 often gives a good sum, especially when x is prime, since gcd(x, x-1) is 1, and 1 + (x-1) = x.

For composite x, choosing y as a large divisor or x - 1 both can give the maximum sum.

Hence, a simple strategy is to choose y = x - 1 for each x.

This seems to work in all the sample cases:

x=10, y=9 gives 10, same as y=5.

x=7, y=6 gives 7.

x=21, y=20 gives gcd(21,20)=1, 1+20=21, same as y=18.

x=100, y=99 gives gcd(100,99)=1, 1+99=100, same as y=98 or y=50.

x=2, y=1 gives 2.

x=1000, y=999 gives 1000, same as y=750.

x=6, y=5 gives 6, same as y=3.

Hence, choosing y = x - 1 seems to be a safe and efficient strategy that always achieves the maximum possible sum.

Therefore, the given program, which simply sets y = x - 1 for each x, is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**
