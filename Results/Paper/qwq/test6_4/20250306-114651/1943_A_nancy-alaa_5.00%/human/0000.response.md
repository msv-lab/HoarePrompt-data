Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about a game between Alice and Bob on an array, and I need to determine the final score based on their optimal plays. The score is the MEX of the array that Alice builds. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

First, I need to understand the game rules clearly:

1. The game is played on an array `a` of size `n`.

2. Alice starts with an empty array `c`.

3. Players take turns, with Alice going first.

4. On Alice's turn, she picks one element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

5. On Bob's turn, he picks one element from `a`, deletes it from `a`, and does not add it to `c`.

6. The game ends when `a` is empty.

7. The score is the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.

8. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, the goal is to find the final MEX when both play optimally.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in it. For example:

- MEX of `[2,2,1]` is `0` (since `0` is missing).

- MEX of `[3,1,0,1]` is `2` (since `0` and `1` are present, but `2` is missing).

- MEX of `[0,3,1,2]` is `4` (since `0`, `1`, `2`, `3` are present, but `4` is missing).

Given that, I need to think about how Alice and Bob's actions affect the MEX of `c`.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to have as many small non-negative integers in `c` as possible. Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from including certain numbers in `c`.

Since Alice can choose any element from `a` and add it to `c`, and Bob can remove any element from `a`, their strategies will involve selecting elements that help them achieve their goals.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

**Example 1:**

Input:

4

0 0 1 1

Possible game:

- Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[0,0,1]`, `c` becomes `[1]`.

- Bob picks `0`, `a` becomes `[0,1]`, `c` remains `[1]`.

- Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` becomes `[1,0]`.

- Bob picks `1`, `a` becomes empty, `c` remains `[1,0]`.

MEX of `[1,0]` is `2`.

**Example 2:**

Input:

4

0 1 2 3

Possible game:

- Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1,2,3]`, `c` becomes `[0]`.

- Bob picks `1`, `a` becomes `[2,3]`, `c` remains `[0]`.

- Alice picks `2`, `a` becomes `[3]`, `c` becomes `[0,2]`.

- Bob picks `3`, `a` becomes empty, `c` remains `[0,2]`.

MEX of `[0,2]` is `1`.

Wait, but according to the sample input, the output for this case is `1`. So, perhaps in this scenario, the MEX is `1`.

**Example 3:**

Input:

2

1 1

Possible game:

- Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` becomes `[1]`.

- Bob picks `1`, `a` becomes empty, `c` remains `[1]`.

MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

Okay, so in this case, the output is `0`.

From these examples, it seems like the MEX depends on which numbers Alice manages to include in `c`, considering that Bob can remove elements that might help or hinder Alice's goal.

I need to find a general strategy for both players.

Let me think about the problem differently. Since Alice wants to maximize the MEX, she wants to include as many small integers in `c` as possible. Bob, wanting to minimize the MEX, would try to prevent Alice from including smaller integers in `c`.

Given that Bob can delete elements from `a` without adding them to `c`, he can remove elements that Alice might want to pick.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the array `a`. If a number appears only once, and Alice doesn't pick it, Bob can pick it and remove it from `a`, making it impossible for Alice to include it in `c`.

On the other hand, if a number appears multiple times, Alice can ensure that at least one of them makes it into `c`, because she can pick one, and even if Bob picks others, she can still have one in `c`.

Wait, but Bob can only pick one element per turn, just like Alice, but Alice also adds it to `c`.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's consider the frequency of each number in `a`.

- If a number `i` appears an even number of times, Bob can pair Alice's picks and remove them, preventing Alice from including `i` in `c`.

- If a number `i` appears an odd number of times, Alice can ensure that at least one of them makes it into `c`.

Wait, but this might not be entirely accurate, because the turns involve both players picking in turns.

Let me think in terms of the number of times each element appears.

Suppose we have counts of each number in `a`.

For each number `i`, if it appears `cnt[i]` times:

- If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can ensure that at least one `i` ends up in `c`.

- If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can ensure that no `i` ends up in `c`.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see:

- If `cnt[i]` is odd, say `cnt[i] = 2k + 1`.

- Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.

- Alice can pick `i` at least once, and Bob can pair the rest.

- So, Alice can ensure that one `i` is in `c`.

- If `cnt[i]` is even, say `cnt[i] = 2k`.

- Bob can pair Alice's picks and remove the counterparts, preventing `i` from being in `c`.

Wait, but this might not always be the case, because the game is more complex, with multiple numbers interacting.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of elements and who picks first.

Given that Alice starts first and both players play optimally, I need to determine for each number `i` whether Alice can include it in `c`.

Let me consider the numbers in increasing order, since MEX is about the smallest missing number.

I need to find the smallest `i` such that Alice cannot include `i` in `c`, despite her best efforts.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through `i` from `0` to `n`, and check if Alice can include `i` in `c`.

If she can include it, then it's in `c`, and I continue to the next `i`.

If she cannot, then that's the MEX.

Now, how do I determine if Alice can include `i` in `c`?

Given the frequency of `i` in `a`, and the total number of elements, I need to see if Alice can ensure that at least one `i` makes it into `c`.

Let's define:

- `cnt[i]`: frequency of `i` in `a`.

- Total elements `n`.

- Alice and Bob take turns, Alice first.

- Total turns: `n`.

- Alice's moves: ceil(n/2).

- Bob's moves: floor(n/2).

Wait, but in each turn, both pick one element, so total turns are `n`, with Alice picking on odd turns, Bob on even turns.

Wait, no. In each turn:

- Alice picks one element, adds it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.

- Bob picks one element, deletes it from `a`, does not add it to `c`.

So, for each turn, two elements are removed from `a` (one by Alice and one by Bob, except possibly if `n` is odd, the last pick is by Alice).

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

- Total elements: `n`.

- Each turn, one element is removed (since Alice picks and removes one, Bob picks and removes one).

- So, total turns: `n`.

- Alice's turns: ceil(n/2), since she starts first.

- Bob's turns: floor(n/2).

Wait, no. In `n` turns, Alice makes the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc., turns.

So, if `n` is even, Alice makes `n/2` turns, Bob makes `n/2` turns.

If `n` is odd, Alice makes `(n+1)/2` turns, Bob makes `(n-1)/2` turns.

But in this game, Alice not only picks but also adds to `c`, while Bob only picks and removes.

So, in terms of controlling which elements go into `c`, Alice has some power, but Bob can interfere by removing elements that Alice might want to pick later.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the count of each `i`.

For each `i`, I need to see if Alice can include at least one `i` in `c`.

If `cnt[i]` is the count of `i` in `a`.

- If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can ensure that at least one `i` is in `c`.

- If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can prevent Alice from including `i` in `c`.

Wait, is that accurate?

Let's consider:

- If `cnt[i]` is odd, say `cnt[i] = 2k + 1`.

- Alice can pick one `i` and add it to `c`.

- Bob can pair the remaining `2k` elements, removing them in pairs.

- So, Alice can ensure that at least one `i` is in `c`.

- If `cnt[i]` is even, `cnt[i] = 2k`.

- Bob can pair Alice's picks and remove the counterparts, preventing any `i` from being in `c`.

Wait, but this assumes that Bob can always pair Alice's picks.

In reality, the game is more complex because Alice can choose which elements to pick and add to `c`, and Bob can choose which to remove.

But perhaps this is a good starting point.

So, for each `i`, if `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can include `i` in `c`; if even, Bob can prevent it.

Given that, to find the MEX, I need to find the smallest `i` for which Alice cannot include `i` in `c`.

Which would be the smallest `i` with `cnt[i]` even.

Wait, but that seems too simplistic.

Let me check with the sample inputs.

**Sample Input 1:**

4

0 0 1 1

Counts:

0: 2 (even)

1: 2 (even)

So, according to this, the smallest `i` with even count is `0`, so MEX should be `0`. But in the sample output, it's `2`.

Wait, that contradicts my hypothesis.

Hmm.

**Sample Input 2:**

4

0 1 2 3

Counts:

0:1 (odd)

1:1 (odd)

2:1 (odd)

3:1 (odd)

According to my earlier idea, all counts are odd, so Alice can include all of them, so MEX should be the next number, which is `4`. But the sample output is `1`.

Wait, that doesn't match.

**Sample Input 3:**

2

1 1

Counts:

1:2 (even)

So, according to my earlier idea, the smallest `i` with even count is `0` (since `0` is missing and has count `0`, which is even), so MEX should be `0`, which matches the sample output.

But in the first sample input, my logic fails.

So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Let me think differently.

Let's consider that Alice wants to include as many small numbers as possible in `c`, and Bob wants to prevent that.

Given that, for each number `i`, starting from `0`, Alice will try to include it in `c`, and Bob will try to prevent it.

Given the counts of each number, the key is to see whether Alice can include `i` in `c` despite Bob's attempts.

Let me consider the game in terms of the number of times each number appears.

Suppose I have the count of each `i` in a frequency array.

For each `i` from `0` to `n`:

- If `cnt[i]` is 0, then `i` is not in `a`, so it's not in `c`, so MEX is `i`.

- If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can include one in `c`.

- If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can prevent Alice from including it in `c`.

So, the MEX would be the smallest `i` where `cnt[i]` is even.

Wait, but in the first sample input, `cnt[0]=2` (even), so MEX should be `0`, but the sample output is `2`.

Hence, my previous assumption is incorrect.

I need to think more carefully.

Let me look back at the first sample input.

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

Possible `c` is [1,0], MEX is `2`.

But according to my earlier logic, since `cnt[0]=2` (even), MEX should be `0`, but it's `2`.

So, perhaps my understanding is incomplete.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that even if `cnt[i]` is even, if there are other numbers with odd counts, Alice can still include `i` in `c`.

But that seems unclear.

Let me try to think in terms of the total number of elements and the parity of counts.

Another approach: think in terms of the number of available moves Alice has to include specific numbers.

Given that Alice starts first, and both players play optimally.

Perhaps I should consider the game as a selection process where Alice tries to pick the numbers she needs, and Bob tries to block her.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think about what numbers Alice can include in `c`.

Given that Alice can choose any element to add to `c`, and Bob can choose any element to remove, but Alice goes first.

Suppose Alice wants to include `i` in `c`. She can pick `i` and add it to `c`. Bob can try to remove `i` to prevent it, but if there are multiple `i`s, Alice can ensure at least one makes it to `c` if the count is odd.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the floor division of the count by 2.

If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can include one in `c`.

If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can prevent Alice from including any `i` in `c`.

Wait, but again, the first sample input contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include `i` in `c` if `cnt[i]` is at least 1, and the number of times Bob can remove `i` is floor(`cnt[i]` / 2).

So, the number of `i` in `c` would be `cnt[i] - floor(cnt[i] / 2)`, which is ceil(`cnt[i] / 2`).

So, Alice can include ceil(`cnt[i] / 2`) of each `i` in `c`.

But actually, since Bob can remove elements, it's not directly about how many Alice can include, but rather about whether Alice can ensure at least one `i` in `c`.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.

Let me consider that for each `i`, if `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can include one in `c`; if even, Bob can prevent Alice from including any `i` in `c`.

Then, the MEX would be the smallest `i` for which `cnt[i]` is even.

But as seen in the first sample input, `cnt[0]=2` (even), so MEX should be `0`, but the sample output is `2`.

This suggests that my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that if `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can prevent Alice from including `i` in `c`, but only if he focuses on that `i`.

However, Bob might have to defend multiple `i`s, and Alice can choose to pick other `i`s to force Bob to defend.

This seems complicated.

Let me try to think in terms of the total number of elements and the counts.

Suppose I have counts of each `i`.

Total elements `n`.

Alice makes ceil(n/2) picks, Bob makes floor(n/2) picks.

Alice wants to include as many small `i`s in `c` as possible.

Bob wants to prevent that.

Perhaps I need to iterate through `i` from `0` to `n` and check if Alice can include `i` in `c`.

For each `i`, check if Alice can ensure that at least one `i` makes it into `c`.

If she can, then `i` is in `c`, and proceed to the next `i`.

If she cannot, then that's the MEX.

To determine if Alice can include `i` in `c`, consider the counts.

If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can include one in `c`.

If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can pair Alice's picks and remove the counterparts, preventing Alice from including `i` in `c`.

But again, this logic doesn't match the sample input.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the game in terms of the remaining elements and the turns left.

This seems too involved.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program is:

from collections import Counter

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

mpp = Counter(arr)

first = False

for i in range(n):

if i not in mpp.keys():

print(i)

break

if mpp[i] == 1 and first:

print(i)

break

if mpp[i] == 1:

first = True

So, it's iterating from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, meaning `cnt[i] = 0`, it prints `i` and breaks.

- Else, if `cnt[i] == 1` and `first` is True, it prints `i` and breaks.

- Else, if `cnt[i] == 1`, it sets `first` to True.

Wait, what is `first` for?

Let me see.

`first` is initialized to False.

For each `i` in range `n`:

- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, print `i` and break.

- Else if `cnt[i] == 1` and `first` is True, print `i` and break.

- Else if `cnt[i] == 1`, set `first` to True.

So, it's looking for the first `i` that is not present, or the second occurrence of `cnt[i] == 1`.

Wait, that's not clear.

Let me try to understand with the first sample input.

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

mpp = Counter(a) => {0:2, 1:2}

Loop through i=0 to 3:

i=0: mpp[0]=2 !=1, and not not in mpp.keys()

i=1: mpp[1]=2 !=1

i=2: 2 not in mpp.keys(), so print 2 and break.

Which matches the sample output of `2`.

Okay, so in this case, it worked.

Let's see the second sample input.

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

mpp = {0:1,1:1,2:1,3:1}

Loop through i=0 to 3:

i=0: mpp[0]=1, set first=True

i=1: mpp[1]=1 and first=True, so print 1 and break.

Which matches the sample output of `1`.

Third sample input:

n=2

a=[1,1]

mpp={1:2}

Loop through i=0 to 1:

i=0: not in mpp.keys(), print 0 and break.

Which matches the sample output of `0`.

Okay, so in all sample cases, it seems to work.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to understand the logic behind this program.

It seems to print:

- The smallest `i` not in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] = 0`).

- If all `i` from `0` to `k-1` are in `a` with `cnt[i] >=1`, then it prints the smallest `i` with `cnt[i] ==1`, but only after at least one other `cnt[j] ==1` has been seen.

Wait, no.

Looking at the code:

- If `i` not in `mpp.keys()`, print `i` and break.

- Else if `cnt[i] ==1` and `first` is True, print `i` and break.

- Else if `cnt[i] ==1`, set `first` to True.

So, it prints the first `i` not in `a`, or if all `i` are in `a`, it prints the second occurrence of `cnt[i]==1`.

Wait, but in the second sample input, it printed `1`, which is `cnt[1]==1`, but it's not the second occurrence, because `cnt[0]==1` is the first.

Wait, `first` is set to True when the first `cnt[i]==1` is encountered, and then for the next `i` with `cnt[i]==1`, it prints it.

But in the second sample input, `i=0` has `cnt[0]==1`, sets `first=True`, then `i=1` has `cnt[1]==1` and `first=True`, so it prints `1`.

So, it's printing the second `i` with `cnt[i]==1`.

Wait, but in this case, it's printing `1`, which is correct according to the sample output.

But why is this the correct approach?

I'm not sure.

Let me think about what this program is doing.

It's essentially finding:

- The smallest `i` not present in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i]==0`).

- If all `i` from `0` to `k-1` are present at least once, then it finds the smallest `i` with `cnt[i]==1`, but only after at least one other `i` with `cnt[i]==1` has been seen.

Wait, in the second sample input, it printed `1`, which is the second `i` with `cnt[i]==1`.

But in the first sample input, all `i` from `0` to `1` are present with `cnt[i]>=1`, and there are no `i` with `cnt[i]==1`, so it printed the smallest `i` not in `a`, which is `2`.

Similarly, in the third sample input, `i=0` is not in `a`, so it printed `0`.

So, it seems like the program is finding:

- The smallest `i` not in `a`.

- If all `i` from `0` to `k-1` are in `a`, then it finds the smallest `i` with `cnt[i]==1`, but only if there is at least one other `i` with `cnt[i]==1`.

But I'm still not sure why this would correspond to the MEX of `c` when both play optimally.

Perhaps there's a different way to think about the problem.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many small `i`s in `c` as possible, and Bob wants to prevent that.

Given that, for each `i`, starting from `0`, Alice will try to include it in `c`, and Bob will try to prevent it.

If `cnt[i]` is odd, Alice can include one in `c`.

If `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can pair Alice's picks and remove the counterparts, preventing Alice from including `i` in `c`.

Therefore, the MEX would be the smallest `i` where either `cnt[i]==0` or `cnt[i]` is even.

Wait, but in the first sample input, `cnt[0]=2` (even), so MEX should be `0`, but the sample output is `2`.

Hmm, perhaps this is not correct.

Wait, maybe the MEX is the smallest `i` where `cnt[i]` is even and `i` is present in `a`.

But in the first sample input, `cnt[0]=2` (even), so MEX should be `0`, but it's `2`.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if `cnt[i]` is even, Bob can prevent Alice from including `i` in `c`, but Alice can still include other `i`s.

Wait, perhaps the MEX is the smallest `i` where `cnt[i]` is even, but only
