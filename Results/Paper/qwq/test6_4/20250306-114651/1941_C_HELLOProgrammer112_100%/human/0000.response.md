Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has a string, and he thinks it's ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Otherwise, it's beautiful. My task is to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters possible.

First, I need to understand what makes a string ugly. It's ugly if it contains either "pie" or "map" as substrings. So, my goal is to eliminate these substrings by deleting the least number of characters from the string.

Let me think about how to approach this. I need to count the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "pie" and "map" from the string.

One way to think about this is to find all the positions where "pie" or "map" appear and count how many characters are in these substrings. However, I have to be careful because there might be overlaps or overlaps between different substrings.

For example, in the string "mapie", "map" and "pie" overlap. So, if I just count the number of "map"s and "pie"s separately and add them up, I might double-count some characters. That would give me an incorrect total number of deletions.

So, I need to account for overlaps. Specifically, if there's an overlapping "map" and "pie", I should not count the overlapping characters twice.

Let me consider the example "mapie". Here, "map" and "pie" overlap on the 'p' and 'i'. So, to remove both "map" and "pie", I need to delete 'm', 'a', 'p', 'i', and 'e'. That's 5 characters. But wait, if I delete 'm', 'a', 'p', 'i', and 'e', that covers both "map" and "pie". Is there a way to do it with fewer deletions? Let's see.

If I delete 'm' and 'e', the string becomes "apie", which still contains "pie". So, that's not sufficient. If I delete 'm' and 'p', the string becomes "aie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie". So, that seems to work with two deletions. Is that the minimum? Let's see.

Another way: delete 'a' and 'p', resulting in "mie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie". So, again, two deletions suffice.

So, in this case, the minimum number of deletions is 2.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

a = int(input())

s = input()

x = s.count('map')

y = s.count('pie')

z = s.count('mapie')

print(x + y - z)

It counts the number of "map"s, "pie"s, and "mapie"s, and then prints x + y - z.

In the example above, "mapie" has one "map", one "pie", and one "mapie". So, x=1, y=1, z=1, and x + y - z = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1. But earlier, I thought that two deletions are needed. So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I miscounted. Let's see.

In "mapie", "map" starts at position 0, "pie" starts at position 2. So, the overlapping substring is "mapie", which contains both "map" and "pie". The code counts x=1, y=1, z=1, so x + y - z = 1, meaning one deletion is sufficient. But earlier, I thought two deletions are needed.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think differently.

Suppose I delete one character that is part of both "map" and "pie". For example, deleting 'p' in "mapie" would break both "map" and "pie". So, one deletion suffices. Wait, that makes sense. If I delete 'p', the string becomes "maie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie". So, one deletion is enough.

I must have miscalculated earlier. So, the code seems to be correct in this case.

Let me check another example.

Take "mmap". According to the problem, "mmap" is an ugly string because it contains "map". So, I need to remove "map" from it.

The string is "mmap".

Possible deletions:

- Delete the first 'm': string becomes "map", which still contains "map".

- Delete the second 'm': string becomes "map", which still contains "map".

- Delete 'a': string becomes "mmP", which doesn't contain "map". So, one deletion suffices.

According to the code:

x = s.count('map') = 1

y = s.count('pie') = 0

z = s.count('mapie') = 0

So, x + y - z = 1, which matches the required one deletion.

Good.

Another example: "ppiee"

Ugly because it contains "pie".

To make it beautiful, delete one 'p' from "pie", making it "piee", which doesn't contain "pie". So, one deletion suffices.

According to the code:

x = 0

y = 1

z = 0

So, x + y - z = 1, which matches.

Another example: "dfpiefghmap"

Ugly because it contains "pie" and "map".

Let's see:

"dfpiefghmap"

"pie" starts at position 2.

"map" starts at position 9.

No overlap between them.

So, need to delete characters from both.

If I delete the 'p' in "pie" and the 'm' in "map", the string becomes "dfiefghaP", which doesn't contain "pie" or "map". So, two deletions.

According to the code:

x = 1 (for "map")

y = 1 (for "pie")

z = 0 (no "mapie")

So, x + y - z = 2, which matches.

Another example: "ppiiee"

This doesn't contain "pie" or "map", so it's beautiful. So, zero deletions.

According to the code:

x = 0

y = 0

z = 0

x + y - z = 0, which is correct.

Another example: "mappppie"

Let's see:

Contains "map" starting at position 0.

Contains "pie" starting at position 5.

No overlap between them.

So, need to delete characters from both.

Delete 'm' from "map" and 'p' from "pie", resulting in "apppie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie". So, two deletions.

According to the code:

x = 1 (for "map")

y = 1 (for "pie")

z = 0 (no "mapie")

x + y - z = 2, which matches.

Another example: "mapie"

As before, one deletion suffices.

Wait, earlier I thought two deletions were needed, but actually one deletion suffices.

So, the code seems correct.

Let me think about the general case.

The code counts the number of "map"s and "pie"s, and subtracts the number of "mapie"s.

This seems to account for overlaps where "map" and "pie" overlap in "mapie".

By subtracting z, it avoids double-counting the overlapping characters.

Is this always correct?

Let me consider a string with multiple overlapping substrings.

For example: "mapiepie"

Here, "mapie" has one "map" and one "pie", overlapping.

Then, there's another "pie" starting at position 4.

So, x = 1 (for "map")

y = 2 (for two "pie"s)

z = 1 (for one "mapie")

So, x + y - z = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2.

Does this make sense?

To make the string beautiful, I need to remove both "map" and both "pie"s.

But there's overlap in the first "pie" and "map".

So, deleting 'p' from "mapie" would break both "map" and the first "pie", leaving the second "pie" intact.

Then, I need to delete another character from the second "pie".

So, total deletions: two.

Yes, matches the calculation.

Another example: "mapmapmap"

Each "map" is overlapping with the next one.

x = 3 (for three "map"s)

y = 0

z = 2 (for two "mapmap"s containing "mapie" like overlaps)

Wait, z is count of "mapie", but "mapmapmap" has no "mapie".

Wait, "mapie" is "map" + "pie" with overlap.

In "mapmapmap", there's no "ie" following "map" to form "mapie".

So, z = 0.

Thus, x + y - z = 3 + 0 - 0 = 3.

But how many deletions are actually needed?

Each "map" needs to be removed.

If I delete the 'm' from each "map", that's three deletions: positions 0, 3, 6.

Alternatively, deleting 'm' at positions 0, 3, 6 makes the string "apapap", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie".

So, three deletions are needed, which matches the calculation.

Seems correct.

Another example: "pipie"

Contains one "pie" starting at position 1.

So, x = 0

y = 1

z = 0

x + y - z = 1.

Indeed, deleting one 'p' from "pie" makes it "pie", which doesn't contain "pie". Wait, no.

Wait, "pipie" becomes "piie" if I delete one 'p' from "pie". But "piie" still contains "pie" from positions 1 to 3.

Wait, actually, "piie" is "p", "i", "i", "e", which doesn't contain "pie". So, it's beautiful.

Hence, one deletion suffices, which matches the calculation.

Another example: "pipie"

Wait, I just did that.

Let me think of another one.

"mapiepie"

Earlier, x + y - z = 2.

To make it beautiful, need to delete characters to remove both "map" and both "pie"s.

Deleting 'p' from the first "mapie" breaks the first "map" and first "pie", and deleting one 'p' from the second "pie" breaks the second "pie". So, two deletions, which matches.

Seems consistent.

Is there any case where this formula fails?

Let me think about a string with multiple overlapping "mapie"s.

For example: "mapiemapie"

Here, two "mapie"s.

x = 2 (two "map"s)

y = 2 (two "pie"s)

z = 2 (two "mapie"s)

x + y - z = 2 + 2 - 2 = 2.

How many deletions are needed?

Each "mapie" can be broken by deleting one 'p' from each "mapie", so two deletions: positions 1 and 7.

Resulting string: "maiemaie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie".

So, two deletions suffice, which matches the calculation.

Another case: "mapmapie"

Here, x = 2 (two "map"s)

y = 1 (one "pie")

z = 1 (one "mapie")

x + y - z = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2.

How many deletions are needed?

Delete 'p' from the first "map" and 'p' from "mapie". So, two deletions: positions 1 and 6.

Resulting string: "maapie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie".

Yes, matches.

I can't find a case where this formula fails.

Let me consider if there are more complex overlaps.

For example: "mapieie"

Here, "mapie" and "pie" starting at position 4.

x = 1 (one "map")

y = 2 (two "pie"s)

z = 1 (one "mapie")

x + y - z = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2.

To make it beautiful, delete 'p' from "mapie" and 'p' from the second "pie". So, two deletions: positions 1 and 5.

Resulting string: "maieie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie".

Again, matches.

Seems solid.

Another angle: what if there are multiple "pie"s without "map"?

For example: "pipiepie"

x = 0

y = 2

z = 0

x + y - z = 2.

To make it beautiful, delete one 'p' from each "pie": positions 1 and 4.

Resulting string: "piieie", which doesn't contain "pie".

Good.

What if "map" is inside "pie"?

Wait, "map" is three characters, "pie" is three characters. Overlap can only happen if they share middle characters.

Wait, "mapie" is the only overlap where "map" and "pie" share two characters.

Is there any other way they can overlap?

For example, "pamapie":

Here, "map" starting at position 1, "pie" starting at position 4.

No overlap between "map" and "pie".

x = 1

y = 1

z = 0

x + y - z = 2.

To make it beautiful, delete 'p' from "map" and 'p' from "pie": positions 2 and 5.

Resulting string: "aamie", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie".

Correct.

Seems consistent.

Is there a case where deleting one character can break multiple substrings?

For example, in "mapie", deleting 'p' breaks both "map" and "pie".

Yes, and the formula accounts for that by subtracting z.

I think this covers most scenarios.

Let me consider the edge case where the string is exactly "map" or "pie".

For "map":

x = 1

y = 0

z = 0

x + y - z = 1.

Indeed, one deletion suffices: delete 'm', resulting in "ap", which doesn't contain "map" or "pie".

Similarly for "pie":

x = 0

y = 1

z = 0

x + y - z = 1.

Delete 'p', resulting in "ie", which is fine.

Single character:

"p":

x = 0

y = 0

z = 0

x + y - z = 0.

Already beautiful.

Good.

Empty string is not considered since n >=1.

Another single character: "m":

x = 0

y = 0

z = 0

x + y - z = 0.

Beautiful.

Ok.

So, overall, the formula seems to work for various cases I can think of.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
