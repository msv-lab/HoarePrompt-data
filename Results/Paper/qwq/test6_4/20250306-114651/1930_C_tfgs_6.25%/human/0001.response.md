Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Stack has an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. He performs an operation `n` times, where in each operation he selects an index `i` (from 1 to the current length of `a`), inserts `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then deletes `a[i]` from `a`. After all operations, `S` will contain unique values, and I need to create an array `b` which is `S` sorted in decreasing order. The goal is to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

First, I need to understand what lexicographically largest means. It means that if we compare two arrays element by element, the one with the larger element at the first position where they differ is considered larger. So, to make `b` lexicographically largest, I need to maximize the first element, then the second, and so on.

Given that `S` is a set and only unique values are stored, inserting duplicates doesn't change `S`. So, my strategy should aim to include as many large unique values in `S` as possible.

Let me think about how the operations affect the array `a`. In each step, I choose an index `i`, insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and delete `a[i]` from `a`. The indices of elements to the right of the deleted element shift left by one.

Wait, the problem says "the indices of all elements to the right of `a_i` will decrease by 1." So, if I have `a = [2, 1]` and I choose `i=1`, I insert `2 + 1 = 3` into `S`, and delete `a[1]`, so `a` becomes `[1]`. If I then choose `i=1` again, I insert `1 + 1 = 2` into `S`, and delete `a[1]`, leaving `a` empty. So `S = {3, 2}`.

Alternatively, if I choose `i=2` first, insert `1 + 2 = 3` into `S`, and delete `a[2]`, so `a` becomes `[2]`. Then choose `i=1`, insert `2 + 1 = 3`, but since `3` is already in `S`, `S` remains `{3}`.

So, in the first approach, `b = [3, 2]`, and in the second, `b = [3]`. Clearly, `[3, 2]` is lexicographically larger than `[3]`.

From this example, it seems beneficial to choose elements in a way that introduces new unique values into `S`, preferably larger ones.

Let me consider another example: `a = [1, 100, 1000, 1000000, 1000000000]`. If I always choose the last element, I insert `1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005`, then `1000000 + 4 = 1000004`, then `1000 + 3 = 1003`, then `100 + 2 = 102`, and finally `1 + 1 = 2`. So `S = {1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2}`, and `b = [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]`.

If I chose differently, say, choose the first element first: `1 + 1 = 2`, then `100 + 2 = 102`, then `1000 + 3 = 1003`, then `1000000 + 4 = 1000004`, and finally `1000000000 + 5 = 1000000005`. So `S` is the same, and `b` is the same.

Wait, but the problem mentions that after n operations, a will be empty, and S will contain unique values. So, regardless of the order, S will contain the same values, as long as we don't insert duplicates.

But in the first test case, choosing different orders leads to different S, because inserting duplicates doesn't add to S.

Wait, in the first test case, `a = [2,1]`. If I choose `i=1` first, insert `2 + 1 = 3`, then choose `i=1`, insert `1 + 1 = 2`, so S = {3,2}. If I choose `i=2` first, insert `1 + 2 = 3`, then choose `i=1`, insert `2 + 1 = 3`, but since 3 is already in S, S remains {3}.

So, the order matters when inserting into S because of duplicates.

Hence, to maximize S and make b lexicographically largest, I need to maximize the number of unique large values in S.

So, my strategy should be to insert the largest possible unique values into S.

Given that, perhaps I should sort the array a in decreasing order and insert a[i] + i accordingly.

Wait, but the indices change as I delete elements.

This seems tricky.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider all possible a[i] + i for each i, and collect them into a set, since duplicates don't matter.

But in reality, I have to perform operations one by one, deleting one element each time.

But since the final S is just a set of unique a[i] + i, and I have to perform n operations, but some inserts might not add to S if the value already exists.

Wait, but in the end, S will contain unique values of a[i] + i that were inserted at least once, but some inserts might be redundant if the value was already inserted before.

But in terms of the final S, it's equivalent to the union of all a[i] + i that could be inserted in some order.

But the problem is to choose an order of operations to maximize the lexicographical order of b, which is S sorted in decreasing order.

Given that, I need to maximize the first element of b, then the second, and so on.

Given that S is sorted in decreasing order, the first element is the maximum possible a[i] + i.

To maximize the first element, I need to ensure that the maximum possible a[i] + i is included in S.

Similarly, for the second element, I need to include the next largest possible value that is not equal to the first, and so on.

Wait, but since S is a set, all elements are unique.

So, perhaps I can collect all possible a[i] + i, remove duplicates, and sort the remaining values in decreasing order.

But in the first test case, if I do that, a = [2,1], possible a[i] + i are 3 and 2, so S = {3,2}, b = [3,2].

In the second test case, a = [1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000], possible a[i] + i are 1+1=2, 100+2=102, 1000+3=1003, 1000000+4=1000004, 1000000000+5=1000000005, so S = {2,102,1003,1000004,1000000005}, b = [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2].

In the third test case, a = [6,4,8], possible a[i] + i are 6+1=7, 4+2=6, 8+3=11, so S = {7,6,11}, b = [11,7,6].

But in the first test case, if I choose i=2 first, insert 1+2=3, then choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, but since 3 is already in S, S remains {3}.

So, in this case, S = {3}, b = [3].

But if I choose i=1 first, insert 2+1=3, then choose i=2, insert 1+2=3, but since 3 is already in S, S remains {3}.

Wait, but in the first test case, the output is "3 2", which suggests that S = {3,2}.

So, it seems that in some orders, I can insert both 3 and 2, while in others, only 3.

Hence, the order matters in terms of when duplicates are inserted.

So, to maximize b, I need to maximize the number of unique large values in S.

Hence, perhaps I need to prioritize inserting larger unique values first.

Wait, but in the first test case, if I insert 2+1=3 first, then insert 1+2=3 again, which doesn't add to S.

But if I insert 1+2=3 first, then insert 2+1=3, which again doesn't add to S.

Wait, but according to the sample input, choosing i=1 first results in S = {3,2}, while choosing i=2 first results in S = {3}.

So, it seems that the order in which I choose indices affects which values are inserted into S.

Hence, I need to choose an order that allows me to insert as many unique large values as possible.

So, perhaps I should aim to insert the larger a[i] + i first, and then the smaller ones, but ensuring that I don't insert duplicates.

Wait, but in the first test case, inserting 2+1=3 first, then 1+2=3, results in S = {3,2}, because the second insert is actually 1+2=3, but since 3 is already in S, it doesn't add anything.

But according to the sample, choosing i=1 first gives S = {3,2}, which seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the index numbering.

Wait, the problem says "Select an index i such that 1 ≤ i ≤ |a|."

Then, "Insert a_i + i into S."

Then, "Delete a_i from a. Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1."

So, in the first test case, a = [2,1].

If I choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, then delete a[1], so a becomes [1].

Then, choose i=1 again, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S, which is new, so S = {3,2}.

If I choose i=2 first, insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S, then delete a[2], so a becomes [2].

Then, choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, which is already there, so S remains {3}.

Hence, choosing i=1 first allows me to insert both 3 and 2 into S, while choosing i=2 first only allows me to insert 3.

So, in this case, choosing the element that gives a new unique value is better.

Hence, to maximize S, I need to prioritize inserting new unique values, preferably larger ones.

But how do I generalize this?

Let me consider that in each step, I have a choice of which index to pick, and I need to pick the one that gives me the largest new unique value.

But the indices change as I delete elements.

This seems complicated to implement directly.

Is there a smarter way to approach this?

Wait, perhaps I can precompute all possible a[i] + i values, and their frequencies, and then construct S by picking the largest unique values as much as possible.

Wait, but some values might be dependent on the order in which I pick the indices.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the maximum possible S is the set of all unique a[i] + i, but in some orders, I might not be able to insert all of them.

In the first test case, S can be {3,2}, but in some orders, it's only {3}.

Hence, I need to maximize the number of unique values in S.

So, perhaps I should aim to insert as many unique large values as possible.

Wait, but how?

Let me consider that I can represent all possible a[i] + i values, and their frequencies.

Then, for each unique value, I can see how many times it appears in a[i] + i.

But since S is a set, it can only contain each value once.

Hence, the maximum number of elements in S is the number of unique a[i] + i.

But in the first test case, there are two unique a[i] + i: 3 and 2.

But depending on the order, S can be {3,2} or {3}.

Hence, it's not just about the number of unique a[i] + i, but also the order in which I insert them.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of unique a[i] + i that can be inserted before their duplicates are encountered in the sequence.

This sounds similar to selecting elements in a way that delays the insertion of duplicates.

Wait, but since S only keeps unique values, inserting duplicates doesn't change S.

Hence, the order in which I insert them affects whether I get to insert a new unique value or not.

So, to maximize the number of unique values in S, I should aim to insert unique values as much as possible.

In particular, I should prioritize inserting values that haven't been inserted yet.

But in practice, this means choosing indices that correspond to unique a[i] + i values.

But since I have to choose one index at a time, and the array shrinks each time, it's not straightforward to plan this in advance.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that in the end, S contains some subset of the possible a[i] + i values, with duplicates removed.

But the way I choose to delete elements from a affects which a[i] + i I can insert.

Wait, maybe I can model this as selecting a permutation of the elements of a, and computing a[i] + position in the permutation.

Wait, no, because the indices change as I delete elements.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I consider all possible a[i] + i, and sort them in decreasing order.

Then, I try to select as many unique a[i] + i as possible in this order, ensuring that I can insert them without duplicates.

Wait, but duplicates are already removed since S is a set.

Hence, perhaps the largest possible b is simply the sorted unique a[i] + i in decreasing order.

But in the first test case, that would be [3,2], which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, it's [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2], which also matches the sample.

In the third test case, [11,7,6], which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the solution is to collect all a[i] + i, take the unique values, sort them in decreasing order, and that's b.

But wait, in the first test case, if I just take unique a[i] + i, it's {3,2}, and sorting in decreasing order gives [3,2], which is correct.

But earlier I thought that depending on the order, S could be {3} or {3,2}.

But apparently, it's possible to have S={3,2}, which is the maximum possible.

Hence, perhaps the approach is to collect all unique a[i] + i, sort them in decreasing order, and that's the lexicographically largest b.

But I need to confirm if this is always possible.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose a = [1,1,1], n=3.

Possible a[i] + i are:

- a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

- a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

- a[3] + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4

So, unique values are {2,3,4}.

Hence, b = [4,3,2].

Is this achievable?

Yes, by choosing i=3 first, insert 1+3=4, then i=2, insert 1+2=3, then i=1, insert 1+1=2.

So, S={4,3,2}.

Alternatively, any order of choosing i would lead to S={4,3,2}, since all a[i] + i are unique.

Another example: a = [1,2,1], n=3.

Possible a[i] + i are:

- a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

- a[2] + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4

- a[3] + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4

Hence, unique values are {2,4}.

But depending on the order, can I get both 2 and 4?

Let's see:

Option 1:

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes [2,1].

Then choose i=1, insert 2+1=3, which is new, so S={2,3}.

Wait, but 3 is not in the unique a[i] + i initially.

Wait, a[2] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

Wait, no, a[2] is now 2, and i=1 refers to a[1]=2, so a[1] +1=3.

Then delete a[1], a becomes [1].

Then choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, which is already in S, so S={2,3}.

Hence, S={2,3}.

But 4 was possible, but in this order, I didn't get 4.

Option 2:

Choose i=2, insert a[2] +1=1 +2=3, delete a[2], a becomes [1,1].

Then choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, S={3,2}, delete a[1], a becomes [1].

Then choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, but 2 is already in S, so S remains {3,2}.

Hence, S={3,2}.

Option 3:

Choose i=3, insert a[3]+3=1+3=4, delete a[3], a becomes [1,2].

Then choose i=2, insert a[2]+2=2+2=4, but 4 is already in S, so S={4}.

Then choose i=1, insert a[1]+1=1+1=2, S={4,2}.

Hence, S={4,2}.

So, in this case, possible S are {2,3}, {3,2}, and {4,2}.

The one with the largest lexicographical order is {4,2}, which is [4,2], since 4 is larger than 3.

But according to my earlier approach, collecting unique a[i] + i would give {2,4}, sorted as [4,2], which matches.

Hence, it seems that collecting all unique a[i] + i and sorting them in decreasing order gives the lexicographically largest b.

Another example: a = [1,1,1,2], n=4.

Possible a[i] + i:

- a[1]+1=1+1=2

- a[2]+2=1+2=3

- a[3]+3=1+3=4

- a[4]+4=2+4=6

Unique values: {2,3,4,6}

Hence, b=[6,4,3,2]

Is this achievable?

Let's try:

Choose i=4, insert 2+4=6, delete a[4], a becomes [1,1,1].

Then choose i=3, insert 1+3=4, S={6,4}, delete a[3], a becomes [1,1].

Then choose i=2, insert 1+2=3, S={6,4,3}, delete a[2], a becomes [1].

Then choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, S={6,4,3,2}.

Hence, S={6,4,3,2}, which matches.

Another order:

Choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, delete a[1], a becomes [1,1,2].

Then choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, but 2 is already in S, so S={2}.

Then choose i=2, insert 1+2=3, S={2,3}, delete a[2], a becomes [1,2].

Then choose i=2, insert 2+2=4, S={2,3,4}, delete a[2], a becomes [1].

Then choose i=1, insert 1+1=2, which is already in S, so S={2,3,4}.

Hence, S={2,3,4}, which is less than [6,4,3,2].

Hence, the first approach is better.

Hence, it seems that collecting all unique a[i] + i and sorting them in decreasing order gives the lexicographically largest b.

Hence, the solution is:

- Compute a[i] + i for all i from 1 to n.

- Collect these values into a set to remove duplicates.

- Sort the set in decreasing order to get b.

- Output b.

Hence, the program should:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the array a of size n.

- Compute a[i] + i for each i from 1 to n.

- Create a set from these values to remove duplicates.

- Sort the set in decreasing order.

- Output the sorted list.

But in the program provided, it's slightly different.

Let's look at the given program.

From the code:

from collections import Counter

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

for i in range(n):

a[i] += i + 1

counter = Counter(a)

a = list(set(a))

a.sort(reverse=True)

cnt = n - len(a)

ans = []

for i in range(len(a)):

if i > 0:

adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])

for j in range(adv):

ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)

cnt -= adv

counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv

ans.append(a[i])

counter[a[i]] -= 1

for _ in range(cnt):

ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)

print(*ans)

So, it does the following:

- Read t.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read array a.

- For each element in a, add i + 1 to it (since Python is 0-indexed, but the problem is 1-indexed).

- Create a Counter of a.

- Create a list of unique a[i] + i, sorted in decreasing order.

- Calculate cnt = n - len(a_unique), which is the number of duplicates.

- Then, iterate through the unique a[i] + i in decreasing order, and for each, add some values to ans based on the difference between consecutive a[i] + i.

- Finally, add cnt elements decremented by 1 from the last element.

Wait, this seems more complicated than necessary.

Given that, according to my earlier reasoning, we can simply collect all unique a[i] + i, sort them in decreasing order, and output b.

But in the given program, it's doing something more involved, considering the differences between consecutive a[i] + i and adding intermediate values.

Is this necessary?

Let me check with the sample input.

First test case:

n=2

a=[2,1]

a[i] + i:

i=1: 2+1=3

i=2: 1+2=3

unique a[i] + i: {3}

But according to the sample, b=[3,2]

But according to my earlier reasoning, S can be {3,2}, which matches the sample.

But according to the unique a[i] + i, it's only {3}, but in reality, S can be {3,2}.

Hence, there must be something wrong with this approach.

Wait, in the first test case, a[i] + i are 3 and 3, but in reality, S can be {3,2}.

Wait, how is that possible?

Wait, in the operation, when I choose an index, I insert a[i] + i into S, and then delete a[i] from a, shifting the indices of the remaining elements.

Hence, the a[i] + i for the remaining elements changes based on the deletion.

Hence, simply collecting all unique a[i] + i doesn't account for the dynamic change in indices as elements are deleted.

Hence, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Hence, I need to find a way to model the process of choosing indices and deleting elements accordingly.

This seems more involved.

Let me think about it differently.

Perhaps I can model this as selecting a permutation of the elements of a, and for each position in the permutation, compute a[i] + position, where position is the order in which they are selected.

But the indices change as elements are deleted.

Wait, perhaps I can fix a sequence of indices to choose, taking into account the shrinking array.

But this seems too vague.

An alternative approach is to realize that the final S is equivalent to the set of a[i] + inv_i, where inv_i is the number of elements to the left of a[i] that are greater than a[i], plus one.

Wait, that might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that each element a[i] can be associated with a range of possible a[i] + i values based on its position.

But this is getting too abstract.

Let me look back at the given program.

It seems that the given program is trying to account for the duplicates and the differences between consecutive unique a[i] + i values.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to insert intermediate values between the unique a[i] + i to maximize the lexicographical order.

But I'm not sure.

Let me test the given program with the first test case.

First test case:

n=2

a=[2,1]

After a[i] += i +1:

a[0] += 1 => a[0] = 3

a[1] += 2 => a[1] = 3

counter = Counter({3:2})

a = list(set(a)) = [3]

a.sort(reverse=True) => [3]

cnt = n - len(a) = 2 -1 =1

ans = []

i=0:

since i=0, no if clause

ans.append(3)

counter[3] -=1 => counter[3]=1

then, for _ in range(cnt=1):

ans.append(ans[-1]-1) => ans.append(3-1)=2

Hence, ans=[3,2], which matches the sample.

Second test case:

n=5

a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

a[i] +=i+1:

a[0]+1=2

a[1]+2=102

a[2]+3=1003

a[3]+4=1000004

a[4]+5=1000000005

counter = Counter({2:1,102:1,1003:1,1000004:1,1000000005:1})

a = list(set(a)) = [2,102,1003,1000004,1000000005]

a.sort(reverse=True) = [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

cnt = n - len(a) =5-5=0

ans = []

i=0:

i>0 is False, so append a[0]=1000000005

counter[1000000005]-=1 => counter[1000000005]=0

i=1:

a[i-1]=1000000005

a[i]=1000004

adv = min(1000000005 - 1000004 -1, 0, counter[1000000005]) = min(999999999,0,0)=0

so, no addition, append a[1]=1000004

counter[1000004]-=1 => counter[1000004]=0

i=2:

a[i-1]=1000004

a[i]=1003

adv = min(1000004 -1003 -1,0,counter[1000004])=min(999999,0,0)=0

append a[2]=1003

counter[1003]-=1 => counter[1003]=0

i=3:

a[i-1]=1003

a[i]=102

adv = min(1003-102-1,0,counter[1003])=min(899,0,0)=0

append a[3]=102

counter[102]-=1 => counter[102]=0

i=4:

a[i-1]=102

a[i]=2

adv = min(102-2-1,0,counter[102])=min(99,0,0)=0

append a[4]=2

counter[2]-=1 => counter[2]=0

then, for _ in range(cnt=0): do nothing

Hence, ans=[1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2], which matches the sample.

Third test case:

n=3

a=[6,4,8]

a[i] +=i+1:

a[0]+1=7

a[1]+2=6

a[2]+3=11

counter = Counter({7:1,
