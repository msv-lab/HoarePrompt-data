Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of length 2n, and it contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. Then there's this integer k, which is between 1 and n/2 floor. I need to find two arrays, l and r, each of length 2k. 

Specifically, l should be a subset of the first n elements of the array, and r should be a subset of the last n elements. Moreover, the bitwise XOR of the elements in l should be equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in r. And it's guaranteed that at least one such pair exists, which is good to know.

First, I need to understand what a subset means in this context. It says that a subset can be obtained by deleting several elements from the sequence and possibly rearranging them. So, order doesn't matter here, which is important because XOR is commutative and associative. That means the order in which we XOR the elements doesn't matter; the result will be the same.

So, my goal is to select 2k elements from the first n elements (for l) and 2k elements from the last n elements (for r) such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the array, once in the first n and once in the second n, I need to think about how to pair them up.

Let me consider the properties of XOR. XOR of a number with itself is zero, and XOR is associative and commutative. That means I can group and reorder the XOR operations as I like.

Perhaps I can think about the XOR of all elements in the first n and the XOR of all elements in the last n. Since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, the XOR of the entire array should be zero, because each number XORed with itself gives zero, and zero XORed with anything is itself.

Wait, no. Actually, since each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and XOR is associative and commutative, the XOR of the entire array would be zero, because for each number x, x XOR x is zero, and zero XOR zero is zero, and so on.

So, the XOR of the first n elements is equal to the XOR of the last n elements, because the XOR of the entire array is zero.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again.

If the XOR of the entire array is zero, and the XOR of the first n elements is A, and the XOR of the last n elements is B, then A XOR B is equal to the XOR of the entire array, which is zero. Therefore, A XOR B = 0, which implies that A = B.

So, the XOR of the first n elements is equal to the XOR of the last n elements.

That's an important observation.

Now, I need to find two subsets, l and r, each of length 2k, such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Given that, perhaps I can select some pairs of identical numbers, since each number appears exactly twice, once in the first n and once in the last n.

Wait, but the problem says that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, but it doesn't specify where they are located. They could be distributed anywhere in the first n or the last n.

Wait, actually, no. The array is of length 2n, and the first n elements are a1 to an, and the last n elements are a(n+1) to a(2n). So, for each number from 1 to n, one occurrence is in the first n, and the other is in the last n.

Wait, no. The problem says: "l is a subset of [a1, a2, ..., an]" and "r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, ..., a2n]". Also, "every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a."

So, each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array a, once in the first n and once in the last n.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. The problem doesn't specify that each number appears once in the first n and once in the last n. It just says that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array.

But, given that the array is of length 2n, and it's split into two parts of n each, it's possible that a number appears twice in the first n or twice in the last n.

Wait, no. Actually, the problem specifically says that l is a subset of the first n elements and r is a subset of the last n elements.

Wait, no, it says:

*l is a subset of [a1, a2, ..., an]

*r is a subset of [an+1, an+2, ..., a2n]

And it's guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a.

So, it's possible that a number appears twice in the first n or twice in the last n.

Wait, but the problem says that l is a subset of the first n elements and r is a subset of the last n elements.

So, I need to select elements for l from the first n elements and elements for r from the last n elements, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array.

Given that, it's possible that a number appears twice in the first n or twice in the last n.

Wait, but the note in the problem description says, for the first test case:

"In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1]. [2,1] is a subset of [a1,a2] and [2,1] is a subset of [a3,a4], and 2 xor 1 = 2 xor 1 = 3."

So, in this case, both 1 and 2 appear once in the first two elements and once in the last two elements.

Wait, but the problem doesn't prevent numbers from appearing twice in the same half.

Wait, actually, in the first test case, a = [1,2,2,1], so 1 appears once in the first n ([1,2]) and once in the last n ([2,1]), and similarly for 2.

Wait, no, in this case, a1=1, a2=2, a3=2, a4=1.

So, in the first n: [1,2], in the last n: [2,1].

So, 1 appears once in the first n and once in the last n, and similarly for 2.

Is this always the case? The problem says:

"l is a subset of [a1,a2,…,an]

r is a subset of [an+1,an+2,…a2n]

It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a."

So, it's possible that a number appears twice in the first n or twice in the last n, but in the examples, it seems that each number appears once in the first n and once in the last n.

Wait, but the problem doesn't guarantee that. So, I need to consider the possibility that a number appears twice in the first n or twice in the last n.

Wait, but if a number appears twice in the first n, then it doesn't appear in the last n, and vice versa.

Wait, no. If a number appears twice in the first n, then it doesn't appear in the last n, because each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

Similarly, if a number appears twice in the last n, it doesn't appear in the first n.

So, for each number from 1 to n, it can appear either twice in the first n, twice in the last n, or once in the first n and once in the last n.

But, in the problem statement, in the note, it shows that numbers appear once in the first n and once in the last n, but according to the problem statement, it's not necessarily the case.

Wait, but in the example, it's shown that numbers can appear once in each half, but according to the problem statement, it's possible for a number to appear twice in one half and not at all in the other half.

So, I need to handle all these cases.

Now, I need to find two subsets, l and r, each of length 2k, such that the XOR of l equals the XOR of r.

Given that, I need to find a way to select elements from the first n for l and from the last n for r, such that their XORs are equal.

Given that the XOR of the entire first n is equal to the XOR of the entire last n, as I reasoned earlier.

Wait, earlier I thought that the XOR of the first n equals the XOR of the last n, because the XOR of the entire array is zero.

But, actually, the XOR of the entire array is zero only if n is even, because each number from 1 to n appears twice, and x XOR x is zero for each x, and zero XOR zero is zero.

Wait, no. Actually, if n is even, the XOR of the entire array is zero, because you have pairs of numbers, each pair x XOR x equals zero, and zero XOR zero is zero.

But if n is odd, then the XOR of the entire array would be the XOR of all numbers from 1 to n, each appearing twice.

Wait, no, again, x XOR x is zero for any x, so even if n is odd, the XOR of the entire array would still be zero, because zero XOR x XOR x is zero, and so on.

Wait, no, hold on.

If n is odd, and each number from 1 to n appears twice, then the XOR of the entire array would be zero, because each pair x XOR x is zero, and zero XOR zero is zero.

Similarly, if n is even, the XOR of the entire array is also zero.

So, in any case, the XOR of the first n elements is equal to the XOR of the last n elements, because the XOR of the entire array is zero, meaning that the XOR of the first n is equal to the XOR of the last n.

Wait, no.

Let me think carefully.

Let A be the first n elements, and B be the last n elements.

Then, XOR of A plus XOR of B equals XOR of the entire array.

Given that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice in the entire array, the XOR of the entire array is zero, because x XOR x is zero for each x.

Therefore, XOR(A) XOR XOR(B) = 0, which implies that XOR(A) = XOR(B).

So, the XOR of the first n elements is equal to the XOR of the last n elements.

That's a crucial observation.

Now, I need to find two subsets, l and r, each of length 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(A) = XOR(B), perhaps I can exploit this property.

Let me think about the properties of subsets and XOR.

I need to select l from A and r from B, each of size 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(A) = XOR(B), perhaps I can select subsets in a way that their XOR matches.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), where XOR corresponds to addition modulo 2.

But that might be too complicated for this problem.

Let me think of a simpler approach.

One idea is to select k pairs of identical elements, one from A and one from B, and include them in l and r respectively.

Wait, but it's not guaranteed that such pairs exist.

Wait, actually, for each number from 1 to n, one occurrence is in A and one in B, but it's possible that a number appears twice in A or twice in B.

Wait, no, as I thought earlier, if a number appears twice in A, it doesn't appear in B, and vice versa.

Wait, no, actually, if a number appears twice in A, then it doesn't appear in B at all, because each number appears exactly twice in the entire array.

So, for each number, it can appear either twice in A, twice in B, or once in A and once in B.

Now, if a number appears twice in A and not in B, or twice in B and not in A, that affects the possible XOR values.

Wait, but given that XOR(A) = XOR(B), perhaps I can use that to my advantage.

Let me consider different cases.

Case 1: a number appears twice in A and not in B.

Case 2: a number appears twice in B and not in A.

Case 3: a number appears once in A and once in B.

Given that, I need to find subsets l from A and r from B, each of size 2k, with XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that XOR(A) = XOR(B), perhaps I can select subsets that respect this equality.

Wait, maybe I can select certain elements to include in l and r such that their XOR matches.

Let me consider that for numbers that appear once in A and once in B, I can pair them up, and including both in l and r would give the same XOR contribution.

Wait, but I need to select 2k elements for l and 2k for r.

Wait, perhaps I can group the elements into pairs where each pair consists of one element from A and one from B that have the same value, and then select k such pairs to include in l and r.

But, the problem is that it's not guaranteed that such pairs exist for all numbers.

Wait, but in the example, they have pairs like that.

Wait, in the first test case, a = [1,2,2,1], so 1 appears once in A and once in B, and 2 appears once in A and once in B.

In the second test case, a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4], which is n=6, so a1 to a6: [6,4,2,1,2,3], a7 to a12: [1,6,3,5,5,4].

So, 1 appears once in A and once in B, 2 appears twice in A and not in B, 3 appears once in A and once in B, 4 appears once in A and once in B, 5 appears twice in B and not in A, 6 appears once in A and once in B.

Wait, no, looking at a = [6,4,2,1,2,3,1,6,3,5,5,4], so a1 to a6: [6,4,2,1,2,3], a7 to a12: [1,6,3,5,5,4].

So, number 1: appears once in A (a4=1) and once in B (a7=1).

Number 2: appears twice in A (a3=2, a5=2) and not in B.

Number 3: appears once in A (a6=3) and once in B (a8=3).

Number 4: appears once in A (a2=4) and once in B (a12=4).

Number 5: appears twice in B (a10=5, a11=5) and not in A.

Number 6: appears once in A (a1=6) and once in B (a7=6).

So, in this case, numbers 2 and 5 appear twice in A and not in B, or twice in B and not in A.

Wait, no, number 2 appears twice in A and not in B, number 5 appears twice in B and not in A.

Given that, in this test case, k=1, so I need to select 2 elements for l and 2 elements for r, such that their XORs are equal.

In the sample output, l = [6,4] and r = [1,3].

So, XOR of l: 6 XOR 4 = 2, XOR of r: 1 XOR 3 = 2, which matches.

Another way to select would be l = [2,2] and r = [5,5], but in this case, [2,2] is a subset of A, and [5,5] is a subset of B, and 2 XOR 2 = 0, and 5 XOR 5 = 0, which also matches.

But in the sample output, they chose different elements.

So, there can be multiple solutions.

Now, how to approach this in general.

I need a way to select 2k elements from A and 2k from B, such that their XORs are equal.

Given that XOR(A) = XOR(B), perhaps I can select subsets such that their XOR contributes to the total XOR in a way that they balance out.

Wait, maybe I can select pairs of elements that have the same XOR value in A and B.

But that seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that since each number appears exactly twice in the entire array, and A and B are halves, I can think in terms of the numbers that appear in both A and B, and those that appear only in A or only in B.

So, for numbers that appear once in A and once in B, I can pair them up.

For numbers that appear twice in A and not in B, or twice in B and not in A, I can handle them separately.

Wait, perhaps I can categorize the numbers into three groups:

1. Numbers that appear once in A and once in B.

2. Numbers that appear twice in A and not in B.

3. Numbers that appear twice in B and not in A.

Then, for group 1, I can pair them up, and for groups 2 and 3, I can use the pairs within A or B.

But I need to ensure that the total XOR of the selected elements in l and r match.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

Since XOR is associative and commutative, the order doesn't matter.

Also, XOR of a set of elements is essentially the sum modulo 2 of the binary representations of the elements.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra, where each number corresponds to a vector in GF(2)^m, where m is the number of bits.

But that might be overkill for this problem.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Given that XOR(A) = XOR(B), and I need to select subsets l from A and r from B such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me denote XOR(A) as S.

Then, XOR(B) is also S.

Now, if I select a subset l from A, then XOR(l) is some value, say X.

Then, I need to select a subset r from B such that XOR(r) = X.

Given that XOR(B) = S, and XOR(r) = X, then the XOR of the remaining elements in B would be S XOR X.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think about selecting l and r such that XOR(l) XOR XOR(r) = 0, which is equivalent to XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Given that, and knowing that XOR(A) = XOR(B) = S, perhaps I can select l and r in a way that their XORs are equal.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the elements and try to match the XOR values.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider the following approach:

- First, identify numbers that appear once in A and once in B.

- For these numbers, pairing them in l and r would contribute the same value to XOR(l) and XOR(r).

- Then, for numbers that appear twice in A or twice in B, I can use them to adjust the XOR values.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let A be the first n elements.

- Let B be the last n elements.

- Let S = XOR(A) = XOR(B).

Now, suppose I select a subset l from A, and a subset r from B, both of size 2k, such that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me denote XOR(l) = X, then I need XOR(r) = X.

Given that XOR(B) = S, and XOR(r) = X, then the XOR of the remaining elements in B is S XOR X.

Similarly, XOR(A) = S, and XOR(l) = X, so the XOR of the remaining elements in A is S XOR X.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think about selecting l and r such that the XOR of l and r together is equal to S XOR S = 0.

Wait, but l is subset of A, r is subset of B, and A and B together make the entire array, whose XOR is zero.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I select l from A and r from B, each of size 2k.

I need XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me consider that l and r are chosen such that the XOR of their elements is equal.

I need to find such subsets.

Given that, perhaps I can look for elements that can be paired to contribute to the XOR in a balanced way.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider small values of k and see.

For k=1, I need to select 2 elements from A and 2 elements from B, such that XOR of l equals XOR of r.

Given that, perhaps I can select two identical elements from A and two identical elements from B.

But that might not always be possible.

Wait, in the first test case, l=[2,1] and r=[2,1], which are not identical elements, but their XORs match.

Wait, in the second test case, l=[6,4] and r=[1,3], whose XORs are both 2.

Another possibility is to select elements such that their XOR cancels out appropriately.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me think about the properties of XOR again.

Since XOR is associative and commutative, I can group elements in any order.

Let me consider that for numbers that appear twice in A or twice in B, their XOR contribution is zero.

So, if a number appears twice in A, including both in l would contribute zero to XOR(l).

Similarly, if a number appears twice in B, including both in r would contribute zero to XOR(r).

Perhaps I can use these pairs to adjust the XOR values.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me categorize the numbers:

- Let C be the set of numbers that appear once in A and once in B.

- Let D be the set of numbers that appear twice in A and not in B.

- Let E be the set of numbers that appear twice in B and not in A.

For each number in C, I can choose to include both its occurrences in l and r, which would contribute the same to XOR(l) and XOR(r).

For numbers in D, I can include both their occurrences in l, which would contribute zero to XOR(l).

Similarly, for numbers in E, I can include both their occurrences in r, which would contribute zero to XOR(r).

Given that, perhaps I can select enough pairs from C, D, and E to make up the required 2k elements in l and r, while ensuring that XOR(l) = XOR(r).

Let me think about the minimal number of pairs needed.

Each pair from C contributes the same value to l and r.

Each pair from D contributes zero to l.

Each pair from E contributes zero to r.

So, if I select m pairs from C, p pairs from D, and q pairs from E, such that 2(m + p) <= 2k for l, and 2(m + q) <= 2k for r, and m + p <= k for l, and m + q <= k for r.

Wait, no, since each pair consists of 2 elements, 2(m + p) elements in l, and 2(m + q) elements in r, and I need exactly 2k elements in each.

So, 2(m + p) = 2k, and 2(m + q) = 2k, which simplifies to m + p = k and m + q = k.

From these, p = k - m and q = k - m.

So, p = q = k - m.

So, for a given m, p and q are both k - m.

Now, m is the number of pairs from C that I select.

Then, p = k - m pairs from D, and q = k - m pairs from E.

Now, I need to ensure that m <= |C|/2, because each pair from C consists of one element from A and one from B.

Wait, no, for C, since each number appears once in A and once in B, each pair from C consists of one element from A and one from B.

Wait, no, a pair from C would be the number itself, but since it appears once in A and once in B, selecting both would mean selecting one for l and one for r.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.

Let me define:

- For C, the set of numbers that appear once in A and once in B.

- For D, the set of numbers that appear twice in A and not in B.

- For E, the set of numbers that appear twice in B and not in A.

Now, for C, for each number c in C, I can choose to include c from A in l and c from B in r.

Then, XOR(l) would have c, and XOR(r) would have c, so their XORs would be equal.

For D, for each number d in D, which appears twice in A, including both in l would contribute d XOR d = 0 to XOR(l).

Similarly, for E, for each number e in E, which appears twice in B, including both in r would contribute e XOR e = 0 to
