Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the array a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on a particular day, then for all the subsequent days, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets in total, across these n days, spending the minimum possible amount of money.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example provided to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 tickets on day 1. Prices for remaining days become [6, 4, 2]

- Buy 0 tickets on day 2. Prices for remaining days become [4, 2]

- Buy 1 ticket on day 3. Cost = 4. Prices for remaining days become [3]

- Buy 2 tickets on day 4. Cost = 6 (since price is now 3 + 2 = 5 per ticket, but wait, let's double-check this.)

Wait, the problem says that if you buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x. So, if I buy 1 ticket on day 3, then from day 4 onwards, the price increases by 1.

Initially, prices are [8,6,4,2].

- Day 1: Buy 0 tickets. So, no price increase for subsequent days. Prices remain [6,4,2].

- Day 2: Buy 0 tickets. No price increase again. Prices remain [4,2].

- Day 3: Buy 1 ticket. Cost = 4 (current price). Then, from day 4 onwards, price increases by 1. So, day 4 price becomes 2 + 1 = 3.

- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 3 = 6.

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

Okay, that matches the example.

Another test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

prices = [8,6,4,2]

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 8 = 16. Prices for remaining days become [8+2=10, 6+2=8, 4+2=6]

- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 10 = 20. Prices for remaining days become [10+2=12, 8+2=10]

- Day 3: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 12 = 24. Prices for remaining days become [12+2=14]

- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 14 = 28.

Total cost = 16 + 20 + 24 + 28 = 88.

But in the example, it says the output is 64. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, let's read the example again.

In the second test case, the output is 64, but according to my calculation, it's 88. Maybe I misunderstood the price increase mechanism.

Wait, the problem says: "If a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days (i.e., from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x."

So, in the second test case:

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 8 = 16. Prices for days 2-4 become [6+2=8, 4+2=6, 2+2=4]

- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 8 = 16. Prices for days 3-4 become [6+2=8, 4+2=6]

- Day 3: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 8 = 16. Price for day 4 becomes 4+2=6

- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 6 = 12

Total cost = 16 + 16 + 16 + 12 = 60. But the example says 64. Hmm, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the price increases.

Let's try again:

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 8 = 16. Prices for days 2-4 increase by 2, so new prices: [8+2=10, 6+2=8, 4+2=6]

- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 10 = 20. Prices for days 3-4 increase by another 2, so new prices: [8+2=10, 6+2+2=10, 4+2+2=8]

- Day 3: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 10 = 20. Price for day 4 increases by another 2, so new price: [10+2=12]

- Day 4: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 12 = 24

Total cost = 16 + 20 + 20 + 24 = 80. Still not matching the example's 64.

Wait, maybe buying fewer tickets on earlier days and more on later days is cheaper.

Let's try:

- Day 1: Buy 0 tickets. Cost = 0. Prices for days 2-4 remain [6,4,2]

- Day 2: Buy 0 tickets. Cost = 0. Prices for days 3-4 remain [4,2]

- Day 3: Buy 2 tickets. Cost = 2 * 4 = 8. Prices for day 4 increase by 2, so [2+2=4]

- Day 4: Buy 6 tickets. Cost = 6 * 4 = 24

Total cost = 0 + 0 + 8 + 24 = 32. Wait, that's less than 64. But perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.

Wait, the problem says "the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day is m", which in this case m=2, so I can't buy 6 tickets on day 4. So that approach is invalid.

Wait, m=2, so I can't buy more than 2 tickets per day.

So, in this case, the maximum I can buy per day is 2, and I need to buy 8 tickets, so I have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days.

Given that, perhaps there's a better way to distribute the purchases.

Wait, maybe purchasing fewer tickets on some days and more on others isn't allowed because of the m constraint.

Given that m=2 and k=8, and n=4, I have to buy exactly 2 tickets each day.

Given that, perhaps the minimum cost is achieved by buying 2 tickets each day at the lowest possible prices.

But in this case, buying 2 tickets each day at the increasing prices results in a total cost of 88, but the example shows 64.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that buying tickets on later days can be cheaper if the price on those days is lower.

But in this problem, buying tickets on a later day increases the price for even later days.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this problem differently.

Let me think about this.

Each day, I can decide how many tickets to buy on that day, up to m.

Each time I buy x tickets on a day, the price for all subsequent days increases by x.

I need to buy exactly k tickets in total.

I need to minimize the total cost.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem, where the state is the current day and the number of tickets already bought.

But with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me think about the constraints.

- n can be up to 3e5

- m can be up to 1e9

- k can be up to 1e9

- a_i can be up to 1e9

Given that, I need an O(n log n) or better solution.

Perhaps I can think of this problem as assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to a day contributes to the price increase for all subsequent days.

Wait, maybe I can model this as assigning k tickets across n days, with each ticket on a day contributing to the price increase for all subsequent days.

This sounds similar to problems where elements have effects on future elements.

Let me consider the total cost.

Suppose I buy x_i tickets on day i.

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

Because each x_j for j < i increases the price on day i by x_j.

So, total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i * a_i) + sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's another way to look at it.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on day i affects the prices of all subsequent days.

So, the cost of buying a ticket on day i is not just a_i, but a_i plus the sum of all x_j for j < i.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of prefix sums.

Let me define prefix[i] = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + prefix[i-1])

Because prefix[i-1] is the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + prefix[i-1])

Which is sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i * a_i) + sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i * prefix[i-1])

This still seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_i, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m for all i.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize this.

This seems complicated to minimize directly.

Maybe I can reorder the days in some way to minimize the total cost.

Let me think about the greedy approach.

Suppose I want to buy tickets on the days where the price is lowest, but considering the price increase due to previous purchases.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize buying tickets on the days where the price is lowest, before considering days with higher prices.

But with the price increases depending on previous purchases, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on a day increases the price for all subsequent days.

So, buying a ticket on an earlier day has a larger impact on the total cost, because it increases the price for all remaining days.

Whereas buying a ticket on a later day affects fewer subsequent days.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I should try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest prices, but considering the price increases accumulated up to that day.

Wait, maybe I should prioritize buying tickets on days with the lowest adjusted prices, where the adjusted price takes into account the price increase due to previous purchases.

But this seems circular.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of their initial prices.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest prices, considering the price increases.

But I need to account for the fact that buying tickets on earlier days in this sorted list will increase the prices for later days.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to use a priority queue to always buy tickets on the day with the current lowest price.

But I need to update the prices correctly as I buy tickets.

Let me think about implementing that.

I can initialize a min-heap with the initial prices and their day indices.

Then, for each ticket I need to buy (total k tickets), I buy one ticket on the day with the lowest current price (from the heap).

Each time I buy a ticket on a particular day, I need to increase the price for all subsequent days by 1.

But with n up to 3e5, and k up to 1e9, this approach would be too slow because it's O(k log n), which is about 1e9 * 20 = 2e10 operations, which is way too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the price increase is additive for each ticket bought on previous days.

So, the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

I need to minimize the total cost, which is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j)

This seems like a quadratic function in terms of x_i.

Maybe I can rearrange it.

Let me denote s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

So, the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}

Therefore, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

And s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i

Wait, s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i

So, cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_i - x_i) = x_i * a_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2

Total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2)

But s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

I'm getting tangled here.

Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * p_i, where p_i is the price per ticket on day i, which is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, p_i = a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j

Therefore, total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * p_i = sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j)

This seems difficult to minimize directly.

Perhaps I can consider the dual problem or find a way to assign tickets to days optimally.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of assigning tickets to days such that the total cost is minimized, considering that each ticket assigned to a day contributes to the price increase for all subsequent days.

This sounds similar to assigning tasks with dependencies or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a minimum cost assignment problem, but that might be too slow for the constraints.

Let me think about the properties of the optimal solution.

Suppose I have two days, day 1 with price a1 and day 2 with price a2, and a1 < a2.

Intuitively, I would want to buy as many tickets as possible on day 1, because it has a lower price.

But, buying tickets on day 1 increases the price for day 2.

So, there's a trade-off.

I need to balance between buying tickets on lower-priced days and the resulting price increases for higher-priced days.

This is tricky.

Let me consider a simple case with n=2, m=infinity (no constraint on m), k=total tickets to buy.

Say n=2, m=1e9, k=5

prices = [1, 2]

Option 1: Buy all 5 tickets on day 1.

- Cost: 5 * 1 = 5

- Price for day 2 becomes 2 + 5 = 7, but since we're not buying any tickets on day 2, it doesn't matter.

Option 2: Buy 4 tickets on day 1 and 1 on day 2.

- Cost: 4 * 1 + 1 * (2 + 4) = 4 + 6 = 10

Option 3: Buy 3 on day 1 and 2 on day 2.

- Cost: 3 * 1 + 2 * (2 + 3) = 3 + 10 = 13

Option 4: Buy 2 on day 1 and 3 on day 2.

- Cost: 2 * 1 + 3 * (2 + 2) = 2 + 12 = 14

Option 5: Buy 1 on day 1 and 4 on day 2.

- Cost: 1 * 1 + 4 * (2 + 1) = 1 + 12 = 13

Option 6: Buy 0 on day 1 and 5 on day 2.

- Cost: 0 + 5 * 2 = 10

So, the minimum cost is 5, which is buying all tickets on the first day.

This makes sense because the first day has the lowest price, and even though it increases the price for the second day, since we're not buying any tickets on the second day, it doesn't matter.

Another example: n=2, m=2, k=3, prices=[1,2]

Option 1: Buy 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2.

- Cost: 2*1 + 1*(2+2) = 2 + 4 = 6

Option 2: Buy 1 on day 1 and 2 on day 2.

- Cost: 1*1 + 2*(2+1) = 1 + 6 = 7

So, better to buy more on the first day.

Another example: n=3, m=2, k=3, prices=[1,2,3]

Option 1: Buy 2 on day 1, 1 on day 2.

- Cost: 2*1 + 1*(2+2) = 2 + 4 = 6

- Day 3 price: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6, but not buying on day 3.

Option 2: Buy 1 on day 1, 2 on day 2.

- Cost: 1*1 + 2*(2+1) = 1 + 6 = 7

Option 3: Buy 1 on day 1, 1 on day 2, 1 on day 3.

- Cost: 1*1 + 1*(2+1) + 1*(3+1+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

So, Option 1 is better.

Seems like buying as many as possible on the first day is better when possible.

But, what if m is small compared to k?

Wait, in the first test case, n=4, m=2, k=3, and the optimal is to buy 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, totaling 10.

But according to my earlier thought, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 might be better.

Wait, let's calculate that.

- Buy 2 on day 1: cost = 2*8 = 16. Prices for days 2-4 become [6+2=8,4+2=6,2+2=4]

- Buy 1 on day 2: cost = 1*8 = 8. Prices for days 3-4 become [6+1=7,4+1=5]

- Don't buy on day 3 and day 4.

Total cost = 16 + 8 = 24.

But in the example, the optimal is 10.

So, buying on later days can be cheaper.

Wait, perhaps buying on days with lower original prices, even if they are later, is better.

But in this case, day 4 has the lowest original price.

Let me try buying 1 on day 3 and 2 on day 4, as in the example.

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4. Prices for day 4 become [2 +1=3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 2*3=6.

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

This is better than buying on earlier days.

So, sometimes buying on later days is better, especially if their original prices are much lower.

This suggests that simply buying on the earliest possible days isn't always optimal.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on a day contributes to the price increase for all subsequent days.

Therefore, buying a ticket on a later day affects fewer subsequent days, which means it has less impact on future prices.

Hence, to minimize the total cost, it might be better to buy tickets on days with lower original prices, especially if those days are later.

But, I also have to consider the m constraint per day.

This seems like a problem that can be solved using a priority queue, where I always buy tickets on the day with the currently lowest price, taking into account the price increases due to previous purchases.

But, with n up to 3e5 and k up to 1e9, a naive implementation would be too slow.

I need a more efficient approach.

Let me think about the problem in terms of the total cost.

The total cost is the sum of (number of tickets bought on day i) multiplied by (price on day i plus the sum of tickets bought on previous days).

This seems similar to the sum of prefix sums.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning k tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

Let me formalize this.

Let x_i be the number of tickets bought on day i.

Then, the cost for tickets bought on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This is the same as x_i * a_i + x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

The total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i * a_i + x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

This seems complicated to minimize directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think of sum_{i=1 to n} sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_i x_j

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of their original prices.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest prices, considering the price increases.

But, since buying on a later day means that fewer days are affected by the price increase, it might be better to buy on later days with lower prices.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the days in increasing order of (a_i + the number of days after i multiplied by some factor).

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each ticket bought on day i increases the price for the remaining (n - i) days.

So, the cost impact of buying a ticket on day i is a_i plus the number of remaining days times the average increase.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total price increase caused by buying a ticket on day i.

If I buy a ticket on day i, it increases the price for the remaining (n - i) days by 1 for each ticket bought on day i.

So, the total cost increase is 1 * (n - i) per ticket bought on day i.

Therefore, the effective cost of buying a ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of the increases caused by previous tickets.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to model the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_i, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize this expression.

This seems like a complicated optimization problem.

Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or some other optimization technique, but that might be too advanced for this context.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I assign a "priority" to each ticket based on the day it's bought.

Tickets bought on earlier days have higher priority in terms of price increases.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning k tickets to n days, where each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

Then, the total cost is the sum over all tickets of their individual costs.

This seems similar to assigning weights to positions in a sequence, where the weight depends on the position and the previous assignments.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me consider small examples to find a pattern.

Example 1:

n=2, m=100, k=100, prices=[1, 100]

- Buy 100 on day 1: cost = 100 * 1 = 100. Day 2 price becomes 100 + 100 = 200, but no tickets bought on day 2.

- Buy 99 on day 1 and 1 on day 2: cost = 99 * 1 + 1 * (100 + 99) = 99 + 199 = 298

- Buy 50 on day 1 and 50 on day 2: cost = 50 * 1 + 50 * (100 + 50) = 50 + 7500 = 7550

- Buy 0 on day 1 and 100 on day 2: cost = 0 + 100 * 100 = 10000

So, buying all on day 1 is cheapest.

Example 2:

n=3, m=1, k=3, prices=[1, 2, 3]

- Buy 1 on day 1, 1 on day 2, 1 on day 3: cost = 1*1 + 1*(2+1) + 1*(3+1+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

- Buy 1 on day 1, 1 on day 2, and 1 on day 3: only option, since m=1

- Buy 1 on day 1, and 2 on day 2: not possible, m=1

- Buy 1 on day 1, and 1 on day 2, and 1 on day 3: as above

So, the cost is 9.

Is there a better way? No, since m=1.

Example 3:

n=3, m=2, k=3, prices=[1, 2, 3]

Option 1: Buy 2 on day 1, 1 on day 2.

- Cost: 2*1 + 1*(2+2) = 2 + 4 = 6

Option 2: Buy 1 on day 1, 2 on day 2.

- Cost: 1*1 + 2*(2+1) = 1 + 6 = 7

Option 3: Buy 1 on day 1, 1 on day 2, 1 on day 3.

- Cost: 1*1 + 1*(2+1) + 1*(3+1+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9

Option 4: Buy 0 on day 1, 2 on day 2, 1 on day 3.

- Cost: 0 + 2*(2) + 1*(3+2) = 0 + 4 + 5 = 9

Option 5: Buy 0 on day 1, 1 on day 2, 2 on day 3.

- Cost: 0 + 1*2 + 2*(3+1) = 0 + 2 + 8 = 10

Option 6: Buy 0 on day 1, 0 on day 2, 3 on day 3.

- Cost: 0 + 0 + 3*(3) = 9

So, Option 1 is the best: total cost 6.

This suggests that buying as many as possible on the first day is better when m allows it.

But in the first test case, buying on later days is better.

Wait, perhaps I need to prioritize days with lower a_i, but also consider the number of remaining days.

I need to find a general strategy.

Let me think about the dual problem.

Suppose I fix the total number of tickets bought, and try to minimize the total cost.

I need to distribute the k tickets across n days, respecting the m limit per day, and accounting for the price increases.

This seems similar to scheduling jobs with release times and deadlines, but I'm not sure.

Another idea: Since the price on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i, perhaps I can think of a_i as the base cost, and the sum of x_j for j < i as the additional cost due to previous purchases.

So, the cost per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

Wait, but this is per ticket.

I need to minimize the sum over all tickets of (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This seems like a sum of individual costs for each ticket, based on the day it's bought.

Perhaps I can treat each ticket as an individual entity, each with its own cost based on the day it's bought and the sum of tickets bought on previous days.

So, if I have k tickets to buy, each ticket has a cost based on the day it's bought and the number of tickets bought before it.

This seems complicated to optimize directly.

Let me consider sorting the days based on a_i, but adjusted for the number of remaining days.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i plus some factor related to the number of remaining days.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that buying a ticket on day i costs a_i plus the sum of x_j for j from 1 to i-1.

So, for each ticket bought on day i, its cost is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on all previous days.

Therefore, the total cost for all tickets bought on day i is x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

This seems similar to a weighted sum, where the weight for day i is a_i plus the sum of previous x_j.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think of it in terms of prefix sums.

Let me define s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

Then, the cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Since s_{i-1} = s_i - x_i

So, cost on day i is x_i * (a_i + s_i - x_i)

Which is x_i * a_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2

Total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_i - x_i^2)

But s_i = sum_{j=1 to i} x_j

This seems too messy.

Perhaps I need to consider the problem differently.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * sum_{j=1 to i-1} x_j

This is the same as sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} x_i * x_j

This seems like a quadratic form.

Maybe I can rearrange it in terms of s_i or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use dynamic programming.

Let me define dp[i][s] as the minimum cost to buy s tickets in the first i days.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as selecting k tickets from a pool, where each ticket has a cost based on the day it's assigned to, including the price increases.

But again, this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning tickets to days, where each assignment has a cost, and then selecting the k assignments with the lowest costs.

But how do I account for the price increases due to previous assignments?

This is tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x_i, with sum x_i = k and x_i <= m.

Then, the total cost is sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * (a_i + sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j)

I need to minimize this.

This seems similar to minimizing a quadratic function.

Maybe I can find a way to minimize this expression by choosing x_i appropriately.

But with the constraints, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider that the cost can be expressed as sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * sum_{j=1}^{i-1} x_j

This is equal to sum_{i=1 to n} x_i * a_i + sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} x_i * x_j

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of the total number of pairs of tickets bought on different days.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that sum_{1 <= j < i <= n} x_i * x_j is related to the covariance or something similar.

This might not be helpful.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i.

But, since buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the days in increasing order of a_i plus the number of remaining days.

No, that doesn't seem right.

Let me think about the price increase mechanism.

Each ticket bought on day i increases the price for all subsequent days by 1.

So, buying a ticket on day i affects the costs of all subsequent days.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I should try to buy tickets on days where the base price a_i is low, and the number of subsequent days is minimal.

In other words, buying on later days is better because the base price might be lower, and fewer days are affected by the price increase.

This aligns with the first test case, where buying on day 3 and day 4 is better than buying on day 1 and day 2.

So, perhaps I should sort the days in increasing order of a_i and prioritize buying on days with lower a_i, especially if they are later.

But how do I implement this efficiently?

Let me consider sorting the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, respecting the m constraint per day.

But, since buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days, I need to be careful.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and then buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, starting from the earliest possible day.

But, given that buying on earlier days increases the prices for later days, it might be better to buy on later days with low a_i.

This is confusing.

Let me consider that for each day, the cost of buying a ticket on that day is a_i plus the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

So, the earlier I buy a ticket, the more it affects the prices of subsequent days.

Therefore, to minimize the total cost, I should buy tickets on days with low a_i, but preferably on later days to minimize the impact on subsequent days.

Wait, but if I buy on a later day, there are fewer subsequent days to affect.

So, perhaps I should sort the days in increasing order of a_i and prioritize buying on the latest possible days among those with the lowest a_i.

This way, I minimize the impact on subsequent days.

Let me try this approach with the first test case.

First test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

prices = [8,6,4,2]

Sort days by increasing a_i: day 4 (2), day 3 (4), day 2 (6), day 1 (8)

Now, starting from the last day (day 4):

- Buy as many as possible: min(m, remaining k) = min(2,3) = 2

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 2 * 2 = 4

- Remaining k = 1

- Price increase for remaining days: +2

Now, remaining days: day 1, day 2, day 3

Updated prices:

- day 1: 8 + 2 = 10

- day 2: 6 + 2 = 8

- day 3: 4 + 2 = 6

Sort remaining days by increasing a_i: day 3 (6), day 2 (8), day 1 (10)

Buy on day 3: min(m, remaining k) = min(2,1) = 1

Cost = 1 * 6 = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

Which matches the example.

Another test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

prices = [8,6,4,2]

Sort days: day 4 (2), day 3 (4), day 2 (6), day 1 (8)

Buy on day 4: min(2,8) = 2, cost = 2*2 = 4, remaining k=6

Price increase for remaining days: +2

Remaining days: day 1 (8+2=10), day 2 (6+2=8), day 3 (4+2=6)

Sort remaining days: day 3 (6), day 2 (8), day 1 (10)

Buy on day 3: min(2,6) = 2, cost = 2*6 = 12, remaining k=4

Price increase for remaining days: +2

Remaining days: day 1 (10+2=12), day 2 (8+2=10)
