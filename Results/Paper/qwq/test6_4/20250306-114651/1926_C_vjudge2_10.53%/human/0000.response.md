Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. For a given n, I have to calculate the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to n. For example, if n is 12, the numbers are 1 to 12. The digit sums are:

- 1: 1

- 2: 2

- 3: 3

- 4: 4

- 5: 5

- 6: 6

- 7: 7

- 8: 8

- 9: 9

- 10: 1 + 0 = 1

- 11: 1 + 1 = 2

- 12: 1 + 2 = 3

Adding these up: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3 = 51, which matches the example.

Now, I need to do this for multiple test cases, up to 10,000 cases, and n can be as large as 200,000. So, efficiency is key here because if I try to iterate through each number for each test case, it might be too slow, especially with the tight time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

Let me think about how to compute the sum of digit sums efficiently.

One approach is to precompute the sum of digit sums up to the maximum possible n, which is 200,000, and then for each test case, I can just output the precomputed sum for that n.

To precompute the sum of digit sums from 1 to m, I need a function that can calculate the sum of digit sums efficiently without iterating through each number.

Let's think about the properties of digit sums.

For numbers from 1 to 9, the sum of digit sums is just the sum of the numbers themselves since they are single digits.

For numbers from 10 to 19, the digit sums are:

- 10: 1 + 0 = 1

- 11: 1 + 1 = 2

- 12: 1 + 2 = 3

- ...

- 19: 1 + 9 = 10

So, for each ten's place, the digit sum contributes the ten's digit times the number of times it appears, plus the sum of the unit's digits from 0 to 9.

Similarly, for numbers from 20 to 29, the ten's digit is 2, and the unit's digits range from 0 to 9, so the digit sums would be 2 + 0, 2 + 1, ..., up to 2 + 9.

I can generalize this for any number of digits.

Wait, but n can be up to 200,000, which is a 6-digit number. So, I need a general approach that works for numbers up to six digits.

I recall that the sum of digits of numbers from 1 to m can be calculated using mathematical formulas that consider the number of digits and the distribution of digits in each place.

But maybe there's a simpler way to precompute the sum of digit sums up to each number efficiently.

Let me consider building an array where sum_values[i] is the sum of digit sums from 1 to i.

I can compute sum_values[i] based on sum_values[i-1] plus the digit sum of i.

But if I do this naively, it would be O(n) time, which for n=200,000 and t=10,000, would be too slow.

Wait, but if I precompute sum_values up to 200,000 and store it in an array, then for each test case, I can just output the value at sum_values[n].

The problem is that precomputing sum_values up to 200,000 with a simple loop might be too slow because t is up to 10,000 and n is up to 200,000, leading to a total time complexity of O(t*n), which is too high.

Wait, no. If I precompute sum_values once, and then for each test case, I just look up the value in sum_values[n], that would be O(t + n), which for n=200,000 and t=10,000 should be acceptable, as n + t is around 210,000 operations.

But I need to make sure that the precomputation is efficient.

Let me think about how to compute the digit sum of a number efficiently.

One way is to convert the number to a string, iterate through each character, convert it back to an integer, and sum them up.

But this is O(d) per number, where d is the number of digits, which is acceptable since d is at most 6.

However, for n=200,000, and t=10,000, the total time might still be too high if the constant factors are large.

Given the tight time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, I need to make sure that the implementation is optimized.

Let me look at the provided program and see if it implements this idea correctly.

The program defines a function func_1(), which seems to be the main function.

It reads t, the number of test cases, and then reads t integers into a list called numbers.

Then, it creates two lists: values and sum_values, both initialized to 0 up to max(numbers) + 1.

It computes the digit sums for numbers from 0 to 9 directly, stores them in values, accumulates the sum in total, and stores the cumulative sum in sum_values.

Then, for numbers from 10 to n, it seems to be trying to compute the digit sum by splitting the number into its last digit and the remaining part.

However, there are a few issues here.

First, in the loop where it computes values[i] for i in range(10, n+1), it uses values[last] + values[remainder], where last is the last digit and remainder is the number without the last digit.

But values[remainder] is not the digit sum of the remainder; it's the precomputed sum of digit sums up to that remainder, which is not what we want.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

I think there's a mistake in how it computes values[i].

values[i] should be the digit sum of i, not the sum of digit sums of the last digit and the remainder.

Similarly, sum_total is sum_values[i-1] plus values[i], which is correct for the cumulative sum.

But the way values[i] is computed seems flawed.

Let me think of a better way to compute the digit sum of a number.

A straightforward way is to convert the number to a string, iterate through each character, convert it back to an integer, and sum them up.

This can be done in a function, say digit_sum(i), which returns the sum of digits of i.

Then, I can precompute sum_values[i] = sum_values[i-1] + digit_sum(i) for i from 1 to max(numbers).

This should work correctly.

Now, considering the time constraints, I need to make sure that this is efficient enough.

Since n can be up to 200,000 and t up to 10,000, and the precomputation is O(n*d), where d is the number of digits, which is at most 6, the total time should be acceptable.

But looking back at the provided program, it seems to have a mistake in how it computes values[i] for i >= 10.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it doesn't properly compute the digit sum for numbers greater than or equal to 10.

Hence, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
