Alright, I have this problem to solve. Mocha has an array of numbers, and she can perform operations on it until all elements are the same. The operation involves choosing a subarray, finding its median, and setting all elements in that subarray to that median. The goal is to make all elements equal to the maximum possible value.

First, I need to understand what the operation does. Given a subarray, the median is the middle value when the subarray is sorted. For example, in [1,2,3,4,5], the median is 3. If I choose the subarray [3,4], the median is 3, and after the operation, both become 3, so the array becomes [1,2,3,3,5]. Then, if I choose the subarray [1,3], which is [1,2,3], the median is 2, and setting all to 2 gives [2,2,2,3,5]. Finally, choosing the whole array [2,2,2,3,5], the median is 2, and setting all to 2 gives [2,2,2,2,2]. But according to the example, there's a way to get all 4's. So, I must have messed up.

Looking back at the example, it shows a sequence of operations that lead to all 4's:

1. Choose (4,5): a becomes [1,2,3,4,4]

2. Choose (3,5): a becomes [1,2,4,4,4]

3. Choose (1,5): a becomes [4,4,4,4,4]

So, the key is to choose subarrays in a way that propagates higher medians across the array.

Now, I need to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved when all elements are the same.

Constraints:

- Number of test cases t ≤ 500

- For each test case, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 10^5

- 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

Given the constraints, the solution needs to be efficient, probably O(n) or O(n log n) per test case.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

if n == 2:

print(min(a))

continue

max = 0

for i in range(n - 2):

temp = a[i:i + 3]

temp.sort()

if temp[1] > max:

max = temp[1]

print(max)

So, for each test case, it reads n and the array a.

If n == 2, it prints the minimum of the two elements, which makes sense because with two elements, the only operation is to set both to the median, which is the minimum of the two.

For n > 2, it initializes max to 0, then iterates through the array, considering every subarray of length 3, finds the median (middle element after sorting), and keeps track of the maximum median found.

Finally, it prints this maximum median.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, why consider subarrays of length 3?

In the operation, you can choose any subarray of length at least 2, find its median, and set all elements in that subarray to that median.

The provided solution only considers subarrays of length exactly 3, and takes the maximum of their medians.

Is this sufficient to find the maximum possible value that can be achieved when all elements are made equal?

Let me think about the example given:

n = 5, a = [1,2,3,4,5]

According to the provided solution:

- Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,3] -> sorted: [1,2,3] -> median: 2

[2,3,4] -> sorted: [2,3,4] -> median: 3

[3,4,5] -> sorted: [3,4,5] -> median: 4

- The maximum median among these is 4.

- According to the example, it's possible to achieve all 4's.

So, in this case, the solution seems correct.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider another example:

n = 3, a = [1,2,5]

Subarrays of length 3: [1,2,5] -> sorted: [1,2,5] -> median: 2

According to the solution, the answer is 2.

But can I achieve higher than 2?

Let's try:

- Choose (1,2): median is 1, set both to 1: [1,1,5]

- Then choose (2,3): median is 1, set both to 1: [1,1,1]

- Or choose (1,3): median is 1, set all to 1.

Alternatively:

- Choose (2,3): median is 1, set both to 1: [1,1,5]

- Then choose (1,3): median is 1, set all to 1.

Seems like I can't get higher than 1 in this case, so the solution correctly outputs 1.

Wait, but according to the solution, it would output 1 for n=2, but for n=3, it outputs 2.

Wait, in this case, n=3, a=[1,2,5], the maximum median of any subarray of length 3 is 2, and indeed, I can't achieve higher than 1 when making all elements equal.

Wait, is there a mistake here?

Wait, in n=3, a=[1,2,5], the solution outputs 2, but in practice, I can't achieve higher than 1.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the operations.

Let me try again:

- Choose (1,2): median is 1, set both to 1: [1,1,5]

- Then choose (1,3): median is 1, set all to 1: [1,1,1]

Alternatively:

- Choose (2,3): median is 1, set both to 1: [1,1,5]

- Then choose (1,3): median is 1, set all to 1: [1,1,1]

Seems like I can't get higher than 1.

So, according to the solution, it would output 2, but in reality, 2 can't be achieved.

This suggests that the solution is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Is there a way to achieve a higher value than the maximum median of subarrays of length 3?

In the first example, it was possible to achieve 4, which was the maximum median of subarrays of length 3.

In this case, the maximum median of subarrays of length 3 is 2, but I can't achieve higher than 1.

Wait, but in the first step, choosing (1,3) gives median 1, setting all to 1.

Choosing (2,3) gives median 1, setting both to 1.

Choosing (1,2) gives median 1, setting both to 1.

Seems like I can't get to 2.

So, perhaps the solution is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the maximum achievable value is not necessarily the maximum median of any subarray of length 3.

Perhaps it's the second maximum value in the array.

Wait, in the first example, [1,2,3,4,5], the second maximum is 4, which matches the example's achievable value.

In [1,2,5], the second maximum is 2, but as shown, it's not achievable to make all elements 2.

Wait, maybe it's the second smallest value.

Wait, in [1,2,3,4,5], the second smallest is 2, but the achievable value is 4.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the floor of (max + min)/2.

Wait, in [1,2,3,4,5], (1+5)/2 = 3, which is less than 4.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the maximum value that appears more than once.

In [1,2,3,4,5], no value appears more than once, but in operations, we can make some values appear multiple times.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

What is the minimal number of operations needed to make all elements equal, and what is the maximum possible value achievable?

I need to maximize the final equal value.

Given that I can choose any subarray of length at least 2, find its median, and set all elements in that subarray to that median.

I need to find the highest possible value that can be propagated to the entire array.

I need to find the highest value x in the array such that it's possible to make all elements equal to x through a series of operations.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the array as a whole and see how higher values can be propagated.

Let's consider that in each operation, setting a subarray to its median can help in propagating higher values.

But I need a better approach.

Maybe I should look at the array in reverse: starting from the end where all elements are equal, and see what operations could have led to that state.

But that seems complicated.

Another idea: since I can choose any subarray of length at least 2, and set it to its median, I can think of propagating medians through the array.

But I need a way to maximize the final value.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the array as a sliding window of size 3 and find the maximum median among all such windows.

That's what the provided solution does.

But in my earlier example, it gave an incorrect result.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for n >= 3, the maximum achievable value is the maximum median of all subarrays of length 3.

But in my earlier example, [1,2,5], the maximum median is 2, but I can't achieve all 2's.

So, perhaps the approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for n >= 3, the maximum achievable value is the maximum of the minimum of each pair of adjacent elements.

Wait, that seems unclear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have an array where I can choose subarrays such that their medians are as high as possible, and through operations, propagate that high value across the array.

I need to find the highest value that can be spread to the entire array through such operations.

Perhaps I need to find the maximum value that appears in the array such that it can be made the median of some subarray.

But that seems vague.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that in order to set the entire array to some value x, there must be a way to make x the median of some subarray.

And through operations, propagate x to the entire array.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that the median of a subarray is the middle element when sorted.

So, for a subarray of odd length, it's the middle element; for even length, as per the problem, it's the element at floor((m+1)/2) position after sorting.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's specified for subarray of length m, the median is the element at position floor((m+1)/2) after sorting.

For example, in [1,2,3,4,5] (m=5), median is a[3] = 3.

In [5,25,20,24] (m=4), median is a[2] = 20.

Wait, but in Python, list indices start at 0, so a[1] would be the second element.

But according to the problem, it's a[ floor((m+1)/2) ], which for m=4 is a[2], which is 20 in the example.

Wait, but in Python, lists are 0-indexed, so a[ floor((m+1)/2) - 1 ].

Need to be careful with indices.

Now, back to the problem.

I need to find the highest possible value x such that through a series of operations, I can make the entire array equal to x.

How can I maximize x?

One way to think about it is to find the highest value that can be propagated to the entire array through a series of median operations.

I need to see how higher values can be brought down to lower positions in the array through operations.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the minimal value in the array, but that doesn't make sense because we want the maximum possible final value.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the second smallest value in the array.

Wait, no, in the example, the second smallest is 2, but the achievable maximum is 4.

So, that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the highest value that appears more than once in the array.

But in the first example, [1,2,3,4,5], no value appears more than once, but the achievable maximum is 4.

Wait, but in that sequence of operations, 4 appears more than once after some operations.

I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can think of the array as a graph, where each element is a node, and operations define edges based on possible transformations.

But that seems too vague and complex.

Wait, perhaps I can consider dynamic programming, where I keep track of the possible medians that can be achieved for different subarrays.

But that might be too slow given the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the highest achievable value is the minimal value in the array, but that doesn't make sense because in the example, minimal value is 1, but achievable maximum is 4.

Wait, perhaps it's the maximal value that appears in the median position of some subarray.

But in the first example, the maximal median of any subarray of length 3 is 4, which matches the achievable value.

In the second example, [1,2,5], the maximal median of any subarray of length 3 is 2, but as shown, I can't achieve all 2's.

So, perhaps the approach is not entirely correct.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that for n >= 3, the maximum achievable value is the maximum median of all subarrays of length 3.

And for n == 2, it's the minimum of the two elements.

But in the second example, [1,2,5], according to this, it would output 2, but in reality, I can't achieve all 2's.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me try another example.

Consider n=4, a=[1,2,4,5]

Possible subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,4] -> sorted: [1,2,4] -> median: 2

[2,4,5] -> sorted: [2,4,5] -> median: 4

So, the maximum median is 4.

Can I achieve all 4's?

Let's try:

- Choose (2,4): [2,4,5] -> median 4, set to [1,4,4,4]

- Then choose (1,2): [1,4] -> median 1, set to [1,1,4,4]

- Then choose (1,4): [1,1,4,4] -> median 1, set to [1,1,1,1]

Oops, I got all 1's, not 4's.

Wait, maybe I need to choose operations differently.

- Choose (2,4): [2,4,5] -> median 4, set to [1,4,4,4]

- Then choose (1,3): [1,4,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4,4]

Ah, yes, in this case, I can achieve all 4's.

So, in this example, the maximum median of subarrays of length 3 is 4, and I can achieve all 4's.

Another example: n=3, a=[1,2,5]

Subarrays of length 3: [1,2,5] -> median 2

According to the solution, output 2

But earlier, I thought I couldn't achieve all 2's, but maybe I can.

Let's try:

- Choose (2,3): [2,5] -> median 2, set to [1,2,2]

- Then choose (1,2): [1,2] -> median 1, set to [1,1,2]

- Then choose (1,3): [1,1,2] -> median 1, set to [1,1,1]

Wait, again, I end up with all 1's.

Alternatively:

- Choose (1,3): [1,2,5] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

Ah, in this case, I can achieve all 2's.

So, in this case, it is possible to achieve all 2's.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, perhaps the approach is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier attempt, I thought it was not possible, but actually, it is possible.

Let me try another example.

n=4, a=[1,3,3,4]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,3,3] -> sorted: [1,3,3] -> median: 3

[3,3,4] -> sorted: [3,3,4] -> median: 3

Maximum median is 3.

Can I achieve all 3's?

- Choose (2,4): [3,3,4] -> median 3, set to [1,3,3,3]

- Then choose (1,2): [1,3] -> median 1, set to [1,1,3,3]

- Then choose (1,4): [1,1,3,3] -> median 1, set to [1,1,1,1]

Wait, I ended up with all 1's.

Alternatively:

- Choose (1,3): [1,3,3] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3,4]

- Then choose (3,4): [3,4] -> median 3, set to [3,3,3,3]

Yes, in this case, I can achieve all 3's.

So, the maximum achievable value is indeed 3, which matches the maximum median of subarrays of length 3.

Another example: n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,6]

Subarrays of length 3:

[1,2,3] -> median 2

[2,3,4] -> median 3

[3,4,6] -> median 4

Maximum median is 4.

Can I achieve all 4's?

- Choose (3,5): [3,4,6] -> median 4, set to [1,2,4,4,6]

- Choose (2,4): [2,4,4] -> median 4, set to [1,4,4,4,6]

- Choose (1,3): [1,4,4] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4,4,6]

- Choose (1,5): [4,4,4,4,6] -> median 4, set to [4,4,4,4,4]

Yes, achieved all 4's.

So, seems like the approach works.

Another example: n=3, a=[2,5,5]

Subarrays of length 3: [2,5,5] -> sorted: [2,5,5] -> median 5

According to the solution, output 5.

Can I achieve all 5's?

- Choose (1,3): [2,5,5] -> median 5, set to [5,5,5]

Yes, achieved all 5's.

So, seems correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought in [1,2,5], I couldn't achieve all 2's, but according to the solution, it's possible.

Upon re-examination, it is possible:

- Choose (1,3): [1,2,5] -> median 2, set to [2,2,2]

So, it was my mistake earlier.

Therefore, the approach seems correct.

Hence, the provided program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible value that can be achieved when all elements in the array are made equal through a series of operations involving medians of subarrays.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Operation**:
   - We can choose any subarray of length at least 2.
   - Compute the median of the chosen subarray.
   - Set all elements in the subarray to this median.
   
2. **Key Insight**:
   - For arrays of length 2, the only possible operation sets both elements to the median, which is the minimum of the two elements.
   - For arrays of length 3 or more, the maximum achievable value when all elements are equal is the maximum median of all possible subarrays of length 3.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - For each test case, iterate through the array and compute the median for every subarray of length 3.
   - Track the maximum median value found among these subarrays.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max_val = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max_val:
                max_val = temp[1]
        print(max_val)

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  1. Read the number of test cases, `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Read the array length, `n`.
     - Read the array, `a`.
     - If `n` is 2, print the minimum of the two elements.
     - Otherwise, iterate through the array to consider every subarray of length 3.
     - Sort each subarray to find the median (middle element).
     - Track the maximum median value found.
     - Print this maximum median value.

- **Efficiency**:
  - For each test case, we perform a single pass through the array with a window of size 3, making the approach efficient within the given constraints.

- **Correctness**:
  - The approach ensures that we achieve the highest possible value by leveraging the medians of overlapping subarrays of length 3, which is sufficient to propagate higher values across the array.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible value that can be achieved when all elements in the array are made equal through a series of operations involving medians of subarrays.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Operation**:
   - We can choose any subarray of length at least 2.
   - Compute the median of the chosen subarray.
   - Set all elements in the subarray to this median.
   
2. **Key Insight**:
   - For arrays of length 2, the only possible operation sets both elements to the median, which is the minimum of the two elements.
   - For arrays of length 3 or more, the maximum achievable value when all elements are equal is the maximum median of all possible subarrays of length 3.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - For each test case, iterate through the array and compute the median for every subarray of length 3.
   - Track the maximum median value found among these subarrays.

        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max_val = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max_val:
                max_val = temp[1]
        print(max_val)

func()
```
