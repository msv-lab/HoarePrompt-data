Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some take 1x1 cells and others take 2x2 cells (which would be 4 cells). The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each screen has 15 cells. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up four cells each. No cell can be occupied by more than one icon. So, for a given number of x (1x1 icons) and y (2x2 icons), I need to find out the minimum number of screens required to fit all these icons.

Let me think about how to approach this. I should calculate the total space required by all icons and then see how many screens are needed to accommodate that space. But it's not just about the total number of cells needed; I have to consider how the icons are placed on the screen.

Each 2x2 icon takes up a 2x2 block, so their placement affects where the 1x1 icons can be placed. I need to maximize the usage of each screen by placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, and then fill the remaining space with 1x1 icons.

Let me consider the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns:

Row 1: Cell 1 2 3

Row 2: Cell 4 5 6

Row 3: Cell 7 8 9

Row 4: Cell 10 11 12

Row 5: Cell 13 14 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four cells in a square. For example, cells 1,2,4,5 or cells 2,3,5,6, etc. But considering the grid is only 5 rows and 3 columns, there are limited positions where a 2x2 icon can be placed.

Let me see how many 2x2 positions are possible on one screen. In a 5x3 grid, the number of possible 2x2 squares would be (5-1) rows x (3-1) columns = 4 x 2 = 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons.

But wait, that might not be necessary for this problem. Maybe I can treat the screen as having a certain capacity for 2x2 and 1x1 icons.

Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and 1x1 takes 1 cell. So, if I place as many 2x2 icons as possible on a screen, the remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.

Let me think about how many 2x2 icons can fit on one screen. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so theoretically, 15 / 4 = 3.75, which means only 3 full 2x2 icons can fit, but that would be 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

But wait, in reality, because of the grid structure, you might not be able to place 3 2x2 icons without overlapping or going out of bounds.

Looking back at the grid:

Rows 1-2 can have two 2x2 icons side by side: positions (1,2,4,5) and (2,3,5,6)

But these overlap in cells 2 and 5.

So, in practice, you can't place two 2x2 icons in the top two rows without overlapping.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider a different approach.

Let me consider the total space required.

Total cells needed = x * 1 + y * 4

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, the minimum number of screens required would be ceil((x + 4*y)/15)

But wait, it's not that simple because of the way 2x2 icons must be placed on the grid.

For example, in the first test case: x=1, y=1

Total cells needed: 1*1 + 1*4 = 5 cells.

But according to ceil(5/15) = 1 screen.

And indeed, as shown in the example, it's possible to place one 1x1 and one 2x2 icon on a single screen.

In the third test case: x=12, y=4

Total cells needed: 12*1 + 4*4 = 12 + 16 = 28 cells.

ceil(28/15) = 2 screens.

But is it possible to arrange them in 2 screens?

Looking at the example solution provided, it seems possible.

So, maybe the simple approach of ceil((x + 4*y)/15) works.

But I need to verify if there are cases where this wouldn't work due to the grid constraints.

Let me think about a screen's capacity in terms of 2x2 and 1x1 icons.

Each screen can hold a certain number of 2x2 icons, and the remaining cells can be filled with 1x1 icons.

From the grid, let's see:

- If I place one 2x2 icon, it takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If I place two 2x2 icons without overlapping, they might take 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If I place three 2x2 icons, they might take 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

- If I place four 2x2 icons, they would take 16 cells, which is more than the screen has, so that's not possible.

But earlier, I saw that placing two 2x2 icons might only be possible if they don't overlap, which in the grid might not be feasible.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each screen can hold a maximum of three 2x2 icons, as 3*4=12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

But in reality, due to the grid structure, perhaps fewer 2x2 icons can be placed per screen without overlapping.

Looking back at the first example: x=1, y=1

Place one 2x2 icon taking cells 1,2,4,5

Then place one 1x1 icon in any of the remaining cells, say cell 6.

That seems to work.

In the third test case: x=12, y=4

Total cells needed: 28

Two screens, each with 15 cells, total 30 cells, which is enough.

But how are the icons arranged?

If each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons, then for y=4, we would need at least two screens, since one screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, but y=4 requires one screen to hold three and the second screen to hold one.

But in the third test case, x=12 and y=4.

So, total cells: 12 + 16 = 28

Two screens: each can hold up to three 2x2 icons and three 1x1 icons.

First screen: three 2x2 icons (12 cells) and three 1x1 icons (3 cells), total 15 cells.

Second screen: one 2x2 icon (4 cells) and nine 1x1 icons (9 cells), total 13 cells.

But x=12, and we've used three + nine = 12, which matches.

So, it works.

But is there a better way to calculate the minimum number of screens without considering the exact arrangement?

I think so.

Let's consider the number of 2x2 icons first.

Each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, as 3*4=12 cells, leaving three cells for 1x1 icons.

But, due to grid constraints, perhaps fewer 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Looking back at the grid:

Rows 1-2: can place two 2x2 icons without overlapping.

Rows 3-4: can place two more.

But wait, columns are only three, so placing two 2x2 icons in rows 1-2 would occupy cells 1,2,4,5 and 2,3,5,6.

But cells 2 and 5 are overlapping, which is not allowed.

So, in reality, only one 2x2 icon can be placed in rows 1-2 without overlapping.

Similarly, only one in rows 3-4, and possibly one in rows 4-5.

So, per screen, maybe only three 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

But in the example, it seems that up to two 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Wait, let's try to place two 2x2 icons per screen.

For example:

- Place one 2x2 icon in cells 1,2,4,5.

- Place another 2x2 icon in cells 7,8,10,11.

- This leaves cells 3,6,9,12,13,14,15 available for 1x1 icons.

So, in this arrangement, two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons can be placed on one screen.

Alternatively, place three 2x2 icons:

- Cells 1,2,4,5

- Cells 7,8,10,11

- Cells 10,11,13,14

But wait, cells 10 and 11 are overlapping between the second and third 2x2 icons.

So, only two 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping.

Therefore, per screen, maximum two 2x2 icons can be placed.

Each 2x2 icon takes four cells, so two 2x2 icons take eight cells, leaving seven cells for 1x1 icons.

But in the earlier test case, x=12, y=4.

If each screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

First screen: two 2x2 icons (8 cells) and seven 1x1 icons (7 cells), total 15 cells.

Second screen: two 2x2 icons (8 cells) and five 1x1 icons (5 cells), total 13 cells.

Total y=4 (two per screen: 2+2=4) and x=12 (seven + five=12).

This seems to work.

But in the third test case, the output is 2, which matches this arrangement.

Wait, but earlier I thought each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, but actually, due to overlapping, only two can be placed per screen.

So, perhaps the initial approach needs to be adjusted.

Let me try to generalize this.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y/2).

Then, for x 1x1 icons, the remaining space on these screens is (number of screens)*7.

If x is less than or equal to (number of screens)*7, then the number of screens is sufficient.

Otherwise, additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

So, the total number of screens would be max(ceil(y/2), ceil(x/7)).

But wait, let's verify this with the third test case: x=12, y=4.

ceil(y/2) = ceil(4/2) = 2

ceil(x/7) = ceil(12/7) = 2

So, max(2,2) = 2, which matches the output.

Another test case: x=1, y=1.

ceil(1/2) = 1

ceil(1/7) = 1

max(1,1) = 1, which matches the output.

Another test case: x=0, y=0.

ceil(0/2) = 0

ceil(0/7) = 0

max(0,0) = 0, which matches the output.

Another test case: x=15, y=0.

ceil(0/2) = 0

ceil(15/7) = 3

max(0,3) = 3 screens.

But according to the sample input, for x=15, y=0, the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, my previous approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the sample input, for x=15, y=0, the output is 1.

But according to my calculation, max(ceil(0/2), ceil(15/7)) = max(0, 3) = 3, but the sample output is 1.

Hmm, that's inconsistent.

So, perhaps my assumption that each screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons is wrong.

Looking back at the grid: each screen has 15 cells.

If no 2x2 icons are placed, then all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, for y=0 and x=15, it should indeed be one screen.

But according to my previous formula, it would require ceil(15/7) = 3 screens, which is incorrect.

So, my earlier assumption that each screen can hold up to seven 1x1 icons is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the arrangement.

If no 2x2 icons are placed, then each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

If some 2x2 icons are placed, then the remaining cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons: ceil(y/2), since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

2. Calculate the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons: number_of_screens * (15 - 2*4) = number_of_screens * 7.

3. If x <= remaining_space, then the number of screens is sufficient.

4. If x > remaining_space, then additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: ceil((x - remaining_space)/15).

5. The total number of screens would be number_of_screens + additional_screens.

Wait, but in the third test case: y=4, ceil(4/2)=2 screens.

Remaining space: 2 * 7 = 14 cells for 1x1 icons.

x=12, which is less than 14, so no additional screens are needed.

Total screens: 2.

But according to the sample output, it's 2, which matches.

In the first test case: y=1, ceil(1/2)=1 screen.

Remaining space: 1 * 7 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

x=1, which is less than 7, so total screens: 1.

Matches the sample output.

In the case where y=0, x=15: ceil(0/2)=0 screens for 2x2 icons.

Remaining space: 0 * 15 = 0 cells for 1x1 icons.

x=15 > 0, so additional screens: ceil(15/15)=1.

Total screens: 0 + 1 = 1.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: y=9, x=0.

ceil(9/2)=5 screens for 2x2 icons.

Remaining space: 5 * 7 = 35 cells for 1x1 icons.

x=0 <=35, so total screens: 5.

Which matches the last test case in the sample input.

Seems correct.

So, the algorithm should be:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons: ceil(y/2)

- Calculate the remaining space for 1x1 icons: number_of_screens * 7

- If x <= remaining_space, then total screens = number_of_screens

- Else, additional_screens = ceil((x - remaining_space)/15)

- Total screens = number_of_screens + additional_screens

This seems to work for the sample inputs.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

result = []

for _ in range(n):

(x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))

space_x = x * 1

space_y = y * 4

total_space = space_y + space_x

if y % 2 == 0:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2

else:

screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1

remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

if space_x <= remaining_cells:

result.append(screen_require_for_y)

else:

extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells

if extra_space % 15 == 0:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15

else:

extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1

result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)

print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))



Let's analyze this step by step.

1. Read the number of test cases, n.

2. For each test case, read x and y.

3. Calculate space_x = x * 1, space_y = y * 4, total_space = space_x + space_y.

4. Determine the number of screens required for y 2x2 icons:

- If y is even, screen_require_for_y = y // 2

- If y is odd, screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1

This is equivalent to ceil(y/2), which is correct.

5. Calculate remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y

- This calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

- Each screen has 15 cells, and space_y cells are occupied by 2x2 icons.

- So, remaining_cells is the leftover space for 1x1 icons.

6. If space_x <= remaining_cells, then the number of screens required is screen_require_for_y.

- This makes sense because the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons.

7. Else, calculate extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells

- This is the extra space needed beyond what's available in the screens required for 2x2 icons.

8. Determine the number of extra screens needed:

- If extra_space % 15 == 0, extra_screen = extra_space // 15

- Else, extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1

- This is equivalent to ceil(extra_space / 15), which is correct.

9. Total screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screen

10. Append the result for this test case.

11. After processing all test cases, print each result on a separate line.

Now, let's verify this with the sample input and output.

Let's take the first test case: x=1, y=1

space_x = 1, space_y = 4, total_space = 5

screen_require_for_y = 1 (since y=1 is odd, 1//2 +1 =1)

remaining_cells = 15*1 - 4 = 11

since space_x=1 <=11, result.append(1)

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2

space_x=7, space_y=8, total_space=15

screen_require_for_y=1 (y=2 is even, 2//2=1)

remaining_cells=15*1 -8=7

space_x=7 <=7, so result.append(1)

Matches sample output.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

space_x=12, space_y=16, total_space=28

screen_require_for_y=2 (y=4 is even, 4//2=2)

remaining_cells=15*2 -16=30-16=14

space_x=12 <=14, so result.append(2)

Matches sample output.

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3

space_x=0, space_y=12, total_space=12

screen_require_for_y=2 (y=3 is odd, 3//2 +1=2)

space_x=0 <=18, so result.append(2)

Matches sample output.

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0

space_x=1, space_y=0, total_space=1

screen_require_for_y=0 (y=0 is even, 0//2=0)

remaining_cells=15*0 -0=0

space_x=1 >0, so extra_space=1-0=1

extra_screen=ceil(1/15)=1

total screens=0+1=1

Matches sample output.

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1

space_x=8, space_y=4, total_space=12

screen_require_for_y=1 (y=1 is odd, 1//2 +1=1)

remaining_cells=15*1 -4=11

space_x=8 <=11, so result.append(1)

Matches sample output.

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0

space_x=0, space_y=0, total_space=0

screen_require_for_y=0

remaining_cells=0

space_x=0 <=0, so result.append(0)

Matches sample output.

Eighth test case: x=2, y=0

space_x=2, space_y=0, total_space=2

screen_require_for_y=0

remaining_cells=0

space_x=2 >0, so extra_space=2-0=2

extra_screen=ceil(2/15)=1

total screens=0+1=1

Matches sample output.

Ninth test case: x=15, y=0

space_x=15, space_y=0, total_space=15

screen_require_for_y=0

remaining_cells=0

space_x=15 >0, so extra_space=15-0=15

extra_screen=ceil(15/15)=1

total screens=0+1=1

Matches sample output.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2

space_x=8, space_y=8, total_space=16

screen_require_for_y=1 (y=2 is even, 2//2=1)

remaining_cells=15*1 -8=7

space_x=8 >7, so extra_space=8-7=1

extra_screen=ceil(1/15)=1

total screens=1+1=2

Matches sample output.

Eleventh test case: x=0, y=9

space_x=0, space_y=36, total_space=36

screen_require_for_y=5 (y=9 is odd, 9//2 +1=5)

remaining_cells=15*5 -36=75-36=39

space_x=0 <=39, so result.append(5)

Matches sample output.

So, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of screens required.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
