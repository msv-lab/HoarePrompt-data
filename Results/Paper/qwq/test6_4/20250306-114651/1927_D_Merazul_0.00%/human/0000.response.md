Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and a set of queries. Each query gives me a range within the array, from index l to r, and I need to find two indices i and j within that range such that the elements at those indices are different, i.e., a_i ≠ a_j. If such a pair doesn't exist, I should return -1 -1.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The array has n elements, and there are q queries. The constraints are that n can be up to 2*10^5, and q can be up to 2*10^5, and there are t test cases with t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n and q across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5 each. So, overall, it's about handling up to 2*10^5 elements and 2*10^5 queries efficiently.

I need to process multiple test cases, each consisting of an array and a number of queries on that array. For each query, I need to find a pair of indices within the specified range where the elements are different.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently. Since q can be up to 2*10^5 and n up to 2*10^5, I need an approach that's linear or nearly linear in time complexity.

One way to handle this is to precompute some information about the array that can help me answer the queries quickly.

Let me consider precomputing for each position in the array, the next position where a different element occurs. This way, for each query, I can find the smallest j greater than or equal to l such that a_j ≠ a_l, if such a j exists within the range [l, r].

Alternatively, I could precompute for each position, the range of indices where the element is the same as at that position. Then, for each query, I can check if the entire range [l, r] falls within such a block where all elements are the same.

Wait, actually, the problem is to find just any two indices within [l, r] where the elements are different. So, if there exists at least one pair where a_i ≠ a_j, I need to find such a pair; otherwise, return -1 -1.

An efficient way to handle this is to, for each query, check if all elements in the range [l, r] are the same. If they are, then no such pair exists, and I should return -1 -1. If not, I can find the first two indices where the elements differ.

To optimize this, I can precompute for each position i, the next position where the element changes. This can be done in a single pass through the array.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, the array a of n integers.

b. Compute a list 'next_diff' where next_diff[i] is the smallest j > i such that a[j] ≠ a[i], or n if no such j exists.

c. Read q, the number of queries.

d. For each query (l, r):

i. If next_diff[l-1] <= r, then there exists a j in [l, next_diff[l-1]] where a_j ≠ a_l, so output l and next_diff[l-1].

ii. Else, all elements from l to r are the same, so output -1 -1.

Wait, indices are 1-based in the problem, but in programming, arrays are 0-based. So, I need to be careful with indexing.

Let me think about the precomputation of next_diff.

I can iterate through the array from left to right, and for each position i, find the smallest j > i such that a[j] ≠ a[i]. If no such j exists (i.e., all elements from i to n are the same), set next_diff[i] = n.

This can be done efficiently by keeping track of the last position where the element changed.

Alternatively, I can iterate through the array and group consecutive elements that are the same, recording the start and end positions of each group.

Then, for each query [l, r], I can check if the entire range [l, r] falls within a single group where all elements are the same. If it does, then no such pair exists, and I should return -1 -1. Otherwise, I can find two indices in different groups where the elements differ.

But grouping might be more complicated to implement efficiently.

Let me stick to the first approach of precomputing next_diff.

Here's how I can implement it:

- Initialize next_diff as a list of size n, initialized to n.

- Set a variable current = 0

- While current < n:

- Set next_same = current + 1

- While next_same < n and a[next_same] == a[current]:

- next_same += 1

- For i from current to next_same - 1:

- next_diff[i] = next_same

- current = next_same

This way, for each position i, next_diff[i] points to the smallest j > i where a[j] ≠ a[i], or n if no such j exists.

Then, for each query [l, r] (1-based indices):

- If next_diff[l-1] <= r, then a[next_diff[l-1]] ≠ a[l-1], so output l and next_diff[l-1] + 1 (since next_diff[l-1] is 0-based).

- Else, all elements from l to r are the same, so output -1 -1.

Wait, no. Since next_diff[l-1] is the smallest index j > l-1 where a[j] ≠ a[l-1], and if j <= r, then a_j ≠ a_l, so we can output l and j+1 (since indices in output are 1-based).

If next_diff[l-1] > r, then all elements from l to r are the same as a_l, so output -1 -1.

Yes, that makes sense.

Let me consider an example to verify.

Take the first test case from the sample input:

n = 5

a = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]

Compute next_diff:

- i=0: a[0]=1, a[1]=1, a[2]=2 ≠ a[0], so next_diff[0] = 2

- i=1: a[1]=1, a[2]=2 ≠ a[1], so next_diff[1] = 2

- i=2: a[2]=2, a[3]=1 ≠ a[2], so next_diff[2] = 3

- i=3: a[3]=1, a[4]=1, so next_diff[3] = 5 (n)

- i=4: a[4]=1, no next different, so next_diff[4] = 5

So next_diff = [2, 2, 3, 5, 5]

Now, for queries:

1. l=1, r=5

- next_diff[0]=2 <=5, so output 1 and 3

2. l=1, r=2

- next_diff[0]=2 <=2, so output 1 and 3, but r=2, so this seems incorrect.

Wait, next_diff[0]=2, which is j=2 (0-based), which is within [1,2], but a[1]=1 and a[2]=1 are the same. So this is a mistake.

Hmm, so my approach has a flaw here.

Wait, in this case, next_diff[l-1] = 2, which is within [1,2], but a[1]=1 and a[2]=1 are the same, which contradicts the precomputation.

Wait no, a[2]=2 ≠ a[1]=1, so it's correct that next_diff[0]=2, meaning a[2] ≠ a[0].

But in the query [1,2], next_diff[0]=2, which is index 2, which is r=2, and a[1]=1, a[2]=1, but a[2] ≠ a[0], but we need to find within [1,2], so a[1] and a[2] are both 1, so they are the same.

Wait, there's confusion here.

Wait, a = [1,1,2,1,1]

Indices: 1:1, 2:1, 3:2, 4:1, 5:1

In query [1,2], a[1]=1 and a[2]=1, so no pair exists where a_i ≠ a_j within [1,2].

But according to next_diff[0]=2, which is within [1,2], but a[2]=1 == a[1]=1, which contradicts.

Wait, no, a[2]=2 ≠ a[1]=1.

Wait, a[2]=2, which is different from a[1]=1.

Wait, but in the array, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, but a[3]=2.

Wait, indices are 1-based in the problem, but in the array, it's 0-based in code.

Wait, let's clarify:

Given a = [1,1,2,1,1], 1-based indices:

- a[1]=1

- a[2]=1

- a[3]=2

- a[4]=1

- a[5]=1

In query [1,2], l=1, r=2

next_diff[0]=2 (0-based), which corresponds to 1-based index 3, but 3 is outside [1,2], so should output -1 -1.

Wait, but next_diff[0]=2, which is within [1,2] in 1-based indexing, but a[1]=1 and a[2]=1 are the same.

Wait, a[2]=1 == a[1]=1, so no different pair exists within [1,2].

But next_diff[0]=2 means that the next different element from a[1] is at index 3, which is outside [1,2], so should output -1 -1.

Wait, but according to the approach, if next_diff[l-1] <= r, then output l and next_diff[l-1]+1.

But in this case, next_diff[0]=2, which is index 3 in 1-based, which is outside [1,2], so next_diff[l-1] > r, hence output -1 -1.

Wait, I think I had a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Let me correct it.

In the query [1,2]:

- l=1, r=2

- next_diff[0]=2 (0-based), which corresponds to index 3 (1-based), which is outside [1,2], so next_diff[l-1] > r, hence output -1 -1.

Yes, that's correct.

In the query [1,3]:

- l=1, r=3

- next_diff[0]=2 (0-based), which is index 3 (1-based), which is within [1,3], and a[1]=1 ≠ a[3]=2, so output 1 and 3.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the approach seems correct.

Now, let's consider implementing this.

I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Given that n and q can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the total sum of n and q across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need to make sure that my code is efficient and doesn't have unnecessary overhead.

I should read all input at once and process it accordingly to avoid slow I/O.

In Python, reading input using sys.stdin.read() and splitting it into tokens is efficient.

I need to manage the indices carefully, keeping in mind that Python lists are 0-based.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read all input at once using sys.stdin.read()

- Split the input into tokens

- Use a pointer to track the current position in the tokens

- For each test case:

- Read t, the number of test cases

- For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the array a of n integers

- Read q

- For each query:

- Read l and r (1-based)

- Using the precomputed next_diff, check if next_diff[l-1] <= r

- If yes, output l and next_diff[l-1] + 1 (1-based)

- Else, output -1 -1

Implementing the precomputation of next_diff as discussed earlier.

I need to make sure that the precomputation is efficient and correctly handles all edge cases, such as when all elements are the same, or when there are multiple groups of identical elements.

Let me consider another example.

Take n=4, a=[5,2,3,4]

Compute next_diff:

- i=0: a[0]=5, a[1]=2 ≠ a[0], so next_diff[0]=1

- i=1: a[1]=2, a[2]=3 ≠ a[1], so next_diff[1]=2

- i=2: a[2]=3, a[3]=4 ≠ a[2], so next_diff[2]=3

- i=3: a[3]=4, no next different, so next_diff[3]=4

So next_diff = [1,2,3,4]

For query [1,2]:

- next_diff[0]=1 <=2, so output 1 and 2

For query [1,4]:

- next_diff[0]=1 <=4, so output 1 and 2

Wait, but in this case, a[1]=5 and a[2]=2 are different, so output 1 and 2 is correct.

Another query [2,3]:

- next_diff[1]=2 <=3, so output 2 and 3

And so on.

Seems correct.

Now, let's consider a case where all elements are the same.

n=4, a=[1,1,1,1]

Compute next_diff:

- i=0: a[0]=1, a[1]=1 == a[0], a[2]=1 == a[0], a[3]=1 == a[0], so next_diff[0]=4

- i=1: a[1]=1, a[2]=1 == a[1], a[3]=1 == a[1], so next_diff[1]=4

- i=2: a[2]=1, a[3]=1 == a[2], so next_diff[2]=4

- i=3: a[3]=1, no next different, so next_diff[3]=4

So next_diff = [4,4,4,4]

For any query [l,r], next_diff[l-1]=4 > r, so output -1 -1

Correct.

Another case: n=3, a=[1,2,1]

next_diff:

- i=0: a[0]=1, a[1]=2 ≠ a[0], so next_diff[0]=1

- i=1: a[1]=2, a[2]=1 ≠ a[1], so next_diff[1]=2

- i=2: a[2]=1, no next different, so next_diff[2]=3

next_diff = [1,2,3]

Query [1,3]:

- next_diff[0]=1 <=3, so output 1 and 2

Query [2,3]:

- next_diff[1]=2 <=3, so output 2 and 3

Query [1,1]:

- Since l=r=1, no pair exists, but according to the approach, next_diff[0]=1 <=1, so output 1 and 2, but 2 is within [1,1]? Wait, no.

Wait, in query [l,r], if l=r, then no pair exists, since only one element.

But in the approach, next_diff[l-1] <= r would be next_diff[l-1] <= r, but l=r, so if next_diff[l-1] <= r, it would be output l and next_diff[l-1]+1, but next_diff[l-1] <= r implies that next_diff[l-1] <= l, meaning that the next different element is within [l,r], but since l=r, next_diff[l-1] must be > l, so it should output -1 -1.

Wait, perhaps I need to add a condition that l < r.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's 1 <= l <= r <= n, but in the task, it's to find i and j such that l <= i <= r and l <= j <= r and a_i ≠ a_j.

So, for l=r, no such pair exists, so output -1 -1.

In my approach, for l=r, next_diff[l-1] would point to the next different element, which would be beyond r, so next_diff[l-1] > r, hence output -1 -1.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the approach seems solid.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently in Python.

I need to manage the input carefully, especially since there are multiple test cases and large constraints.

I should read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them one by one.

I need to make sure that the precomputation of next_diff is efficient, O(n) time per test case.

Then, for each query, answering in O(1) time.

Given that, the total time complexity would be O(t*n + t*q), which should be acceptable since t*n and t*q are both up to 2*10^5.

Now, let's think about the code structure.

I can use a pointer to track the current position in the input tokens.

For each test case:

- Read n

- Read the array a of n integers

- Precompute next_diff

- Read q

- For each query:

- Read l and r

- If next_diff[l-1] <= r, output l and next_diff[l-1]+1

- Else, output -1 -1

I need to handle the indexing carefully to avoid off-by-one errors.

Let me think about the precomputation again.

In the precomputation, I need to find for each position i, the smallest j > i such that a[j] ≠ a[i], or n if no such j exists.

I can iterate through the array, and for each group of consecutive identical elements, set next_diff[i] for all i in that group to the start of the next group.

This way, it's efficient and correct.

Let me try to implement the precomputation in code.

Here's a sample implementation:

def precompute_next_diff(a):

n = len(a)

next_diff = [n] * n

i = 0

while i < n:

current = a[i]

j = i

while j < n and a[j] == current:

j += 1

for k in range(i, j):

next_diff[k] = j

i = j

return next_diff

This should work correctly.

Now, I need to integrate this into the main function.

Also, I need to handle multiple test cases correctly, making sure that each test case is processed independently.

I need to make sure that the pointer for input tokens is correctly updated after each test case.

In Python, reading all input at once and splitting into tokens is efficient.

I can use an iterator to handle the tokens one by one.

Let me sketch the code structure.

import sys

def main():

import sys

data = sys.stdin.read().split()

ptr = 0

t = int(data[ptr])

ptr += 1

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[ptr])

ptr += 1

a = list(map(int, data[ptr:ptr+n]))

ptr += n

next_diff = precompute_next_diff(a)

q = int(data[ptr])

ptr += 1

for _ in range(q):

l = int(data[ptr])

r = int(data[ptr+1])

ptr += 2

if next_diff[l-1] <= r:

print(l, next_diff[l-1] + 1)

else:

print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

This should work.

But I need to make sure that the indices are correctly managed.

In the precompute_next_diff function, next_diff[i] is 0-based, and in the output, indices are 1-based.

So, when outputting, I need to print l and next_diff[l-1] + 1.

Also, need to ensure that l and j are within [l, r].

Wait, in the case where next_diff[l-1] <= r, a[next_diff[l-1]] ≠ a[l-1], so j = next_diff[l-1] + 1 (1-based), which is within [l, r].

But need to make sure that j is within [l, r].

Wait, since next_diff[l-1] <= r, and next_diff[l-1] is 0-based, j = next_diff[l-1] + 1 is 1-based, which should be <= r.

Wait, no, next_diff[l-1] is the 0-based index, and j = next_diff[l-1] + 1 is 1-based, which should be <= r.

Wait, need to verify this.

Take the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,2,1,1]

next_diff=[2,2,3,4,4]

Query [1,2]:

l=1, r=2

next_diff[0]=2 <=2, so j=3, but 3 >2, which is outside [1,2]. Wait, but in this case, next_diff[0]=2 <= r=2, but j=3 is outside [1,2], which is incorrect.

Wait, there's a mistake here.

Wait, no, next_diff[0]=2, which is index 2 in 0-based, which is 3 in 1-based, which is outside [1,2], so actually, next_diff[l-1] > r, so should output -1 -1.

Wait, in the earlier reasoning, I thought next_diff[l-1] <= r means j is within [l, r], but in this case, next_diff[0]=2 <=2, but j=3 >2.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the condition.

Let me think again.

If next_diff[l-1] <= r, then j = next_diff[l-1] +1 (1-based), and j should be within [l, r].

But in this case, j=3 >2, which is outside [1,2], so it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that j <= r.

So, in the output, if next_diff[l-1] < r, then j = next_diff[l-1] +1 <= r, and a[j] ≠ a[l-1].

If next_diff[l-1] == r, then j = r +1, which is outside [l, r], so it's invalid.

Wait, but in the precomputation, next_diff[i] is the smallest j > i where a[j] ≠ a[i], or n if no such j exists.

So, in the query [l, r], if next_diff[l-1] <= r, then there exists a j in [l, r] where a_j ≠ a_l.

But in the above example, next_diff[0]=2 <=2, but j=3 is outside [1,2], which seems contradictory.

Wait, no, next_diff[0]=2 means that a[2] ≠ a[0], and 2 is within [1,2] in 1-based indexing.

Wait, a[1]=1, a[2]=1, a[3]=2.

Wait, a[2]=1 == a[1]=1, but next_diff[0]=2 means that the next different element from a[0] is at index 2 (0-based), which is a[3]=2 ≠ a[0]=1.

But in the query [1,2], we are only considering a[1] and a[2], both are 1, so no different pair exists within [1,2].

But next_diff[0]=2, which is index 3, which is outside [1,2], so should output -1 -1.

Hence, the condition should be: if next_diff[l-1] < r, then there exists a j in [l, r] where a_j ≠ a_l, and j = next_diff[l-1] +1.

If next_diff[l-1] == r, then j = r +1, which is outside [l, r], so output -1 -1.

So, the correct condition is: if next_diff[l-1] < r, output l and next_diff[l-1]+1; else, output -1 -1.

Yes, that makes sense.

In the earlier example, next_diff[0]=2 < r=2? 2 < 2 is False, so output -1 -1.

In query [1,3], next_diff[0]=2 <3, so output 1 and 3.

Perfect.

So, I need to adjust the condition to next_diff[l-1] < r.

Let me update the code accordingly.

import sys

def precompute_next_diff(a):

n = len(a)

next_diff = [n] * n

i = 0

while i < n:

current = a[i]

j = i

while j < n and a[j] == current:

j += 1

for k in range(i, j):

next_diff[k] = j

i = j

return next_diff

def main():

import sys

data = sys.stdin.read().split()

ptr = 0

t = int(data[ptr])

ptr += 1

for _ in range(t):

n = int(data[ptr])

ptr += 1

a = list(map(int, data[ptr:ptr+n]))

ptr += n

next_diff = precompute_next_diff(a)

q = int(data[ptr])

ptr += 1

for _ in range(q):

l = int(data[ptr])

r = int(data[ptr+1])

ptr += 2

if next_diff[l-1] < r:

print(l, next_diff[l-1] + 1)

else:

print(-1, -1)

if __name__ == "__main__":

main()

This should work correctly.

Let me verify it with the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

5

5

1 1 2 1 1

3

1 5

1 2

1 3

...

Sample Output for the first test case:

2 3

-1 -1

1 3

Wait, in my approach:

For query [1,5]:

next_diff[0]=2 <5, so output 1 and 3

For query [1,2]:

next_diff[0]=2 <2? 2 <2 is False, so output -1 -1

For query [1,3]:

next_diff[0]=2 <3, so output 1 and 3

Which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[30,20,20,10,10,20]

Queries:

1 2

2 3

2 4

2 6

3 5

Compute next_diff:

i=0: a[0]=30, a[1]=20 ≠ a[0], so next_diff[0]=1

i=1: a[1]=20, a[2]=20 == a[1], a[3]=10 ≠ a[1], so next_diff[1]=3

i=2: a[2]=20, a[3]=10 ≠ a[2], so next_diff[2]=3

i=3: a[3]=10, a[4]=10 == a[3], a[5]=20 ≠ a[3], so next_diff[3]=5

i=4: a[4]=10, a[5]=20 ≠ a[4], so next_diff[4]=5

i=5: a[5]=20, no next different, so next_diff[5]=6

next_diff = [1,3,3,5,5,6]

Queries:

1 2:

next_diff[0]=1 <2, so output 1 and 2

But in the sample output, it's 2 1, which is equivalent since a[2]=20 ≠ a[1]=30.

So, both are correct.

2 3:

next_diff[1]=3 ==3, so output -1 -1

But sample output is -1 -1

2 4:

next_diff[1]=3 <4, so output 2 and 4

Sample output is 4 2, which is also correct.

2 6:

next_diff[1]=3 <6, so output 2 and 4

Sample output is 4 6, which is also correct, since a[4]=10 ≠ a[2]=20

3 5:

next_diff[2]=3 <5, so output 3 and 4

Sample output is 5 3, which is also correct.

So, my approach matches the sample outputs.

Therefore, I can conclude that this solution is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this
