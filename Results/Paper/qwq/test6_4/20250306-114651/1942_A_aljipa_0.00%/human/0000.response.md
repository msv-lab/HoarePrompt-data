Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to create an array of length n, where each element is between 1 and 10^9, and exactly k out of the n cyclic shifts of this array are sorted.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift is. From the description, the x-th cyclic shift of the array a is a_x, a_{x+1}, ..., a_n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{x-1}. So, essentially, it's like rotating the array x-1 times to the left.

For example, if n=4 and the array is [1,2,3,3], the cyclic shifts are:

- x=1: [1,2,3,3] (original array)

- x=2: [2,3,3,1]

- x=3: [3,3,1,2]

- x=4: [3,1,2,3]

And among these, only the first one is sorted.

So, the task is to find an array where exactly k such shifts are sorted.

Constraints:

- t ≤ 10^3 (number of test cases)

- For each test case, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3

- Sum of n over all test cases ≤ 10^3

Output:

- For each test case, output the array if it exists, or -1 if it doesn't.

Examples provided:

1. n=2, k=2 → [1,1]

Both shifts are sorted.

2. n=3, k=1 → [69420,69,420]

Only one shift is sorted.

3. n=3, k=2 → -1

No such array exists.

Okay, so I need to find a general way to construct such an array for given n and k, or determine that it's impossible.

Let me think about the properties of the array that would make exactly k cyclic shifts sorted.

First, consider the case when k = n. That means all cyclic shifts must be sorted.

What does that imply?

If all cyclic shifts are sorted, then the array must be constant, i.e., all elements are equal.

Because if any two elements are different, rotating the array so that the smaller one comes after the larger one would make that shift unsorted.

For example, if array is [1,2,1], then shifting to [2,1,1] which is not sorted.

Hence, for k = n, the array must have all elements equal.

And indeed, in the first example, n=2, k=2, the array is [1,1].

So, generalizing, for k = n, set all a_i to the same value.

Now, consider k = 1.

That means exactly one cyclic shift is sorted, and the rest are not.

Looking at the second example, n=3, k=1, the array is [69420,69,420].

Let's check the shifts:

1. [69420,69,420] → not sorted

2. [69,420,69420] → sorted

3. [420,69420,69] → not sorted

Hence, only one sorted shift.

How to construct such an array?

I need to ensure that only one particular rotation results in a sorted array.

One way to think about this is to have the array almost sorted, but with a specific wrap-around that makes only one shift sorted.

For k=1, perhaps having the array in a specific order where only one rotation makes it increasing.

Wait, in the example, [69420,69,420], the sorted shift is [69,420,69420], which is ascending.

So, perhaps arranging the array in a way that only one rotation brings it to ascending order.

Is there a pattern here?

Let's consider n=3, k=1.

If I set a1 < a2 < a3, then all rotations would be sorted, which is k=3, but we need k=1.

So, that won't work.

Alternatively, if I set a1 < a2 > a3, maybe that would work.

Wait, in the example, 69420 > 69 < 420.

Wait, 69420 > 69, and 69 < 420.

So, it's like a valley.

Similarly, in n=4, k=1, how to arrange?

Maybe have one peak or one valley.

Wait, but in n=3, k=1, [69420,69,420], which is [large, small, medium].

So, rotating it:

- [69420,69,420] → not sorted

- [69,420,69420] → sorted

- [420,69420,69] → not sorted

Yes, only one sorted shift.

So, perhaps for k=1, arrange the array in a way that only one rotation is sorted.

Is there a general pattern for k=1?

Maybe have the array in increasing order except for one drop.

Wait, but in the example, it's not strictly increasing except for one drop; it's more like having one local minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps arranging the array in a way that the difference between consecutive elements (with wrap-around) has only one increasing sequence.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of permutations.

But in this problem, elements can be equal and up to 10^9.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of how many times the array "wraps around" in its sortedness.

Wait, perhaps think about how many times the array is increasing or decreasing.

Wait, maybe think about the number of increasing sequences in the circular array.

Wait, perhaps think in terms of the number of times the array decreases.

For example, in the array [69420,69,420], it decreases from 69420 to 69, and then increases from 69 to 420.

So, there's one decrease.

In the shifts:

- [69420,69,420]: decreases once

- [69,420,69420]: increases twice

- [420,69420,69]: decreases once

Hence, only one shift is sorted.

So, perhaps for k=1, arrange the array to have exactly one decrease.

Then, only one shift will make it increasing.

Wait, but in n=4, k=1, how would that work?

For example, [4,1,2,3]

Shifts:

- [4,1,2,3] → not sorted

- [1,2,3,4] → sorted

- [2,3,4,1] → not sorted

- [3,4,1,2] → not sorted

Hence, only one sorted shift.

So, seems like arranging the array with one decrease satisfies k=1.

Similarly, for k=2, perhaps arrange two decreases?

But in the example where n=3, k=2, it's impossible.

Wait, in n=4, k=2, is it possible?

Let's try [1,2,4,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,4,3] → sorted except 4>3

- [2,4,3,1] → 4>3, 3<1

- [4,3,1,2] → 4>3, 1<2

- [3,1,2,4] → 3>1, 2<4

Only one shift is sorted.

Hmm.

Alternatively, [1,3,2,4]

Shifts:

- [1,3,2,4] → 1<3, 3>2

- [3,2,4,1] → 3>2, 4>1

- [2,4,1,3] → 2<4, 4>1

- [4,1,3,2] → 4>1, 3>2

Only one sorted shift.

Seems like it's hard to get exactly two sorted shifts.

Wait, maybe it's impossible for n=4, k=2.

Wait, but in n=3, k=2 is impossible, and perhaps similarly for n=4.

Wait, but in n=3, k=2 is impossible, but maybe for n=4, k=2 is possible.

Let me try [1,2,3,4]

All shifts are sorted: [1,2,3,4], [2,3,4,1], [3,4,1,2], [4,1,2,3]

But [2,3,4,1] is not sorted because 4>1.

Wait, no, 4>1 is not increasing, so it's not sorted.

Wait, the problem says "c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq ... \leq c_{x,n}"

So, for [2,3,4,1], 2<=3<=4<=1 is not true because 4<=1 is false.

Hence, only the original [1,2,3,4] is sorted.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, [1,2,3,4] has only one sorted shift, which is itself.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=4, k=1, it's [1,2,3,3] has only one sorted shift.

Wait, perhaps I misread earlier.

But in the example, n=4, k=1 is not provided, but from the earlier thought, for n=4, k=1, [1,2,4,3] has only one sorted shift.

Similarly, [1,2,3,4] has only one sorted shift.

So, perhaps for k=1, arrange the array to have exactly one decrease.

Then, only one shift will make it sorted.

Similarly, for k=2, maybe arrange two decreases, but perhaps it's not straightforward.

Wait, in the problem, for n=3, k=2 is impossible, as per the example.

Hence, perhaps for k=2 and n=3, it's impossible.

Similarly, for n=4, k=2 might also be impossible.

Wait, but for n=4, k=2, maybe [1,2,3,4] has only one sorted shift.

Wait, perhaps for k=2, it's impossible when n=4.

Wait, but let's think differently.

Perhaps, for k=1, arrange the array to have exactly one decrease.

For k=2, arrange two decreases, but perhaps that leads to more than two sorted shifts.

Hence, maybe for k >=2, it's only possible under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible.

But in the problem, for n=3, k=1 is possible, k=3 is possible, k=2 is impossible.

Similarly, for n=4, k=1 and k=4 might be possible, but k=2 is not.

Hence, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible, and for other k, it's impossible.

Wait, but in n=4, k=2 is impossible, n=3, k=2 is impossible.

Wait, but in n=4, k=3 might also be impossible.

Let me check.

Suppose n=4, k=3.

If I have an array where three cyclic shifts are sorted, and one is not.

Is that possible?

Let's try [1,1,1,2]

Shifts:

- [1,1,1,2] → sorted

- [1,1,2,1] → not sorted (2>1)

- [1,2,1,1] → not sorted (2>1)

- [2,1,1,1] → not sorted (2>1)

Hence, only one sorted shift.

Not k=3.

Alternatively, [1,2,3,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,2] → 1<=2<=3<=2 (not sorted)

- [2,3,2,1] → 2<=3<=2<=1 (not sorted)

- [3,2,1,2] → 3<=2<=1<=2 (not sorted)

- [2,1,2,3] → 2<=1<=2<=3 (not sorted)

No sorted shifts.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, [1,2,2,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,2,2] → sorted

- [2,2,2,1] → not sorted (2>1)

- [2,2,1,2] → not sorted (2>1)

- [2,1,2,2] → not sorted (2>1)

Again, only one sorted shift.

Seems like for n=4, k=3 is impossible.

Similarly, for n=3, k=2 is impossible.

Hence, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible, and for other k, it's impossible.

Wait, but in n=3, k=1 is possible, k=3 is possible, k=2 is impossible.

Similarly, in n=4, k=1 and k=4 are possible, k=2 and k=3 are impossible.

Hence, perhaps only when k=1 or k=n, it's possible; otherwise, impossible.

Is that always the case?

Wait, what about n=5, k=2?

Is that possible?

Let's try to construct such an array.

Suppose [1,2,3,4,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4,2] → not sorted (4>2)

- [2,3,4,2,1] → not sorted (4>2)

- [3,4,2,1,2] → not sorted (4>2)

- [4,2,1,2,3] → not sorted (4>2)

- [2,1,2,3,4] → not sorted (2>1)

No sorted shifts.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, [1,2,3,5,4]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,5,4] → not sorted (5>4)

- [2,3,5,4,1] → not sorted (5>4)

- [3,5,4,1,2] → not sorted (5>4)

- [5,4,1,2,3] → not sorted (5>4)

- [4,1,2,3,5] → sorted

Only one sorted shift.

Again, only k=1.

Seems like for n=5, k=2 is impossible.

Hence, perhaps only k=1 and k=n are possible, and all other k are impossible.

Therefore, the general solution is:

- If k == n, set all elements equal.

- If k == 1, arrange the array with one decrease.

- Otherwise, output -1.

But wait, in the example, n=3, k=1 is possible, and n=3, k=3 is possible, but n=3, k=2 is impossible.

Similarly, for n=4, k=1 and k=4 are possible, others are not.

But perhaps for some n, other k are possible.

Wait, what about n=6, k=3?

Is that possible?

Let's try to construct such an array.

Suppose [1,2,3,4,5,3]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4,5,3] → not sorted (5>3)

- [2,3,4,5,3,1] → not sorted (5>3)

- [3,4,5,3,1,2] → not sorted (5>3)

- [4,5,3,1,2,3] → not sorted (5>3)

- [5,3,1,2,3,4] → not sorted (5>3)

- [3,1,2,3,4,5] → not sorted (3>1)

Only one sorted shift.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, [1,2,3,4,3,2]

Shifts:

- [1,2,3,4,3,2] → not sorted (4>3)

- [2,3,4,3,2,1] → not sorted (4>3)

- [3,4,3,2,1,2] → not sorted (4>3)

- [4,3,2,1,2,3] → not sorted (4>3)

- [3,2,1,2,3,4] → not sorted (3>2)

- [2,1,2,3,4,3] → not sorted (2>1)

Only one sorted shift.

Still.

Wait, perhaps for k=1, arrange the array with one specific decrease, and for k=n, make all elements equal, and for all other k, it's impossible.

Hence, the general solution is:

- If k == n, set all a_i to the same value.

- If k == 1, arrange the array with one decrease.

- Otherwise, output -1.

In the code provided, it seems to implement this logic.

Let's look at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())

res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]

print(*res)

So, for k == n, it sets res to [1]*n, which is all elements equal to 1.

For k ==1, it sets res to range(n), which is [0,1,2,...,n-1].

For other k, it sets res to [-1].

Wait, but in the problem, for k==1, we need to arrange the array to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

Is range(n) sufficient for that?

Let's check for n=3, k=1.

range(3) is [0,1,2].

Shifts:

- [0,1,2] → sorted

- [1,2,0] → not sorted (2>0)

- [2,0,1] → not sorted (2>0)

Hence, only one sorted shift.

Good.

For n=4, k=1, range(4) is [0,1,2,3].

Shifts:

- [0,1,2,3] → sorted

- [1,2,3,0] → not sorted (3>0)

- [2,3,0,1] → not sorted (3>0)

- [3,0,1,2] → not sorted (3>0)

Hence, only one sorted shift.

Good.

So, using range(n) works for k==1.

For k==n, setting all elements to 1 is fine, as all shifts will be sorted.

For other k, it outputs [-1], which is correct if those k are impossible.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But in the problem, for k==1, the example uses [69420,69,420], which is different from range(n).

But as long as it satisfies the condition, it's acceptable.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to create an array of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of the array are sorted. We will follow a specific approach to handle different cases for `k` and ensure the correctness of the solution.

## Approach

1. **Case 1: `k == n`**
   - For `k == n`, all cyclic shifts must be sorted. This is only possible if all elements in the array are equal.
   - We choose to set all elements to 1 for simplicity.

2. **Case 2: `k == 1`**
   - For `k == 1`, exactly one cyclic shift should be sorted.
   - We use a strictly increasing sequence for the array, which ensures that only the original sequence is sorted, and all other shifts are not sorted due to the wrap-around effect.

3. **Case 3: Other values of `k`**
   - For other values of `k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for general `n` and `k`. Hence, we output `-1`.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(n))
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)

# Example usage
# func()
```

## Explanation

- **For `k == n`**:
  - We create an array where all elements are set to 1. This ensures that every cyclic shift remains sorted because all elements are equal.

- **For `k == 1`**:
  - We create an array using a strictly increasing sequence (e.g., `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`). This ensures that only the original sequence is sorted, while all other cyclic shifts introduce a wrap-around that breaks the sorted order.

- **For other values of `k`**:
  - Based on the analysis, it is concluded that having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for other values of `k` is not feasible, hence we output `-1`.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
