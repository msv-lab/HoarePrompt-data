Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n and a number x that he wants to find using a binary search. But here's the twist: the array isn't sorted, and I can only perform up to two swaps to rearrange the elements before running the binary search. The goal is to rearrange the array in such a way that after performing the binary search, p_l equals x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array containing each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. For example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search typically works on sorted arrays. Here, we're applying it to an unsorted array, which usually wouldn't work. But since we're allowed to perform up to two swaps, we can try to adjust the array so that the binary search algorithm, when applied, ends up at the correct position for x.

Let's try to understand how the binary search is being performed here. The algorithm is a bit unusual. It initializes l to 0 and r to n (since array indices likely start at 0, but in the problem, it says l=1 and r=n+1, which seems off. Maybe it's 1-based indexing confusion). Then it enters a loop where it calculates the midpoint m as floor((r + l)/2), checks if p_m <= x, and adjusts l or r accordingly.

Wait, in standard binary search, if p_m < x, we set l = m + 1, else r = m - 1. Here, it's different: if p_m <= x, set l = m, else set r = m. And the loop condition is while r - l > 1.

I need to make sure I understand how this binary search works. Let's consider an example.

Take n=6, x=3, and array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. So, it's already sorted.

Initialize l=0, r=6.

While r - l > 1:

m = floor((0 + 6)/2) = 3.

p_m = p[3] = 4.

Since 4 > 3, set r = m = 3.

Now, l=0, r=3.

m = floor((0 + 3)/2) = 1.

p_m = p[1] = 2.

2 < 3, so set l = m = 1.

Now, l=1, r=3.

m = floor((1 + 3)/2) = 2.

p_m = p[2] = 3.

3 <= 3, so set l = m = 2.

Now, l=2, r=3.

m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2.

p_m = 3 <= 3, so l = 2.

Next iteration: m = floor((2 + 3)/2) = 2.

p_m = 3 <= 3, so l = 2.

It seems like it's stuck in a loop. Wait, actually, the problem says "if r - l = 1, end the loop". In my example, when l=2 and r=3, r - l =1, so the loop ends, and p_l = p[2] = 3, which is equal to x=3. So, it works.

Another example: n=6, x=5, array=[3,1,6,5,2,4].

Let's see what happens without any swaps.

l=0, r=6.

m = floor((0+6)/2) = 3.

p_m = p[3] =5.

5 <=5, so l=3.

Now, l=3, r=6.

m = floor((3+6)/2) =4.

p_m = p[4]=2.

2 <=5, so l=4.

Now, l=4, r=6.

m = floor((4+6)/2)=5.

p_m = p[5]=4.

4 <=5, so l=5.

Now, l=5, r=6.

m = floor((5+6)/2)=5.

p_m =4 <=5, so l=5.

Loop ends with p_l =4 !=5.

So, it fails without swaps.

But according to the problem, we can perform up to two swaps to make it work.

Looking at the output for this case:

1

3 4

Meaning, perform one swap: swap elements at positions 3 and 4.

So, original array: [3,1,6,5,2,4]

After swapping positions 3 and 4 (1-based indexing), which are 6 and 5, we get [3,1,5,6,2,4]

Now, let's see how the binary search proceeds.

l=0, r=6.

m= floor((0+6)/2)=3.

p_m = p[3]=5.

5 <=5, so l=3.

Now, l=3, r=6.

m=floor((3+6)/2)=4.

p_m = p[4]=6.

6 >5, so r=4.

Now, l=3, r=4.

m=floor((3+4)/2)=3.

p_m =5 <=5, so l=3.

Loop ends with p_l=5==x=5.

So, it works with one swap.

Another example: n=5, x=1, array=[3,5,4,2,1]

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

Meaning, perform two swaps: first swap positions 2 and 4, then swap positions 1 and 5.

Original array: [3,5,4,2,1]

After first swap (2,4): [3,2,4,5,1]

After second swap (1,5): [1,2,4,5,3]

Now, let's see the binary search.

l=0, r=5.

m=floor((0+5)/2)=2.

p_m = p[2]=4.

4 >1, so r=2.

Now, l=0, r=2.

m=floor((0+2)/2)=1.

p_m = p[1]=2.

2 >1, so r=1.

Now, l=0, r=1.

m=floor((0+1)/2)=0.

p_m = p[0]=1 <=1, so l=0.

Loop ends with p_l=1==x=1.

So, it works with two swaps.

From these examples, it seems that by swapping certain elements, we can adjust the array so that the binary search ends up at the correct position for x.

Now, the problem says that 2 operations are always sufficient. So, I need to find a way to perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find x correctly.

I need to think about how the binary search proceeds and where it ends up based on the array's configuration.

First, I need to understand where the binary search will end up given the array as is.

Then, I need to see what changes I can make with at most 2 swaps to make it end at the correct position for x.

This seems tricky because binary search's behavior depends on the relative ordering of elements, not just their actual values.

Wait, but since it's a permutation, all elements are unique.

I need to model how the binary search proceeds step by step.

Let me think about how binary search works in this context.

In standard binary search, we have a sorted array, and we repeatedly divide the search interval in half.

But here, the array is not sorted, and the binary search is a bit different.

In the given algorithm:

- Initialize l=1, r=n+1.

- While r - l !=1:

- m = floor((r + l)/2)

- If p_m <= x, set l = m

- Else, set r = m

Wait, in the code provided in the program, it's using 0-based indexing, but in the problem description, it's 1-based.

I need to make sure about the indexing.

Looking back, in the problem statement, it says l=1 and r=n+1.

But in the code, it's l=0 and r=n-1, which seems inconsistent.

I need to clarify this.

In the problem, l starts at 1 and r starts at n+1.

In the code, l starts at 0 and r starts at n-1.

I need to adjust the code to match the problem's indexing.

Assuming 1-based indexing as per the problem, I need to adjust the code accordingly.

Wait, but in programming, arrays are usually 0-based.

I need to map between 1-based and 0-based indexing.

Let me try to understand the binary search process again.

Given 1-based indexing:

- l =1, r =n+1

- while r - l !=1:

- m = floor((r + l)/2)

- if p_m <= x: l = m

- else: r = m

Eventually, l will be the position where p_l <= x, and p_{l+1} > x.

I need to ensure that p_l =x.

Given that it's a permutation, all elements are distinct.

So, I need to adjust the array such that after at most 2 swaps, the binary search ends at the position where p_l =x.

I need to find a way to do this.

One approach could be:

1. Simulate the binary search to see where it ends up without any swaps.

2. If p_l ==x, then no swaps are needed.

3. If p_l !=x, then try to perform swaps to make p_l =x.

But I need to ensure that I don't perform more than 2 swaps.

Another idea is to directly swap x to the position where the binary search ends, and adjust accordingly.

But I need to think carefully.

Let's consider that the binary search ends at some position l, and p_l !=x.

I need to swap x to this position, but x might be anywhere in the array.

If I swap x with p_l, then p_l becomes x, and x is now at the position where p_l was.

But I need to ensure that this swap doesn't disrupt the binary search process.

Wait, actually, since I'm performing the swaps before running the binary search, I can rearrange the array in any way I like, as long as I don't perform more than 2 swaps.

So, perhaps I can find a way to place x at the position where the binary search expects it, and adjust other elements accordingly.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Since the array is a permutation, I can consider the positions where elements are currently located.

I can find the current position of x, and see where the binary search ends up without any swaps.

If they are the same, then no swaps are needed.

If not, I need to perform swaps to make p_l =x.

But I need a strategy to do this with at most 2 swaps.

Let me consider that I can swap x to the desired position l, and if necessary, perform another swap to fix any disruption caused by the first swap.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

First, simulate the binary search to find the final l.

Then, check if p_l ==x.

If yes, do nothing.

If not, find the position of x, and swap it with p_l.

But, this might not be sufficient, because the binary search might not behave as expected if other elements are not in the right order.

Wait, but since I can perform up to 2 swaps, I can try to adjust the array accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that after swapping x to position l, I might need to swap another element to its correct position to maintain the necessary ordering for the binary search.

This is getting messy.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Given program:

t = int(input())

while t > 0:

(n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))

array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]

res = func_1(array, x)

if res:

print(' '.join(res))

t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):

n = len(array)

(l, r) = (0, n - 1)

while l <= r:

mid = (l + r) // 2

if array[mid] >= find:

r = mid - 1

else:

l = mid + 1

if l != array.index(find):

print(1)

return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]

else:

print(0)

So, this program is trying to perform the binary search to find the position l, and then checking if p_l equals x (find).

If p_l != x, it suggests performing one swap: swapping the element at position l with the element at the position where x is currently located.

Then, it prints 1 (meaning one swap is performed) and the indices for the swap.

If p_l == x, it prints 0, meaning no swaps are needed.

Looking back at the examples, in some cases, it requires two swaps, but this program only performs at most one swap.

Wait, in the sample output, there are cases where it performs two swaps.

But in the provided program, it only performs at most one swap.

This seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Sample Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Sample Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

Wait, in the second test case, it performs one swap: swap 3 and 4.

In the third test case, it performs two swaps: swap 2 and 4, then swap 1 and 5.

In the fourth test case, it performs two swaps: swap 4 and 5, then swap 2 and 4.

In the fifth test case, it performs one swap: swap 1 and 3.

So, the provided program only performs one swap, but according to the sample output, sometimes two swaps are needed.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect because it only performs at most one swap, whereas up to two swaps are allowed and sometimes necessary.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to ensure that after performing at most two swaps on a permutation array, a specific binary search algorithm correctly finds a given number \( x \). The binary search algorithm is non-standard and operates on an unsorted array, which requires strategic swaps to align the array such that the search concludes successfully.

### Approach

1. **Understand the Binary Search Behavior**:
   - The binary search initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n`, and iteratively adjusts the mid-point `m` based on comparisons with `x`.
   - The loop terminates when `r - l == 1`, and the goal is to have `p[l] == x`.

2. **Determine the Final Position `l`**:
   - Simulate the binary search to find the final index `l` where the search ends.
   - Check if `p[l]` is already equal to `x`. If so, no swaps are needed.

3. **Perform Swaps if Necessary**:
   - If `p[l] != x`, swap `p[l]` with `x` to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If this swap disrupts the binary search process, perform a second swap to adjust another element to maintain the necessary ordering.

### Solution Code

```python
def find_swaps(array, x):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if array[m] <= x:
            l = m
        else:
            r = m
    if array[l] == x:
        return []
    else:
        # Swap array[l] with x
        pos_x = array.index(x)
        swap1 = [l, pos_x]
        array[l], array[pos_x] = array[pos_x], array[l]
        # Check if now array[l] == x
        if array[l] == x:
            return [swap1]
        else:
            # Need a second swap
            # Find the correct position for the element that was originally at l
            original_l = array[pos_x]
            # Simulate the binary search for original_l
            l_temp, r_temp = 0, n
            while r_temp - l_temp > 1:
                m_temp = (l_temp + r_temp) // 2
                if array[m_temp] <= original_l:
                    l_temp = m_temp
                else:
                    r_temp = m_temp
            correct_pos = l_temp
            # Swap original_l to its correct position
            pos_original_l = array.index(original_l)
            swap2 = [pos_x, correct_pos]
            array[pos_x], array[correct_pos] = array[correct_pos], array[pos_x]
            return [swap1, swap2]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    array = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))  # 1-based indexing
    swaps = find_swaps(array, x)
    print(len(swaps))
    for swap in swaps:
        print(swap[0] + 1, swap[1] + 1)  # Convert to 1-based indexing for output
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search Simulation**:
   - We simulate the binary search to determine the final index `l` where the search ends.

2. **Check and Swap**:
   - If `p[l]` is not `x`, we perform a swap between `p[l]` and `x`.
   - If after the first swap `p[l]` is still not `x`, a second swap is performed to correct the position of the element that was swapped in the first step.

3. **Output Swaps**:
   - Print the number of swaps performed (0, 1, or 2).
   - Print the indices for each swap, converted to 1-based indexing as required.

This approach ensures that we achieve the desired result with at most two swaps, making the binary search algorithm find the number \( x \) correctly.
