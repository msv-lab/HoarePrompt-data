Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to choose n cells in an n by n grid. These cells are specified by their coordinates (x, y), where both x and y range from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of these chosen cells. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is simply the sum of the absolute differences of their coordinates: |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

First, I need to understand what the Manhattan distance represents. In a grid, it's the distance you'd travel if you can only move horizontally and vertically, like in city streets, hence the name "Manhattan" distance.

So, my task is to select n cells in such a way that the number of unique distances between any two cells is as large as possible.

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first example, n=2. The output is:

1 1

1 2

So, the two cells chosen are (1,1) and (1,2). The distances are:

- Between (1,1) and itself: 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (1,2) and itself: 0

So, the set of distinct distances is {0,1}, which has a size of 2.

The note says that this is the maximum possible for n=2.

In the second example, n=3. The output is:

2 1

2 3

3 1

The distances are:

- Between (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- Between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, the set of distinct distances is {0,1,2,3}, which has a size of 4.

Again, it's mentioned that this is optimal for n=3.

Looking at these examples, it seems that choosing cells in such a way that they are spread out as much as possible might help in achieving a larger number of distinct distances.

But I need a general strategy that works for any n between 2 and 1000.

Let me think about the maximum possible number of distinct distances.

In an n x n grid, the maximum possible Manhattan distance between any two cells is 2(n-1), which occurs when you have two cells at opposite corners, like (1,1) and (n,n). The distance would be |1-n| + |1-n| = 2(n-1).

But since we're choosing only n cells out of n^2, we can't achieve all possible distances up to 2(n-1), but we can aim to maximize the number of distinct distances among the chosen cells.

I need to select n cells such that the number of unique distances between any two of them is maximized.

One approach could be to place the cells in a way that minimizes overlaps in the distances, thereby maximizing the number of unique distances.

Looking back at the examples:

For n=2: cells (1,1) and (1,2) give distances {0,1}

For n=3: cells (2,1), (2,3), (3,1) give distances {0,1,2,3}

For n=4: from the note, an arrangement is given, but I don't have the visual, so I'll have to infer.

Wait, the problem provides example outputs for n=2 to n=6, so maybe I can look for a pattern.

Looking at n=2: cells are in the same row, different columns.

n=3: two cells in the same row, one below in another column.

n=4: from the note, there's an arrangement, but without the visual, it's hard to see the pattern.

Perhaps there's a systematic way to choose the cells.

Let me consider choosing all cells in a single row or a single column.

For example, choose cells (1,1), (1,2), ..., (1,n).

In this case, the distances would be:

- Between any two cells (1,j) and (1,k): |j - k|

So, the distances would be all integers from 0 to n-1.

Therefore, the set of distances would be {0,1,2,...,n-1}, which has size n.

Is this the maximum possible?

Wait, in the n=3 case, the example output has 4 distinct distances {0,1,2,3}, which is more than n=3.

So, choosing all cells in a single row isn't always optimal.

Hmm.

Wait, in n=2, choosing (1,1) and (1,2) gives distances {0,1}, which is size 2, matching n=2.

But in n=3, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) would give distances {0,1,2}, size 3, but the example achieves size 4.

So, choosing all cells in a single row is not optimal for n>=3.

Therefore, I need a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

What's the maximum number of distinct distances possible for n points in an n x n grid?

I need to maximize the number of unique values of |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| for all pairs of points.

One way to approach this is to maximize the spread of the points in both the x and y directions.

Perhaps placing the points on a diagonal could help.

Wait, in n=2: choosing (1,1) and (2,2). Distances would be:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (2,2) and (2,2): 0

So, distances {0,2}, which is size 2, same as choosing cells in the same row.

Not better than choosing (1,1) and (1,2), which also gives size 2.

For n=3: choosing (1,1), (2,2), (3,3). Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (1,1) and (3,3): |1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4

- Between (2,2) and (2,2): 0

- Between (2,2) and (3,3): |2-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,3) and (3,3): 0

So, distances {0,2,4}, size 3.

But in the example for n=3, they have size 4.

So, placing points on the diagonal isn't optimal.

Alternative idea: place points in a way that they form a kind of "staircase" or spread out in both dimensions.

Looking back at n=3 example: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances: {0,1,2,3}

How does this arrangement achieve distances up to 3?

Because the maximum distance here is between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3.

In the diagonal arrangement, the maximum was 4, but only achieved size 3 due to overlaps.

So, perhaps there's a trade-off between the range of distances and the uniqueness.

I need a way to select n points such that the distances between them cover as many unique values as possible.

Another thought: maybe placing points in a way that one coordinate is fixed, and the other varies, but perhaps not entirely.

Wait, in n=2, choosing (1,1) and (1,2) gives distances {0,1}, size 2.

Choosing (1,1) and (2,1) would also give {0,1}, since |1-2| + |1-1| = 1.

Same as previous.

Choosing (1,1) and (2,2) gives {0,2}, which is different but same size.

In n=3, choosing (1,1), (1,2), (1,3) gives {0,1,2}, size 3.

But the example achieves size 4 by choosing (2,1), (2,3), (3,1).

So, perhaps choosing points in a way that they are not all in a single row or column helps.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose I fix one coordinate and vary the other, but for some points, I change the fixed coordinate.

Wait, in n=3 example, two points in the same row, and one in a different row.

Maybe for n, I can choose floor(n/2) points in one row and ceil(n/2) in another row, spread out in columns.

Wait, not sure.

Let me consider the maximum number of distinct distances possible.

The maximum possible number of distinct distances is the number of unique sums of absolute differences in x and y coordinates.

Since x and y both range from 1 to n, the possible distances range from 0 to 2(n-1).

But with only n points, the number of unique distances is limited by the number of pairs, which is n choose 2 plus n (for the zero distances).

But I need to maximize the number of unique distances, not necessarily reach all possible distances.

I need a strategy to select n points such that the pairwise distances are as diverse as possible.

Looking back at the example for n=3: points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances: 0,1,2,3

Similarly, for n=4, from the note, an arrangement is given with more distinct distances.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can be applied for any n.

Wait, perhaps choosing points along the anti-diagonal or something similar.

Wait, in n=3, (2,1), (2,3), (3,1) is not exactly the anti-diagonal, but close.

Alternatively, maybe choosing points where x + y is varied.

Wait, in n=3, for points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), the sums are 3,5,4 respectively.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps choosing points where x - y is varied.

But not sure.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix one point and vary the others.

Wait, but I need to maximize the number of unique distances among all pairs.

This seems tricky.

Another idea: perhaps place points in such a way that their x-coordinates are all different, and y-coordinates follow a certain pattern to maximize distance variations.

Wait, but in the n=3 example, two points have the same x-coordinate.

Wait, maybe it's better to have points with the same x or y to create more varied distances.

I need a better plan.

Let me look for a pattern in the example outputs.

For n=2: points (1,1) and (1,2), distances {0,1}

For n=3: points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1), distances {0,1,2,3}

For n=4: from the note, points (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4), distances presumably up to 6 or so.

Wait, for n=4, maximum possible distance is 2*(4-1) = 6.

In the n=3 case, maximum is 2*(3-1) = 4, and the example achieves up to 3.

Wait, no, in n=3 example, distance up to 3.

Wait, hold on, in n=3, points (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances: 0,1,2,3

Wait, but 3 is |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3, which is less than 2*(3-1) = 4.

So, they didn't achieve the maximum possible distance, but still maximized the number of unique distances.

Perhaps for n=3, achieving distances {0,1,2,3} is better than achieving {0,1,2,4}, even though 4 is a possible distance.

But in this case, it's not about reaching the maximum distance, but about having as many unique distances as possible.

So, perhaps it's better to have distances that are consecutive or nearly consecutive to maximize the count.

But I need a general strategy.

Let me consider choosing points such that their x-coordinates are as spread out as possible, and y-coordinates are chosen to maximize distance variation.

Wait, perhaps choosing points where x-coordinates are increasing and y-coordinates are decreasing, like a diagonal but in reverse.

Wait, that's the anti-diagonal.

For n=3: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Distances:

- Between (1,3) and (1,3): 0

- Between (1,3) and (2,2): |1-2| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (1,3) and (3,1): |1-3| + |3-1| = 2 + 2 = 4

- Between (2,2) and (2,2): 0

- Between (2,2) and (3,1): |2-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, distances {0,2,4}, which is size 3, but the example achieves size 4.

So, not better than the example.

Alternative idea: maybe choose points in a way that some x-coordinates are repeated to get more varied y differences.

Wait, in n=3 example, two points have the same x=2.

Maybe for larger n, a similar approach can be used.

Wait, perhaps choosing points in a "staircase" pattern.

For example, for n=3:

(1,1), (2,2), (3,1)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (1,1) and (3,1): |1-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Between (2,2) and (2,2): 0

- Between (2,2) and (3,1): |2-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, distances {0,2}, which is worse than the example's {0,1,2,3}.

Not helpful.

Wait, maybe choosing points in a way that x and y coordinates are as different as possible.

Wait, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the problem differently.

Suppose I fix one point and see how the distances vary with other points.

But since I need to maximize unique distances overall, not just from one point, this might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of combinatorics.

The number of unique distances is maximized when the pairwise distances are as distinct as possible.

One way to ensure this is to have the differences in coordinates be as varied as possible.

Wait, perhaps choosing points where the sum of coordinates is unique.

Wait, but sums can repeat.

Wait, in the n=3 example, sums are 3,5,4 respectively, which are all different, giving distances based on those.

But I need to consider pairwise distances, not just individual sums.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think about it in terms of the number of unique distances achievable.

For n points, there are C(n,2) + n (including the zero distances) pairs.

But with n points, the maximum number of unique distances is limited by the possible distinct values of |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Given that x and y range from 1 to n, the possible distances range from 0 to 2(n-1), and there are 2n-1 possible distinct distances in this range.

But depending on how the points are chosen, not all of these may be achievable.

So, perhaps the goal is to select n points that can achieve as many of these 2n-1 possible distances as possible.

But is that the case?

Wait, for n=2, possible distances are 0,1,2, which is 2n-2=2, but including 0 makes it 2n-1=3, but in reality, with n=2, you can only get up to distance 2.

Wait, for n=2, 2n-2=2, which matches the example's size 2.

Wait, no, 2n-1=3, but in the example, they have size 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, for n=2, possible distances are 0,1,2, which are 3 values, but in the example, they have {0,1}, which is size 2.

Wait, but is {0,1,2} achievable for n=2?

Let's see: with points (1,1) and (2,2), distances are 0 and 2.

With points (1,1) and (2,1), distances are 0 and 1.

With points (1,1) and (2,3), but n=2, so y can only be up to 2.

Wait, n=2 means y from 1 to 2.

So, points (1,1), (2,2): distances 0 and 2.

Points (1,1), (2,1): distances 0 and 1.

Points (1,1), (1,2): distances 0 and 1.

Points (1,2), (2,2): distances 0 and 1.

Points (1,1), (2,1): distances 0 and 1.

Seems like for n=2, the maximum unique distances are 2, either {0,1} or {0,2}.

The example chooses {0,1}.

But in n=3, they achieve {0,1,2,3}, which is size 4.

Wait, for n=3, possible distances are from 0 to 4 (2*(3-1)=4), so 2n-1=5 possible distances, but in the example, they have size 4.

Is it possible to achieve size 5?

Let me try.

For n=3, let's choose points (1,1), (2,3), (3,2).

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (1,1) and (3,2): |1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,2): |2-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,2) and (3,2): 0

So, distances {0,2,3}, which is size 3.

Not better than the example.

Alternative selection: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances: {0,2,4}, size 3.

Wait, but in the example for n=3, they have size 4.

So, perhaps selecting points in a way that some x's are the same and others different.

Looking back at the example: (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances: 0,1,2,3.

How is distance 1 achieved?

Between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

Between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

So, distances {0,1,2,3}.

Okay, so by having two points in the same row and one different, they achieve more unique distances.

Perhaps for n=4, a similar strategy can be applied.

Wait, in n=4 example from the note: points (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (1,1) and (4,3): |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- Between (1,3) and (1,3): 0

- Between (1,3) and (4,3): |1-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3

- Between (1,3) and (4,4): |1-4| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4

- Between (4,3) and (4,3): 0

- Between (4,3) and (4,4): |4-4| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (4,4) and (4,4): 0

So, distances {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is size 7.

For n=4, 2n-1=7, which is the maximum possible number of unique distances.

So, in this case, they achieved the maximum possible.

Similarly, for n=3, is 4 the maximum possible, or can we achieve more?

Wait, for n=3, 2n-1=5, but in the example, they have 4.

Is it possible to achieve 5?

Let me try.

Choose points (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

Distances: {0,1,2,3,4}

Wait, in this selection:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (1,1) and (3,2): |1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,2): |2-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,2) and (3,2): 0

So, distances {0,2,3}, which is size 3.

Not achieving 5.

Alternative selection: (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

Distances: {0,2,4}, size 3.

Another selection: (1,1), (2,1), (3,2)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,1): |1-2| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- Between (1,1) and (3,2): |1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- Between (2,1) and (3,2): |2-3| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,2) and (3,2): 0

So, distances {0,1,2,3}, size 4.

Same as the example.

Is there a way to get size 5?

Let me try another selection: (1,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (1,1) and (3,1): |1-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, distances {0,2,3}, size 3.

Not better.

Another selection: (1,2), (2,1), (3,3)

Distances:

- Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

- Between (1,2) and (2,1): |1-2| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (1,2) and (3,3): |1-3| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- Between (2,1) and (3,3): |2-3| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (3,3) and (3,3): 0

So, distances {0,2,3}, size 3.

Still not achieving 5.

Wait, perhaps it's not possible to achieve 5 for n=3.

Looking back, for n=3, 2n-1=5, but perhaps not all distances can be achieved with only 3 points.

Given that, maybe the maximum achievable is 4, as in the example.

So, perhaps the goal is to maximize the number of unique distances, even if not all possible 2n-1 are achievable.

In n=3, achieving 4 unique distances may be the best possible.

Similarly, for n=4, achieving 7 unique distances is possible, as shown in the example.

So, perhaps for n >=3, the maximum number of unique distances is 2n-2.

Wait, for n=3, 2n-2=4, which matches the example.

For n=4, 2n-2=6, but in the example, they achieved 7, which is 2n-1.

Wait, no, in n=4, 2n-1=7, which they achieved.

Wait, perhaps for n >=2, the maximum number of unique distances is 2n-1.

But for n=2, 2n-1=3, but in the example, they have only 2.

Wait, perhaps it's 2n-1 minus something.

Wait, for n=2, 2n-1=3, but only achieving 2.

Wait, perhaps it's 2n-1 minus the number of overlapping distances.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for n points in an n x n grid, the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances is equal to the number of unique sums of |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j| for all pairs (i,j).

Given that, perhaps there's a formula or pattern that can be used to select the points optimally.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a known mathematical result for this.

After some research, I find that in a grid, selecting points along a diagonal can maximize the number of unique distances, but in this problem, it seems that's not sufficient, as seen in the n=3 example.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is to select points in such a way that their x-coordinates and y-coordinates are as spread out as possible.

For example, for n=3, selecting (1,1), (2,2), (3,3) gives distances {0,2,4}, which is size 3.

But selecting (1,1), (2,3), (3,1) gives {0,2,3}, which is also size 3.

But the example achieves {0,1,2,3}, which is better.

Wait, perhaps including points with the same x or y helps to introduce more unique distances.

Wait, in the example for n=3, two points have the same x=2.

Maybe for larger n, choosing multiple points in the same row or column can help achieve more unique distances.

Let me try for n=4.

Suppose I choose points (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (1,1) and (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

- Between (1,2) and (2,3): |1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (1,2) and (4,4): |1-4| + |2-4| = 3 + 2 = 5

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (4,4): |2-4| + |3-4| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (4,4) and (4,4): 0

So, distances {0,1,2,3,5,6}, which is size 6.

But in the example for n=4, they have size 7.

So, not optimal.

Alternative selection: (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (1,1) and (4,3): |1-4| + |1-3| = 3 + 2 = 5

- Between (1,1) and (4,4): |1-4| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6

- Between (1,3) and (1,3): 0

- Between (1,3) and (4,3): |1-4| + |3-3| = 3 + 0 = 3

- Between (1,3) and (4,4): |1-4| + |3-4| = 3 + 1 = 4

- Between (4,3) and (4,3): 0

- Between (4,3) and (4,4): |4-4| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (4,4) and (4,4): 0

So, distances {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}, which is size 7.

This matches the example.

So, in this arrangement, all possible distances from 0 to 6 are achieved, except for distance 7, which isn't possible since the maximum is 6.

Wait, for n=4, the maximum distance is 2*(4-1)=6, and 2n-1=7, which matches the number of unique distances achieved.

So, perhaps for n >=2, the maximum number of unique distances is 2n-1, and it's achievable for n >=4, but for n=3, it's only achievable up to 4.

Wait, but for n=3, 2n-1=5, but in the example, they have only 4.

Wait, perhaps for n=3, achieving 4 is the best possible.

Wait, is it possible to achieve 5 unique distances for n=3?

Let me try selecting points (1,1), (2,2), (3,1)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,2): |1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (1,1) and (3,1): |1-3| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2

- Between (2,2) and (2,2): 0

- Between (2,2) and (3,1): |2-3| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, distances {0,2}, which is size 2.

Not better.

Alternative selection: (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (2,3): |1-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (1,1) and (3,2): |1-3| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,2): |2-3| + |3-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

- Between (3,2) and (3,2): 0

So, distances {0,2,3}, which is size 3.

Still not achieving 4.

Wait, in the example for n=3, they have 4 unique distances.

So, perhaps their selection is better.

Looking back, in the n=3 example, points are (2,1), (2,3), (3,1)

Distances:

- Between (2,1) and (2,1): 0

- Between (2,1) and (2,3): |2-2| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (2,1) and (3,1): |2-3| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1

- Between (2,3) and (2,3): 0

- Between (2,3) and (3,1): |2-3| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3

- Between (3,1) and (3,1): 0

So, distances {0,1,2,3}, which is size 4.

Better than my previous selections.

So, perhaps selecting points with some repetition in one coordinate helps achieve more unique distances.

In this case, two points share the same x-coordinate.

Maybe for larger n, a similar strategy can be applied.

Wait, for n=4, in the example, points are (1,1), (1,3), (4,3), (4,4)

Here, two points share the same x=1, and two share the same x=4.

Wait, actually, in this selection, two points have x=1, and two have x=4.

But in n=3 example, two points have x=2, and one has x=3.

Perhaps there's a pattern here.

Maybe for general n, choosing floor(n/2) points in one row and ceil(n/2) in another row, spread out in columns.

Wait, for n=3, floor(3/2)=1, ceil(3/2)=2, so choose 1 row with 2 points and another row with 1 point.

Which matches the example: points in rows 2 and 3, with 2 points in row 2 and 1 in row 3.

Similarly, for n=4, choosing 2 points in row 1 and 2 points in row 4.

This seems promising.

Let me try this strategy for n=5.

Choose 2 points in row 1 and 3 points in row 5.

For example: (1,1), (1,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,2): |1-1| + |1-2| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (1,1) and (5,3): |1-5| + |1-3| = 4 + 2 = 6

- Between (1,1) and (5,4): |1-5| + |1-4| = 4 + 3 = 7

- Between (1,1) and (5,5): |1-5| + |1-5| = 4 + 4 = 8

- Between (1,2) and (1,2): 0

- Between (1,2) and (5,3): |1-5| + |2-3| = 4 + 1 = 5

- Between (1,2) and (5,4): |1-5| + |2-4| = 4 + 2 = 6

- Between (1,2) and (5,5): |1-5| + |2-5| = 4 + 3 = 7

- Between (5,3) and (5,3): 0

- Between (5,3) and (5,4): |5-5| + |3-4| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (5,3) and (5,5): |5-5| + |3-5| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (5,4) and (5,4): 0

- Between (5,4) and (5,5): |5-5| + |4-5| = 0 + 1 = 1

- Between (5,5) and (5,5): 0

So, distances {0,1,2,5,6,7,8}, which is size 7.

For n=5, 2n-1=9, but in this selection, only 7 unique distances are achieved.

Is it possible to achieve more?

Alternative selection: (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (5,2), (5,5)

Distances:

- Between (1,1) and (1,1): 0

- Between (1,1) and (1,3): |1-1| + |1-3| = 0 + 2 = 2

- Between (1,1) and (1,4): |1-1| + |1-4| = 0 + 3 = 3

- Between (1,1) and (5,2): |1-5| + |1-2| = 4 + 1 = 5

- Between (1,1) and (5,5): |1
