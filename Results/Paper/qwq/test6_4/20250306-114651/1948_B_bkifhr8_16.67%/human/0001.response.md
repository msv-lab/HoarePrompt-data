Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I can perform a specific operation on any element that's at least 10. The operation is to delete that element and insert its digits in the same position. For example, if I have [12, 3, 45, 67] and I apply the operation to the third element, 45, it becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Another example is [2, 10], applying the operation to the second element gives [2, 1, 0].

My task is to determine if it's possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing this operation any number of times, possibly zero.

First, I need to understand what the operation allows me to do. Essentially, for any number >= 10, I can split it into its individual digits and insert them in place of the number. This can be done repeatedly.

So, for example, starting with [12, 3, 45, 67], if I split 12, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. If I then split 45, it becomes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]. Splitting 67 gives [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. This array is sorted.

In another example, [12, 28, 5], splitting 12 gives [1, 2, 28, 5], then splitting 28 gives [1, 2, 2, 8, 5]. This is not sorted, and I don't see a way to sort it by splitting numbers further.

In the third example, [0, 0], it's already sorted, so no operation is needed.

From these examples, it seems that the operation allows me to break down numbers into their digits, and I need to check if, after possibly breaking down some numbers, the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see what it's doing.

The program reads the number of test cases, t, then for each test case, it reads n (the number of elements in the array) and the array itself.

Then, it iterates through the array from the second element to the end. For each element, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current one and if the previous element is greater than 10. If both conditions are true, it splits the previous element into its tens and units digits and inserts them in place of the previous element.

After potentially performing these operations, it calls a function func_1 to check if the list is sorted.

Wait a minute, this seems too simplistic. The problem allows performing the operation any number of times, but the given program only attempts to split elements once, in a single pass through the array.

Let me think about this. Suppose I have an array like [12, 3, 21]. According to the program, it would check if 12 > 3 and 12 > 10, which is true, so it splits 12 into 1 and 2, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 21]. This is sorted, so it returns YES. That seems correct.

But what if I have [12, 28, 5] as in the second example? It would first check if 12 > 28, which is false, so it doesn't split 12. Then it checks if 28 > 5 and 28 > 10, which is true, so it splits 28 into 2 and 8, resulting in [12, 2, 8, 5]. Now, is this sorted? No, because 2 < 12, so it's not non-decreasing.

The program would then check if [12, 2, 8, 5] is sorted, which it's not, so it would return NO, which matches the expected output.

Another test case is [0, 0], which is already sorted, so no operation is needed, and it should return YES.

So, in these cases, the program seems to work correctly.

But let's consider another example to see if this approach is sufficient. Suppose the array is [100, 10, 20]. According to the program, it would iterate from the second element:

- Check if 100 > 10 and 100 > 10: true. Split 100 into 1, 0, 0, so the array becomes [1, 0, 0, 10, 20].

Now, check if [1, 0, 0, 10, 20] is sorted. It's not, because 0 < 1. So, the program would return NO.

But wait, is there a way to make this array sorted by performing more operations?

If I split the 10 into 1 and 0, the array becomes [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 20]. This is still not sorted because 0 < 1.

If I split the 20 into 2 and 0, it becomes [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0]. Still not sorted.

So, in this case, it's impossible to make the array sorted, and the program correctly returns NO.

Another example: [15, 2, 30]. 

- Check if 15 > 2 and 15 > 10: true. Split 15 into 1 and 5, so array becomes [1, 5, 2, 30].

- Now, check if 5 > 2: yes, and 5 > 10? No, so no further split.

- The array [1, 5, 2, 30] is not sorted, so return NO.

But maybe there's a different sequence of operations that could sort it.

If I first split 15 into 1 and 5: [1, 5, 2, 30].

Then, split 30 into 3 and 0: [1, 5, 2, 3, 0].

This is [1, 5, 2, 3, 0], which is not sorted.

Alternatively, if I split 2 (but it's less than 10, so can't split it).

So, seems like there's no way to sort this array, and the program correctly returns NO.

Another example: [20, 30, 15].

- Check if 20 > 30? No.

- Check if 30 > 15 and 30 > 10: yes. Split 30 into 3 and 0: [20, 3, 0, 15].

- Now, 20 > 3: yes, and 20 > 10: yes. Split 20 into 2 and 0: [2, 0, 3, 0, 15].

- Now, 0 <= 3 <= 0 <= 15? Wait, 0 <= 3 is true, 3 <= 0 is false. So, not sorted.

- Maybe if I split 15 into 1 and 5: [2, 0, 3, 0, 1, 5].

- Is this sorted? 0 <= 1 <= 2 <= 3 <= 5? Wait, 0 <= 1 <= 2 <= 3 <= 5 is true, but there's an extra 0 in the middle.

Wait, [2, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5]. No, that's not sorted.

Seems like no matter what I do, I can't sort this array, so the program correctly returns NO.

Wait, actually, in this case, the program would only perform one pass:

- Initial array: [20, 30, 15]

- Check if 20 > 30? No.

- Check if 30 > 15 and 30 > 10: yes. Split 30 into 3 and 0: [20, 3, 0, 15].

- Now, check if 20 > 3 and 20 > 10: yes. Split 20 into 2 and 0: [2, 0, 3, 0, 15].

- Now, check if 0 > 3? No.

- Check if 3 > 0 and 3 > 10? No.

- Check if 0 > 15? No.

- So, it checks if [2, 0, 3, 0, 15] is sorted, which it's not, so returns NO.

Seems correct.

But let's consider an array where multiple splits are needed.

Take [100, 11, 12].

- Initial array: [100, 11, 12]

- Check if 100 > 11 and 100 > 10: yes. Split 100 into 1, 0, 0: [1, 0, 0, 11, 12]

- Check if 0 > 11? No.

- Check if 11 > 12 and 11 > 10: yes. Split 11 into 1 and 1: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12]

- Now, check if 0 > 1? No.

- Check if 1 > 1 and 1 > 10? No.

- Check if 1 > 12? No.

- So, check if [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12] is sorted. It's not, because 0 < 1, then 0 < 1, then 1 < 12, but the initial 1 > 0 breaks it.

- So, program returns NO.

But is there a way to sort this array?

If I split 11 first: [100, 1, 1, 12]

- Then split 100: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12]

- Which is [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 12]. Not sorted.

Alternatively, split 12 into 1 and 2: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2]. This is sorted: 0 <= 0 <= 1 <= 1 <= 1 <= 2.

But the program only performs one pass of splits, so it might not catch this.

Wait, according to the program, it only attempts to split elements once, in a single pass.

So, in this case, the program would return NO, but actually, it's possible to sort the array with more splits.

Hence, the program might not be correct in this scenario.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, I can perform the operation any number of times, including zero.

So, I need to check if it's possible to perform the operation multiple times until the array is sorted.

But the given program only attempts to split elements once, in a single pass.

Therefore, it might not be sufficient to determine the correct answer in all cases.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{No}}\]
