Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation allows me to select three integers i, j, and x, and then set all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles. My goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the least possible cost.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. I need to make all elements the same, and I can do this by potentially changing a subset of the array once. I need to find the minimum cost to achieve this.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

If I choose i=2, j=4, x=8, the array becomes [1,8,8,8,5,1]. But that doesn't make all elements equal. I need to choose i and j such that after setting elements from i to j to x, the entire array becomes equal to some value.

Wait, but I can choose x to be any value, not necessarily existing in the array.

So, perhaps I should think about making the entire array equal to a specific value and see what's the minimum cost to do that.

But I can perform the operation only once, and it's to set a range of elements to a single value x.

Wait, actually, I can perform the operation at most once, meaning I might not perform it at all.

So, if the array is already equal, I don't need to do anything, and the cost is 0.

If the array is not equal, I need to decide whether to perform the operation or not.

But since I can perform it only once, I need to make sure that after performing it, all elements are equal.

Wait, but I can choose any range and set it to any value x.

So, one way is to choose a range that covers all elements that are not equal to a particular value, and set them to that value.

But I need to minimize the cost, which is the size of the range I choose.

So, perhaps I should choose the value that appears the most in the array, and then set the remaining elements to that value.

But I can only perform the operation once, so I need to set a contiguous range to that value.

Wait, but the operation is to set a contiguous range to a single value.

So, I need to choose a range and a value, set that range to that value, and make the entire array equal.

I need to find the smallest such range that, when set to a certain value, makes the entire array equal.

I think the key is to find the largest contiguous subarray that already has the same value, and then set the rest to that value.

Wait, but if I have multiple such subarrays, I need to choose one to keep and set the rest to that value.

Wait, maybe I should find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with the same value, and then the cost would be the rest of the array.

Wait, but I can choose to set a range to any value, not necessarily the existing ones.

So, perhaps I should choose a value that is already present in the array, find the longest contiguous subarray with that value, and then set the rest to that value.

But I need to make sure that after setting that range to that value, the entire array becomes equal to that value.

Wait, that might not always be possible.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to set a range to a particular value x, and after that, the entire array should be x.

That means, all elements outside this range should already be x, and all elements within this range will be set to x.

So, to minimize the cost, which is the size of this range, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x.

In other words, I need to choose x such that the number of elements equal to x is maximized, and among those, choose a range that covers all elements that are not equal to x.

Wait, but the operation is to set a contiguous range to x, so elements outside this range remain unchanged.

Therefore, for the entire array to be equal to x after the operation, all elements outside this range must already be equal to x.

So, I need to choose a range such that all elements outside this range are already equal to x.

Then, by setting this range to x, the entire array becomes x.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x, which are outside the range.

Therefore, I should choose x to be the value that appears the most in the array, and find the minimal range that, when set to x, makes the entire array equal to x.

Wait, but to make the entire array equal to x, all elements outside the chosen range must already be x.

So, I need to choose a range that includes all elements that are not equal to x.

Therefore, the minimal such range would be the minimal range that covers all non-x elements.

Then, the cost is the size of this range.

So, the problem reduces to finding, for each possible x, the minimal range that covers all elements not equal to x, and then choosing the x that minimizes this range size.

But since I can choose x to be any value, including new values not present in the array, but it's probably best to choose x as one of the existing values to maximize the number of elements already equal to x.

Wait, but if I choose x as a new value, then all elements are not equal to x, so I need to set the entire array to x, which costs n.

But I can also choose x as one of the existing values, and then only set the elements that are not equal to x.

So, it's better to choose x as one of the existing values.

Now, to find the minimal range that covers all elements not equal to x, I can find the first and last occurrence of elements not equal to x, and set the range from first to last.

Then, the cost is (last - first + 1).

But I need to choose x such that this cost is minimized.

Wait, but if I choose x as the value that appears the most, then the number of elements not equal to x is minimized, and the range covering them would be minimized.

But, it's possible that the non-x elements are spread out, so the range would be larger.

Wait, actually, the minimal range covering all non-x elements is from the first non-x element to the last non-x element.

So, for each x, the minimal range is from the first non-x to the last non-x.

Therefore, the size of this range is (last - first + 1).

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements already equal to x outside this range.

Wait, but actually, the cost is (last - first + 1), and I want to minimize this.

So, I need to choose x such that the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

In other words, choose x such that the first and last non-x elements are as close as possible.

But that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum length of a subarray where all elements are equal to x, and then the cost is n - length of this subarray.

But no, because the subarray where all elements are x doesn't need to be the one I set to x.

Wait, actually, if I choose to set a range to x, then the elements outside this range must already be x.

So, the length of the subarray where elements are already x is the length of the array minus the range I set.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I set a range to x, then the elements outside this range must already be x.

So, the length of the subarray outside this range is the number of elements already equal to x.

So, to maximize the number of elements already equal to x, I need to choose x such that the maximum subarray where all elements are x is as large as possible.

Wait, but it's not necessarily a subarray, it could be non-contiguous.

Wait, no, I need a contiguous subarray.

Wait, no, actually, the elements that are already x form a set, and I need to choose a range that covers all non-x elements.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I choose x to be the value that appears the most in the array.

Let's say x appears m times.

Then, the number of elements that are not x is n - m.

To make all elements equal to x, I need to set these n - m elements to x.

But I can only perform one operation, which is to set a contiguous range to x.

So, I need to choose a contiguous range that covers as many of these n - m elements as possible.

Wait, but the elements that are already x are already fine.

So, I need to set a range that covers all elements that are not x, provided that the elements outside this range are already x.

Wait, no.

Wait, if I set a range to x, then the elements within this range are set to x, and the elements outside this range remain as they are.

So, for the entire array to be x, the elements outside this range must already be x.

Therefore, the range must cover all elements that are not x.

So, the minimal such range is from the first element that is not x to the last element that is not x.

So, for each x, I can find the positions of elements not equal to x, and find the minimal range that covers all of them.

Then, the cost is the size of this range.

I need to choose x such that this cost is minimized.

So, for each x, find the minimal range that covers all non-x elements, and choose the x with the smallest such range.

But iterating over all possible x might be inefficient, especially if there are many unique values.

Given that n can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5, I need an efficient solution.

Is there a way to find the optimal x without iterating over all possible x?

Let me think about the array and the frequency of each value.

Suppose I have a frequency count of each value in the array.

I can identify the value that appears the most, say x_max with frequency m.

Then, the number of elements that are not x_max is n - m.

To make all elements equal to x_max, I need to set a range that covers all n - m elements that are not x_max.

So, the minimal range that covers all non-x_max elements is from the first non-x_max element to the last non-x_max element.

The size of this range is (last - first + 1).

So, the cost is (last - first + 1).

But I need to choose x such that this cost is minimized.

So, I need to choose x such that the range covering all non-x elements is minimized.

In other words, choose x such that the distance between the first and last non-x elements is minimized.

So, I need to find x where the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

Wait, but if x appears more frequently, the non-x elements are spread out more.

Wait, maybe it's better to choose x with higher frequency, so that the non-x elements are fewer and possibly closer together.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Find the value x that appears the most in the array.

- Find the positions of all elements that are not equal to x.

- Find the minimal range that covers all these non-x elements.

- The cost is the size of this range.

- Repeat for all x and choose the minimal cost.

But this would be too slow for large n and t.

Is there a smarter way?

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum length of a subarray where all elements are equal to some x, and then the cost is n - length of this subarray.

Because setting the rest of the array to x would make the entire array equal to x.

So, if I can find the maximum subarray with all elements equal to x for some x, then n - length of this subarray would be the minimal range I need to set to x to make the entire array equal to x.

Wait, but this might not be correct, because the subarray where all elements are x could be anywhere, and the range I need to set might not necessarily exclude this subarray.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray where all elements are already x, and I don't need to change them.

I need to set a range to x to make the entire array x.

So, the minimal range to set is the range that covers all elements that are not x.

So, the cost is the size of this range, which is (last - first + 1), where first and last are the positions of the first and last non-x elements.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the distance between the first and last non-x elements is minimized.

So, I need to find x where the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

But how do I find that efficiently?

An alternative approach is to find, for each x, the positions of elements not equal to x, and then find the minimal range that covers all these positions.

But again, this seems inefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal range that covers all elements that are not equal to the most frequent element.

Because choosing the most frequent element minimizes the number of elements that need to be changed.

But actually, it's not necessarily the best choice, because even if x is the most frequent, the non-x elements might be spread out, requiring a larger range to cover them.

Meanwhile, another x with lower frequency might have all non-x elements closely grouped.

So, it's not straightforward.

Given time constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider the following:

- Find the value x that appears the most in the array.

- Find the first and last occurrence of elements that are not equal to x.

- The minimal range to set to x is from first to last, inclusive.

- The cost is (last - first + 1).

- But I need to choose x such that this cost is minimized.

So, perhaps I can iterate through all possible x, but that's too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum length of a subarray where all elements are equal, and then the cost is n - length of this subarray.

Because setting the rest of the array to this value would make the entire array equal to this value.

So, if I can find the maximum length of a subarray with equal elements, then the minimal cost is n - length.

This seems promising.

Let me try this with the first example:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

The maximum length of a subarray with equal elements is 1 (since all elements are unique in their subarrays).

So, n - 1 = 5, but the expected output is 4.

Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the first example, the minimal cost is 4, which would correspond to setting indices 2 to 5 to 1, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1,1].

So, cost is 4, which is n - m, where m is the maximum number of consecutive equal elements, which is 1 in this case.

But n - m = 5, but the cost is 4.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum frequency of any value, not just consecutive.

Wait, but that might not help directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I choose to set a range to a particular value x.

To make the entire array equal to x, all elements outside this range must already be x.

So, the range must cover all elements that are not equal to x.

Therefore, the minimal range for a given x is from the first element that is not x to the last element that is not x.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the first and last non-x elements are as close as possible.

In other words, minimize (last - first + 1) for each x.

To find the x that minimizes this, I need to find the x where the non-x elements are most tightly grouped.

But how do I find that efficiently?

An alternative idea: find the maximum length of a subarray where all elements are equal to x for some x, and then the cost is n - length.

But as the first example shows, this doesn't work.

Wait, in the first example, the maximum subarray length with equal elements is 1, and n - 1 = 5, but the minimal cost is 4.

So, this approach overestimates the cost.

Perhaps I need to consider the maximum number of consecutive elements that are equal to x for some x, and then the minimal cost is n - m, where m is the maximum frequency of any value.

But again, in the first example, the maximum frequency is 2 (for 1), and n - 2 = 4, which matches the first test case.

Wait, but in the second test case:

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

The array is already equal, so cost is 0, which matches n - 7 = 0.

In the third test case:

8

8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8

The maximum subarray length with equal elements is 7 (the first four 8's and the last three 8's are not contiguous).

Wait, no, contiguous subarrays of 8's are:

- positions 1 to 3: 8,8,8

- positions 5 to 8: 8,8,8

So, the maximum length is 3.

Then, n - 3 = 5, but the output is 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the maximum frequency of any value, not just contiguous subarrays.

Wait, but the operation is to set a contiguous range to x, so maybe I need to consider the maximum number of elements already equal to x, and see how much I need to set to x to make the rest equal.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

Let x be the value we choose to make the entire array equal to.

Let's find the positions where a[i] != x.

We need to set a range from the first to the last of these positions to x.

The cost is (last - first + 1).

We need to choose x such that this cost is minimized.

So, we need to minimize (last - first + 1) over all possible x.

To minimize this, we need to minimize the distance between the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

In other words, choose x such that the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

So, perhaps I can find, for each x, the positions where a[i] != x, and then find the minimal distance between the first and last such positions.

But iterating over all x is too slow.

Is there a way to compute this more efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum number of elements that are the same within a contiguous subarray, and then the cost is n - m, where m is the maximum number of consecutive equal elements.

But as the third test case shows, m=3, n=8, n - m=5, but the output is 2.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, in the third test case, the array is [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8].

If I choose x=8, the non-x elements are at positions 4 and 5 (1 and 2).

So, the range from position 4 to 5, which is size 2.

So, the cost is 2, which matches the output.

Wait, but if I choose x=1, the non-x elements are at positions 1 to 3 and 6 to 8, which is from position 1 to 8, size 8.

Similarly, for x=2, non-x elements are at positions 1 to 3 and 5 to 8, which is from position 1 to 8, size 8.

So, choosing x=8 gives the minimal cost of 2.

Similarly, in the first test case:

[1,2,3,4,5,1]

Choosing x=1, non-x elements are at positions 2 to 5, cost=4.

Choosing x=2, non-x elements are at positions 1,3,4,5,6, cost=6.

Similarly for x=3, x=4, x=5.

So, choosing x=1 gives the minimal cost of 4.

In the second test case:

[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Choosing x=1, no non-x elements, cost=0.

So, it works.

In the third test case:

[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

Choosing x=8, non-x elements at positions 4 and 5, cost=2.

Choosing x=1 or x=2 would require setting a larger range.

So, it seems that choosing x as the value that maximizes the number of consecutive equal elements could be a way to minimize the cost.

Wait, but in the third test case, the maximum number of consecutive 8's is 3, but choosing x=8 still gives the minimal cost because the non-x elements are minimized.

Wait, but in this case, the non-x elements are only at positions 4 and 5, which are adjacent.

So, the range is small.

So, perhaps choosing x such that the non-x elements are as close as possible.

But how to compute this efficiently?

An idea: find the value x such that the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

To do this, for each x, find the positions of a[i] != x, and find the minimal range that covers all these positions.

But again, this seems inefficient.

An optimization: notice that the minimal range that covers all non-x elements is from the first to the last non-x element.

So, for each x, find the first and last positions where a[i] != x, and compute (last - first + 1).

Then, choose the x that minimizes this value.

But iterating over all x is too slow.

An optimization: observe that the first and last non-x positions for different x can be precomputed.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each position, the value that appears there, and keep track of the first and last positions where a[i] != x for each x.

But that still seems inefficient.

An alternative approach: realize that the minimal cost is equal to the minimal (last - first + 1) over all x, where first and last are the first and last positions where a[i] != x.

To minimize this, I need to choose x such that the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

An optimization: choose x such that the non-x elements are as few as possible and as close as possible.

But how to compute this efficiently?

An idea: find the maximum number of consecutive elements that are equal to x for any x, and then set the rest to x.

Wait, but in the third test case, the maximum number of consecutive 8's is 3, but choosing x=8 still gives a minimal cost of 2, which is better than n - m = 8 - 3 = 5.

So, perhaps I need to consider the entire array and find the minimal range that covers all elements that are not equal to x, for the best x.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and keep track of the frequency of each value.

Then, for each value x, the number of elements that are not x is n - frequency[x].

But I need to cover all non-x elements with a single range.

So, the minimal range that covers all non-x elements is from the first to the last non-x element.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to choose x such that the distance between the first and last non-x elements is minimized.

So, I need to find x where the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

But how to find this efficiently?

An optimization: note that if I choose x to be the value that appears the most, and its frequency is m, then the number of non-x elements is n - m.

But I need to cover these n - m elements with a single range.

So, the cost is (last - first + 1), where first and last are the first and last positions of non-x elements.

To minimize this, I need to choose x such that the non-x elements are as close together as possible.

An efficient way to compute this is:

- Find the value x that appears the most, and has the minimal distance between the first and last non-x elements.

But iterating over all x is too slow.

An alternative approach: find the maximum frequency of any value, and then find the minimal distance between the first and last positions of non-x elements for that x.

Wait, but I need to do this efficiently.

An optimization: iterate through the array, keep track of the frequency of each value.

Then, for the value with the highest frequency, find the first and last positions of elements that are not equal to this value, and compute the cost as (last - first + 1).

But in the third test case, x=8 has frequency 6, and the first and last non-x elements are at positions 4 and 5, so cost is 2.

Similarly, in the first test case, x=1 has frequency 2, and the first and last non-x elements are at positions 2 and 5, so cost is 4.

This seems to work.

So, the approach is:

- Find the value x that appears the most in the array.

- Find the first and last positions of elements that are not equal to x.

- The minimal cost is (last - first + 1).

- If there are multiple values with the same maximum frequency, choose the one with the minimal (last - first + 1).

This should be efficient enough, as finding the frequency and the first and last positions can be done in linear time.

But in the third test case, x=8 has frequency 6, and the non-x elements are at positions 4 and 5, so last - first + 1 = 2.

Similarly, in the first test case, x=1 has frequency 2,
