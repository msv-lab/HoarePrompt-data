Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase Latin letters such that there are exactly n special characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. Let's look at the example provided: in the string "AAABAACC", there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It's equal to both, so it shouldn't be special. Wait, but according to the problem, it is special. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "exactly one of its neighbors". So, for position 1, 'A' is equal to its right neighbor 'A' but not its left neighbor (assuming the left neighbor doesn't exist, so it's only equal to one neighbor). That makes sense. So, for the first character, if it's equal to its only neighbor, the right one, then it's special.

Similarly, for the last character, it's only equal to its left neighbor.

For characters in the middle, they have both left and right neighbors.

So, to generalize:

- For the first character, it's special if it's equal to its right neighbor.

- For the last character, it's special if it's equal to its left neighbor.

- For any character in between, it's special if it's equal to exactly one of its neighbors (either left or right, but not both).

Got it.

Now, I need to build a string where the total number of such special characters is exactly n.

I need to find such a string for each test case, and if it's possible, print "YES" followed by the string, otherwise "NO".

Constraints:

- t is up to 50, so multiple test cases.

- n is from 1 to 50.

- The string can be up to 200 characters long.

It's also mentioned that if there's a solution, there's at least one solution of length at most 200.

Okay, so I need to find a string for each n between 1 and 50, with at most 200 characters, that has exactly n special characters as defined.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a pattern or a way to construct such a string.

Let me consider some small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's start with n=1.

For n=1, I need a string with exactly one special character.

Let's try:

- "A": only one character, which is special because it's equal to none of its neighbors (but according to the problem, it's equal to exactly one neighbor, which doesn't make sense because it has no neighbors. Maybe the problem considers it as not special in this case. So, maybe this isn't special.

Wait, the problem says "equal to exactly one of its neighbors". If a character has no neighbors, it has no neighbors to be equal to, so it doesn't satisfy "exactly one neighbor". So, probably, single character is not special.

So, "A" has 0 special characters.

Let's try "AA": two 'A's.

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'A', so it's special.

- Position 2: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'A', so it's special.

Total special characters: 2.

That's more than n=1.

Let's try "AB": two characters, 'A' and 'B'.

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'B'? No, so not special.

- Position 2: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A'? No, so not special.

Total special characters: 0.

Not enough.

Let's try "ABA": three characters.

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'B'? No, not special.

- Position 2: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A' and its right neighbor 'A'. So, it equals neither or both? Wait, it's equal to neither, so not special.

- Position 3: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'B', no, so not special.

Total special characters: 0.

Not enough.

Wait, maybe "AAB":

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'A', so special.

- Position 2: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'A' and its right neighbor 'B'. So, it equals its left neighbor but not its right, so special.

- Position 3: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A', no, so not special.

Total special characters: 2.

Still more than n=1.

Hmm.

Is it possible to have exactly one special character?

Let me try "ABC":

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'B'? No.

- Position 2: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A' and its right neighbor 'C'. Neither, so not special.

- Position 3: 'C' equals its left neighbor 'B', no, so not special.

Total: 0.

Still 0.

Let's try "ABBA":

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'B', no, so not special.

- Position 2: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A' and its right neighbor 'B'. It equals its right neighbor but not its left, so special.

- Position 3: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'B' and its right neighbor 'A'. It equals its left neighbor but not its right, so special.

- Position 4: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'B', no, so not special.

Total: 2.

Again, more than n=1.

Wait, is it possible to have exactly one special character?

Let me think differently. Maybe it's not possible for n=1.

Let me check n=2.

From above, "AAB" has 2 special characters.

So, for n=2, it's possible.

Wait, but in the example, for n=1, the output is 'NO', meaning it's impossible.

So, maybe for odd n, it's impossible.

Looking back at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2:

print('NO')

else:

s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)

if len(s) < 200:

print('YES')

print(s)

else:

print('NO')

It seems to suggest that if n is odd, it's impossible, and if n is even, construct the string by repeating 'AAB' n//2 times.

Let me verify this.

First, check for n=6:

s = 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAAB'

Let's count special characters:

- Position 1: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'A', special.

- Position 2: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'A' and its right neighbor 'B', so equals left but not right, special.

- Position 3: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A', no, not special.

- Position 4: 'A' equals its right neighbor 'A', special.

- Position 5: 'A' equals its left neighbor 'A' and its right neighbor 'B', so equals left but not right, special.

- Position 6: 'B' equals its left neighbor 'A', no, not special.

Total special characters: 4, but n=6. So, this doesn't match. The program is incorrect here.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Let's recount:

- Pos1: 'A' == Pos2 'A', special.

- Pos2: 'A' == Pos1 'A' and Pos3 'B', so equals Pos1 but not Pos3, special.

- Pos3: 'B' != Pos2 'A' and != Pos4 'A', not special.

- Pos4: 'A' == Pos5 'A', special.

- Pos5: 'A' == Pos4 'A' and Pos6 'B', equals Pos4 but not Pos6, special.

- Pos6: 'B' != Pos5 'A', not special.

Total: 4 special characters, but n=6. So, the string 'AABAAB' has 4 special characters, but we need 6.

This means the program is incorrect because for n=6, it provides a string with 4 special characters, not 6.

So, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

But let's see what the example output says for n=6: it's "YES" followed by "AAABAACC", which has 6 special characters.

Wait, in the example, for n=6, it's "AAABAACC" with 6 special characters.

But according to the program, for n=6, it would produce 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAAB', which has only 4 special characters.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't produce the correct number of special characters for n=6.

Moreover, for n=2, the program would output "YES" and "AAB", but "AAB" has 2 special characters, which is correct.

For n=1, it correctly outputs "NO" since n is odd.

But for n=6, it outputs "AABAAB", which is incorrect because it has 4 special characters, not 6.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
