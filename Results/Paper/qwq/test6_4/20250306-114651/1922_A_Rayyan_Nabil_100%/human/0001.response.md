Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of n lowercase Latin letters. I need to determine if there exists a template t such that strings a and b match the template, while string c does not match it.

First, I need to understand what it means for a string to match the template. The template can have both lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. The rules are:

1. If the i-th letter of the template is lowercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be exactly the same.

2. If the i-th letter of the template is uppercase, then the i-th letter of the string must be different from the lowercase version of the template's letter.

For example, if the template has 'A' at position i, then the string must have any letter except 'a' at that position.

My task is to find such a template t that makes a and b match, but c does not match.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to consider each position from 1 to n and decide whether to make the template's letter at that position lowercase or uppercase.

If I choose to make the template's letter at position i lowercase, then both a and b must have the same letter at that position as the template, and c must have a different letter.

If I choose to make it uppercase, then both a and b must have letters at position i that are different from the lowercase version of the template's letter, and c must have a letter that either matches or doesn't match depending on the template's case.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can look at each position independently and see what constraints they impose.

Let's consider position i.

Case 1: Template's letter at position i is lowercase, say 'x'.

- Then, a[i] must be 'x', b[i] must be 'x', and c[i] must not be 'x'.

So, for this case to be possible:

- a[i] == b[i], and c[i] != a[i].

Case 2: Template's letter at position i is uppercase, say 'X'.

- Then, a[i] must not be 'x', b[i] must not be 'x', and c[i] must be 'x'.

Wait, no. Actually, if the template has an uppercase letter, the strings a and b must have letters at position i that are different from the lowercase version of the template's letter.

But in the template, it's uppercase, so the condition for matching is that the string's letter is different from the lowercase version of the template's letter.

Wait, the template has an uppercase letter, say 'X', which corresponds to lowercase 'x'. So, for a and b to match, they must have letters at position i that are not 'x'. And for c to not match, it must have 'x' at position i.

Wait, but the problem says that if the template has an uppercase letter, then the string must be different from the lowercase version of that letter.

And for c to not match, it must violate this condition for at least one position.

Wait, let's rephrase.

If the template has an uppercase letter at position i, say 'X', then for the strings a and b to match, they must have letters at position i that are not 'x'. And for c to not match, it must have 'x' at position i.

Wait, but c not matching means that there is at least one position where if the template has an uppercase letter, c has the corresponding lowercase letter, or something like that.

I think I need to be more precise.

Let me define:

- For position i, if template[i] is lowercase, say 'x', then:

- a[i] == 'x'

- b[i] == 'x'

- c[i] != 'x'

- If template[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then:

- a[i] != 'x'

- b[i] != 'x'

- c[i] == 'x'

Because for c to not match the template, there must be at least one position where:

- If template[i] is lowercase, c[i] != template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase of template[i]

Wait, more precisely:

- If template[i] is lowercase, c[i] must be equal to template[i] to match, so to not match, c[i] != template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase, c[i] must be different from lowercase of template[i] to match, so to not match, c[i] == lowercase of template[i]

So, for c to not match, there must be at least one position where:

- If template[i] is lowercase, c[i] != template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase, c[i] == lowercase of template[i]

But for a and b to match, for all positions:

- If template[i] is lowercase, a[i] == template[i] and b[i] == template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase, a[i] != lowercase of template[i] and b[i] != lowercase of template[i]

So, I need to choose for each position i whether to make template[i] lowercase or uppercase, such that:

- For all i:

- If template[i] is lowercase: a[i] == template[i] and b[i] == template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase: a[i] != lowercase of template[i] and b[i] != lowercase of template[i]

- There exists at least one i where:

- If template[i] is lowercase: c[i] != template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase: c[i] == lowercase of template[i]

Wait, but in the matching rules, template[i] being lowercase means a[i] and b[i] must equal template[i], and c[i] must not equal template[i].

Similarly, if template[i] is uppercase, a[i] and b[i] must not equal the lowercase of template[i], and c[i] must equal the lowercase of template[i].

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of constraints for each position.

For each position i, there are two choices for the template: make it lowercase or uppercase.

Let's consider making template[i] lowercase.

Then:

- a[i] must equal template[i]

- b[i] must equal template[i]

- c[i] must not equal template[i]

So, for this choice to be possible:

- a[i] must equal b[i], and c[i] must not equal a[i]

Otherwise, it's impossible to choose template[i] as lowercase.

Similarly, if I choose template[i] as uppercase:

- a[i] must not equal lowercase of template[i]

- b[i] must not equal lowercase of template[i]

- c[i] must equal lowercase of template[i]

Wait, but template[i] is uppercase, so its lowercase version is known.

But I need to choose what letter to use for template[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the actual letter for template[i], considering its case.

This seems complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of the letters a[i], b[i], and c[i], and see what constraints they impose on the template.

Let me consider position i.

I have a[i], b[i], and c[i].

I need to choose template[i] such that:

- If template[i] is lowercase, then:

- a[i] == template[i]

- b[i] == template[i]

- c[i] != template[i]

- If template[i] is uppercase, then:

- a[i] != lowercase of template[i]

- b[i] != lowercase of template[i]

- c[i] == lowercase of template[i]

So, for each position i, I have these constraints based on how I choose template[i].

Now, I need to choose for each position i whether to make template[i] lowercase or uppercase, such that:

- For all positions i, the choices satisfy the constraints for a and b to match.

- There exists at least one position j where the choice makes c not match.

This seems like a problem of finding a combination of choices for each position that satisfies these conditions.

This sounds a bit like a logic problem, where each position has possible choices, and there are constraints across positions.

Given that n can be up to 20, and t can be up to 1000, I need an efficient way to solve this.

Maybe I can think in terms of possibilities for each position and see if there's a combination that works.

Let me consider that for each position i, there are two choices: make template[i] lowercase or uppercase.

But there are constraints on these choices based on a[i], b[i], and c[i].

Let me consider position i.

Case 1: Choose template[i] as lowercase.

- Then, template[i] must be equal to a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must be different from a[i].

- So, this choice is only possible if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

Case 2: Choose template[i] as uppercase.

- Then, template[i] must be uppercase, and its lowercase version must be different from a[i] and b[i], and c[i] must equal the lowercase of template[i].

- Wait, but template[i] is uppercase, so its lowercase version is simply the lowercase of whatever letter I choose.

- But I need a[i] != lowercase of template[i], b[i] != lowercase of template[i], and c[i] == lowercase of template[i].

- So, for this choice to be valid, c[i] must not equal a[i] and c[i] must not equal b[i], because c[i] equals the lowercase of template[i], which is different from a[i] and b[i].

Wait, this seems a bit tangled.

Perhaps a better approach is to consider the possible choices for each position and see what they imply for the overall template.

Let me think about the conditions more carefully.

For the template to make a and b match, and c not match, I need:

- For all i, if template[i] is lowercase, then a[i] == template[i] and b[i] == template[i].

- For all i, if template[i] is uppercase, then a[i] != lowercase of template[i] and b[i] != lowercase of template[i].

- There exists at least one j where:

- If template[j] is lowercase, then c[j] != template[j].

- If template[j] is uppercase, then c[j] == lowercase of template[j].

Now, considering that a, b, and c are all lowercase strings, perhaps I can simplify this.

Wait, a, b, and c are all given in lowercase letters.

So, template can have uppercase letters, but a, b, and c are all lowercase.

This means that when template[i] is uppercase, say 'X', then the lowercase version is 'x', so a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

But since a, b, and c are all lowercase, a[i], b[i], and c[i] are all lowercase letters.

So, for template[i] being uppercase 'X', it imposes that a[i] != 'x', b[i] != 'x', and c[i] == 'x'.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of the letters themselves.

Let me consider each position i independently.

I have a[i], b[i], and c[i], all lowercase.

Option 1: Make template[i] lowercase, equal to a[i].

- Then, template[i] = a[i], and b[i] must equal a[i], and c[i] != a[i].

- So, this option is only possible if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

Option 2: Make template[i] uppercase, say 'X', where lowercase 'x' is different from a[i] and b[i], and c[i] == 'x'.

- So, template[i] = 'X', with 'x' != a[i] and 'x' != b[i], and c[i] == 'x'.

- But since a[i] and b[i] are both lowercase, and c[i] is lowercase, I need to choose 'x' such that 'x' != a[i], 'x' != b[i], and c[i] == 'x'.

- This implies that c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for position i, I have two possibilities:

1. Choose template[i] as lowercase a[i], provided a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

2. Choose template[i] as uppercase 'X', where 'x' != a[i], 'x' != b[i], and c[i] == 'x'.

Wait, but in option 2, I need to choose 'x' such that 'x' != a[i], 'x' != b[i], and c[i] == 'x'.

But c[i] is given and is lowercase, so 'x' is c[i], which must satisfy c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Therefore, for position i, I can choose:

- Option 1: template[i] = a[i] (lowercase), if a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

- Option 2: template[i] = uppercase letter corresponding to c[i], if c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Wait, but in option 2, template[i] is uppercase, and its lowercase version is c[i], which must be different from a[i] and b[i].

So, for option 2 to be valid, c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

Now, I need to choose for each position i either option 1 or option 2, such that:

- For all positions i, if option 1 is chosen, then a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

- For all positions i, if option 2 is chosen, then c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

- Additionally, there must be at least one position where the choice leads to c not matching the template.

But, in option 1, choosing template[i] as lowercase a[i], c[i] != a[i], so c doesn't match at that position.

In option 2, choosing template[i] as uppercase 'X' with lowercase 'x' = c[i], then c matches at that position because c[i] == 'x'.

Wait, no. In option 2, if template[i] is uppercase 'X', then for c to not match, c[i] must equal 'x', which is the lowercase of 'X'.

But according to the rules, if template[i] is uppercase, then c must be different to match, but c has 'x', so it doesn't match.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

- If template[i] is uppercase 'X', then for c to match, c[i] must not equal 'x'.

- But in option 2, c[i] == 'x', so c doesn't match at that position.

Wait, but according to the problem statement:

- If template[i] is uppercase, then s[i] must be different from the lowercase of template[i] to match.

- Therefore, if template[i] is uppercase 'X', s[i] must not equal 'x' to match.

- So, if c[i] == 'x', then c doesn't match at that position.

Therefore, in option 2, choosing template[i] as uppercase 'X' with lowercase 'x' = c[i], ensures that c doesn't match at that position.

Similarly, in option 1, choosing template[i] as lowercase a[i], with c[i] != a[i], ensures that c doesn't match at that position.

Wait, but in option 1, choosing template[i] as lowercase a[i], with a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i], ensures that a and b match, and c doesn't match at that position.

In option 2, choosing template[i] as uppercase 'X' with lowercase 'x' = c[i], and c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i], ensures that a and b have letters different from 'x', so they match, and c has 'x', so it doesn't match.

So, in both options, c doesn't match at position i.

But I need c to not match the template, which means that there is at least one position where c doesn't match.

So, if I choose any combination of options where at least one position has c not matching, which both options ensure for their respective positions, then as long as at least one position has c not matching, it's sufficient.

Wait, but actually, in both options, c doesn't match at position i.

So, if I choose any combination of options, c will not match at all positions where option 1 or option 2 is chosen.

Wait, no. In option 1, c doesn't match at position i because c[i] != a[i].

In option 2, c doesn't match at position i because c[i] == 'x', which is the lowercase of the uppercase letter in the template, which is a mismatch for c.

Wait, no. Let's recall:

- In option 1: template[i] = a[i] (lowercase), so for c to match, c[i] == a[i], but since c[i] != a[i], c doesn't match at position i.

- In option 2: template[i] = 'X' (uppercase), with lowercase 'x' = c[i], so for c to match, c[i] must not equal 'x', but c[i] == 'x', so c doesn't match at position i.

Therefore, in both options, c doesn't match at position i.

So, if I choose any combination of options for all positions, c will not match at every position, which is stronger than needed.

I only need c to not match at least one position, but with this approach, c doesn't match at all positions where option 1 or option 2 is chosen.

Wait, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Actually, in option 2, choosing template[i] as uppercase 'X' with lowercase 'x' = c[i], then for c to match, it must have c[i] != 'x', but since c[i] == 'x', it doesn't match.

So, in both options, c doesn't match at position i.

Therefore, if I choose any combination of options for all positions, c will not match the template because there will be positions where it doesn't match.

But the problem requires that c does not match the template, which means that there is at least one position where c doesn't match.

So, if I can choose a template where for all positions, c doesn't match, that's sufficient, as it's a stronger condition.

But I need to ensure that a and b match the template for all positions.

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a choice of options for each position such that:

- For all positions i:

- If option 1 is chosen: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- If option 2 is chosen: c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

And there is at least one position where c doesn't match, which is already ensured in both options.

Wait, but in option 2, c doesn't match at position i, and in option 1, c doesn't match at position i.

So, as long as I choose at least one position to apply either option 1 or option 2, c will not match the template.

But I need to ensure that for all positions, a and b match the template.

So, for option 1: choose template[i] = a[i] (lowercase), requiring a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i].

For option 2: choose template[i] = 'X' (uppercase), with lowercase 'x' = c[i], requiring c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i].

So, for the entire template to satisfy the conditions, for each position i:

- Either a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i] (option 1)

- Or c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i] (option 2)

And there must be at least one position where c doesn't match, which is already ensured.

So, the overall condition is that for all positions i, one of the two conditions must hold:

1. a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

And there exists at least one position where c doesn't match, which is already covered.

Therefore, I can iterate through all positions and check if for each position, at least one of the two conditions holds.

If it does for all positions, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but in the example provided:

First test case:

n = 1

a = "a"

b = "b"

c = "c"

Check position 1:

- Option 1: a[1] == b[1] and c[1] != a[1]

- a[1] == "a" != "b" == b[1], so a[1] != b[1], so option 1 is not possible.

- Option 2: c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1]

- c[1] = "c" != "a" and "c" != "b", so option 2 is possible.

- So, choose option 2: template[1] = 'C' (uppercase), with lowercase 'c' = c[1].

- Then, a[1] != 'c', b[1] != 'c', and c[1] == 'c', so a and b match, c doesn't match.

- So, "YES"

Second test case:

n = 2

a = "aa"

b = "bb"

c = "aa"

Position 1:

- Option 1: a[1] == b[1] and c[1] != a[1]

- a[1] = "a" != "b" == b[1], so option 1 not possible.

- Option 2: c[1] != a[1] and c[1] != b[1]

- c[1] = "a" != "a" ? No, "a" == "a", so option 2 not possible.

- So, no valid option for position 1.

- Therefore, "NO"

Third test case:

n = 10

a = "mathforces"

b = "luckforces"

c = "adhoccoder"

We need to check for each position i from 1 to 10:

- Option 1: a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

- Option 2: c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Let's check position by position.

Position 1:

a[1] = 'm', b[1] = 'l', c[1] = 'a'

- Option 1: 'm' == 'l'? No.

- Option 2: 'a' != 'm' and 'a' != 'l'? Yes.

- So, option 2 is possible.

Position 2:

a[2] = 'a', b[2] = 'u', c[2] = 'd'

- Option 1: 'a' == 'u'? No.

- Option 2: 'd' != 'a' and 'd' != 'u'? Yes.

- Option 2 is possible.

...

Continuing this way for all positions, if option 2 is possible for all positions, then "YES".

Fourth test case:

n = 3

a = "acc"

b = "abd"

c = "abc"

Position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'a', c[1] = 'a'

- Option 1: 'a' == 'a' and 'a' != 'a'? No, 'a' == 'a', so option 1 not possible.

- Option 2: 'a' != 'a' and 'a' != 'a'? No.

- No valid option for position 1.

- Therefore, "NO"

So, in the first and third test cases, for all positions, at least one of the options is possible, so "YES".

In the second and fourth test cases, there are positions where neither option is possible, so "NO".

Therefore, the condition to output "YES" is that for all positions i, at least one of the two conditions holds:

1. a[i] == b[i] and c[i] != a[i]

2. c[i] != a[i] and c[i] != b[i]

Wait, but in the first test case, for position 1:

a[1] = 'a', b[1] = 'b', c[1] = 'c'

- Condition 1: 'a' == 'b' and 'c' != 'a'? 'a' != 'b', so False.

- Condition 2: 'c' != 'a' and 'c' != 'b'? Yes, True
