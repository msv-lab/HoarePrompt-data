Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim has two arrays: array a with n integers and array b with m integers, and m is less than or equal to n. He wants to look at every subsegment of a of length m and check if it's "good." A subsegment is good if, after rearranging its elements, at least k of them match the elements in array b.

First, I need to understand what it means for elements to match after rearrangement. I think it means that in the subsegment of a, there are at least k elements that are the same as those in b, regardless of their positions. But wait, the problem says "match the elements of array b," and in the example, it shows that even if the elements are in different orders, as long as at least k elements are the same, it's considered good.

So, more formally, for a subsegment c of a with length m, if we can rearrange c so that at least k of its elements are equal to the corresponding elements in b, then it's good. Wait, but the problem says "the elements of c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b." So, it's not about positions; it's just that at least k elements in c are equal to any k elements in b, regardless of order.

Wait, but in the example, it says that [4,1,2,3] can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b = [1,2,3,4], and [2,3,4,5] can be rearranged to [5,2,3,4], where at least 3 elements match b. So, it seems like it's about having at least k elements in c that are also in b, regardless of their positions.

But actually, reading it again: "elements of c can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of array b." So, it's about rearranging c to match b in at least k positions. Meaning, after rearranging c, at least k elements in c should be equal to the corresponding elements in b.

Wait, but in the example, [4,1,2,3] is considered good because it can be rearranged to [1,2,3,4], which matches b = [1,2,3,4] in all 4 positions, which is more than k=3. Similarly, [2,3,4,5] can be rearranged to [5,2,3,4], which matches b = [1,2,3,4] in the last three positions.

So, it's about rearranging c to match b in at least k positions.

Okay, so the task is to count the number of subarrays of a of length m where, after rearranging c, at least k of its elements are equal to the corresponding elements in b.

Given that, I need an efficient way to iterate through all subarrays of length m in a and check this condition.

Given the constraints, n can be up to 2e5, and t (number of test cases) is up to 1e4, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2e5, same for m. So, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since m is <= n, and I need to consider every subarray of length m in a, a sliding window approach seems suitable.

In each window of size m in a, I need to check if, after rearranging the elements in the window, at least k elements match the corresponding elements in b.

Wait, but b is of length m, and I need to rearrange c to match b in at least k positions.

But rearranging c means permuting its elements to align with b in at least k positions.

Wait, but b is fixed, and I need to rearrange c to match b in at least k positions.

This sounds similar to finding the number of positions where c and b match after sorting both, but I need to make sure that at least k elements are the same, regardless of their original positions.

Wait, but it's not exactly about sorting; it's about permuting c to match b in at least k positions.

This seems related to the concept of having at least k common elements between c and b, but considering their positions after rearrangement.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of counts of elements.

If I count the frequency of each element in b and in c, then the number of positions where c can match b is limited by the minimum frequency of each element in c and b.

Wait, perhaps I can use the intersection of counts between c and b to determine how many matches are possible.

Let me formalize this.

Let cb be the count of each element in b.

Let cc be the count of each element in the current window c of a.

Then, the maximum number of matches possible is the sum over all elements of min(cc[element], cb[element]).

If this sum is >= k, then the window is good.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, for each window of size m in a, I can compute the count of each element in the window (cc), compute the sum of min(cc[element], cb[element]) over all elements, and if this sum >= k, then increment the answer.

Now, the problem is that with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, same for m, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Using a sliding window approach, I can maintain a frequency count of the current window, and as I slide the window, I can update the frequency count by removing the element that's leaving the window and adding the new element entering the window.

Then, I can keep track of the sum of min(cc[element], cb[element]).

Wait, but cb is fixed for each test case, so I can precompute it.

I need to efficiently update this sum as the window slides.

Let me think about how to maintain this sum efficiently.

Let's denote the current sum as sm = sum over all elements of min(cc[element], cb[element]).

When I move the window by one position, I remove the element that's no longer in the window and add the new element.

So, when removing an element, say x, from the window:

- If cc[x] > cb[x], then sm decreases by cb[x], because cb[x] was contributing fully to sm.

- Else, sm decreases by cc[x].

Similarly, when adding an element y to the window:

- If cc[y] < cb[y], then sm increases by cc[y], because cc[y] is now contributing to sm.

- Else, sm increases by cb[y].

Wait, I need to be careful here.

Actually, let's think about it step by step.

Initially, sm = sum over all elements of min(cc[element], cb[element]).

When I remove an element x from the window:

- If cc[x] > cb[x], then sm was contributed by cb[x], so removing x decreases sm by cb[x].

- If cc[x] == cb[x], then sm was contributed by cb[x], so removing x decreases sm by cb[x].

- If cc[x] < cb[x], then sm was contributed by cc[x], so removing x decreases sm by cc[x].

Similarly, when adding an element y to the window:

- If cc[y] <= cb[y], then sm increases by cc[y].

- If cc[y] > cb[y], then sm increases by cb[y].

Wait, but cc[y] is the new count after adding y, so I need to consider the increase in cc[y].

Wait, maybe it's better to keep track of the current sm and update it based on the element added and removed.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's say I have the current window from l to r, and I'm moving the window to l+1 to r+1.

I remove a[l-1] and add a[r+1].

Let x = a[l-1], y = a[r+1].

First, update cc by removing x and adding y.

Then, update sm accordingly.

But to do this efficiently, I need to compute how sm changes.

An alternative approach is to keep track of the intersection counts.

Let me consider that sm is the sum of min(cc[element], cb[element]).

When I remove x, sm decreases by min(cc[x], cb[x]).

Then, I add y, and sm increases by min(cc[y], cb[y]).

Wait, this seems simpler.

So, when removing x, sm decreases by min(cc[x], cb[x]).

Then, cc[x] decreases by 1.

If cc[x] after decrement is still less than or equal to cb[x], then the new min(cc[x], cb[x]) is cc[x], so the decrease in sm is min(cc[x]+1, cb[x]) - min(cc[x], cb[x]).

Similarly, when adding y, sm increases by min(cc[y], cb[y]) - min(cc[y]-1, cb[y]).

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the delta for sm when removing x and adding y.

Let me define:

When removing x:

If cc[x] > cb[x], then sm decreases by cb[x].

Else, sm decreases by cc[x].

Then, when adding y:

If cc[y] < cb[y], then sm increases by cc[y].

Else, sm increases by cb[y].

Wait, but cc[y] is incremented by 1 when adding y, so I need to consider the change in min(cc[y], cb[y]).

Let me denote:

delta_sm_remove_x = min(cc[x], cb[x])

cc[x] -= 1

delta_sm_add_y = min(cc[y], cb[y]) - min(cc[y]-1, cb[y])

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the change in min(cc[element], cb[element]) when cc[element] changes.

Let me consider that.

When cc[element] changes from cc[element] to cc[element]+1 (adding y), the change in min is:

if cc[element] < cb[element], then min increases by 1.

else, min increases by 0.

Similarly, when cc[element] decreases from cc[element] to cc[element]-1 (removing x), the change in min is:

if cc[element]-1 < cb[element], then min decreases by 1 if cc[element] <= cb[element], else no change.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Maybe I should precompute cb for each test case and then, for each window, compute the sum of min(cc[element], cb[element]) directly.

But with n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 2e5, same for m, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

An alternative approach is to use a sliding window with a frequency counter and keep track of the intersection sum efficiently.

Let me think about implementing this.

First, for each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read array a of size n

- Read array b of size m

- Precompute cb = Counter(b)

- Initialize cc = Counter(a[0:m])

- Compute sm = sum(min(cc[element], cb[element]) for all elements)

- If sm >= k, ans +=1

- Then, slide the window from m to n:

- Remove a[l-1]: decrease cc[a[l-1]] and update sm

- Add a[r]: increase cc[a[r]] and update sm

- If sm >=k, ans +=1

Now, the key is to efficiently update sm when removing and adding elements.

Let's define a function to compute the delta when removing x:

def delta_remove(x, cc, cb):

if cc[x] > cb[x]:

return cb[x]

else:

return cc[x]

And when adding y:

def delta_add(y, cc, cb):

if cc[y] < cb[y]:

return 1

else:

return 0

Wait, when adding y, cc[y] increases by 1.

If cc[y] before adding was less than cb[y], then min increases by 1.

If cc[y] before adding was equal to cb[y], then min increases by 0.

So, delta_add(y, cc, cb) = min(cc[y]+1, cb[y]) - min(cc[y], cb[y])

Which is:

if cc[y] < cb[y], then delta_add = 1

else, delta_add = 0

Similarly, delta_remove(x, cc, cb) = min(cc[x], cb[x]) - min(cc[x]-1, cb[x])

Which is:

if cc[x] <= cb[x], then delta_remove = 1

else, delta_remove = 0

Wait, let's think again.

When removing x:

- Before removal: min(cc[x], cb[x])

- After removal: min(cc[x]-1, cb[x])

- So, delta_remove = min(cc[x], cb[x]) - min(cc[x]-1, cb[x])

Which is:

if cc[x] > cb[x], then min(cc[x], cb[x]) = cb[x], min(cc[x]-1, cb[x]) = cb[x], so delta_remove = 0

if cc[x] == cb[x], then min(cc[x], cb[x]) = cb[x], min(cc[x]-1, cb[x]) = cc[x]-1 = cb[x]-1, so delta_remove = 1

if cc[x] < cb[x], then min(cc[x], cb[x]) = cc[x], min(cc[x]-1, cb[x]) = cc[x]-1, so delta_remove = 1

So, delta_remove = 1 if cc[x] <= cb[x], else 0

Similarly, when adding y:

- Before adding: min(cc[y], cb[y])

- After adding: min(cc[y]+1, cb[y])

- So, delta_add = min(cc[y]+1, cb[y]) - min(cc[y], cb[y])

Which is:

if cc[y] < cb[y], then min(cc[y]+1, cb[y]) = cc[y]+1, min(cc[y], cb[y]) = cc[y], so delta_add = 1

if cc[y] >= cb[y], then min(cc[y]+1, cb[y]) = cb[y], min(cc[y], cb[y]) = cb[y], so delta_add = 0

So, delta_add = 1 if cc[y] < cb[y], else 0

Great, now I can implement this efficiently.

So, in code:

- For each test case:

- Read n, m, k

- Read a as list of integers

- Read b as list of integers

- cb = Counter(b)

- Initialize cc = Counter(a[0:m])

- sm = sum(min(cc[element], cb[element]) for element in cc)

- ans = 0

- if sm >= k:

ans +=1

- for r in range(m, n):

x = a[r - m]

y = a[r]

sm -= delta_remove(x, cc, cb)

cc[x] -=1

if cc[x] == 0:

del cc[x]

sm += delta_add(y, cc, cb)

cc[y] +=1

if sm >= k:

ans +=1

- print(ans)

Now, to implement delta_remove and delta_add as simple functions based on the conditions above.

Also, since a and b can have elements up to 1e6, and n up to 2e5, I need to make sure that the Counter works efficiently.

In Python, Counter is a dict subclass, and operations are O(1) for increments and lookups.

So, this should be efficient enough.

Let me think about possible edge cases.

- k = 1, m = 1, n = 1: simplest case

- All elements in a and b are the same

- No elements in a match b

- Only k elements match in some windows

- Multiple test cases with maximum sum of n

Also, since elements in a and b are not necessarily unique, I need to handle duplicates correctly.

I need to make sure that the frequency counts are accurate and that the sum of min(cc[element], cb[element]) is correctly computed.

Let me consider an example:

n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = {1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1}

Windows:

[4,1,2,3]: cc={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, sm=4 >=2 => good

[1,2,3,4]: cc={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, sm=4 >=2 => good

[2,3,4,5]: cc={2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}, sm=3 >=2 => good

[3,4,5,6]: cc={3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}, sm=2 >=2 => good

Total: 4

Which matches the first test case output.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=3

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

Windows:

[4,1,2,3]: cc={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, sm=4 >=3 => good

[1,2,3,4]: cc={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, sm=4 >=3 => good

[2,3,4,5]: cc={2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}, sm=3 >=3 => good

[3,4,5,6]: cc={3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}, sm=2 <3 => not good

Total: 3

Which matches the second test case output.

Another test case:

n=7, m=4, k=4

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

Windows:

[4,1,2,3]: cc={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, sm=4 >=4 => good

[1,2,3,4]: cc={1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}, sm=4 >=4 => good

[2,3,4,5]: cc={2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}, sm=3 <4 => not good

[3,4,5,6]: cc={3:1,4:1,5:1,6:1}, sm=2 <4 => not good

Total: 2

Which matches the third test case output.

Another test case:

n=11, m=5, k=3

a = [9,9,2,2,10,9,7,6,3,6,3]

b = [6,9,7,8,10]

cb = {6:1,9:1,7:1,8:1,10:1}

Windows:

[9,9,2,2,10]: cc={2:2,9:2,10:1}, sm=1 <3 => not good

[9,2,2,10,9]: cc={2:2,9:2,10:1}, sm=1 <3 => not good

[2,2,10,9,7]: cc={2:2,9:1,10:1,7:1}, sm=3 >=3 => good

[2,10,9,7,6]: cc={2:1,9:1,10:1,7:1,6:1}, sm=4 >=3 => good

[10,9,7,6,3]: cc={10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1}, sm=4 >=3 => good

[9,7,6,3,6]: cc={9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1}, sm=2 <3 => not good

[7,6,3,6,3]: cc={7:1,6:2,3:2}, sm=1 <3 => not good

Total: 3

Wait, but the output says 4 for this test case. So, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let's check again.

Windows:

[9,9,2,2,10]: cc={9:2,2:2,10:1}, sm = min(9:2,1)+min(2:2,0)+min(10:1,1) =1+0+1=2 <3 => not good

[9,2,2,10,9]: cc={9:2,2:2,10:1}, sm=2 <3 => not good

[2,2,10,9,7]: cc={2:2,10:1,9:1,7:1}, sm=min(2:2,0)+min(10:1,1)+min(9:1,1)+min(7:1,1)=0+1+1+1=3 >=3 => good

[2,10,9,7,6]: cc={2:1,10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1}, sm=1+1+1+1+0=4 >=3 => good

[10,9,7,6,3]: cc={10:1,9:1,7:1,6:1,3:1}, sm=1+1+1+1+0=4 >=3 => good

[9,7,6,3,6]: cc={9:1,7:1,6:2,3:1}, sm=1+1+1+0+0=3 >=3 => good

[7,6,3,6,3]: cc={7:1,6:2,3:2}, sm=1+1+0+0=2 <3 => not good

Total: 4

Yes, I missed one window. So, my initial implementation seems correct.

Last test case:

n=4, m=1, k=1

a = [4,1,5,6]

b = [6]

cb = {6:1}

Windows:

[4]: cc={4:1}, sm=0 <1 => not good

[1]: cc={1:1}, sm=0 <1 => not good

[5]: cc={5:1}, sm=0 <1 => not good

[6]: cc={6:1}, sm=1 >=1 => good

Total: 1

Which matches the last test case output.

So, the approach seems correct.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

from collections import Counter

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):

cb = Counter(sorted(b))

ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))

ans = 0

sm = sum((ca & cb).values())

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

for r in range(m, n):

if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:

sm += 1

ca[a[r]] += 1

if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:

sm -= 1

ca[a[r - m]] -= 1

if sm >= k:

ans += 1

return ans

So, in func_1:

- cb = Counter(sorted(b))

- ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))

- sm = sum((ca & cb).values()), which is sum of min(ca[element], cb[element]) for all elements

- Then, for each step in the sliding window:

- if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]], sm +=1

- ca[a[r]] +=1

- if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]], sm -=1

- ca[a[r - m]] -=1

- if sm >=k, ans +=1

Now, let's compare this with my earlier reasoning.

In my reasoning:

- When adding y, if cc[y] < cb[y], then sm +=1

- When removing x, if cc[x] <= cb[x], then sm -=1

Which is exactly what this code is doing.

So, it seems correct.

Let me verify with an example.

Take n=7, m=4, k=2

a = [4,1,2,3,4,5,6]

b = [1,2,3,4]

cb = Counter(sorted([1,2,3,4])) = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

ca = Counter(sorted([4,1,2,3])) = {1:1,2:1,3:1,4:1}

sm = sum(min(ca[element], cb[element]) for all elements) = 4

ans =1 (since 4 >=2)

Then, r=4:

a[4]=4

ca[4] =1 < cb[4]=1 ? No, because ca[4]=1, cb[4]=1, so ca[4] < cb[4] is False, so sm +=0

ca[4] +=1 => ca[4]=2

ca[a[r - m]]=ca[a[4-4]]=ca[a[0]]=ca[4]=2

cb[4]=1, so ca[4]=2 > cb[4]=1, so sm -=0

ca[4]-=1 => ca[4]=1

sm=4

ans +=1 (since 4 >=2)

Next, r=5:

a[5]=5

ca[5]=0 < cb[5]=0? No, because cb[5]=0, so ca[5]<cb[5] is False, so sm +=0

ca[5] +=1 => ca[5]=1

ca[a[r - m]]=ca[a[5-4]]=ca[a[1]]=ca[1]=1

cb[1]=1, so ca[1]=1 <= cb[1]=1, so sm -=1 (now sm=3)

ca[1]-=1 => ca[1]=0

sm=3

ans +=1 (since 3 >=2)

Next, r=6:

a[6]=6

ca[6]=0 < cb[6]=0? No, cb[6]=0, so ca[6]<cb[6] is False, so sm +=0

ca[6] +=1 => ca[6]=1

ca[a[r - m]]=ca[a[6-4]]=ca[a[2]]=ca[2]=1

cb[2]=1, so ca[2]=1 <= cb[2]=1, so sm -=1 (now sm=2)

ca[2]-=1 => ca[2]=0

sm=2

ans +=1 (since 2 >=2)

Total ans=4, which matches.

So, the code seems correct.

I think it's implementing the correct approach as per my reasoning.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{See explanation for the solution code.}} \]

**Correctness: True**
