Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about determining who wins a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their scores after a certain number of turns. They start at specific positions in a permutation, and each turn they can choose to stay or move to another position based on the permutation. The goal is to maximize their scores by collecting points associated with the positions they land on.

First, I need to understand the problem completely. We have a permutation p of length n, and an array a of length n, where a[i] represents the points gained when landing on position i. Both players start at positions PB and PS respectively, and the game consists of k turns.

Each turn, both players simultaneously:

1. Add a[x] to their score, where x is their current position.

2. Choose to either stay at their current position or move to p[x].

The winner is the one with the higher score after k turns. If scores are equal, it's a draw.

My task is to determine the winner or if it's a draw, assuming both players play optimally to maximize their scores.

Looking at the example provided, it seems that the optimal strategy involves identifying cycles in the permutation and calculating the maximum possible score based on whether they stay or move within the cycle.

I need to think about how cycles in the permutation affect the players' movement. If a player is in a cycle, after some moves, they will repeat their positions. So, understanding the cycle structure is crucial for calculating the maximum score over k turns.

In the first step, I should probably find the cycles in the permutation for each player's starting position. Then, for each cycle, calculate the maximum possible score by deciding whether to stay or move at each step.

However, since k can be up to 10^9, I need an efficient way to calculate the score over k turns without simulating each turn individually. That means I need to find a way to compute the score in O(1) time per cycle or something similarly efficient.

I recall that in cycle graphs, the movement is periodic with the length of the cycle. So, if a player is in a cycle of length m, their positions will repeat every m turns. Therefore, I can calculate the score for one full cycle and then multiply it by the number of full cycles within k turns, and add the score for the remaining turns.

But, since players can choose to stay or move each turn, it's not straightforward. They can choose to stay at any point to maximize their score, so I need to consider the optimal choices at each step.

Wait, but the problem says they make moves simultaneously, and they are trying to maximize their own scores independently. So, each player makes their own decisions independently of the other.

I need to model the decision-making process for each player separately.

Let's consider one player. They are at position x. Each turn, they can choose to stay at x and collect a[x], or move to p[x] and collect a[p[x]].

Wait, no. According to the problem:

- First, they add a[x] to their score.

- Then, they choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in each turn, they collect a[x], and then decide where to be in the next turn: x or p[x].

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where for each position in the cycle, I can calculate the maximum score achievable from that point onward.

But again, with k up to 10^9, I need a smarter way.

I need to think about the structure of the permutation and how cycles work.

First, permutations can be decomposed into disjoint cycles. Since the permutation is a set of distinct integers from 1 to n, there are no overlapping cycles.

So, for each player, starting from their initial position, they will follow a path determined by the permutation, possibly looping in cycles.

But in this problem, both players move simultaneously, and they make decisions independently to maximize their own scores.

I need to calculate the maximum possible score for each player separately and then compare them.

So, I can treat each player's movement independently.

Let me focus on one player first.

Given a starting position, a permutation p, and an array a, and k turns, I need to calculate the maximum possible score the player can achieve.

Each turn, the player is at position x:

1. Add a[x] to the score.

2. Choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in the next turn, the player will be at x or p[x], depending on the choice.

I need to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns, with the choice at each turn to stay or move.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current position and the number of turns left.

However, with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me think about the cycle structure again.

Suppose the player is in a cycle of length m.

Then, after m turns, the player returns to the starting position if they always choose to move.

But they can choose to stay at any point, so it's not just following the cycle.

Wait, perhaps I can model the possible positions the player can be in over time.

But it's getting complicated.

Another approach: since the player can choose to stay or move each turn, they can effectively choose to stay put for any number of consecutive turns before moving to the next position in the permutation.

This might be a way to optimize the score.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose the player is at position x.

They can choose to stay at x for several turns, collecting a[x] each turn, or move to p[x] and repeat the process.

So, the player can choose to collect a[x] for some number of turns, then move to p[x], collect a[p[x]] for some number of turns, and so on.

The goal is to maximize the total score over k turns.

This sounds like a problem where the player needs to decide how many turns to spend at each position in the cycle before moving on.

Given that cycles can be long, and k can be up to 1e9, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

I recall that in such problems, the optimal strategy often involves staying at the position with the highest a[x] in each cycle for as long as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum a[x] in the cycle and stay there as much as possible.

But the player can only stay or move each turn, so they might not be able to arbitrarily choose which position to stay at.

Let me think again.

Suppose the player is in a cycle: x -> p[x] -> p[p[x]] -> ... -> x.

Let’s say the cycle has length m.

If the player chooses to always move, they will cycle through the positions in a loop.

But they can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns.

So, the player can choose to stay at a particular position for as many turns as they want before moving to the next position.

This gives them flexibility in distributing their turns to maximize the sum of a[x] over k turns.

To maximize the score, the player should spend as many turns as possible at the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle.

If there are multiple positions with the same highest a[x], it doesn't matter which one they choose.

So, the strategy is:

- Identify the position(s) with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

- Spend as many turns as possible at that position, collecting a[x] each turn.

- When forced to move (because k is larger than the number of turns spent so far), move to the next position in the cycle and repeat the process.

Wait, but they can choose to stay or move each turn independently.

So, perhaps it's better to think in terms of choosing to stay or move at each step, but with the goal of maximizing the sum of a[x] over k turns.

This still seems tricky to model directly.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Find the cycle that the starting position is in.

2. Compute the maximum possible score over k turns by deciding for each turn whether to stay or move.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

I recall that in such cycle-based problems, we can precompute the maximum score for each cycle and then use that to compute the overall score.

Wait, perhaps I can model the cycle as a graph and find the maximum sum path with the given constraints.

But that might still be too slow.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a cycle: x -> p[x] -> ... -> x.

Let’s say the cycle has length m.

Let me denote the positions in the cycle as x0, x1, ..., x_{m-1}, where x0 is the starting position.

At each turn, the player can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the cycle.

The player needs to distribute k turns among these positions to maximize the sum of a[x_i].

This sounds like a linear DP where the state is the current position in the cycle and the number of turns spent so far.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not practical.

I need a mathematical formula or a pattern that allows me to compute the sum efficiently.

Let me consider that the player can choose to spend any number of turns at each position before moving to the next one.

So, for each position in the cycle, the player can spend t_i turns, where t_i >=1, and the sum of all t_i over the cycle is equal to k.

Wait, but they can also choose to stay at a position for multiple turns before moving.

Actually, it's more flexible than that.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the player goes around the cycle.

But it's still confusing.

Let me try to find the maximum possible score.

If the player can choose to stay at any position for any number of turns, the maximum score would be a[x] * k, where x is the position with the maximum a[x] in the cycle.

But there's a constraint: they can only stay or move one step at a time.

Wait, but actually, in this problem, they can choose to stay or move each turn independently.

So, in each turn, they can choose to stay at the current position or move to the next position in the cycle.

But they are making this choice simultaneously with the other player.

Wait, but since their choices are independent, I can treat each player separately.

So, for each player, I need to compute the maximum possible score over k turns, given that they can choose to stay or move each turn.

I think the key is to identify the position with the highest a[x] in the cycle and spend as many turns as possible at that position.

To do this, the player can choose to move to that position and then stay there for as many turns as possible.

But they have to follow the sequence of the cycle.

Wait, no, they can choose to stay or move each turn independently, so they don't necessarily have to follow the sequence strictly.

Wait, but moving means going to p[x], and staying means remaining at x.

So, from position x, they can choose to stay at x or move to p[x] each turn.

So, in the next turn, if they stayed, they are still at x; if they moved, they are at p[x].

Then, in the following turn, again, they can choose to stay at their current position or move to p[current position].

So, effectively, the player can choose their position each turn, as long as it's either their current position or the next position in the permutation.

Wait, no, more precisely, in each turn, they first add a[x] to their score, where x is their current position, and then choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in the next turn, their current position is either x (if they stayed) or p[x] (if they moved).

So, their position in the next turn is determined by their choice in the current turn.

This is similar to a graph where edges are from x to x (staying) and from x to p[x] (moving).

So, for each position, there are two possible choices: stay or move.

Given that, the movement over k turns can be modeled as a path in this graph with k steps.

The goal is to maximize the sum of a[x] over k steps.

This sounds like a standard dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[x][t] as the maximum score achievable when starting at position x with t turns remaining.

Then, dp[x][t] = a[x] + max(dp[x][t-1], dp[p[x]][t-1])

Because in each turn, the player adds a[x] and then chooses to stay at x or move to p[x].

But with n up to 2e5 and k up to 1e9, this DP is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in each turn, the player can choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, for each position x in the cycle, the player can choose to spend any number of consecutive turns at x before moving to p[x].

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to calculate the maximum score by finding the position with the highest a[x] and spending as many turns as possible there.

But I need to consider the cycle structure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum a[x] in the cycle and assume that the player spends as many turns as possible at that position.

But to do that, the player needs to reach that position first.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, find the cycle that contains the starting position.

Then, identify the position(s) in the cycle with the maximum a[x].

Then, compute the minimal number of turns required to reach that position from the starting position.

Then, spend the remaining turns at that position, collecting a[x] each turn.

This might be a good strategy.

Let me formalize it.

Let cycle be the list of positions in the cycle, starting from the starting position.

Find the position in the cycle with the maximum a[x]. Let’s say it's x_max with a[x_max] = max_a.

Find the minimal number of steps to reach x_max from the starting position. Let's say it's steps_to_max.

Then, the player can reach x_max in steps_to_max turns and spend the remaining (k - steps_to_max) turns at x_max.

So, total score = sum of a[x] for the first steps_to_max turns + a[x_max] * (k - steps_to_max)

But this assumes that once the player reaches x_max, they stay there forever.

However, if there are multiple positions with the same max_a, or if moving back and forth can yield a higher score, this might not be optimal.

Wait, but in the cycle, once the player reaches x_max, they can choose to stay there forever by always choosing to stay.

So, the above formula should give the maximum possible score.

Let me verify this with the first example.

In the first example:

n=4, k=2, PB=3, PS=2

p = [4,1,2,3]

a = [7,2,5,6]

Let's find the cycle for PB=3.

Starting at 3:

3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> ...

So, the cycle is 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3, with cycle length m=4.

The a values are:

a[3]=5, a[2]=2, a[1]=7, a[4]=6

The maximum a[x] in the cycle is 7 at position 1.

Steps to reach position 1 from position 3: 2 steps (3->2->1).

k=2, so steps_to_max=2, k - steps_to_max=0.

Total score = a[3] + a[2] + a[1] * 0 = 5 + 2 + 0 = 7

But in the explanation, Bodya's score is 10.

Wait, that doesn't match.

In the explanation, Bodya stays at position 3 for both turns, collecting a[3]=5 twice, so score=10.

According to my earlier formula, I get 7, which is less than 10.

So, my formula is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Ah, I see. In my formula, I assumed that the player has to reach x_max and then stay there.

But in reality, the player can choose to stay at any position, not necessarily x_max.

In this case, Bodya can choose to stay at position 3 for both turns, collecting a[3]=5 each time, for a total of 10.

According to my earlier formula, I only considered reaching x_max and staying there, which in this case would be position 1 with a[1]=7, but it requires moving to position 1, which costs one turn to reach, and then staying there for the remaining turns.

In this example, k=2, steps_to_max=2, so total score=5 (first turn at 3) + 2 (second turn at 2) + 7*0 =7, which is less than staying at position 3 and collecting 5 each turn.

So, my earlier approach is flawed.

I need to adjust my strategy.

Perhaps, the optimal strategy is to identify the position in the cycle with the highest a[x], and find the minimal number of steps to reach it, and then spend as many turns as possible there.

But in cases where staying at a position with a high a[x] without moving is better than moving to another position, my formula fails.

In the above example, position 3 has a[3]=5, and position 1 has a[1]=7.

But staying at position 3 for both turns gives 10, which is better than reaching position 1 in 2 steps and collecting 7, which would give 5 + 2 + 7*0 =7.

So, staying at position 3 is better.

Wait, but position 1 has a[1]=7, which is higher than a[3]=5.

But because it takes 2 steps to reach position 1, and k=2, the player can only reach position 1 and collect a[1] once, but that would require spending a turn to move there, during which they collect a[3] and a[2].

So, total score is a[3] + a[1] =5 +7=12, but according to the explanation, Bodya can get 10 by staying at position 3 and collecting a[3] twice.

Wait, that doesn't add up.

Wait, no, in the explanation, Bodya stays at position 3 for both turns, collecting a[3] each time, so 5 +5=10.

If Bodya chooses to move to position 2 in the first turn, they collect a[3]=5, then move to position 2.

In the second turn, they are at position 2, collect a[2]=2, and choose to stay at position 2 or move to position 1.

If they stay at position 2, total score is 5 (first turn) +2 (second turn)=7.

If they move to position 1, collect a[2]=2 and move to position 1, then in the second turn, they are at position 1, collect a[1]=7, total score=5 +7=12.

Wait, that's better than staying at position 3 and getting 10.

But in the explanation, Bodya gets 10.

So, perhaps the explanation is not showing the optimal strategy for Bodya.

Wait, perhaps Bodya can choose different moves.

Let me think.

Turn 1:

- At position 3, collect a[3]=5, then choose to stay at 3 or move to p[3]=2.

Option 1: Stay at 3.

- Score: 5

- Position: 3

Turn 2:

- At position 3, collect a[3]=5, then choose to stay at 3 or move to p[3]=2.

- Stay at 3: score +=5, total=10

- Move to 2: score +=5, total=10, but position is 2.

But if they move to 2 in turn 2, they collect a[2]=2 in turn 2, and then position is 2.

So, total score is 5 (turn 1) +2 (turn 2)=7.

So, staying at 3 both turns gives 10, which is better.

Alternatively, in turn 1, move to 2.

- Collect a[3]=5, move to p[3]=2.

- Turn 2: at position 2, collect a[2]=2, choose to stay at 2 or move to p[2]=1.

- Stay at 2: total=5 +2=7

- Move to 1: collect a[2]=2, move to p[2]=1, then in turn 2, at position 1, collect a[1]=7, total=5 +7=12

Wait, that's better than staying at 3 and getting 10.

So, why does the explanation say Bodya can always win with 10?

Because in the explanation, Bodya chooses to stay at position 3 both turns, getting 10, while Sasha moves to position 1 and stays, getting 9.

But according to my calculation, Bodya can get 12 by moving to position 2 and then to position 1.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the explanation:

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's score| Sasha's move

---|---|---|---|---|---|---

first| 3 | 0 + a3=0+5=5 | stays | 2 | 0 + a2=0+2=2 | moves to p2=1

second| 3 | 5 + a3=5+5=10 | stays | 1 | 2 + a1=2+7=9 | stays

final| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |

So, in this scenario, Bodya stays at 3 both turns, getting 10, and Sasha moves to 1 and stays, getting 9.

But according to my earlier calculation, Bodya could have moved to 2 and then to 1, getting 12.

Why didn't Bodya choose that?

Because Sasha is also making choices simultaneously.

Wait, but the problem says they make moves simultaneously, but their choices are independent.

So, Bodya can choose their moves without knowing Sasha's moves.

But in this case, Bodya can choose to maximize their own score regardless of Sasha.

So, in the above scenario, Bodya could have chosen to move to 2 in the first turn and then to 1 in the second turn, getting 5 +7=12, which is better than staying at 3 and getting 10.

But in the explanation, Bodya chooses to stay at 3 and get 10.

So, perhaps there is something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the movement is not independent in the way I thought.

Let me read the problem again.

"on each turn, two things happen to each player:

- If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x .

- Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x ."

So, both players make their choices independently at each turn.

So, Bodya can choose to stay or move without knowing Sasha's choice.

But in terms of maximizing their own score, they should choose the best possible path regardless of Sasha.

So, in the first turn, Bodya is at 3, collects a[3]=5, then chooses to stay at 3 or move to p[3]=2.

If they stay at 3, in the second turn, they collect a[3]=5 again.

If they move to 2, in the second turn, they are at 2, collect a[2]=2, then choose to stay at 2 or move to p[2]=1.

If they stay at 2, total score is 5 +2=7.

If they move to 1, collect a[2]=2 and move to 1, then in the second turn, collect a[1]=7, total score=5 +7=12.

So, the better choice for Bodya is to move to 2 in the first turn and then to 1 in the second turn, getting 12.

But in the explanation, Bodya stays at 3 and gets 10.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the movement.

Wait, let's look at the problem statement again.

"on each turn, two things happen to each player:

1. If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x .

2. Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x ."

So, in each turn:

- They collect a[x], where x is their current position.

- Then, they choose to stay at x or move to p[x].

So, in the first turn:

- Bodya is at 3, collects a[3]=5, then chooses to stay at 3 or move to p[3]=2.

- Sasha is at 2, collects a[2]=2, then chooses to stay at 2 or move to p[2]=1.

In the second turn:

- Bodya is at 3 (if stayed) or at 2 (if moved), collects a[3]=5 or a[2]=2, then chooses to stay or move again.

- Sasha is at 2 (if stayed) or at 1 (if moved), collects a[2]=2 or a[1]=7, then chooses to stay or move.

In the explanation, Bodya stays at 3 both turns, collecting a[3]=5 twice, total 10.

Sasha moves to 1 in the first turn, collects a[2]=2, moves to 1, then stays at 1 in the second turn, collects a[1]=7, total 9.

So, Bodya wins with 10 vs Sasha's 9.

But according to my earlier calculation, Bodya could have moved to 2 in the first turn and then to 1 in the second turn, collecting a[3]=5 in the first turn and a[1]=7 in the second turn, total 12, which is better than 10.

So, why doesn't Bodya choose that?

Is there a constraint that prevents Bodya from moving in a certain way?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the movement.

Let me re-express the steps:

- In turn 1:

- Bodya is at 3, collects a[3
