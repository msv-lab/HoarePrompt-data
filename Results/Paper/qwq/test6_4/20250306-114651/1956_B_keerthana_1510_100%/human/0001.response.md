Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears on exactly two cards. The deck is divided between me and Nene, each getting n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, starting with me, for a total of 2n turns. Each turn, the player plays one card from their hand and gets a point if there's already a card with the same number on the table.

Nene is really smart and plays optimally to maximize her score, and if there are multiple options, she chooses the one that minimizes my score.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of points I can get by playing optimally, given that Nene is also playing optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

Each player has n cards, and there are 2n turns. Since there are two cards for each number, some numbers might be distributed in different ways between me and Nene.

For example, in the first test case:

n = 4

My cards: 1, 1, 2, 3

So, Nene's cards must be 2, 3, 4, 4.

The game proceeds with me and Nene alternating turns, each playing one card per turn.

The scoring happens only if the card played matches a number already on the table.

I need to maximize my points, considering that Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Let me try to think about how the game progresses.

In the first turn, I play a card. Since the table is empty, I don't get any points, and the card is placed on the table.

Then Nene plays a card. Same thing, no points, just placed on the table.

This continues until, at some point, a player plays a card that matches a number already on the table and gets a point.

I need to strategize when to play the duplicate cards to maximize my points.

Wait, but Nene is also trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, I need to consider what cards Nene has and how she will play them.

But I don't know exactly which cards Nene has, only which cards I have.

However, since I know which cards I have, I can infer which cards Nene has, because the remaining cards belong to her.

In the first test case:

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, total cards: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

So, in this scenario, Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

I need to think about the sequence of plays.

Let's think about the possible sequences.

Suppose I play a 1 first.

Then Nene can play a 4.

Then I play the other 1, and since there's already a 1 on the table, I get a point.

Then Nene plays another 4, and since there's already a 4 on the table, she gets a point.

Then I play a 2, no point.

Nene plays a 2, gets a point.

Then I play a 3, no point.

Nene plays a 3, gets a point.

So, in this sequence, I get 1 point, and Nene gets 3 points.

Is there a better sequence for me?

Suppose I play a 2 first.

Nene plays a 4.

I play a 1.

Nene plays a 4.

I play a 1, get a point.

Nene plays a 3, no point.

I play a 3, no point.

Nene plays a 2, gets a point.

So, again, I get 1 point, Nene gets 2 points.

Wait, in this sequence, Nene gets 2 points, not 3.

But in the note, it says Nene gets 3 points in the first test case.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let me try again.

First, I play a 1.

Table: 1

Nene plays a 4.

Table: 1,4

I play a 1.

Table: 1,4,1

I get 1 point (since there's already a 1 on the table).

Nene plays a 4.

Table: 1,4,1,4

Nene gets 1 point.

I play a 2.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2

No point.

Nene plays a 3.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3

No point.

I play a 3.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3

I get 1 point.

Nene plays a 2.

Table: 1,4,1,4,2,3,3,2

Nene gets 1 point.

So, I have 1 point, Nene has 2 points.

But in the note, it says Nene gets 3 points.

Maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps Nene can play her cards in a different order to maximize her points.

Let's try another sequence.

I play a 1.

Table: 1

Nene plays a 3.

Table: 1,3

I play a 1.

Table: 1,3,1

I get 1 point.

Nene plays a 4.

Table: 1,3,1,4

Nene plays another 4.

Table: 1,3,1,4,4

Nene gets 1 point.

I play a 2.

Table: 1,3,1,4,4,2

No point.

Nene plays a 2.

Table: 1,3,1,4,4,2,2

Nene gets 1 point.

So again, Nene has 2 points, I have 1 point.

But the note says Nene gets 3 points.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider that Nene can play her cards in a way to get more points.

Wait, perhaps if Nene plays a 4 after I play a 1, and then I play the other 1, getting a point, and then Nene plays another 4, getting a point, and then I play a 2, no point, Nene plays a 3, no point, I play a 3, no point, Nene plays a 2, getting a point.

So, Nene gets points for playing the second 4 and the second 2.

Wait, but in this case, Nene gets 2 points, not 3.

I must be missing something.

Wait, maybe Nene can get a point for playing the second 3 as well.

Wait, no, because I played the first 3, so when Nene plays the second 3, she gets a point.

But in the sequence above, Nene plays the second 3 after I play the first 3, so she gets a point.

So, points:

Me: 1 (for the second 1)

Nene: 1 (for the second 4), 1 (for the second 2), 1 (for the second 3)

Total Nene points: 3

Ah, I see. I missed that Nene can get a point for playing the second 3.

So, in that case, Nene gets 3 points, and I get 1 point.

Okay, so in this example, I can get at most 1 point.

The problem is asking for the maximum number of points I can get assuming Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, in this case, it's 1.

In the second test case, with n=8, and my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5, the output is 2.

I need to find a general way to calculate this for any n and any distribution of my cards.

Let me try to find a pattern or a strategy.

First, I need to think about how the game progresses and how the choices of cards affect the points.

Each number appears exactly twice, and I have some of them in my hand, and Nene has the rest.

I need to consider which numbers are duplicated in my hand and which are not.

For example, in the first test case, I have two 1's, one 2, and one 3.

Nene has one 2, one 3, and two 4's.

So, for numbers where I have two cards, I can potentially get a point if I play the second one after it's been played before.

Similarly, for numbers where Nene has two cards, she can get a point if she plays the second one after it's been played.

For numbers where only one card is in my hand and one in Nene's, then whoever plays the second one gets a point.

But Nene is playing optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

So, she will try to play her cards in a way that maximizes her points and minimizes mine.

I need to find a way to maximize my points given that Nene is playing optimally.

Let me think about the frequencies.

First, count how many cards of each number I have.

Then, infer how many cards of each number Nene has.

For each number, I know how many I have, and since there are two in total, I can deduce how many Nene has.

For example, for number 1, I have two, so Nene has zero.

For number 2, I have one, so Nene has one.

For number 3, I have one, Nene has one.

For number 4, I have zero, Nene has two.

So, for each number, possible cases:

- I have two, Nene has zero: I can play both, but since Nene has none, I can't get a point from this number because Nene doesn't have any to play.

- I have one, Nene has one: Nene can play her card after I play mine, and get a point, or vice versa.

- I have zero, Nene has two: Nene can play both and get a point for the second one.

Wait, but in the first case, if I have two and Nene has zero, I can play both, but since Nene has none, there's no way for me to get a point from this number because Nene doesn't have any to play.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has none, so when I play the second 1, there is already a 1 on the table (the first one I played), so I get a point.

Wait, but according to the rules, I get a point if there is already a card with the same number on the table.

So, if I play the first 1, no point.

Then, if I play the second 1 later, and if the first 1 is already on the table, then I get a point.

So, in this case, I can get a point from playing the second 1.

But in the first test case, that's what happened.

I played the first 1, then Nene played something, then I played the second 1 and got a point.

So, in this case, even though Nene has no 1's, I can still get a point from playing the second 1.

Similarly, for numbers where I have one and Nene has one, depending on the order, I might be able to get a point.

Wait, but in the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has none, so for number 1, I can get one point.

For numbers where I have one and Nene has one, I can't get any points because Nene will play her card after I play mine, and she will get the point.

Wait, but in the first test case, for number 2, I have one and Nene has one.

I played the 2 after Nene played the 4's.

When I played the 2, no point.

Then Nene played the second 2 and got a point.

So, in this case, I couldn't get any points from number 2.

Similarly, for number 3, I have one and Nene has one.

I played the 3, no point.

Nene played the second 3 and got a point.

So, again, no points for me from number 3.

For number 4, I have none, Nene has two.

Nene plays the first 4, no point.

Then plays the second 4 and gets a point.

So, Nene gets one point from number 4.

In total, I get one point from number 1, and Nene gets three points: one from number 4 and one from each of number 2 and 3.

So, in this case, I can get one point.

Is there a way for me to get more than one point?

Let's see.

Suppose I have two 1's and Nene has none.

I can get one point from number 1.

For other numbers where I have one and Nene has one, I can't get any points because Nene will play her card after I play mine and get the point.

So, in this case, I can only get one point.

Similarly, in the second test case, with n=8, and my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

So, Nene has the remaining cards: 3,6, and two 4's.

Wait, total cards are two each of 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards: 3,3,4,6,6

Wait, total cards should be two each of 1 to 8, so 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

Wait, that's nine cards, but n=8, so Nene should have 8 cards.

Wait, total cards are 16, I have 8, Nene has 8.

Wait, my cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

Wait, that's eight cards.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says n=8, but in the explanation, it says Nene has 3,6,8, but according to this, she has 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Looking back at the problem statement.

Wait, in the second test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, total cards: two each of 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, Nene's cards: the remaining ones: 1,2,3,3,4,6,6,7

Wait, but in the problem's output, it's 2.

So, I need to find out how many points I can get.

Let's think about it.

For numbers where I have two cards, like 8 and 5, I can potentially get a point from playing the second one.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, like 1,2,4,7, I can't get any points because Nene will play her card after I play mine and get the point.

For numbers where I have zero cards and Nene has two, like 3 and 6, Nene can get a point from playing the second one.

So, in this case, I can only get points from playing the second 8 and the second 5.

So, two points.

Hence, the output is 2.

Similarly, in the first test case, I can only get one point from playing the second 1.

So, the general strategy seems to be that I can get a point for each number where I have two cards, provided that I play the first one before Nene plays her card (if she has any), but in cases where I have two and Nene has none, I can definitely get a point from playing the second one.

For numbers where I have one and Nene has one, I can't get any points because Nene can play her card after I play mine and get the point.

So, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards.

Wait, but in the third test case:

n=8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8

Wait, total cards: two each of 1 to 8.

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, Nene's cards: 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8

So, in this case, for numbers where I have two cards: none.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

For numbers where Nene has two: 8.

So, in this case, I can't get any points because for all numbers I have only one card.

Hence, the output is 0.

Wait, but according to the example output, it's 1.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

So, frequencies:

1: me - 1, Nene -1

2: me -1, Nene -1

3: me -1, Nene -1

4: me -2, Nene -0

5: me -1, Nene -1

6: me -1, Nene -1

7: me -1, Nene -1

8: me -0, Nene -2

So, for number 4, I have two cards, Nene has zero.

So, I can get a point from playing the second 4.

Hence, the output is 1.

Ah, I see.

So, in this case, I can get one point from playing the second 4.

Similarly, in the first test case, I have two 1's, and Nene has none, so I can get one point from playing the second 1.

In the second test case, I have two 5's and two 8's, so I can get two points.

In the third test case, I have two 4's, so I can get one point.

In the fourth test case, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3, so Nene has 1,2,3.

So, for all numbers, I have one and Nene has one.

Hence, I can't get any points.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards are 1, so Nene has 1.

Again, I have one and Nene has one, so I can't get any points.

So, the general rule seems to be that I can get a point for each number where I have two cards and Nene has none.

Because in that case, when I play the second card, there is already the first one on the table, so I get a point.

For numbers where I have one card and Nene has one, Nene can play her card after I play mine and get the point.

So, I can't get any points from those numbers.

Hence, the maximum number of points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards.

Wait, but in the third test case, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6, which includes two 4's, so I can get one point.

Hence, the answer is 1.

Similarly, in the second test case, I have two 5's and two 8's, so I can get two points.

Wait, but in the third test case, I have two 4's, but Nene has two 8's.

Wait, no, in the third test case, Nene has two 8's, but I don't have any 8's, so that doesn't affect my points.

But I can still get a point from playing the second 4.

Hence, the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards.

So, in the first test case, I have two 1's, so I can get one point.

In the second test case, I have two 5's and two 8's, so I can get two points.

In the third test case, I have two 4's, so I can get one point.

In the fourth test case, I have one of each, so zero points.

In the fifth test case, I have one card, Nene has one, so zero points.

Hence, the answer is simply the number of numbers where I have two cards.

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=2, my cards are 1,1, Nene's cards are 2,2.

So, in this case, I have two 1's, Nene has two 2's.

If I play a 1, then Nene plays a 2.

Then I play the second 1 and get a point.

Nene plays the second 2 and gets a point.

So, I get one point.

Is there a way for me to get more than one point?

No, because Nene has two 2's, and I have no 2's, so I can't get any points from number 2.

Hence, I can only get one point from number 1.

Similarly, if I have two numbers with two cards each, I can get two points.

So, it seems that the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards.

Hence, the solution is to count how many numbers I have two cards of.

In the program provided, it seems to be doing exactly that.

Let's look at the program:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))

}

So, it's reading every second line starting from the third line (since the first line is the number of test cases, and then for each test case, the first line is n, and the second line is the list of cards I have.

Then, for each test case, it splits the line into tokens, counts the number of tokens, and subtracts the number of unique tokens.

Hence, len(tokens) is the number of cards I have, which is n.

len({*tokens}) is the number of unique numbers in my cards.

So, len(tokens) - len({*tokens}) is equal to n - number of unique numbers.

But, in my hand, for each number, if I have two cards, then it contributes 1 to n - number of unique numbers.

Because, if I have two cards of a number, it's counted as one unique number, but two in total.

So, for each number where I have two cards, n - unique increases by one.

Hence, n - unique is equal to the number of numbers where I have two cards.

Which, according to my earlier reasoning, is the maximum number of points I can get.

Hence, the program is correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=4, my cards are 1,1,2,3.

So, unique numbers are 1,2,3, which is 3.

n - unique = 4 - 3 = 1, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=8, my cards are 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5.

Unique numbers are 7,4,1,2,8,5, which is 6.

n - unique = 8 - 6 = 2, which matches the output.

In the third test case, n=8, my cards are 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6.

Unique numbers are 7,1,4,5,3,2,6, which is 7.

n - unique = 8 - 7 = 1, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, n=3, my cards are 1,2,3.

Unique numbers are 1,2,3, which is 3.

n - unique = 3 - 3 = 0, which matches the output.

In the fifth test case, n=1, my cards are 1.

Unique numbers are 1, which is 1.

n - unique = 1 - 1 = 0, which matches the output.

Hence, the program is correct.

So, the answer is that the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
