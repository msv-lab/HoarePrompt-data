Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have some cards with numbers from 1 to n, and I have a certain number of each card, given by a_i for each i from 1 to n. Then, I can buy k new cards, and I can choose any numbers from 1 to n for these new cards. After buying, I arrange all my cards in a line, and I need to find the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n]. Basically, I need to maximize the number of n-length segments in the array that contain each number from 1 to n exactly once.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray of length n a permutation of [1, 2, ..., n]. It means that in that segment, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once. So, in the entire array, I'm looking for windows of size n where all numbers from 1 to n are present, each exactly once.

Now, I need to think about how to arrange my cards to maximize the number of such windows. One way to approach this is to arrange the cards in a way that these permutation windows are as densely packed as possible.

I recall that in sliding window problems, especially those involving counts of elements, it's useful to think about the frequency of elements and how they can be distributed to satisfy the conditions.

Let's consider the constraints:

- I have initial counts a_i for each number i.

- I can buy k additional cards, choosing any numbers from 1 to n.

My goal is to maximize the number of n-length windows that are permutations of [1, 2, ..., n].

I need to think about the limiting factors. The limiting factors are the counts of the numbers that have the smallest initial counts because to form as many permutation windows as possible, I need to have enough of each number to cover the windows.

Let me think about it in terms of the minimum count. If I have a number with a very low count, it will limit the number of permutation windows I can form because each window needs one of each number.

So, if I have a number i with a_i = x, then I can form at most x permutation windows, assuming I have enough of the other numbers.

But actually, to form m permutation windows, I need at least m occurrences of each number. Because each window requires one of each number, and the windows are contiguous.

So, the maximum number of permutation windows I can form is limited by the smallest a_i. But I can buy k additional cards, so I can increase the counts of some numbers to overcome these limitations.

I need to strategically buy cards to maximize the minimum count across all numbers, because the maximum number of permutation windows is determined by the smallest count after buying the cards.

Wait, but it's not just about the minimum count because the windows are contiguous. It's more nuanced than that.

Let me think differently. Suppose I sort the initial counts a_i in ascending order. Let's say a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

Now, to form m permutation windows, I need at least m occurrences of each number. So, for each a_i, if a_i < m, I need to buy m - a_i cards of that number.

The total number of cards I need to buy to achieve m permutation windows is the sum over all i such that a_i < m of (m - a_i).

But I have a limit of k cards I can buy. So, I need to find the maximum m such that the total number of cards needed to make all a_i at least m is less than or equal to k.

This sounds like a classic binary search problem. I can binary search on m, the number of permutation windows, and check if the total number of cards needed to make all a_i at least m is <= k.

But the problem is that n can be up to 2*10^5, and t can be up to 100, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 5*10^5. So, a binary search for each test case with up to 2*10^5 elements would be acceptable in terms of time constraints, as long as the binary search is efficient.

Wait, but let's see if there's a smarter way to calculate m without binary search.

Let me consider the sorted a_i as a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

I need to find the maximum m such that sum over i from 1 to n of (m - a_i) for a_i < m is <= k.

This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum m where the total deficit to reach m is <= k.

I recall that in algorithmic problems, this can be calculated efficiently by iterating through the sorted a_i and calculating the cost to make all a_i up to a certain point equal to m, and then adjusting m accordingly.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the a_i in ascending order: a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

I'll iterate through the sorted a_i, and for each position i, consider making the first i counts equal to some m.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the minimum count.

Let me consider that the maximum m is limited by the smallest a_i, but I can increase some a_i by buying cards.

I need to maximize m such that sum over i from 1 to n of max(0, m - a_i) <= k.

This is a standard problem where we can find the maximum m using binary search.

But maybe there's a mathematical way to compute m directly.

Let me consider that after buying k cards, the total sum of a_i increases by k.

But the problem is more about distributing those k cards to maximize the number of permutation windows.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of complete sets of [1,2,...,n] I can form.

But the windows are overlapping, so forming one window affects the possibility of forming adjacent windows.

Wait, no, because each window is of length n, and they can overlap by n-1 elements.

I need to think about how to arrange the cards to maximize the number of such windows.

Maybe it's helpful to think in terms of periods or some repeating pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a sliding window and calculate the number of windows where all counts are at least 1.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider a simpler case.

Take the second example from the input:

n=2, k=4

a = [8,4]

After buying 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2, we have a = [8,8]

Then, we can arrange the cards as [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]

This gives 8 subarrays of [1,2] and 7 subarrays of [2,1], totaling 15 permutation windows.

But wait, in this arrangement, every pair [1,2] is a permutation, and [2,1] is also a permutation.

So, in a sequence like 1,2,1,2,..., there are overlapping windows where both [1,2] and [2,1] are permutations.

But in the problem, we are only counting contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations.

In this case, for n=2, every pair is considered, and overlapping pairs are counted separately.

So, in a sequence like 1,2,1,2,1,2,..., each overlapping pair is a permutation.

Now, for n=2, the number of permutation windows is simply the number of positions where two consecutive elements are different in a way that forms a permutation.

But for general n, it's about contiguous subarrays of length n being permutations.

I need a general approach.

Let me consider that to maximize the number of permutation windows, I need to maximize the number of positions where the window contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

I need to arrange the cards in a way that allows as many such windows as possible.

One way to maximize this is to arrange the cards in a repeating sequence that allows overlapping permutation windows.

For example, for n=2, arranging them as 1,2,1,2,... allows every pair to be a permutation.

Similarly, for n=3, arranging them in a repeating sequence like 1,2,3,1,2,3,... would allow every three consecutive numbers to be a permutation.

But in reality, it's more complicated because the counts of each number are limited by a_i plus k.

I need to think about how many complete blocks of n I can form, where each block is a permutation.

But again, the windows are overlapping, so forming one window affects the possibility of forming adjacent windows.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as arranging the cards in blocks that allow maximum overlapping permutation windows.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times I can repeat a permutation pattern, given the constraints on the counts.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that for each permutation window, I need one of each number.

So, if I have m permutation windows, I need m occurrences of each number.

But since the windows are overlapping, some numbers are shared between windows.

Wait, no, for overlapping windows, the numbers are shared, so the total number of occurrences needed is not simply m*n.

In fact, for m windows of size n with overlapping by n-1 elements, the total number of elements is m + (n - 1).

But in reality, it's more complex because the overlaps can vary.

Perhaps a better way is to think about the minimum number of each element required to form m permutation windows, considering the overlaps.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look back at the problem.

I need to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length n that are permutations of [1,2,...,n].

Given that I can arrange the cards in any order, and I can buy up to k additional cards, choosing any numbers from 1 to n.

So, I need to decide which numbers to buy and how to arrange all the cards (initial and bought) to maximize the number of permutation windows.

I need to find a way to calculate the maximum number of such windows.

Let me consider that each permutation window requires one of each number.

So, the number of permutation windows is limited by the number of times I can place a complete set of [1,2,...,n] in the array, allowing overlaps.

But overlaps complicate things because the same element can be part of multiple windows.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion could be applied here, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a sequence of length l, the number of permutation windows is l - n + 1.

But not necessarily, because not all subarrays of length n are permutations.

I need to maximize l - n + 1, but subject to the constraint that as many as possible of the subarrays are permutations.

But this seems too broad.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have infinite cards of each type, so k is sufficiently large.

Then, I can arrange the cards in a repeating sequence of the permutation, like 1,2,3,1,2,3,... for n=3.

In this case, every subarray of length n is a permutation.

So, the maximum number of permutation windows is l - n + 1, where l is the total number of cards.

But l is a_i sum plus k.

But in reality, a_i sums may limit the number of times I can repeat the permutation pattern.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many complete cycles of the permutation I can form, given the constraints on a_i plus k.

But I need a more systematic way.

Let me consider that to form m permutation windows, I need at least m occurrences of each number.

Because each window requires one of each number, and since the windows are overlapping, but to be safe, I can consider that I need at least m occurrences of each number.

But actually, because of overlaps, I might need fewer total cards.

Wait, no, because in overlapping windows, some elements are reused.

So, for m windows of size n with overlap n-1, the total number of elements is m + n - 1.

But in general, with varying overlaps, it's complicated.

Perhaps it's better to consider that to have m permutation windows, I need at least m + n - 1 cards.

But even that seems off.

Wait, in a sequence of length l, the number of subarrays of length n is l - n + 1.

So, if I set l - n + 1 = m, then l = m + n - 1.

So, to have m permutation windows, I need at least m + n - 1 cards.

But in reality, I might need more because the distribution of numbers has to satisfy the permutation condition.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me look back at the first test case.

n=1, k=10, a=[1]

So, I have one card with number 1, and I can buy 10 more cards, each with number 1.

So, total cards: 11 cards with number 1.

The only possible subarray of length 1 is [1], which is a permutation of [1].

So, there are 11 such subarrays.

So, the answer is 11.

That makes sense.

In the second test case:

n=2, k=4, a=[8,4]

After buying 4 cards of type 2, we have [8,8]

Then, arranging them as [1,2,1,2,...] up to 16 cards.

The number of subarrays of length 2 that are permutations is 15.

Wait, but in the example, it's 15.

But I need to generalize this.

Perhaps I can think of it as the number of times I can place a permutation pattern, and count the overlapping windows accordingly.

But I need a formula or a method that can be computed efficiently for large n and a_i.

Let me consider that after buying cards, I have b_i = a_i + c_i, where c_i is the number of cards bought for i, with sum of c_i <= k.

I need to maximize the number of permutation windows, which is the number of positions where the window contains each number from 1 to n exactly once.

This seems too vague for a direct formula.

Perhaps I need to think in terms of the minimum count after buying cards.

Wait, let's consider that to have m permutation windows, I need at least m occurrences of each number.

Because each window requires one of each number.

So, for each number i, b_i >= m.

Therefore, m <= b_i for all i, which means m <= min(b_i).

But b_i = a_i + c_i, and sum of c_i <= k.

I need to maximize m = min(b_i) subject to sum of c_i <= k.

This is similar to maximizing the minimum value after distributing k units among the a_i.

This is a standard problem where m is maximized such that sum over i of max(m - a_i, 0) <= k.

This can be computed using binary search on m.

Once m is determined, the total number of permutation windows is m + (total length - m*n + n - 1), but I need to think carefully about it.

Wait, no.

Actually, once m is determined, meaning that I have at least m occurrences of each number, I can arrange the cards in a way that there are m blocks where each block is a permutation.

But I need to think about how these blocks can be arranged to maximize the overlapping permutation windows.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for another approach.

I recall that in some problems involving permutations in sliding windows, the number of permutation windows can be calculated based on the frequency maps of the elements in the current window.

But in this problem, since I can arrange the cards any way I want, it's different from having a given array.

Here, I need to construct an array that maximizes the number of permutation windows.

Perhaps I should think about arranging the cards in a way that the permutation windows are as densely packed as possible.

For example, arranging them in a repeating sequence of the permutation.

Like for n=2, 1,2,1,2,1,2,...

In this case, every pair is a permutation.

Similarly, for n=3, 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3,...

Here, every three consecutive numbers form a permutation.

In such arrangements, the number of permutation windows is l - n + 1, where l is the total number of cards.

But I need to ensure that I have enough cards to form such an arrangement.

Given that I can arrange the cards freely, as long as I have enough of each number, I can form such repeating patterns.

So, perhaps the maximum number of permutation windows is m = min(b_i) where b_i = a_i + c_i, and sum of c_i <= k.

And in such an arrangement, the number of permutation windows is m.

But in the second example, m=8, but the number of permutation windows is 15.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the second example, after buying 4 cards of type 2, we have b=[8,8], and the number of permutation windows is 15, which is 8 + 7 = 15.

Wait, 8 from [1,2] and 7 from [2,1], but in reality, in a sequence like 1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2, the number of [1,2] is 15 and [2,1] is 14, but in the example, it's 8 and 7, which adds up to 15.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

In any case, perhaps the number of permutation windows is (l - n + 1) * (n!), but that seems too high.

Wait, no, because for n=2, there are 2 possible permutations, [1,2] and [2,1], so if the sequence allows both, the total is (l - n + 1) * number of unique permutations.

But in the example, it's 8 + 7 = 15, which matches (16 - 2 + 1) = 15.

So, perhaps in this arrangement, every possible window is a permutation.

So, perhaps the maximum number of permutation windows is l - n + 1, where l is the total number of cards, provided that I can arrange them such that every window is a permutation.

But is this always possible?

Only if I have enough of each number to fill the roles in the permutation windows.

In the second example, by making b_i = 8 for both numbers, I can arrange them in a way that every window is a permutation.

So, in general, if I can make b_i >= m for all i, where m is the number of permutation windows, then I can arrange the cards to have m permutation windows.

But in reality, m is l - n + 1, where l is the total number of cards.

So, l - n + 1 <= min(b_i)

Because to have l - n + 1 permutation windows, I need at least l - n + 1 occurrences of each number.

Because each window requires one of each number.

Wait, but in the arrangement like 1,2,1,2,... for n=2, each number appears every other position, so the count of each number is ceil((l - n + 1)/2).

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in a sequence of length l, the number of permutation windows is l - n + 1.

To maximize l - n + 1, I need to maximize l, which is sum of b_i = sum of a_i + k.

But I need to ensure that in this arrangement, every window of size n is a permutation.

Is that possible?

Only if I have enough of each number to cover their occurrences in the windows.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of times each number appears in the permutation windows.

In each permutation window, each number appears exactly once.

So, in m permutation windows, each number appears m times.

But because the windows are overlapping, some numbers are shared between windows.

So, the total number of cards needed is not m * n, but m + (n - 1), or something similar.

Wait, no, it's more complex.

Let me consider that for m permutation windows, the total number of cards is l = m + n - 1.

Because the first window uses n cards, and each subsequent window shares n-1 cards with the previous window.

So, for m windows, total cards needed are n + (m - 1)*(n - 1).

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, for m windows of size n with overlap of n-1, the total length is n + (m - 1)*(n - 1).

Yes, that makes sense.

For example, for n=2 and m=3:

Total length l = 2 + (3-1)*(2-1) = 2 + 2*1 = 4.

Sequence: 1,2,1,2

Windows: [1,2], [2,1], [1,2] — three permutation windows.

Similarly, for n=3 and m=2:

l = 3 + (2-1)*(3-1) = 3 + 1*2 = 5.

Sequence: 1,2,3,2,3

Windows: [1,2,3], [2,3,2], [3,2,3]

But [2,3,2] is not a permutation, so this approach doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe my formula is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

In general, for m permutation windows with overlap, the total number of cards is l = m*(n - 1) + 1.

Wait, no.

Actually, in the previous example, for n=2 and m=3, l=4, which is m*(n-1) + 1 = 3*1 +1=4.

Similarly, for n=3 and m=2, l=5, which is m*(n-1) +1=2*2 +1=5.

But in that case, for n=3 and m=2, the sequence is 1,2,3,2,3, which has windows [1,2,3], [2,3,2], [3,2,3]. Only the first window is a permutation.

So, my formula doesn't guarantee that all windows are permutations.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

I need a different way.

Let me consider that to have m permutation windows, I need at least m occurrences of each number.

Because each window requires one of each number, and the windows may overlap, but to be safe, I'll assume that I need m occurrences of each number.

Then, the minimum m is limited by the smallest b_i, where b_i = a_i + c_i, and sum of c_i <=k.

So, I can perform a binary search on m, and for each m, check if sum over i of max(m - a_i, 0) <=k.

Once I find the maximum such m, then the number of permutation windows is m.

But in the second example, m=8, and the number of permutation windows is 15.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the second example, after setting b_i=8 for both numbers, the total number of permutation windows is 15, which is l - n +1 =16 -2 +1=15.

So, in this case, l = m + (n -1) =8 +1=9, but in the example, l=16.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I set m to be the maximum number of permutation windows.

Each permutation window corresponds to a unique set of n consecutive cards that form a permutation.

If I arrange the cards in a way that every n consecutive cards form a permutation, then the number of such windows is l - n +1, where l is the total number of cards.

To maximize m, I need to maximize l - n +1, subject to the constraints on the counts of each number.

The constraints are that for each number i, the number of times it appears in the array should be at least ceil(m / f), where f is the frequency of i in the permutation.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, the maximum number of overlapping permutation windows is related to the number of times I can repeat a pattern.

Perhaps I can think in terms of repeating a permutation pattern as much as possible, given the constraints on the counts.

So, I need to find how many times I can repeat a permutation pattern, given that I can buy up to k additional cards.

To do this efficiently, I need to calculate the minimum count after buying cards and then determine how many permutation windows I can form.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimum count after distributing k cards to maximize the minimum count, and then calculate the number of permutation windows based on that.

Let me formalize this.

Sort the a_i in ascending order: a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n.

I need to find the maximum m such that sum over i from 1 to n of max(m - a_i, 0) <=k.

This is a standard problem where m is the target minimum count, and I need to find the maximum m where the total cost (number of cards needed to reach m for each a_i) is <=k.

Once I have m, the number of permutation windows is m + (something).

Wait, no.

Actually, if I have m as the minimum count, and I arrange the cards in a way that the permutation windows are as dense as possible, then the number of permutation windows is m + (some function of n and k).

But I need to find the exact formula.

Let me consider that with m as the minimum count, I can form m permutation windows, but actually, with m being the minimum count, I can form more windows due to overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the total number of permutation windows as l - n +1, where l is the total number of cards, which is sum of a_i + k.

But I need to ensure that the arrangement allows all these windows to be permutations.

This seems too optimistic because it depends on how the cards are distributed.

Perhaps I need to accept that this problem requires a more sophisticated approach.

Let me consider that the maximum number of permutation windows is equal to the minimum count after buying cards, m, plus some adjustment based on the remaining cards.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of permutation windows is m + floor((l - m*n)/n), but I'm not sure.

Let me try to think in terms of blocks.

Each permutation window consumes one of each number.

So, if I have m permutation windows, I need m of each number.

After allocating m of each number to the permutation windows, I have a_i - m remaining cards for each i.

These remaining cards can be placed anywhere, but they don't contribute to additional permutation windows beyond m.

Wait, but in reality, if I have more cards, I can have more overlapping permutation windows.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of permutation windows being l - n +1, where l is the total number of cards, but only if I can arrange the cards such that every window is a permutation.

But that requires that I have at least m occurrences of each number, where m = l - n +1.

So, m <= b_i for all i, where b_i = a_i + c_i.

Hence, m <= min(b_i).

But m = l - n +1, and l = sum of b_i.

Wait, no, l is the total number of cards, which is sum of b_i.

But sum of b_i = sum of a_i + k.

So, l = sum a_i + k.

Then, m = l - n +1 = sum a_i + k - n +1.

But I also have m <= min(b_i).

So, m = min(sum a_i + k - n +1, min(b_i)).

But b_i = a_i + c_i, and sum c_i <=k.

To maximize m, I need to maximize min(b_i).

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that I can set b_i = a_i + c_i, with sum c_i <=k, and I need to maximize m = l - n +1, where l = sum b_i, subject to m <= b_i for all i.

So, m <= b_i for all i, and m <= sum b_i - n +1.

But this is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I need to accept that the problem requires a binary search approach.

I can perform a binary search on m, the number of permutation windows, and for each m, check if sum over i of max(m - a_i, 0) <=k.

Once I find the maximum such m, then the number of permutation windows is m.

But in the second example, m=8, but the number of permutation windows is 15.

This suggests that my understanding is incomplete
