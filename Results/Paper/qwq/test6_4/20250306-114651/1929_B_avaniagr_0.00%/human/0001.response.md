Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n by n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this with the fewest number of colored cells possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two main types of diagonals: those that run from the top-left to the bottom-right and those that run from the top-right to the bottom-left. For a grid of size n, there are n diagonals in each direction, but some of them are shorter than others.

Wait, actually, the problem says there are a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. Let me verify that. For an n x n grid, the number of diagonals in one direction is 2n - 1, and since there are two directions, it should be 2*(2n - 1) = 4n - 2. Yeah, that makes sense.

So, we have 4n - 2 diagonals in total, and we need to make sure that at least k of them have at least one colored cell. We need to find the minimal number of cells to color to satisfy this condition.

I think the key here is to maximize the number of diagonals that a single cell can cover. Each cell lies on exactly two diagonals: one in each direction. So, if I color a cell, I can cover two diagonals at once.

But, some cells might lie on more diagonals. Wait, no, in a square grid, each cell is on exactly one diagonal in the top-left to bottom-right direction and one diagonal in the top-right to bottom-left direction.

Wait a second, actually, in some grids, the main diagonals might be longer, but each cell still lies on exactly two diagonals, unless it's on the edge.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully. In a grid, for example, n=3:

Indices starting from 1:

Cell (1,1) is on diagonal from top-left to bottom-right (cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)) and on diagonal from top-right to bottom-left (cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)). Wait, actually, in this case, it's the same diagonal for both directions because it's the main diagonal.

Wait, no. Diagonals in one direction are from top-left to bottom-right, and in the other direction from top-right to bottom-left.

So, for n=3:

- Diagonals from top-left to bottom-right:

- Diagonal with cells (1,1)

- Diagonal with cells (1,2), (2,1)

- Diagonal with cells (2,2)

- Diagonal with cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonal with cells (3,3)

Wait, actually, it's better to think in terms of the sum of indices. For top-left to bottom-right diagonals, the sum of row and column indices is constant. For top-right to bottom-left, the difference between row and column indices is constant.

So, for n=3:

- Sum based (top-left to bottom-right):

- Sum=2: cell (1,1)

- Sum=3: cells (1,2), (2,1)

- Sum=4: cells (2,2), (3,1), (1,3)

- Sum=5: cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Sum=6: cell (3,3)

Wait, but n=3, rows and columns are from 1 to 3.

So sums:

- 2: (1,1)

- 3: (1,2), (2,1)

- 4: (2,2), (3,1), (1,3)

- 5: (2,3), (3,2)

- 6: (3,3)

So, 5 diagonals in one direction.

Similarly, for differences (top-right to bottom-left):

- Difference= -2: cell (3,1)

- Difference= -1: cells (2,1), (3,2)

- Difference=0: cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Difference=1: cells (1,2), (2,3)

- Difference=2: cell (1,3)

So, again, 5 diagonals in this direction.

Wait, but according to the problem, there are 4n - 2 diagonals. For n=3, that's 10 diagonals, which matches the 5 + 5.

Now, the problem is to cover at least k diagonals by coloring the minimal number of cells.

Since each cell covers exactly two diagonals (one from each direction), the idea is to select cells in such a way that we cover as many diagonals as possible with fewer cells.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard in general, but perhaps for this specific structure, there's a pattern or formula that can be used.

Let me think about it differently. Suppose I want to cover all diagonals, i.e., k=4n-2. How many cells do I need to color?

Well, since each cell covers two diagonals, and there are 4n-2 diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals would be ceil((4n-2)/2). But ceil((4n-2)/2) = 2n - 1. So, 2n - 1 cells are sufficient to cover all diagonals.

Wait, but is that the minimal number? Let's see for n=2:

n=2, 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Ceil(6/2) = 3 cells.

But in the example, for n=2, k=3, the output is 2. Wait, that's odd. According to my calculation, ceil(6/2)=3 cells should be needed to cover all 6 diagonals, but the example shows that for k=3, only 2 cells are needed.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe for smaller k, fewer cells are needed, but for k=4n-2, it's 2n-1 cells.

Wait, in the example, for n=3, k=4, output is 2.

For n=3, k=3, output is 2.

For n=3, k=10, output is 6.

For n=3, k=9, output is 5.

For n=4, k=7, output is 4.

For n=7, k=11, output is 6.

For n=2, k=3, output is 2.

Wait, for n=2, k=3, output is 2, which is less than ceil(6/2)=3.

So, perhaps there is a better way to cover the diagonals.

Let me think about the structure of the grid.

In a grid, the diagonals can be grouped into two sets: those where row + column is constant (top-left to bottom-right), and those where row - column is constant (top-right to bottom-left).

So, if I select a cell, I cover one diagonal from each set.

I need to cover at least k diagonals in total.

I need to minimize the number of cells selected, while covering at least k diagonals.

This sounds like a matching problem, where cells are connections between diagonals from the two sets.

In graph theory terms, this is like a bipartite graph where one partition is the set of diagonals from one direction, and the other partition is the set of diagonals from the other direction, and edges connect diagonals that share a cell.

Then, selecting a cell corresponds to selecting an edge in this bipartite graph, and covering both diagonals connected by that edge.

So, the problem reduces to finding a minimal edge cover of at least k nodes in this bipartite graph.

But this seems complicated, especially since n can be up to 1e8.

Perhaps there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

Case 1: k <= number of diagonals in one direction.

For example, k <= 2n -1.

In this case, since one set of diagonals has 2n -1 diagonals, and the other set also has 2n -1 diagonals.

Wait, 4n -2 diagonals in total, divided into two sets of 2n -1 each.

So, if k <= 2n -1, then perhaps I can cover k diagonals by selecting ceil(k/2) cells.

Because each cell covers two diagonals, one from each set.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3, k=4, output is 2, which is ceil(4/2)=2.

For n=3, k=3, output is 2, which is also ceil(3/2)=2.

For n=3, k=9, output is 5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=3, k=10, output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but wait, 10/2=5, but output is 6. Wait, that's inconsistent.

Wait, n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, output is 6.

But ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps there is more to it.

Wait, perhaps when k is less than or equal to 2n -1, the minimal number of cells is ceil(k/2), but when k > 2n -1, it's different.

But in the example, for n=3, k=9, output is 5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=3, k=10, output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but actual output is 6.

So, perhaps when k > 2n -1, it's not just ceil(k/2), but something else.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k/2) when k <= 2n -1, and ceil(k/2) + something when k > 2n -1.

Wait, for n=3, k=9, ceil(9/2)=5, output is 5.

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

So, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + (k > 2n -1).

Wait, for k=10, 2n -1=5, so k > 2n -1 is false, because 10 > 5 is true, but according to the formula, it's ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k/2) + (k > 2n -1)*1.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, 2n -1=5, k >5, so +1, ceil(10/2)=5 +1=6, which matches the output.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, 9 >5, ceil(9/2)=5 +1=6, but output is 5.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (2n -1)).

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + max(0,10-5)=5 +5=10, which is not matching.

Wait, that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's min(ceil(k/2), 2n -1).

Wait, for n=3, k=4, ceil(4/2)=2, which matches output 2.

For k=3, ceil(3/2)=2, matches output 2.

For k=9, ceil(9/2)=5, but min(5,5)=5, matches output 5.

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, min(5,5)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + (k >= 2n) * (k - (2n -1)).

For k=10, n=3, 2n=6, k >=6 is true, so + (10 -5)=5, ceil(10/2)=5 +5=10, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have to cover k diagonals.

Each cell covers two diagonals, one from each set.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

But if I have to cover k diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k/2).

However, there might be dependencies based on how the diagonals intersect.

Wait, perhaps for k up to 2n -1, ceil(k/2) is sufficient, but for k > 2n -1, it's more.

Wait, for k > 2n -1, perhaps I need to cover some diagonals from the other set as well.

Wait, maybe it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (2n -1)).

For n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + (10-5)=5, total 10, but output is 6.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (2n -1)) //2.

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + (10-5)//2=2, total 7, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's more involved.

Let me consider the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

With 1 cell, you can cover 2 diagonals.

With 2 cells, you can cover up to 4 diagonals, but possibly less if there is overlap.

Wait, but in reality, with 2 cells, you can cover up to 4 diagonals if the cells are chosen such that each covers two new diagonals.

Similarly, with 3 cells, up to 6 diagonals, and so on.

But in the example, for n=2, k=3, output is 2, which means that with 2 cells, you can cover 3 diagonals.

Wait, but according to the above, with 2 cells, you can cover up to 4 diagonals.

Wait, but n=2 has 4*2 -2=6 diagonals.

So, with 2 cells, you can cover up to 4 diagonals, but in the case where k=3, it's sufficient to use 2 cells.

Similarly, for k=4 in n=3, output is 2, which means covering 4 diagonals with 2 cells.

For k=9 in n=3, output is 5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

For k=10 in n=3, output is 6, which is ceil(10/2)=5, but actual output is 6.

Wait, perhaps there is an additional constraint when k is close to 4n -2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

If k <= 2n -1, then ceil(k/2).

Else, ceil(k/2) + (k - (2n -1)).

Wait, for n=3, k=9, ceil(9/2)=5 + (9-5)=4, total 9, but output is 5.

No, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (4n -2 - (2n -1))).

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Let me look at the example outputs again.

For n=3, k=4, output=2.

For n=3, k=3, output=2.

For n=3, k=10, output=6.

For n=3, k=9, output=5.

For n=4, k=7, output=4.

For n=7, k=11, output=6.

For n=2, k=3, output=2.

Wait, for n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, output is 6.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, output is 5.

So, perhaps for k <= 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2).

For k > 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2) + (k - (2n -1)).

But for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + (10-5)=5, total 10, but output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps for k > 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2) + ceil((k - (2n -1))/2).

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + ceil((10-5)/2)=3, total 8, still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's more like 2n -1 cells are needed to cover up to 4n -2 diagonals.

Wait, for n=3, 2n -1=5 cells can cover up to how many diagonals?

Each cell covers 2 diagonals, so 5 cells can cover up to 10 diagonals, which matches 4n -2=10.

So, perhaps for k <= 4n -2, the number of cells needed is ceil(k/2), but with a cap at 2n -1.

Wait, but for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in understanding.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is the maximum of ceil(k/2) and ceil(k - (2n -1)).

Wait, for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, ceil(10 -5)= ceil(5)=5, max(5,5)=5, but output is 6.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + floor((k - (2n -1))/2).

For k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + floor((10-5)/2)=2, total 7, not matching.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that to cover all 4n -2 diagonals, I need exactly 2n -1 cells.

Because each cell covers 2 diagonals, and there are 4n -2 diagonals, so (4n -2)/2 = 2n -1 cells.

Similarly, for k diagonals, perhaps it's ceil(k/2), but adjusted based on n.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, and output is 6, which is more than ceil(10/2)=5.

So, perhaps there's an additional condition.

Wait, perhaps when k > 2n -1, the number of cells needed is ceil(k/2) + (k - (2n -1)).

Wait, for k=10, n=3, ceil(10/2)=5 + (10-5)=5, total 10, but output is 6.

No, not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (4n -2 - (2n -1))).

Wait, that seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of cells needed to cover k diagonals is ceil(k/2), but with a minimum of max(k - (2n -1), 0) additional cells.

Wait, for k <= 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2).

For k > 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2) + (k - (2n -1)).

But for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + (10-5)=5, total 10, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (4n -2 - (2n -1))).

Wait, 4n -2 - (2n -1) = 2n -1.

So, ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (2n -1)).

For k=10, n=3, ceil(10/2)=5 + max(0,10-5)=5, total 10, not matching.

This isn't working.

Let me look for another approach.

Suppose I have to cover k diagonals.

Each cell can cover one diagonal from each set.

I need to select cells such that the total number of unique diagonals covered is at least k.

This sounds like a hitting set problem, where I need to hit at least k diagonals.

But hitting set is NP-hard, so there must be a smarter way here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the number of diagonals that need to be covered from each set.

Suppose I have two sets of diagonals: set A with 2n -1 diagonals and set B with 2n -1 diagonals.

Each cell covers one diagonal from A and one from B.

I need to select cells such that the total number of unique diagonals from A and B covered is at least k.

So, if I select a cell, it covers one from A and one from B.

I need to maximize the number of new diagonals covered with each cell.

In the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

But if I have to cover k diagonals, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k/2).

However, there might be cases where covering additional diagonals requires covering overlapping diagonals.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is needed here.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the sum of the number of diagonals needed from each set.

Let’s denote:

Let’s say I need to cover p diagonals from set A and q diagonals from set B, where p + q >= k.

But since each cell covers one from A and one from B, I need to maximize p + q with minimal cells.

Wait, perhaps it's min(ceil(p/1) + ceil(q/1)), but that seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the extreme case where k is small.

For example, k=1.

I need to cover at least one diagonal.

I can do this by coloring one cell, which covers two diagonals.

So, minimal number of cells is 1.

Wait, but in the problem, k starts from 1.

Wait, no, k starts from 1, but in the example, k=3 for n=2, output is 2.

Wait, for k=1, minimal number of cells is 1, covering 2 diagonals.

For k=2, still 1 cell suffices.

For k=3, need 2 cells, covering up to 4 diagonals.

Wait, but for n=2, 4n -2=6 diagonals.

So, for k=3, need 2 cells.

Similarly, for k=4, need 2 cells.

For k=5, need 3 cells.

For k=6, need 3 cells.

But in the example, for n=2, k=3, output is 2.

Which matches ceil(3/2)=2.

Similarly, for k=4, ceil(4/2)=2.

For k=5, ceil(5/2)=3.

For k=6, ceil(6/2)=3.

So, perhaps for k <= 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2), and for k > 2n -1, it's ceil(k/2) + (k - (2n -1)).

Wait, but for n=3, k=10, which is 4n -2=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but output is 6.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + max(0, k - (2n -1)), but for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5 + (10-5)=5, total 10, but output is 6.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k/2) + floor((k - (2n -1))/2).

For k=10, n=3, ceil(10/2)=5 + floor((10-5)/2)=2, total 7, not matching.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a
