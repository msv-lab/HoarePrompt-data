Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Sasha wants to draw a square grid of size n by n, and he wants to color some cells in such a way that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The goal is to minimize the number of cells he needs to color.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to the bottom-right and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to the bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is 2n - 1, and similarly, the number of anti-diagonals is also 2n - 1. So, the total number of diagonals is 4n - 2.

The problem asks to ensure that at least k of these diagonals have at least one colored cell, and we need to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to minimize the number of colored cells is to maximize the number of diagonals that each colored cell covers. That is, each colored cell should be on as many diagonals as possible that are not already covered by other colored cells.

But since each cell is only on one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, the maximum number of new diagonals a single cell can cover is two: one main and one anti-diagonal.

So, ideally, each colored cell covers two new diagonals.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

Wait, but that can't be right because there might be constraints where certain diagonals can only be covered by specific cells.

Let me consider some examples.

Take n = 3.

The total number of diagonals is 4*3 - 2 = 10.

If k = 4, according to the example, the minimal number of cells is 2.

Similarly, for k = 3, it's also 2.

Wait, ceil(3 / 2) = 2, which matches.

For k = 10, it's 6.

But ceil(10 / 2) = 5, which doesn't match. So, there must be more to it.

Hmm.

Maybe for larger k, covering all diagonals requires covering some overlapping diagonals in a specific way.

Let me think about the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by a certain number of cells.

Each cell can cover up to two diagonals, but as we add more cells, there might be overlaps where a cell covers a diagonal that's already covered by another cell.

So, to cover k diagonals, we might need more than ceil(k / 2) cells in some cases.

Let me consider the extreme case where k = 4n - 2, which is all diagonals.

In this case, how many cells do we need to color to cover all diagonals?

Well, since there are 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, but they overlap in certain cells.

Wait, no, they are distinct sets.

Actually, in a square grid, the set of main diagonals and anti-diagonals together constitute all possible diagonals.

But some cells are on both a main and an anti-diagonal.

So, to cover all diagonals, we need to ensure that every main diagonal and every anti-diagonal has at least one colored cell.

This sounds like a classic set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but since the grid is large (n up to 10^8), we need an efficient solution based on some mathematical insight.

Let me consider the minimal number of cells needed to cover all diagonals.

In the case where k = 4n - 2, which is all diagonals, what's the minimal number of cells needed?

Well, each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, to cover all main diagonals and all anti-diagonals, we need to select a set of cells such that every main diagonal and every anti-diagonal has at least one cell from this set.

This sounds like a bipartite graph covering problem, where one partition is the main diagonals and the other is the anti-diagonals, and edges connect diagonals that share a cell.

But this seems too complicated for the time constraints.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me think about the minimal number of cells needed to cover all main diagonals.

To cover all main diagonals, we need at least the number of main diagonals that are not overlapping.

Wait, no.

Actually, to cover all main diagonals, we can select the main diagonal that covers the most uncovered cells, and iteratively select cells until all diagonals are covered.

But again, this is too time-consuming for large n.

Perhaps there's a formula based on the grid's properties.

Let me consider smaller n and see if I can find a pattern.

For n = 2:

Total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

If k = 3, according to the example, the answer is 2.

Wait, in the example, for n = 2 and k = 3, the output is 2.

Similarly, for n = 3 and k = 4, it's 2.

Wait, but for n = 3 and k = 10, it's 6.

Wait, n = 3, k = 9, it's 5.

Wait, in the sample input, for n = 3, k = 10, output is 6, and for k = 9, it's 5.

Wait, 10 is the total number of diagonals for n = 3, and 9 is one less than that.

So, perhaps there's a threshold where, for smaller k, the number of cells is ceil(k / 2), and for larger k, it's more.

Wait, but in n = 3, k = 4, answer is 2, which is ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

For k = 3, it's still 2, which is ceil(3 / 2) = 2.

For k = 9, it's 5, which is more than ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

For k = 10, it's 6, which is ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but it's 6.

So, perhaps for k up to 2n - 2, the minimal number is ceil(k / 2), and for k >= 2n - 1, it's different.

Wait, for n = 3:

2n - 2 = 4.

For k = 4, answer is 2, which is ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

For k = 5, it should be 3, but in the sample, for k = 9, it's 5, and for k = 10, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I select a cell, I cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

To cover all main diagonals and all anti-diagonals, I need to select enough cells such that every main diagonal and every anti-diagonal has at least one cell selected.

This sounds like a set cover problem where the universe is the set of all diagonals, and each cell is a set containing the main and anti-diagonal it belongs to.

Finding the minimal number of cells to cover all diagonals is equivalent to finding the minimal number of sets to cover the entire universe.

This is a classic set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but perhaps for this specific case, there's a mathematical formula.

Let me consider that the main diagonals and anti-diagonals form two separate groups, and the cells are the intersections.

In a grid, the main diagonals can be indexed from 0 to 2n-2, and similarly for anti-diagonals.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider the minimal number of cells needed to cover all main diagonals.

To cover all main diagonals, I need at least the number of main diagonals that are not overlapping.

Wait, no.

Actually, to cover all main diagonals, I can select cells along one anti-diagonal.

Wait, for example, in n x n grid, selecting the main anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) would cover all main diagonals.

Similarly, selecting the main diagonal would cover all anti-diagonals.

Wait, no.

Wait, in n x n grid, the main diagonal runs from top-left to bottom-right, and the main anti-diagonal runs from top-right to bottom-left.

Each main diagonal is identified by its slope.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of covering rows and columns, but it's diagonals.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of graph theory.

Consider each diagonal as a node, and each cell as an edge connecting two nodes (one for the main diagonal and one for the anti-diagonal it belongs to).

Then, the problem reduces to finding a minimal edge cover in this bipartite graph.

But again, for large n, this is not practical.

Perhaps there's a formula based on the grid's properties.

Let me consider that for k up to 2n - 2, the minimal number of cells is ceil(k / 2).

For k >= 2n - 1, it's more.

Wait, for n = 3:

2n - 2 = 4.

For k = 4, answer is 2, which is ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

For k = 5, it should be 3, but in the sample, for k = 9, it's 5, and for k = 10, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of main and anti-diagonals separately.

Let me denote:

Number of main diagonals: 2n - 1.

Number of anti-diagonals: 2n - 1.

Total diagonals: 4n - 2.

Now, if k is small, say k <= 2n - 2, then ceil(k / 2) seems to be sufficient.

But for larger k, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is the smallest integer m such that the number of diagonals covered by m cells is at least k.

Each cell can cover up to two new diagonals, but there might be overlaps.

So, the first cell covers 2 diagonals, the second covers 2 more, and so on.

But eventually, there might be a point where adding a new cell only covers 1 new diagonal or even none, due to overlaps.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, in the extreme case where k = 4n - 2, which is all diagonals, what's the minimal number of cells needed?

Well, to cover all main diagonals, I need at least n cells, because each cell covers one main diagonal, and there are 2n - 1 main diagonals.

Wait, no, each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

Wait, but in reality, the main diagonals and anti-diagonals overlap in certain cells.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a matching between main and anti-diagonals.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in a grid, the minimal number of cells needed to cover all rows and all columns is equal to the maximum number of non-overlapping rows and columns, which is n.

But in this case, it's diagonals, not rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of cells needed to cover all main diagonals and all anti-diagonals is equal to the maximum number of pairwise non-intersecting diagonals.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate the minimal number of cells based on n and k.

Let me consider that for k up to 2n - 2, the minimal number is ceil(k / 2).

For k >= 2n - 1, it's more.

Wait, for n = 3:

2n - 2 = 4.

For k = 4, answer is 2.

For k = 5, it should be 3, but in the sample, for k = 9, it's 5, and for k = 10, it's 6.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) when k <= 2n - 2, and then it increases differently for larger k.

Wait, for n = 3, 2n - 2 = 4, and ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

For k = 5, ceil(5 / 2) = 3, but in the sample, for k = 9, it's 5, which is more than ceil(9 / 2) = 5, and for k = 10, it's 6, which matches ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the sample says 6.

Wait, maybe it's floor((k + 1) / 2).

Wait, floor(5 / 2) = 2, which is not matching.

This is confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have to cover at least k diagonals.

Each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells needed is ceil(k / 2).

But in reality, for larger k, this might not hold due to overlapping constraints.

Perhaps I need to consider the structure of the grid more carefully.

Let me consider that the grid can be divided into main diagonals and anti-diagonals, and that some diagonals intersect.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion can help, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe there's a formula based on the number of diagonals and their intersections.

This seems too vague.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs.

Sample Input:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Sample Output:

2

2

6

5

4

6

2

Looking at n = 3:

For k = 4, output is 2.

For k = 3, output is 2.

For k = 10 (which is 4*3 - 2 = 10), output is 6.

For k = 9, output is 5.

For n = 4 and k = 7, output is 4.

For n = 7 and k = 11, output is 6.

For n = 2 and k = 3, output is 2.

Looking at these, it seems that for smaller k, the output is ceil(k / 2), but for larger k, it's more.

Wait, for n = 3 and k = 4, ceil(4 / 2) = 2, which matches.

For k = 3, ceil(3 / 2) = 2, which matches.

For k = 9, ceil(9 / 2) = 5, which matches.

For k = 10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps for k up to 2n - 2, it's ceil(k / 2), and for k >= 2n - 1, it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

Wait, for n = 3, 2n - 2 = 4.

For k = 5, it would be ceil(5 / 2) = 3, but in the sample, for k = 9, it's 5, which matches ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

For k = 10, it's 6, which is ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but it's 6.

So, perhaps it's ceil(k / 2) when k <= 4n - 4, and then it's n + ceil((k - (4n - 4)) / 2) for k >= 4n - 3.

Wait, that seems off.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the minimal number of cells needed is equal to the minimal number of cells required to cover at least k diagonals.

Given that each cell can cover up to two diagonals, the minimal number is ceil(k / 2), but adjusted for the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered without overlaps.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the total number of diagonals and how they intersect.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that for k up to 2n - 2, the minimal number is ceil(k / 2).

For k >= 2n - 1, it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

Wait, for n = 3 and k = 5, this would be 3 + ceil(1 / 2) = 3 + 1 = 4, but in the sample, for k = 9, it's 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

Wait, for n = 3 and k = 9, it's 3 + ceil((9 - 4) / 2) = 3 + ceil(5 / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, but the sample output is 5.

Hmm, still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

For n = 3 and k = 9, it's 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, which matches the sample.

For k = 10, it's 2 + ceil(6 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, ceil(6 / 2) = 3, so 2 + 3 = 5, but sample is 6.

Hmm.

Perhaps it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2) when k > 2n - 2.

For n = 3 and k = 9, it's 3 + ceil(5 / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, but sample is 5.

Wait, perhaps it's n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

Wait, for n = 3 and k = 9, it's 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, which matches.

For k = 10, it's 2 + ceil(6 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, but sample is 6.

So, perhaps for k = 4n - 2, which is 10 for n = 3, it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

Wait, n = 3, k = 10:

3 + ceil((10 - 4) / 2) = 3 + ceil(6 / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the formula is:

If k <= 2n - 2, then ceil(k / 2).

Else, n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

Wait, for n = 3 and k = 9, it's 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.

For k = 10, it's 2 + ceil(6 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, but sample is 6.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, maybe it's n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2) when k > 2n - 2.

Wait, for k = 9, it's 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.

For k = 10, it's 2 + ceil(6 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, but sample is 6.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe for k = 4n - 2, it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

For n = 3, k = 10:

3 + ceil((10 - 4) / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, which matches.

For k = 9:

3 + ceil((9 - 4) / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, but sample is 5.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2) when k > 2n - 2.

For k = 9: 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.

For k = 10: 2 + ceil(6 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, but sample is 6.

So, perhaps there's an adjustment needed when k = 4n - 2.

Maybe for k = 4n - 2, it's n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2) + 1.

Wait, for k = 10: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6, which matches.

For k = 9: 2 + 3 = 5, which matches.

So, perhaps the formula is:

If k <= 2n - 2:

result = ceil(k / 2)

Else:

result = n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2)

And if k = 4n - 2, add 1.

Wait, for n = 3, 4n - 2 = 10, which matches.

For n = 3, k = 9: 2 + 3 = 5.

For k = 10: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.

This seems to work.

Similarly, for n = 4, k = 7:

2n - 2 = 6.

Since k = 7 > 6, result = 4 - 1 + ceil((7 - 6) / 2) = 3 + ceil(1 / 2) = 3 + 1 = 4, which matches the sample.

For n = 7, k = 11:

2n - 2 = 12.

k = 11 <= 12, so ceil(11 / 2) = 6, which matches the sample.

For n = 2, k = 3:

2n - 2 = 2.

k = 3 > 2, so result = 2 - 1 + ceil((3 - 2) / 2) = 1 + ceil(1 / 2) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample.

So, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, the minimal number of cells needed is:

If k <= 2n - 2:

ceil(k / 2)

Else:

n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2)

And if k = 4n - 2, add 1.

Wait, but for n = 3, k = 10, which is 4n - 2, result is 6, which is n - 1 + ceil((10 - 4) / 2) + 1 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6.

For k = 9, it's 2 + 3 = 5, which is correct.

For n = 4, k = 7:

2n - 2 = 6, k = 7 > 6, so 4 - 1 + ceil((7 - 6) / 2) = 3 + 1 = 4.

For n = 7, k = 11:

2n - 2 = 12, k = 11 <= 12, so ceil(11 / 2) = 6.

Seems consistent.

Therefore, I can implement this formula.

Now, considering the constraints, n can be up to 10^8, and t up to 1000, so the solution must be efficient, preferably O(1) per test case.

The formula above is O(1) per test case, so it's acceptable.

Now, let's think about implementing this.

I need to handle multiple test cases, read n and k for each, and output the minimal number of cells needed.

I need to handle the cases where k <= 2n - 2 and k > 2n - 2 separately.

Also, handle the special case when k = 4n - 2 by adding 1.

Wait, in the formula above, for k = 4n - 2, it's n - 1 + ceil((4n - 2 - (2n - 2)) / 2) + 1 = n - 1 + ceil(2n / 2) + 1 = n - 1 + n + 1 = 2n.

But in the sample, for n = 3, k = 10, output is 6, which is 2n.

So, it seems correct.

Similarly, for n = 3, k = 9:

n - 1 + ceil((9 - 4) / 2) = 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.

Which matches the sample.

So, the formula seems solid.

Now, to implement ceil(k / 2), I can use (k + 1) // 2 in integer division.

Similarly, ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2) can be (k - (2n - 2) + 1) // 2.

I need to make sure to handle the special case when k = 4n - 2 by adding 1.

Wait, in the formula above, for k = 4n - 2, it's n - 1 + ceil((4n - 2 - (2n - 2)) / 2) + 1 = n - 1 + ceil(2n / 2) + 1 = n - 1 + n + 1 = 2n.

Which is correct for n = 3, k = 10: 2*3 = 6.

For n = 3, k = 9: n - 1 + ceil((9 - 4) / 2) = 2 + ceil(5 / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.

Perfect.

So, in code, I can write:

if k <= 2*n - 2:

result = (k + 1) // 2

else:

result = n - 1 + (k - (2*n - 2) + 1) // 2

if k == 4*n - 2:

result += 1

print(result)

Wait, but in the formula for k = 4n - 2, I already have the +1 included.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust it.

Wait, in the formula above, for k > 2n - 2:

result = n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2)

And for k = 4n - 2, add +1.

But in the calculation for n = 3, k = 10:

result = 2 - 1 + ceil((10 - 4) / 2) + 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5, but sample is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

if k <= 2*n - 2:

result = (k + 1) // 2

elif k < 4*n - 2:

result = n - 1 + (k - (2*n - 2) + 1) // 2

else:

result = 2*n

This seems to match the sample.

For n = 3, k = 10:

k = 10, which is equal to 4*3 - 2 = 10, so result = 2*3 = 6, which matches.

For k = 9:

k < 4*n - 2, so result = 2 - 1 + (9 - 4 + 1) // 2 = 1 + 3 = 4, but sample is 5.

Wait, discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, for k >= 2n - 1, result = n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2)

For n = 3, k = 9:

result = 2 - 1 + ceil((9 - 4) / 2) = 1 + ceil(5 / 2) = 1 + 3 = 4, but sample is 5.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2) - 1.

For n = 3, k = 9:

3 + ceil(5 / 2) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5, which matches.

For k = 10:

3 + ceil(6 / 2) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5, but sample is 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

For n = 3, k = 9:

3 + ceil(5 / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, but sample is 5.

No.

Wait, maybe it's n + ceil((k - (2n - 1)) / 2).

For n = 3, k = 9:

3 + ceil((9 - 5) / 2) = 3 + ceil(4 / 2) = 3 + 2 = 5, which matches.

For k = 10:

3 + ceil((10 - 5) / 2) = 3 + 3 = 6, which matches.

For k = 7 (n=4):

4 + ceil((7 - 7) / 2) = 4 + 0 = 4, which matches the sample.

For k = 11 (n=7):

7 + ceil((11 - 12) / 2) = 7 + ceil(-1 / 2) = 7 + 0 = 7, but sample is 6.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - 1 + ceil((k - (2n - 2)) / 2).

For n = 7, k = 11:

7 - 1 + ceil((11 - 12) / 2) = 6 + ceil(-1 / 2) = 6 + 0 = 6, which matches.

For n = 3, k = 9:

3 - 1 + ceil((9 - 4) / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5.

For k = 10:

3 - 1 + ceil((10 - 4) / 2) = 2 + 3 = 5, but sample is 6.

Wait, for k = 10, which is 4n - 2, we need to add 1, making it 6.

So, the formula is:

if k <= 2*n - 2:

result = (k + 1) // 2

else:

result = n - 1 + (k - (2*n - 2) + 1) // 2

if k == 4*n - 2:

result += 1

This seems to hold.

Now, implement this in code.

Given that n can be up to 1e8 and t up to 1000, we need an efficient solution.

We can read all inputs, compute the result for each test case, and output them.

To handle large inputs efficiently, we can read all lines at once and process them.

In Python, we can use sys.stdin.read() to read all input at once, split it into tokens, and process them.

Given that, we can proceed to implement the solution.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for s in [*open(0)][1:]:

(n, k) = map(int, s.split())

print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n
