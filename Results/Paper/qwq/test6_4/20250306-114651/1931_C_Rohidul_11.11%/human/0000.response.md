Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform an operation at most once. This operation allows me to select three integers i, j, and x, and then set all elements from index i to j to the value x. The cost of this operation is (j - i + 1) burles, which is essentially the number of elements being set to x.

My goal is to make all elements of the array equal, and I need to find the least amount of burles I have to spend to achieve this. It's guaranteed that I can always make all elements equal, so I don't have to worry about cases where it's impossible.

First, I need to understand what's the best way to make all elements equal with at most one operation.

Let me consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

6

1 2 3 4 5 1

Expected Output:

4

Explanation:

By setting elements from index 2 to 4 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 3 burles. But the expected output is 4, so maybe there's a better way.

Wait, if I set elements from index 1 to 5 to 1, that would be [1,1,1,1,1,1], and the cost is 5 burles, which is higher than 4. So that's not optimal.

Alternatively, setting index 2 to 3 to 1: [1,2,1,1,5,1], which doesn't make all elements equal.

Wait, maybe setting index 2 to 5 to 1: [1,2,1,1,1,1], still not all equal.

Wait, perhaps setting index 2 to 4 to 1: [1,2,1,1,1,1], still not equal.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different x.

If I choose x=1 and set index 2 to 5 to 1: [1,2,1,1,1,1], still not equal.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a different range.

Alternatively, set index 1 to 4 to 1: [1,1,1,1,5,1], then set index 4 to 4 to 1, but I can only perform the operation once.

Wait, maybe choosing x=5 and setting index 1 to 5 to 5: [1,5,5,5,5,1], then set index 1 to 1 and index 6 to 6 to 5, but again, I can only do one operation.

So, seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to find the longest sequence of identical elements and set the rest to that value.

But I can only perform one operation, which is to set a subarray to a certain value.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of what remains unchanged.

I can choose a subarray to set to x, and the rest remains as is.

But I need all elements to be equal in the end.

So, if I set a subarray to a certain value, and the rest are already that value or I can make them that value in the same operation.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that after setting the subarray from i to j to x, all elements become x.

So, for that to happen, the elements outside of this subarray must already be equal to x.

So, x must be equal to the elements outside of [i,j].

Wait, that could be a way to approach this.

Let me think about it.

Suppose I choose i and j such that all elements before i and after j are already equal to x.

Then, by setting the subarray [i,j] to x, the whole array becomes x.

The cost is (j - i + 1) burles.

I need to choose i and j such that the cost is minimized, meaning (j - i + 1) is as small as possible.

So, I need to maximize the lengths of the prefix and suffix that already have the value x.

So, the idea is to find the longest prefix and suffix that have the same value, and then set the subarray in between to that value.

Wait, but the prefix and suffix can have different lengths.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be the value that appears in both the prefix and suffix.

Wait, maybe I should choose x to be the value that maximizes the sum of the length of the prefix and the length of the suffix that have that value.

Then, the cost would be n - (prefix_length + suffix_length - overlap).

Wait, but I need to make sure that the prefix and suffix have the same value.

Wait, perhaps I should choose x to be the value that is common to both the prefix and the suffix.

Wait, maybe it's better to iterate through possible x values and find the maximum prefix and suffix lengths for each x.

But that might be inefficient for large n.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the code provided, let's try to understand what it's doing.

The function processes multiple test cases, as indicated by the loop over t test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n, the size of the array.

- Read the array a as a list of integers.

- Initialize l and r as the start and end indices of the array.

- Initialize st and end as 0.

- Then, there are two while loops:

- The first while loop increments l while a[l] == a[l + 1], and increments st accordingly.

- The second while loop decrements r while a[r] == a[r - 1], and increments end accordingly.

- Then, there are conditions based on the values of a[0], a[-1], st, and end to calculate ans.

- Finally, print the maximum of 0 and ans.

Wait, I need to understand what this code is trying to achieve.

It seems like it's trying to find the longest prefix and suffix that have the same value and then calculate the cost based on that.

Let me try to decode this.

In the first while loop:

While l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1], increment l and st.

So, it's finding the length of the prefix where all elements are equal to a[0].

Similarly, the second while loop is finding the length of the suffix where all elements are equal to a[-1].

Then, there are conditions based on whether a[0] == a[-1].

If a[0] == a[-1], it calculates ans as r - l - 1.

If a[0] != a[-1], and st == 0 and end == 0, ans is len(a) - 1.

Else, ans is r - l.

Finally, it prints the maximum of 0 and ans.

Wait, let's see with the first example:

n = 6

a = [1,2,3,4,5,1]

So, a[0] = 1, a[-1] = 1

First while loop:

l = 0, r = 5

a[0] == a[1]? 1 == 2? No, so l remains 0, st remains 0.

Second while loop:

a[5] == a[4]? 1 == 5? No, so r remains 5, end remains 0.

Then, since a[0] == a[-1], ans = r - l - 1 = 5 - 0 - 1 = 4.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 7

a = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

a[0] == a[-1] == 1

First while loop:

a[0] == a[1], so l increments to 1, st increments to 1.

a[1] == a[2], l=2, st=2

a[2] == a[3], l=3, st=3

a[3] == a[4], l=4, st=4

a[4] == a[5], l=5, st=5

a[5] == a[6]? 1 == 1, l=6, st=6

Now, l = 6, r = 6, so l < r is False.

Second while loop:

r = 6, a[6] == a[5]? 1 == 1, r=5, end=1

a[5] == a[4]? 1 == 1, r=4, end=2

a[4] == a[3]? 1 == 1, r=3, end=3

a[3] == a[2]? 1 == 1, r=2, end=4

a[2] == a[1]? 1 == 1, r=1, end=5

a[1] == a[0]? 1 == 1, r=0, end=6

Now, l = 6, r = 0

Since a[0] == a[-1], ans = 0 - 6 -1 = -7, but then it prints max(0, ans) = 0.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 8

a = [8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8]

a[0] = 8, a[-1] = 8

First while:

a[0] == a[1], l=1, st=1

a[1] == a[2], l=2, st=2

a[2] == a[3]? 8 == 1? No.

Second while:

a[7] == a[6], r=6, end=1

a[6] == a[5], r=5, end=2

a[5] == a[4]? 8 == 2? No.

So, l = 2, r = 5

ans = 5 - 2 -1 = 2.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 1

a = [1]

a[0] == a[-1] == 1

First while: l=0, but l < r is False.

Second while: r=0, so end=0.

ans = 0 - 0 -1 = -1, but print max(0, -1) = 0.

Which is correct.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 2

a = [1,2]

a[0] = 1, a[-1] = 2

st and end are both 0, and a[0] != a[-1], so ans = len(a) -1 = 1.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 3

a = [1,2,3]

a[0] = 1, a[-1] = 3

st=0, end=0, a[0] != a[-1], so ans = len(a) -1 = 2.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Another test case:

n = 7

a = [4,3,2,7,1,1,3]

a[0] = 4, a[-1] = 3

First while: l=0, since a[0] != a[1], st=0.

Second while: a[6] == a[5]? 3 == 1? No, so end=0.

So, ans = r - l = 6 - 0 = 6.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

Last test case:

n = 9

a = [9,9,2,9,2,5,5,5,3]

a[0] = 9, a[-1] = 3

First while: a[0] == a[1], l=1, st=1

a[1] == a[2]? 9 == 2? No.

Second while: a[8] == a[7]? 3 == 5? No, so end=0.

So, ans = r - l = 8 - 1 = 7.

Which matches the expected output.

Good.

So, in all these cases, the code seems to be working correctly.

Now, let's try to understand why this approach works.

The idea seems to be:

- Find the longest prefix where all elements are equal to a[0].

- Find the longest suffix where all elements are equal to a[-1].

- Then, if a[0] == a[-1], the cost is the length of the middle part that needs to be set to a[0].

- If a[0] != a[-1], and st == 0 and end == 0, meaning no elements in the prefix or suffix are equal to a[0] or a[-1] respectively, then the cost is n - 1, since we can set all but one element to that one element.

- Else, the cost is r - l, which is the length of the middle part.

Wait, but in the code, when a[0] == a[-1], ans = r - l -1.

Wait, why -1?

In the first test case, n=6, a=[1,2,3,4,5,1], l=0, r=5, ans=4, which is correct.

In the second test case, n=7, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1,1], l=6, r=0, ans=-7, but printed as 0, which is correct.

In the third test case, n=8, a=[8,8,8,1,2,8,8,8], l=2, r=5, ans=2, which is correct.

So, seems like ans = r - l -1 when a[0] == a[-1].

And when a[0] != a[-1], if st == 0 and end == 0, ans = n -1.

Else, ans = r - l.

Wait, I need to see what r and l represent.

l is the index up to which the prefix is equal to a[0].

r is the index from which the suffix is equal to a[-1].

So, the middle part is from l to r.

Wait, but in the first test case, l=0, r=5, ans=4.

Which is n - (st + end) where st=0, end=0.

Wait, maybe it's n - (st + end).

In the first test case, n=6, st=0, end=0, ans=6 - (0 + 0) = 6, but it's set to 4.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's n - (st + end + 1).

6 - (0 + 0 +1) = 5, still not 4.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's r - l -1.

r=5, l=0, ans=4.

Yes, that matches.

In the second test case, r=0, l=6, ans=-6, which is corrected to 0.

In the third test case, r=5, l=2, ans=2.

Seems consistent.

So, generalizing, when a[0] == a[-1], the cost is r - l -1.

When a[0] != a[-1], if st ==0 and end ==0, ans = n -1.

Else, ans = r - l.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me think about what we're trying to achieve.

We want to set a subarray [i,j] to x, and make the entire array equal to x.

So, to minimize the cost, we need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x.

So, the total cost is n - count_x, where count_x is the number of elements already equal to x.

But we can only perform one operation, which is to set a subarray to x.

So, by setting a subarray to x, we can make the entire array equal to x by ensuring that all elements outside this subarray are already equal to x.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

If I choose x to be the value of the prefix and suffix, then by setting the middle part to x, I can make the entire array equal to x.

The cost is the length of the middle part, which is r - l -1.

But only if the prefix and suffix are already equal to x.

So, when a[0] == a[-1], this makes sense.

When a[0] != a[-1], then I need to choose x to be either a[0] or a[-1], and set the other part accordingly.

But in the code, it handles this case separately.

If a[0] != a[-1], and st ==0 and end ==0, ans = n -1.

Else, ans = r - l.

I need to see if this covers all cases.

Let me consider a test case where a[0] != a[-1], and st >0 or end >0.

For example:

n=5

a=[1,1,2,3,3]

Here, a[0]=1, a[-1]=3

st=1 (prefix of 1's: indices 0 and 1)

end=2 (suffix of 3's: indices 3 and 4)

So, l=1, r=3

ans = r - l = 3 -1 =2

Is this correct?

If I set subarray from i=1 to j=3 to 1, the array becomes [1,1,1,1,3], then I need to set the last element to 1, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, no, I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be 3 instead.

Set subarray from i=1 to j=3 to 3, the array becomes [1,3,3,3,3], then set the first element to 3, but I can only do one operation.

Wait, but I can only perform one operation.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose x to be 1, and set the subarray from i=2 to j=4 to 1, making [1,1,1,1,1], with cost 3.

Or choose x=3, and set subarray from i=0 to j=3 to 3, making [3,3,3,3,3], with cost 4.

The minimal cost is 3.

But according to the code, ans = r - l = 3 -1 =2, but the actual cost should be 3.

So, discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, in this case, st=1, end=2, a[0]!=a[-1], so ans = r - l =3 -1=2, but actual minimal cost is 3.

So, the code is giving 2, but actual is 3.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it seemed correct.

Maybe this is a case where the code is wrong.

Let me think about another approach.

I need to make all elements equal with at most one operation.

Option 1: Choose x to be the most frequent element and set the subarray that covers all non-x elements.

But I can only perform one operation.

Option 2: Find the largest subset of elements that are already equal to x, and set the rest to x.

But I can only set a subarray to x.

Wait, perhaps the minimal cost is equal to the size of the array minus the maximum number of elements that are already equal to x, where x is chosen optimally.

But I need to set a subarray to x, not just choose x and set arbitrary elements.

Wait, it's more constrained because I can only set a contiguous subarray to x.

So, I need to choose x and a subarray such that, after setting that subarray to x, all elements in the array are x.

The cost is the length of that subarray.

I need to minimize this cost, i.e., minimize the length of the subarray.

So, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x.

So, the minimal cost is n - k, where k is the maximum number of elements already equal to x, for some x, such that the elements not equal to x are covered by the subarray set to x.

Wait, but I need to choose x and a subarray [i,j] such that, after setting a[i..j] to x, all elements in the array are x.

So, all elements outside [i,j] must already be equal to x.

So, to minimize the cost (which is j - i + 1), I need to maximize the number of elements already equal to x, which are outside [i,j].

So, k is the number of elements already equal to x.

Then, the minimal cost is n - k, because I need to set the remaining n - k elements to x.

But I can only set a contiguous subarray to x.

So, I need to ensure that all elements not equal to x are contained within the subarray [i,j].

So, the minimal cost is n - k, where k is the maximum number of elements equal to x, such that all elements not equal to x are contiguous.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum k such that all elements not equal to x are contained in a contiguous subarray of length n - k.

So, the minimal cost is n - k, where k is the maximum number of elements equal to x, and the elements not equal to x form a contiguous subarray.

So, to maximize k, I need to choose x such that the elements not equal to x are contained in the smallest possible contiguous subarray.

So, for each x, find the minimum length of a subarray that contains all elements not equal to x.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of the minimum length subarray that contains all non-x elements.

Wait, but since I can only perform one operation, I need to set that subarray to x.

So, the cost is the length of that subarray.

So, for each x, find the minimal length of a subarray such that, outside this subarray, all elements are equal to x.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimum over all x of this minimal subarray length.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, n=5, a=[1,1,2,3,3]

For x=1:

Non-1 elements are at positions 2 and 3 (0-based indices), which are not contiguous.

Wait, position 2 has 2, position 3 has 3, which are not contiguous.

So, I cannot cover them with a single subarray.

Wait, but in this case, it's impossible to make all elements equal to 1 with one operation.

Similarly, for x=3:

Non-3 elements are at positions 0,1,2 (elements 1,1,2).

These are contiguous from position 0 to 2.

So, set subarray from 0 to 2 to 3, making the array [3,3,3,3,3].

Cost is 3.

For x=2:

Non-2 elements are at positions 0,1,3,4.

These are not contiguous, so cannot be covered with one subarray.

Similarly, x=5 is not present.

So, the minimal cost is 3 for x=3.

But according to the code, it gives 2, which is incorrect.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the approach.

An alternative approach is to find the minimal length of a subarray such that, if I set this subarray to some x, the entire array becomes equal to x.

So, I need to cover all elements that are not equal to x with this subarray.

But x can be any value.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as finding the minimal length window such that, outside this window, all elements are equal to some x.

Then, set the window to x.

So, I need to find the smallest subarray such that, outside this subarray, all elements are equal to x.

To minimize the cost, I need to minimize the length of this subarray.

So, for each possible x, find the minimal length of a subarray that covers all non-x elements.

Then, take the minimal among all x.

But since I can choose x after selecting the subarray, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, perhaps choosing x to be the value that maximizes the number of elements equal to x, provided that the non-x elements are contained in a contiguous subarray.

So, for each x, check if the non-x elements form a contiguous subarray, and find the minimal length among those.

Wait, but this seems complicated to implement efficiently.

Given the time constraints, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be trying to find the longest prefix and suffix that have the same value, and then set the middle part to that value.

But as shown in the earlier test case, it can give incorrect results.

So, perhaps the provided code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the examples, it seems to work.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the optimal operation is to set a subarray to x, such that the elements outside this subarray are all equal to x.

So, to minimize the cost, I need to maximize the number of elements that are already equal to x.

Hence, choose x to be the most frequent element, and set the subarray that contains all non-x elements to x.

But I need to ensure that all non-x elements are contained in a single subarray.

So, for each x, find the minimal length of a subarray that contains all non-x elements.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimal such length over all x.

To implement this efficiently, I can:

- For each x, find the positions of non-x elements.

- Find the minimal length of a subarray that covers all these positions.

- This is equivalent to the minimal distance between the first and last non-x elements.

- So, for each x, find the first and last occurrence of non-x elements, and set the subarray from first to last.

- The cost is last - first + 1.

- Then, the minimal cost is the minimal last - first +1 over all x.

Wait, but this might not be correct because there could be multiple non-x elements, and I need to cover all of them in one subarray.

So, for each x, find the positions of all non-x elements, and find the minimal subarray that contains all of them.

This would be the subarray from the minimum position to the maximum position of non-x elements.

So, for each x, the cost is max_pos - min_pos +1, where min_pos and max_pos are the smallest and largest positions of non-x elements.

Then, the minimal cost is the minimal max_pos - min_pos +1 over all x.

But I need to consider that for some x, it might not be possible if non-x elements are not contiguous.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, for x=1, non-x elements are at positions 1,2,3,4, which are contiguous from 1 to 4.

For x=2, non-x elements are at 0,2,3,4, which are not fully contiguous.

Wait, but in the earlier test case, n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5,1], but wait, that's n=6, not n=5.

Wait, in the test case I considered earlier, n=5, a=[1,1,2,3,3].

For x=1:

Non-x elements at positions 2,3,4 (0-based: 2,3,4).

These are contiguous from 2 to 4.

So, set subarray from 2 to 4 to 1, making the array [1,1,1,1,1].

Cost is 3.

For x=3:

Non-x elements at positions 0,1,2 (0-based: 0,1,2).

These are contiguous from 0 to 2.

Set subarray from 0 to 2 to 3, making [3,3,3,3,3].

Cost is 3.

For x=2:

Non-x elements at positions 0,1,3,4.

These are not fully contiguous, so cannot be covered with one subarray.

Similarly, x=4 is not present.

So, minimal cost is 3.

But according to the code, ans = r - l =3 -1=2, which is less than the actual minimal cost.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
