Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and k. I need to create a string s such that all possible strings of length n, made from the first k lowercase English letters, are subsequences of s. And I have to make sure that s is as short as possible. If there are multiple possibilities, any of them is acceptable.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, in the string "abcde", "ace" is a subsequence because you can delete "b" and "d" to get it.

Okay, so for each test case, I have values of n and k. Let's look at the examples to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

4

1 2

2 1

2 2

2 3

Output:

ab

aa

baab

abcbac

Looking at the first test case:

n=1, k=2

Possible strings of length 1 from the first 2 letters 'a' and 'b' are "a" and "b". So, s should contain both "a" and "b" as subsequences. The string "ab" works because "a" is the first character and "b" is the second.

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

Only one possible string: "aa". So s should contain "aa" as a subsequence. The string "aa" itself works.

Third test case:

n=2, k=2

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb". The provided s is "baab".

Let's verify:

- "aa": positions 2 and 4: 'a' at position 2 and 'a' at position 4.

- "ab": positions 1 and 3: 'a' at position 1 and 'b' at position 3.

- "ba": positions 1 and 4: 'b' at position 1 and 'a' at position 4.

- "bb": positions 3 and 4: 'b' at position 3 and 'b' at position 4.

All of these are present as subsequences in "baab".

Fourth test case:

n=2, k=3

Possible strings: "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc". The provided s is "abcbac".

Let's verify a few:

- "aa": positions 1 and 4: 'a' at position 1 and 'a' at position 4.

- "ab": positions 1 and 2: 'a' at position 1 and 'b' at position 2.

- "ac": positions 1 and 5: 'a' at position 1 and 'c' at position 5.

- "ba": positions 2 and 4: 'b' at position 2 and 'a' at position 4.

- "bb": positions 2 and 3: 'b' at position 2 and 'b' at position 3.

- "bc": positions 2 and 5: 'b' at position 2 and 'c' at position 5.

- "ca": positions 4 and 5: 'c' at position 4 and 'a' at position 5.

- "cb": positions 4 and 6: 'c' at position 4 and 'b' at position 6.

- "cc": positions 4 and 5: 'c' at position 4 and 'c' at position 5.

All of these are present as subsequences in "abcbac".

So, the problem is to generate such a string s for given n and k that contains all possible strings of length n from the first k letters as subsequences, and among such strings, choose the one with the smallest length.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)

So, for each test case, it takes n and k, takes the first k letters of the alphabet, and repeats that string n times.

Let's see if this works for the examples.

First test case:

n=1, k=2

'ab' * 1 = 'ab'

Matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=2, k=1

'a' * 2 = 'aa'

Matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=2, k=2

'ab' * 2 = 'abab'

But in the example, it's 'baab'.

Wait, 'abab' should also work because:

- "aa": positions 1 and 3: 'a' and 'a'

- "ab": positions 1 and 2: 'a' and 'b'

- "ba": positions 2 and 3: 'b' and 'a'

- "bb": positions 2 and 4: 'b' and 'b'

Yes, that seems correct. But the example used 'baab', which is also correct, as we saw earlier.

Fourth test case:

n=2, k=3

'abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

But in the example, it's 'abcbac'.

Let's see if 'abcabc' contains all required subsequences.

Possible strings:

"aa": positions 1 and 4: 'a' and 'a'

"ab": positions 1 and 2: 'a' and 'b'

"ac": positions 1 and 5: 'a' and 'c'

"ba": positions 2 and 4: 'b' and 'a'

"bb": positions 2 and 5: 'b' and 'b'

"bc": positions 2 and 6: 'b' and 'c'

"ca": positions 3 and 4: 'c' and 'a'

"cb": positions 3 and 5: 'c' and 'b'

"cc": positions 3 and 6: 'c' and 'c'

So, 'abcabc' works as well. The example used 'abcbac', which is shorter (6 characters vs 6 characters â€“ same length).

Wait, both are 6 characters. So, in this case, it's the same length.

But in general, is repeating 'abc...k' n times the optimal solution?

Let's think about n=3, k=2.

According to the program, s would be 'ab' * 3 = 'ababab'

Possible strings of length 3 from 'a' and 'b':

"aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb"

Let's check if all these are subsequences in 'ababab':

- "aaa": positions 1, 3, 5: 'a', 'a', 'a'

- "aab": positions 1, 3, 4: 'a', 'a', 'b'

- "aba": positions 1, 2, 4: 'a', 'b', 'a'

- "abb": positions 1, 2, 5: 'a', 'b', 'b'

- "baa": positions 2, 4, 6: 'b', 'a', 'a'

- "bab": positions 2, 4, 5: 'b', 'a', 'b'

- "bba": positions 2, 3, 5: 'b', 'b', 'a'

- "bbb": positions 2, 3, 6: 'b', 'b', 'b'

All of these are present in 'ababab'. So, it works.

But is there a shorter string that contains all these subsequences?

Let's try to see if we can make a shorter string for n=3, k=2.

For example, 'abba':

- "aaa": no three 'a's in 'abba'

- "aab": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 2, 'b' at 3

- "aba": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 3, 'a' at 4

- "abb": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 3, 'b' at 4

- "baa": 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4, but there's only one 'a' after 'b', so can't make "baa"

So, 'abba' is insufficient.

Another attempt: 'ababa'

- "aaa": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 3, 'a' at 5

- "aab": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 3, 'b' at 4

- "aba": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4

- "abb": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 2, 'b' at 4

- "baa": 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4, 'a' at 5

- "bab": 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4, 'b' at 5

- "bba": 'b' at 2, 'b' at 4, 'a' at 5

- "bbb": only one 'b' in positions 2,4,5: can't make three 'b's

So, 'ababa' is also insufficient.

What about 'ababab'? That's what the program generates, and earlier check shows it works.

Is there a shorter string than 'ababab' for n=3, k=2?

Let's try 'aababb':

- "aaa": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 2, 'a' at 4

- "aab": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 2, 'b' at 3

- "aba": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 3, 'a' at 4

- "abb": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 3, 'b' at 5

- "baa": 'b' at 3, 'a' at 4, 'a' at 6

- "bab": 'b' at 3, 'a' at 4, 'b' at 5

- "bba": 'b' at 3, 'b' at 5, 'a' at 6

- "bbb": 'b' at 3, 'b' at 5, 'b' at 5 (only two 'b's, can't make three)

So, 'aababb' is insufficient.

Another attempt: 'abababb'

- "aaa": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 3, 'a' at 5

- "aab": 'a' at 1, 'a' at 3, 'b' at 4

- "aba": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4

- "abb": 'a' at 1, 'b' at 2, 'b' at 5

- "baa": 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4, 'a' at 6

- "bab": 'b' at 2, 'a' at 4, 'b' at 5

- "bba": 'b' at 2, 'b' at 5, 'a' at 6

- "bbb": 'b' at 2, 'b' at 5, 'b' at 7

This seems to cover all, but it's longer than 'ababab'.

So, it seems 'ababab' is the shortest for n=3, k=2.

Wait, but in the earlier case for n=2, k=2, 'baab' was used in the example, which is shorter than 'abab' (which is 'ab' * 2 = 'abab').

Wait, no, 'abab' and 'baab' are both 4 characters long.

Wait, but in the example, for n=2, k=2, 'baab' was used, which is also 4 characters, same as 'abab'.

So, in that case, both are acceptable since they are of the same length.

So, is the program's approach correct in general?

The program generates s by repeating the first k letters n times.

So, s = ('abc...k') * n

Is this the minimal length?

In the case of n=2, k=2, s='abab', which is minimal.

In n=2, k=3, s='abcabc', which seems minimal.

In n=3, k=2, s='ababab', which seems minimal.

But is there a general proof that this is minimal?

Let me think about the number of possible strings of length n from k letters: it's k^n.

Each subsequence must be present in s.

What's the minimal length of s that guarantees all these subsequences?

This seems related to the concept of a de Bruijn sequence, but for subsequences instead of substrings.

In de Bruijn sequences, for k characters and n length, there is a sequence of length k^n + n -1 that contains every possible subsequence of length n exactly once as a substring.

But here, we are dealing with subsequences, not substrings.

I need to find the minimal s such that all k^n possible strings of length n from the first k letters are subsequences of s.

What's the minimal possible length of s?

I'm not sure about the exact minimal length in general, but the program's approach seems to work and provides a reasonable upper bound.

In the program, s is ('abc...k') repeated n times.

The length of s is k * n.

Is there a better upper bound?

I'm not sure.

But at least the program's approach seems correct and provides a valid s for the given n and k.

So, in terms of correctness, it seems True.

But to be thorough, let's check another test case.

Suppose n=1, k=1.

Then, s should contain "a" as a subsequence, which it does, since s='a' * 1 = 'a'.

Another test case: n=3, k=1.

s='a' * 3 = 'aaa'

Possible strings: "aaa", which is present in s.

Another test case: n=2, k=3.

s='abc' * 2 = 'abcabc'

Possible strings:

"aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc"

As earlier, all these are present in 'abcabc' as subsequences.

So, it seems to work.

What about n=3, k=3?

s='abc' * 3 = 'abcabcabc'

Possible strings: all combinations of 'a', 'b', 'c' of length 3, totaling 27.

I can verify a few:

- "aaa": positions 1,4,7

- "aab": positions 1,4,5

- "aba": positions 1,2,5

- and so on.

It seems that all possible combinations are covered.

Therefore, I conclude that the program's approach is correct.

So, Correctness: **True**
