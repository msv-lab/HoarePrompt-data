Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and there are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals.

First, I need to understand the preferences:

- Introverts want to be alone in a tent. So, each introvert needs their own tent with just one person.

- Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others. So, each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people: the extrovert and two others.

- Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, I should return -1.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the introverts are straightforward. Each one needs their own tent. So, the number of tents required for introverts is simply 'a'.

Now, for extroverts, they need to be in a tent with exactly two others. So, each tent that has an extrovert must have three people: the extrovert plus two more people.

These two more people can be either universals or other extroverts, but if they are extroverts, those extroverts would also need two others in their tent, and so on.

Wait, actually, if a tent has one extrovert and two universals, that's fine. Or, if a tent has three extroverts, that's also fine, as long as each extrovert in that tent has two others with them.

But, if I have extroverts left who need two others, and I don't have enough universals to fulfill that, then it's impossible.

So, I need to figure out how to group the extroverts and universals such that each extrovert has exactly two others in their tent.

Let me consider the number of extroverts 'b' and universals 'c'.

Each extrovert requires two additional spots in their tent. So, the total number of spots needed for extroverts is 2*b.

These spots can be filled by universals or by other extroverts.

Wait, but extroverts need exactly two others, not just any number.

This is a bit tricky.

Let me think in terms of how many tents are needed for extroverts.

Since each tent can hold up to three people, and each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need to distribute them into tents, each tent having exactly three people, including the extroverts and others.

The others can be universals or other extroverts.

But, if I have extroverts in a tent together, they all need to have exactly two others in the tent.

Wait, if I have a tent with three extroverts, each of them has exactly two others, which satisfies their preference.

Similarly, a tent with one extrovert and two universals also satisfies the extrovert's preference.

So, tents can be:

- One extrovert and two universals.

- Three extroverts.

- Mixed combinations, as long as each tent has exactly three people, and any extrovert in the tent has exactly two others with them.

Now, I need to minimize the number of tents.

To minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, meaning preferentially putting three extroverts in one tent.

But, I also have to consider the universals.

Let me try to formulate this.

Let's say I have 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals.

I need to assign these to tents, where each tent has exactly three people, and each tent contains at least one extrovert, and each extrovert is in a tent with exactly two others.

Wait, no. Actually, the tents can have universals alone as well.

Wait, no. Tents can have:

- One introvert (alone).

- One extrovert and two others (others being universals or extroverts).

- Any combination for universals, but since introverts need to be alone, and extroverts need exactly three people in their tent, the universals can fill in the remaining spots.

Wait, actually, the problem says that among the participants, a are introverts, b are extroverts, and c are universals.

And we need to calculate the number of tents required, considering the preferences.

But the tents can have up to three people, but with the constraints based on the types.

Wait, perhaps I need to separate the tents into those that have extroverts and those that don't.

Tents that have extroverts must have exactly three people, including the extrovert(s).

Tents that don't have extroverts can have one introvert or up to three universals.

But introverts must have their own tent with just one person.

So, the tents can be of the following types:

1. One introvert alone.

2. One extrovert, one universal, and one universal.

3. One extrovert, one extrovert, and one extrovert.

4. One universal alone.

5. One universal and one universal.

Wait, but tents can have up to three people.

So, possible tent configurations are:

- One introvert.

- One universal.

- Two universals.

- Three universals.

- One extrovert and two universals.

- Three extroverts.

And possibly:

- One extrovert, one universal, and one extrovert.

But, in that case, both extroverts need to have exactly two others in their tent, which they do.

So, as long as a tent has at least one extrovert, it must have exactly three people.

If a tent has no extroverts, it can have one or more universals, up to three.

But introverts must have their own tent.

Given that, I need to assign all participants to tents according to these rules.

My goal is to minimize the number of tents.

To minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of participants per tent, considering the constraints.

So, for extroverts, since they need to be in tents with exactly three people, including themselves, I should try to put as many extroverts as possible in the same tent.

Each tent can hold up to three people, so the maximum number of extroverts per tent is three.

So, if I have enough universals, I can put three extroverts in one tent.

But, if I don't have enough universals to fill the required spots, it's impossible.

Wait, no. If I have three extroverts in one tent, that satisfies all three extroverts' preferences, since each has exactly two others in the tent.

So, that's a valid configuration.

Similarly, if I have one extrovert and two universals in a tent, that also satisfies the extrovert's preference.

Now, for the universals, they can be in any tent configuration: alone, with one other, or with two others.

So, they are flexible.

Given that, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts placed in tents with three extroverts, and use universals to fill in any remaining spots.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote the number of tents needed for extroverts as 't'.

Each such tent can have up to three extroverts.

So, the number of extroverts that can be placed in 't' tents is up to 3*t.

But, since each tent with extroverts must have exactly three people, and if there are extroverts in the tent, the tent must have exactly three people.

Wait, no. If a tent has extroverts, it must have exactly three people, regardless of whether they are all extroverts or a mix with universals.

But, if a tent has no extroverts, it can have one or more universals, up to three.

But introverts must have their own tent.

So, for extroverts, to minimize the number of tents, I should maximize the number of tents that have three extroverts.

The remaining extroverts can be placed in tents with two extroverts and one universal, or one extrovert and two universals.

But, wait, if I have a tent with two extroverts and one universal, that would satisfy both extroverts, but I need to make sure that the universal is okay with that.

Since universals are flexible, that's fine.

But, in terms of minimizing tents, it's better to have as many extroverts as possible in tents with three extroverts.

So, let's see.

Let's say I have 'b' extroverts.

I can group them into groups of three, requiring 'ceil(b / 3)' tents.

But, I need to make sure that, if 'b' is not divisible by 3, I have enough universals to fill the remaining spots.

For example, if 'b' modulo 3 is 1, I need two universals to fill the last tent (one extrovert + two universals).

If 'b' modulo 3 is 2, I need one universal to fill the last tent (two extroverts + one universal).

So, in general, if 'b' is not divisible by 3, I need (3 - (b % 3)) universals to fill the last tent.

But, I need to make sure that I have at least that many universals available.

If I don't, then it's impossible, and I should return -1.

Wait, actually, it's a bit different.

Let me think again.

If 'b' modulo 3 is 0, then I can group all extroverts into tents of three, needing 'b / 3' tents.

If 'b' modulo 3 is 1, I need one additional tent with one extrovert and two universals, so total tents are 'floor(b / 3) + 1', but I need at least two universals for that.

Similarly, if 'b' modulo 3 is 2, I need one additional tent with two extroverts and one universal, so I need at least one universal.

So, in general, the number of tents for extroverts is 'ceil((b + c) / 3)', but with the condition that 'c' is sufficient to fill the remaining spots.

Wait, but 'c' can be used in multiple ways.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts as ceil((b + c) / 3), but ensure that c >= (3 - b % 3) if b % 3 != 0.

But, I need to think carefully.

Let me formalize this.

Let's define a function that calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Define 't' as the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

Each such tent can have up to three people, and must have exactly three people if there is at least one extrovert in the tent.

So, to minimize 't', I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, i.e., put as many extroverts as possible in tents of three.

So, the minimal 't' is ceil(b / 3).

But, I need to ensure that, for each tent that has extroverts, the tent has exactly three people.

So, for 't' tents, the number of people in those tents is exactly 3*t.

These 't' tents can have:

- Some tents with three extroverts.

- Some tents with two extroverts and one universal.

- Some tents with one extrovert and two universals.

The total number of extroverts is 'b', and the total number of people in these 't' tents is 3*t.

Therefore, the total number of universals used in these tents is 3*t - b.

This number must be less than or equal to 'c', the number of universals available.

Additionally, after assigning 'b' extroverts and '3*t - b' universals to these 't' tents, the remaining universals can be assigned to additional tents, with up to three per tent.

So, the minimal 't' is ceil(b / 3), and we need to ensure that 3*t - b <= c.

If 3*t - b > c, then it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts with the available universals, and I should return -1.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the remaining universals can be accommodated in additional tents, if needed.

Wait, no. The remaining universals, after assigning some to the extrovert tents, can be placed in their own tents, with up to three per tent.

So, the total number of tents is 't' (for extroverts and some universals) plus ceil((c - (3*t - b)) / 3).

But, to minimize the total number of tents, I should maximize the number of universals assigned to the extrovert tents, up to the limit of 3*t - b.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate 't' as the minimal number of tents required to accommodate 'b' extroverts and as many universals as needed to fill the tents to three people.

Then, the remaining universals can be assigned to additional tents.

So, the minimal 't' is ceil((b + c) / 3), but with the condition that 3*t - b <= c.

Because, in these 't' tents, the number of universals used is 3*t - b, which must be <= c.

If 3*t - b > c, then it's impossible.

Otherwise, the total number of tents is 't' (for extroverts and some universals) plus ceil((c - (3*t - b)) / 3) for the remaining universals.

But, since the remaining universals are c - (3*t - b), and they can be placed in ceil((c - (3*t - b)) / 3) tents.

But, to minimize the total number of tents, I should maximize 't', but 't' is already ceil((b + c) / 3), which is the minimal number of tents needed for 'b' extroverts and 'c' universals.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Let me try to think differently.

First, calculate the number of tents needed for introverts: 'a'.

Then, calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

To minimize the total number of tents, I should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, i.e., put as many extroverts as possible in tents of three.

So, the minimal number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

But, for each of these tents, the number of universals required is 3 - number of extroverts in the tent.

So, for ceil(b / 3) tents:

- If b is divisible by 3, then each tent has three extroverts, and no universals are needed.

- If b % 3 == 1, then one tent will have one extrovert and two universals, and the other tents will have three extroverts each.

- If b % 3 == 2, then one tent will have two extroverts and one universal, and the other tents will have three extroverts each.

So, in general, the number of universals needed is:

- If b % 3 == 0: 0

- If b % 3 == 1: 2

- If b % 3 == 2: 1

And the number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

So, the total number of tents is 'a' (for introverts) plus ceil(b / 3) (for extroverts and some universals), and then additional ceil((c - needed_universals) / 3) tents for the remaining universals.

But, I need to make sure that the needed_universals <= c.

If needed_universals > c, then it's impossible, and I should return -1.

Otherwise, the total number of tents is 'a' + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - needed_universals) / 3).

But, to minimize the total number of tents, I should maximize the number of universals assigned to the extrovert tents, which is already considered in the above calculation.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I considered that the number of tents for extroverts and some universals is ceil((b + c) / 3), with the condition that 3*ceil((b + c)/3) - b <= c.

But, actually, that might not be accurate.

Let me think with an example.

Take the first test case:

a=1, b=2, c=3

So, introverts: 1, extroverts: 2, universals: 3

Number of tents for introverts: 1

For extroverts, b=2, so ceil(2/3)=1 tent.

Needed universals: if b%3==2, needed_universals=1

So, needed_universals=1 <= c=3, okay.

Then, remaining universals: c - needed_universals = 3 - 1 = 2

Additional tents for remaining universals: ceil(2/3)=1 tent.

Total tents: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts and some universals) + 1 (remaining universals) = 3 tents.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

a=1, b=4, c=1

Number of tents for introverts: 1

For extroverts, b=4, ceil(4/3)=2 tents.

Needed universals: b%3==1, needed_universals=2

But c=1 < 2, impossible, so -1.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case:

a=1, b=4, c=2

Number of tents for introverts: 1

For extroverts, b=4, ceil(4/3)=2 tents.

Needed universals: b%3==1, needed_universals=2 <= c=2, okay.

Remaining universals: c - needed_universals = 2 - 2 = 0

Total tents: 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 tents.

Which should match the sample output.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 3.

Yes, that's correct.

Another test case:

a=1, b=1, c=1

Number of tents for introverts: 1

For extroverts, b=1, ceil(1/3)=1 tent.

Needed universals: b%3==1, needed_universals=2

But c=1 < 2, impossible, so -1.

Which matches the sample output.

So, this seems correct.

Therefore, the formula is:

- Tents for introverts: a

- Tents for extroverts and some universals: ceil(b / 3)

- Needed universals: if b % 3 == 0: 0; elif b % 3 == 1: 2; else: 1

- If needed_universals > c, return -1

- Else, remaining universals: c - needed_universals

- Tents for remaining universals: ceil(remaining_universals / 3)

- Total tents: a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(remaining_universals / 3)

But, in the given code, it's different.

Let me look at the given code.

The code defines func_1(extroverts, universals), which returns ceil((extroverts + universals)/3), but with the condition that if extroverts % 3 != 0, then universals must be >= (3 - extroverts % 3).

Otherwise, return None.

Then, func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals) calls func_1 and adds introverts to it, or returns -1 if func_1 returns None.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, that's not entirely correct.

In my reasoning, the number of tents for extroverts and some universals is ceil(b / 3), and needed_universals is determined based on b % 3.

Then, remaining universals are c - needed_universals, and additional tents are ceil(remaining_universals / 3).

So, total tents would be a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - needed_universals)/3).

But in the given code, it's simply introverts + ceil((b + c)/3), if the condition on universals is met.

Wait, but in func_1, it's defined as:

if extroverts % 3 != 0:

if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:

return None

return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

Then, func_2 is introverts + func_1(extroverts, universals), or -1 if func_1 returns None.

So, in the first test case:

b=2, c=3

b % 3 = 2

b % 3 + c = 2 + 3 = 5 >= 3, so func_1 returns ceil((2+3)/3)=ceil(5/3)=2

Then, total tents: a + func_1(b, c) = 1 + 2 = 3, which matches the sample.

In the second test case:

b=4, c=1

b % 3 = 1

b % 3 + c = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so func_1 returns None, thus total tents is -1, matches the sample.

In the third test case:

b=4, c=2

b % 3 = 1

b % 3 + c = 1 + 2 = 3 >= 3, so func_1 returns ceil((4+2)/3)=ceil(6/3)=2

Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3, matches the sample.

In the fourth test case:

b=1, c=1

b % 3 = 1

b % 3 + c = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3, so func_1 returns None, total tents is -1, matches the sample.

In the fifth test case:

b=3, c=2

b % 3 = 0

So, func_1 returns ceil((3+2)/3)=ceil(5/3)=2

Total tents: 1 + 2 = 3, matches the sample.

So, it seems that this approach also works.

But is it equivalent to my earlier reasoning?

In my earlier reasoning, for b=2, c=3:

needed_universals = 1 (since b % 3 == 2)

c - needed_universals = 3 - 1 = 2

additional tents for remaining universals: ceil(2/3)=1

total tents: a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(remaining_universals / 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

In the given code: a + ceil((b + c)/3) = 1 + ceil(5/3)=1 + 2=3

Same result.

For b=4, c=1:

needed_universals = 2 (since b % 3 == 1)

c - needed_universals = 1 - 2 = -1 < 0, impossible, so -1

In the given code: b % 3 + c =1 +1=2 <3, so func_1 returns None, total tents is -1

Same.

For b=4, c=2:

needed_universals=2

c - needed_universals=2-2=0

additional tents for remaining universals=ceil(0/3)=0

total tents=1 + 2 + 0=3

In the given code: a + ceil((4+2)/3)=1 + 2=3

Same.

For b=1, c=1:

needed_universals=2

c - needed_universals=1-2=-1 <0, impossible, so -1

In the given code: b % 3 + c=1+1=2 <3, so -1

Same.

So, it seems that both approaches give the same results.

But I need to ensure that the given code is correct in general.

Let me try to generalize.

In func_1, it checks if b % 3 != 0 and if b % 3 + c < 3, then returns None, else returns ceil((b + c)/3)

Then, func_2 returns a + func_1(b, c), or -1 if func_1 returns None.

Is this equivalent to my earlier reasoning?

In my earlier reasoning, needed_universals is:

if b % 3 == 0: 0

elif b % 3 == 1: 2

elif b % 3 == 2: 1

Then, if needed_universals > c, impossible, else total tents is a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - needed_universals)/3)

But in the given code, it's a + ceil((b + c)/3), with the condition that if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then impossible.

I need to check if these two approaches are equivalent.

Let me consider b and c such that b % 3 == 0:

needed_universals = 0

If b % 3 == 0, func_1 returns ceil((b + c)/3)

Total tents in my approach: a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3)

But ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3) <= ceil((b + c)/3)

Wait, no. Ceil function doesn't work that way.

Wait, actually, ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3) >= ceil((b + c)/3)

But I need to see if a + ceil((b + c)/3) is equal to a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil((c - needed_universals)/3)

Given that needed_universals = 0, it's a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3)

But ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3) >= ceil((b + c)/3)

But they might not be equal.

Wait, for example, b=2, c=1:

ceil(2/3) + ceil(1/3) = 1 + 1 = 2

ceil((2+1)/3)=1

So, 2 > 1

So, in this case, a + ceil(b / 3) + ceil(c / 3) = a + 1 + 1 = a + 2

a + ceil((b + c)/3) = a + 1

So, they are different.

But according to the problem, we need the minimal number of tents.

So, which one is correct?

In this example, b=2, c=1:

Number of tents for extroverts: ceil(2/3)=1 tent.

Needed universals: b % 3 == 2 => needed_universals=1

c - needed_universals=1-1=0

Additional tents for remaining universals: ceil(0/3)=0

Total tents: a + 1 + 0 = a + 1

But according to the code, a + ceil((2+1)/3)=a + 1, which matches.

So, in this case, my earlier reasoning suggested a + 2, but that's incorrect.

So, my earlier reasoning must be flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider how to calculate the total tents.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the extroverts and universals are grouped together in tents of up to three people, with the constraint that any tent with at least one extrovert must have exactly three people.

Tents that have no extroverts can have up to three universals.

So, to minimize the total number of tents, I should maximize the number of people per tent.

Therefore, I should try to fill the tents with three people whenever possible, prioritizing extroverts to be grouped together.

So, the minimal number of tents for extroverts and universals is ceil((b + c)/3), but with the condition that the assignment respects the extroverts' requirements.

So, in func_1, it's checking if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3, then it's impossible to assign the extroverts and universals to tents with the constraints.

Otherwise, it's possible, and the number of tents needed is ceil((b + c)/3)

Then, the total tents are a (for introverts) + ceil((b + c)/3)

Which matches the given code.

Wait, but in my earlier example with b=2, c=1:

ceil((2+1)/3)=1 tent for extroverts and universals.

But, in reality, with b=2, c=1:

- One tent with two extroverts and one universal: satisfies the extroverts' requirement.

- Introverts: a tents.

So, total tents: a + 1, which matches ceil((b + c)/3)

Hence, the given code seems correct.

Another example: b=4, c=1

ceil((4+1)/3)=ceil(5/3)=2 tents.

But, needed_universals=2 (since b % 3 ==1), but c=1 < 2, impossible.

Hence, func_1 returns None, total tents is -1, which matches.

Another example: b=4, c=2

ceil((4+2)/3)=ceil(6/3)=2 tents.

needed_universals=2 <= c=2, possible.

Total tents: a + 2.

Which matches.

Hence, the given code seems correct.

So, I think the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants with specific preferences for the hike. The participants include introverts, extroverts, and universals, each with different requirements for tent occupancy.

### Approach

1. **Introverts:** Each introvert needs their own tent and must be alone in it.
2. **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must share a tent with exactly two other people, who can be universals or other extroverts.
3. **Universals:** They can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.

The strategy is to:
- Assign one tent per introvert.
- Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals together, ensuring that each extrovert's tent has exactly three people.
- Ensure there are enough universals to satisfy the tent configurations for extroverts.

### Solution Code

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

test_case_n = int(input())
for _ in range(test_case_n):
    introverts, extroverts, universals = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))
```

### Explanation

1. **func_1 Function:**
   - Determines if it is possible to arrange extroverts and universals into tents such that each extrovert is in a tent with exactly two others.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.
   - Returns the ceiling of the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals divided by 3.

2. **func_2 Function:**
   - Computes the total number of tents required by adding the number of introverts (each needing their own tent) to the number of tents calculated by `func_1`.
   - If it is impossible to arrange extroverts and universals (as determined by `func_1` returning `None`), returns -1.

3. **Main Code:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads the counts of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - Prints the result using `func_2`.

This approach ensures that all preferences are satisfied while minimizing the number of tents used.
