Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either has a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block with no free cells between them, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what a "single block without any free cells between them" means. It means that all the chips should be consecutive without any zeros (free cells) in between. For example, if I have chips at positions 1, 2, and 4, I need to move the chip at position 4 to position 3 to make it 1, 2, 3.

Now, let's think about how to approach this. I need to minimize the number of operations, which means I should find the most efficient way to rearrange the chips into a consecutive block.

One way to think about this is to find the optimal position for the block of chips. Since I can only move chips to the left, I need to decide where to place the block on the ribbon.

Let me consider the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips. The block should span from some position L to L + k - 1, where k is the number of chips.

I need to choose L such that the number of operations to move all chips into this block is minimized.

Wait, but since I can only move chips to the left, the position of the block is constrained by the positions of the chips.

Let me try to think differently. Since I can only move chips to the left, the rightmost chip cannot be moved, as there are no free cells to its right. So, I should consider the rightmost chip as the end of the block.

But no, actually, I can choose any chip to move, as long as there's a free cell to its left.

Wait, maybe I should find the leftmost position where I can place all the chips without any gaps.

Let me consider an example to understand better.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 8

a = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

I need to move the chips so that there are no gaps between them.

In this case, the chips are at positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.

I can move the chip at position 7 to position 5, since position 5 is free.

Now, the chips are at positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

This is a single block from 2 to 6 with no gaps.

It took only one operation.

So, the answer is 1.

Another example:

n = 6

a = [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Here, there's only one chip at position 2.

Since it's the only chip, it's already a block with no gaps.

So, the answer is 0.

Another example:

n = 6

a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

All cells have chips, so it's already a single block.

Answer is 0.

Another example:

n = 5

a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Chips at positions 1, 3, 5.

I need to move the chip at position 5 to position 2 and the chip at position 3 stays or moves to position 4.

Wait, if I move the chip from position 5 to position 2, which is free, then positions 2 and 3 have chips.

Then, I need to move the chip from position 3 to position 4.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

Maybe I should find the number of gaps between the chips and fill those gaps by moving the rightmost chips to the left.

But, in the first example, there was one gap, and the answer is one operation.

Wait, but in the first example, there were two gaps: between position 4 and 6, and between position 7 and 8.

But only one operation was needed.

Wait, no. The chips are at positions 2,3,4,6,7.

So, the gaps are at positions 5 and 8.

But, to make a single block, I need to fill the gap at position 5 by moving the chip from position 7 to position 5.

Then, all chips are at positions 2,3,4,5,6.

So, one operation.

Another way to look at it is that the number of operations needed is equal to the number of gaps that need to be filled.

But, in this case, there was only one gap to fill (position 5), even though there was another free position at 8.

But, since position 8 is beyond the rightmost chip, it doesn't affect the block.

So, perhaps the number of operations is equal to the number of gaps within the range of the leftmost to the rightmost chip.

Wait, but in the third example, all cells have chips, so no gaps, answer is 0.

In the second example, only one chip, no gaps, answer is 0.

In the fourth example, chips at 1,3,5.

To make a single block, I need to move the chip from 5 to position 2 and the chip from 3 to position 4.

So, two operations.

Which makes sense because there are two gaps: between 1 and 3, and between 3 and 5.

But, in this case, moving the chip from 5 to 2 fills one gap, and moving the chip from 3 to 4 fills another gap.

So, it seems like the number of operations is equal to the number of gaps that need to be filled.

But, I need to confirm this.

Another way to think about it is to find the desired positions for the chips and see how many moves are needed to place them there.

But, I need to find the minimal number of operations.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where the block should be placed to minimize the number of operations.

Maybe the block should be placed as far to the left as possible.

Let's consider that.

In the first example, the chips are at 2,3,4,6,7.

If I move the chip at 7 to 5, then I have chips at 2,3,4,5,6.

That's a block from 2 to 6.

Alternatively, I could move the chip at 6 to 5 and the chip at 7 to 6, but that would take two operations, which is more than necessary.

So, moving the chip from 7 to 5 is more efficient.

So, perhaps moving the rightmost chip to the left is a better strategy.

Wait, but I can only move chips to the closest free cell to the left.

So, in that operation, I have to move it to the nearest free cell to the left.

I can't choose to move it further left in one operation.

Wait, but the operation allows me to move a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

So, in each operation, I can only move a chip to the nearest free cell to the left.

That might limit how far I can move the chip in one operation.

Wait, but in the first example, moving the chip from 7 to 5 is allowed because 5 is the closest free cell to the left.

Similarly, if I have multiple free cells between chips, I can move the chip to the closest free cell to the left.

So, perhaps I need to identify the positions where the chips should be in the final block and calculate how many operations are needed to move each chip to its final position.

But, I need to do this in a way that minimizes the total number of operations.

Wait, but since I can only move chips to the left, and I can choose which chip to move each time, I need to find a sequence of moves that achieves the block with the fewest operations.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let me consider the positions of the chips.

Suppose I have chips at positions p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 < p2 < ... < pk.

I need to move these chips to a block of k consecutive positions.

I need to choose the starting position for this block, say from L to L + k - 1.

Then, for each chip, I need to move it to one of these positions, but only by moving it to the left.

I need to minimize the number of moves.

Wait, but since I can only move chips to the left, I need to choose L such that L <= p1 and L + k - 1 >= p1.

Wait, no, L can be up to p1, but I need to make sure that all chips can be moved to positions L to L + k - 1 by moving them to the left.

So, L can be from 1 to p1.

Given that, I need to choose L such that the number of operations is minimized.

Each operation consists of moving one chip to the closest free cell to the left.

Wait, but in reality, each operation allows me to move one chip to the closest free cell to the left, and I can perform this operation any number of times.

But I need to do it in such a way that after all operations, the chips form a single block.

I need to find the minimal number of such operations.

This seems a bit confusing.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of the final positions of the chips.

I need to have k consecutive positions filled with chips.

I need to choose which k consecutive positions to have the chips in.

Then, for each chip, I need to move it to its final position, but only by moving it to the left, and in each operation, moving it to the closest free cell to the left.

Wait, but this might not be the most straightforward way to think about it.

Let me try to think about it differently.

Suppose I have chips at positions p1, p2, ..., pk.

I need to move them to k consecutive positions, say from L to L + k - 1.

I need to choose L such that L <= p1 and L + k - 1 <= pn.

Wait, no, pn is the rightmost chip.

I need L + k - 1 <= n.

But I need to make sure that all chips can be moved to positions L to L + k - 1 by moving them only to the left.

So, for each pi, I can move it to any position <= pi, as long as there are free cells in between.

But I need to do it in steps, where each step moves one chip to the closest free cell to the left.

This seems a bit too involved.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me look at the example again.

In the first example:

n = 8

a = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]

Chips at positions 2,3,4,6,7.

I can move the chip at position 7 to position 5, which is free.

Now, chips are at 2,3,4,5,6.

This is a block from 2 to 6.

It took one operation.

Alternatively, I could have moved the chip at position 6 to position 5, and then the chip at position 7 to position 6.

That would take two operations.

But the minimal number is one.

So, the minimal number of operations is the minimal number of gaps that need to be filled.

Wait, but in this case, there was only one gap to fill (position 5), which was done in one operation.

Similarly, in the fourth example:

n = 5

a = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]

Chips at positions 1,3,5.

To make a block, say from 1 to 3:

Move the chip from 5 to 2 and the chip from 3 stays or moves to 4, but 4 is outside the range.

Wait, n=5, positions 1 to 5.

If I move the chip from 5 to 2, then positions 1,2,3 have chips.

That's a block from 1 to 3.

But position 2 was previously free, so I need to make sure that when I move the chip from 5 to 2, position 2 is free.

Yes, it is, so that's allowed.

Similarly, if I choose to move the chip from 5 to 2, that's one operation.

Now, I have chips at 1,2,3,5.

Wait, no, after moving the chip from 5 to 2, the positions are 1,2,3, and 5 is free.

Then, I need to move the chip from 3 to 4, but position 4 was free.

Wait, but position 4 is beyond the rightmost chip that I have after the first move.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Maybe another approach is needed.

Let me think about the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

In the first example, leftmost chip at 2, rightmost at 7.

Between 2 and 7, there are positions 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Chips are at 2,3,4,6,7.

So, free position is 5.

Number of free positions between leftmost and rightmost chips is 1.

And the number of operations needed is 1.

Similarly, in the fourth example, leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5.

Positions 1,2,3,4,5.

Chips at 1,3,5.

Free positions are 2 and 4.

Number of free positions is 2.

Number of operations needed is 2.

Another example:

n=9

a=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Chips at 2,3,7,8.

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8.

Positions 2 to 8: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Chips at 2,3,7,8.

Free positions are 4,5,6.

Number of free positions is 3.

In the example, the answer is 3.

So, it seems that the number of operations needed is equal to the number of free positions between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

That seems to be a pattern.

Let me verify this with previous examples.

First example:

Free positions between leftmost and rightmost: position 5.

Number of free positions: 1.

Number of operations: 1.

Second example:

n=6

a=[0,1,0,0,0,0]

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 2.

No free positions between them (since leftmost and rightmost are the same).

Number of free positions: 0.

Number of operations: 0.

Third example:

n=6

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1]

No free positions between leftmost and rightmost.

Number of operations: 0.

Fourth example:

n=5

a=[1,0,1,0,1]

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5.

Free positions between them: 2 and 4.

Number of free positions: 2.

Number of operations: 2.

Fifth example:

n=9

a=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8.

Free positions between them: 4,5,6.

Number of free positions: 3.

Number of operations: 3.

So, in all these examples, the number of operations needed is equal to the number of free positions between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Therefore, the solution seems to be to count the number of free positions between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

So, in the program, we need to find the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips, then count the number of zeros between them.

But, we need to be careful about the boundaries.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, for each test case:

- Read n and the array a of size n.

- Find the leftmost chip (first 1 from the left).

- Find the rightmost chip (first 1 from the right).

- Count the number of zeros between these two positions, inclusive.

Wait, no, exclusive, because the leftmost and rightmost positions are occupied by chips.

But, in the first example, leftmost is 2, rightmost is 7, and between them are positions 3 to 6.

Wait, positions 2 to 7.

Chips are at 2,3,4,6,7.

Free position is 5.

So, number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost is 1.

Similarly, in the fourth example, leftmost is 1, rightmost is 5.

Positions 1 to 5.

Chips at 1,3,5.

Free positions are 2 and 4.

So, number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost is 2.

Hence, it seems that we need to count the number of zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chip positions, inclusive of the boundaries.

Wait, but in the first example, position 2 and 7 are occupied, so perhaps it's between leftmost and rightmost, exclusive.

Wait, but in the first example, positions 3,4,5,6 are considered.

Among these, only position 5 is free.

So, if we count the number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost, exclusive, it matches.

Similarly, in the fourth example, positions 2,3,4,5.

Chips at 1,3,5.

So, positions 2 and 4 are free.

Hence, number of zeros between leftmost and rightmost, exclusive, is 2.

This seems consistent.

Hence, the number of operations needed is equal to the number of free positions between the leftmost and rightmost chips, exclusive.

So, in the program, we need to:

- Find the leftmost chip.

- Find the rightmost chip.

- Count the number of zeros between them, exclusive.

Let me see how this relates to the given program.

The given program does the following:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the array a.

- Remove leading zeros.

- Remove trailing zeros.

- Count the number of zeros in the remaining array.

- Print the count.

Wait, this seems to be implementing exactly what I just thought.

Let me verify with the first example.

First example:

n=8

a=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Remove leading zero: a becomes [1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

Remove trailing zero: a becomes [1,1,1,0,1,1]

Count the number of zeros in this array: there is one zero.

Hence, output is 1.

Which matches the example.

Second example:

n=6

a=[0,1,0,0,0,0]

Remove leading zero: a becomes [1,0,0,0,0]

Remove trailing zeros: a becomes [1]

Count the number of zeros: zero.

Hence, output is 0.

Third example:

n=6

a=[1,1,1,1,1,1]

Remove leading zeros: none.

Remove trailing zeros: none.

Count the number of zeros: zero.

Hence, output is 0.

Fourth example:

n=5

a=[1,0,1,0,1]

Remove leading zeros: none.

Remove trailing zeros: none.

Array remains [1,0,1,0,1]

Count the number of zeros: two.

Hence, output is 2.

Fifth example:

n=9

a=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Remove leading zero: a becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

Remove trailing zero: a becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Count the number of zeros: three.

Hence, output is 3.

Which matches the example.

So, the program seems to be correct.

But let me make sure I understand why this works.

By removing leading zeros, we are essentially ignoring any free positions before the leftmost chip.

By removing trailing zeros, we are ignoring any free positions after the rightmost chip.

Then, counting the number of zeros in between gives us the number of free positions between the leftmost and rightmost chips, exclusive.

Which, as per my earlier reasoning, is equal to the minimum number of operations needed.

Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
