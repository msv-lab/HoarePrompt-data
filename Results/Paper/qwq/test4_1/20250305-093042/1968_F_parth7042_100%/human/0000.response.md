Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array of numbers, and we need to handle multiple queries where each query gives us a range [l, r] in the array. We need to determine if the subarray from a_l to a_r is "interesting" based on a specific condition.

The definition of an "interesting" array is that it can be divided into k > 1 parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. So, we need to split the subarray into consecutive segments, and the XOR of each segment should be the same.

First, I need to understand what XOR means. XOR is a bitwise operation where the bits of the numbers are compared, and the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For example, 1 XOR 1 is 0, and 1 XOR 0 is 1.

So, for the subarray a_l to a_r, I need to check if it's possible to split it into at least two consecutive parts where each part's XOR is equal.

Let me look at the example provided:

Array: [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]

Queries:

1. [1,5]: The whole array. It's shown that it can be split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], and all these parts have XOR equal to 1.

2. [2,4]: [1,2,3]. It's mentioned that it can be split into [1,2] and [3], both having XOR equal to 3.

3. [3,5]: [2,3,0]. XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1. But it's said to be not interesting.

4. [1,3]: [1,1,2]. XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 2. Not interesting.

5. [3,4]: [2,3]. XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1. Not interesting.

From this, it seems that for the subarray to be interesting, it must be possible to split it into at least two parts with equal XOR.

I need to find an efficient way to handle multiple queries on the array, given that n and q can be up to 2*10^5, which is quite large. So, I need an O(n log n) or O(q log n) solution, something that can handle large inputs efficiently.

Let me think about prefix XORs. If I compute the prefix XOR array, where pf[i] is the XOR of all elements from a1 to ai, then the XOR of any subarray from l to r is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

So, for the subarray [l,r], its XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

Now, for the subarray to be interesting, I need to split it into at least two parts where each part has the same XOR value.

Let's denote the XOR value of each part as x. So, if I split the subarray into k parts, each having XOR equal to x, then the total XOR of the subarray would be x XOR x XOR ... XOR x (k times). If k is even, this would be 0, and if k is odd, it would be x.

Wait a minute, that's an important observation.

If k is even, the total XOR is 0, and if k is odd, it's x.

So, in the query, if the XOR of the subarray [l,r] is 0, that means k is even, and each part has some XOR x, but since total XOR is 0, k must be even.

But the problem allows k > 1, which includes both even and odd k.

Wait, no. If k is 2, which is even, and each part has XOR x, then total XOR is 0. If k is 3, which is odd, total XOR is x.

So, in general, for the subarray to be interesting, either:

- The total XOR is 0, which implies that it can be split into an even number of parts with equal XOR.

- Or, the total XOR is x, and it can be split into an odd number of parts, each with XOR x.

But, in the example, for [1,5], the total XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1. It's split into three parts, each with XOR 1.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, if k is odd and total XOR is x, then it's possible.

But in the solution code, I see that if the total XOR is 0, it directly answers "YES". Otherwise, it does some checks with bisect_left on some lists.

So, perhaps there's a way to precompute the positions where the prefix XOR equals a certain value and use that to check for the possibility of splitting.

Let me look at the code provided.

The code reads all input at once and splits it into a list called data. Then it processes the test cases one by one.

For each test case:

- It reads n (number of elements) and q (number of queries).

- It reads the array a_1 to a_n.

- It computes the prefix XOR array pf, where pf[i] is the XOR of the first i elements.

- It uses a dictionary mp to map each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

- For each query [l,r], it computes the XOR of the subarray [l,r] as pf[r] XOR pf[l-1].

- If this XOR is 0, it directly answers "YES".

- Otherwise, it looks up the lists of indices where pf[r] and pf[l-1] occur.

- It uses bisect_left to find positions in these lists and checks some conditions to decide whether to answer "YES" or "NO".

I need to understand why this works.

First, if the XOR of the subarray [l,r] is 0, it means that the subarray can be split into an even number of parts, each with some XOR x, and the total XOR is 0. So, it's directly "YES".

If the XOR is not 0, say it's x, then we need to check if there exists at least one split point in the subarray where the XOR up to that point is equal to x, and the remaining part also has XOR x.

Wait, more carefully:

Suppose the subarray [l,r] has XOR x. We need to check if there exists at least one way to split it into k > 1 parts where each part has XOR x.

If k = 2, then we need to split the subarray into two parts, each with XOR x. Since the total XOR would be x XOR x = 0, but our subarray XOR is x, which is not 0, so k cannot be 2.

If k = 3, then the total XOR would be x XOR x XOR x = x, which matches our subarray XOR.

So, for k odd, total XOR is x, and for k even, it's 0.

Therefore, for subarrays with XOR x != 0, we need to check if we can split them into an odd number of parts, each with XOR x.

But how do we check that efficiently?

The code seems to be checking if there exists some index i in [l,r] such that pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = x and pf[r] XOR pf[i] = x.

Wait, let's think differently.

If we have the subarray [l,r] with XOR x, and we want to split it into parts where each part has XOR x.

Suppose we have a split at position i, where l <= i < r, into [l,i] and [i+1,r].

Then, we need pf[i] XOR pf[l-1] = x and pf[r] XOR pf[i] = x.

So, pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR x, and pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

Therefore, pf[l-1] XOR x = pf[r] XOR x, which simplifies to pf[l-1] = pf[r].

But that's only possible if pf[l-1] = pf[r], which would imply that the subarray [l,r] has XOR 0, which contradicts our assumption that x != 0.

So, that approach seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to consider multiple splits.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r] with XOR x, I need to find positions l = p0 < p1 < p2 < ... < pk = r+1, such that for each 0 <= j < k, the XOR from p_j to p_{j+1}-1 is x.

Wait, indices are from 1 to n, so perhaps p0 = l, p1, ..., pk = r+1.

And for each j, pf[p_{j+1}-1] XOR pf[p_j - 1] = x.

Wait, pf[p_{j+1}-1] XOR pf[p_j -1] is the XOR of the subarray [p_j, p_{j+1}-1], which should be equal to x.

So, we need pf[p_{j+1}-1] XOR pf[p_j -1] = x for all j.

Given that, perhaps there is a way to find such p_j's.

But this seems complicated.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be checking for the existence of some index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR x and pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

Wait, in the code, for x != 0, it does:

v1 = mp[pf[r]]

v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]

it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)

it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:

results.append('YES')

else:

results.append('NO')

So, mp is a dictionary mapping each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where that XOR value occurs.

pf[r] is the prefix XOR up to r.

pf[l - 1] is the prefix XOR up to l - 1.

The XOR of the subarray [l,r] is pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1].

If this XOR is 0, it's directly "YES".

Else, it looks for indices in the lists where pf[r] and pf[l - 1] occur, within the range [l,r], and checks some conditions.

I need to understand why this works.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r] to be split into parts with equal XOR x, the prefix XOR values at the split points should satisfy certain conditions.

Suppose x is the common XOR for each part.

Then, for the subarray [l,r], with pf[l-1] being the prefix XOR before the subarray, and pf[r] being the prefix XOR at the end of the subarray.

The total XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l-1] = x.

Now, if there exists an index i in [l,r] such that pf[i] = pf[l-1] XOR x, then the subarray [l,i] has XOR x, and the remaining subarray [i+1,r] has XOR pf[r] XOR pf[i] = pf[r] XOR (pf[l-1] XOR x) = (pf[r] XOR pf[l-1]) XOR x = x XOR x = 0.

So, if I can find such an i where [l,i] has XOR x and [i+1,r] has XOR 0, that would mean the subarray [l,r] can be split into two parts: one with XOR x and one with XOR 0.

But, for the subarray to be interesting, I need to split it into k > 1 parts with each having XOR x.

Wait, but if one part has XOR 0, that's not equal to x (since x != 0).

So, that doesn't seem right.

Perhaps I need to find multiple split points.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the subarray [l,r] with XOR x.

I need to split it into parts where each part has XOR x.

So, if I can find a split point i where the XOR from l to i is x, and the XOR from i+1 to r is also x, then I can split it into two parts, each with XOR x.

But, the XOR from i+1 to r should also be x, which means pf[r] XOR pf[i] = x.

So, pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

Similarly, pf[i] should also be equal to pf[l - 1] XOR x.

Because pf[i] XOR pf[l - 1] = x.

So, pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x.

Therefore, for such a split to exist, there must be an index i where pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x and pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

Which implies that pf[l - 1] XOR x = pf[r] XOR x, which simplifies to pf[l - 1] = pf[r].

But, if pf[l - 1] = pf[r], then pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1] = 0, meaning the subarray [l,r] has XOR 0.

But in this case, the code already handles it by directly answering "YES" when the subarray XOR is 0.

So, in the case where subarray XOR is not 0, pf[l - 1] != pf[r], so pf[l - 1] XOR x != pf[r] XOR x, which seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider multiple split points.

Suppose I split the subarray [l,r] into more than two parts.

For example, for k=3, I need to split it into three parts, each with XOR x.

So, I need to find two split points i and j where l <= i < j <= r, such that:

- XOR from l to i is x

- XOR from i+1 to j is x

- XOR from j+1 to r is x

Which translates to:

pf[i] XOR pf[l - 1] = x => pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x

pf[j] XOR pf[i] = x => pf[j] = pf[i] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l - 1]

pf[r] XOR pf[j] = x => pf[r] = pf[j] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x

So, pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x

Therefore, for k=3, pf[r] should be equal to pf[l - 1] XOR x.

But x is pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1], so pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR (pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1]) = pf[r].

Which is always true, but that doesn't help much.

This seems confusing.

Let me look back at the code.

It seems to be checking if there exists an index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x and pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

But as we saw, pf[l - 1] XOR x = pf[r], assuming pf[r] XOR x = pf[l - 1].

But if pf[l - 1] != pf[r], which is the case when x != 0, then this condition can't be satisfied.

So, perhaps there's another way to interpret this.

Maybe the code is checking for the existence of an index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and there exists another index j > i where pf[j] = pf[i] XOR x, and so on, until r.

But that seems too involved for an O(1) per query solution.

Wait, perhaps prefix XOR values can help in determining the number of times a particular XOR value appears, and thus infer if splits are possible.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r], with XOR x, to be split into k parts with each part having XOR x, then the total XOR would be x if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

But in our case, the total XOR is x, so k must be odd.

So, k >= 3, since k > 1 and k is odd.

Wait, k can be 3,5,7,....

But in the example, for [1,5], k=3, with each part having XOR 1.

For [2,4], k=2, which is even, but total XOR would be 0, but in this case, it's k=2 with each part having XOR 3, but 3 XOR 3 = 0, which doesn't match the subarray XOR, which is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

Wait, in the second query [2,4]: [1,2,3]

XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

So, it's possible to split into k=2 parts, each with XOR x=3, since 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches the total XOR.

Wait, but according to the earlier logic, if k is even, total XOR should be 0, which it is in this case.

But in the problem statement, it's said that k > 1, and y1 = y2 = ... = yk.

So, for [2,4], it's possible to split into [1,2] and [3], each with XOR 3, which satisfies the condition.

Similarly, for [1,5], it's split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

Wait, but [1], [1], [2,3,0] has k=3, which is odd, and total XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which matches the subarray XOR.

But in [2,4], k=2, which is even, and total XOR is 0, which matches the subarray XOR.

So, the condition seems to hold.

Therefore, in general, for a subarray with XOR x, it can be split into k > 1 parts with each part having XOR x, where k is odd if x != 0, and k is even if x == 0.

Wait, no, in the [2,4] case, x=0, and k=2 is even.

In [1,5], x=1, and k=3 is odd.

So, the rule is: if x == 0, k must be even; if x != 0, k must be odd.

But in the code, if x == 0, it directly answers "YES".

Otherwise, it does some checks.

But I need to find a way to check if for x != 0, there exists a split into k odd parts with each part having XOR x.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for x != 0, I need to find at least one split point i in [l,r] such that the XOR from l to i is x, and the XOR from i+1 to r is also x.

But as we saw earlier, for that, pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

Which implies pf[l - 1] XOR x = pf[r] XOR x, which simplifies to pf[l - 1] = pf[r].

But if pf[l - 1] = pf[r], then pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1] = 0, meaning x = 0, which contradicts x != 0.

So, in this case, such a split is not possible.

Therefore, for x != 0, it's only possible to split the subarray into an odd number of parts, each with XOR x, if there are multiple indices where the prefix XOR equals pf[l - 1] XOR x.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for the number of times pf[l - 1] XOR x appears in the prefix XOR array within [l,r].

If it appears at least twice, perhaps that indicates multiple splits.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

I recall that in problems involving XOR and splits, prefix XOR values and their frequencies are often used.

Maybe I can think in terms of the frequency of prefix XOR values.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that for the subarray [l,r] to be split into k parts with each part having XOR x, the prefix XOR values at the split points must satisfy certain conditions.

Let me consider that between l-1 and r, there must be at least k positions where the prefix XOR equals pf[l - 1] XOR x, pf[l - 1] XOR x XOR x, and so on.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix l and r, and I need to check if the subarray [l,r] can be split into k > 1 parts with each part having XOR x.

Let me consider that the number of split points where the XOR up to that point is equal to x is important.

Wait, perhaps I can count the number of times pf[i] equals pf[l - 1] XOR x within the range [l,r].

If there are at least two such indices, then I can split the subarray into at least two parts with XOR x.

But I need to ensure that the splits are consecutive and cover the entire subarray.

This seems complicated.

Let me look back at the code again.

It seems to be checking if there exists an index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x and pf[i] = pf[r] XOR x.

But as we saw, pf[l - 1] XOR x = pf[r], assuming pf[r] XOR x = pf[l - 1].

But if pf[l - 1] != pf[r], which is the case when x != 0, then this condition can't be satisfied.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Let me look at the specific lines:

v1 = mp[pf[r]]

v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]

it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)

it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:

results.append('YES')

else:

results.append('NO')

So, v1 is the list of indices where pf[i] = pf[r]

v2 is the list of indices where pf[i] = pf[l - 1]

it1 is the first index in v1 that is >= l

it2 is the last index in v2 that is < r

Then, it checks if v1[it1] < v2[it2]

If so, "YES", else "NO"

I need to understand why this condition determines if the subarray is interesting.

Let me consider that v1 contains indices where pf[i] = pf[r]

Similarly, v2 contains indices where pf[i] = pf[l - 1]

If I can find an index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[r], and an index j in [l,r) where pf[j] = pf[l - 1], and i < j, then perhaps that indicates a split.

But wait, pf[i] = pf[r] implies that the subarray [i+1,r] has XOR 0.

Similarly, pf[j] = pf[l - 1] implies that the subarray [l,j] has XOR 0.

But I'm not sure how this relates to splitting the subarray into parts with equal XOR.

Maybe I need to consider that for the subarray [l,r] to be split into k parts with equal XOR x, there must be at least k-1 split points where the XOR up to that point is equal to m*x for some integer m.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that for the subarray [l,r], with XOR x, to be split into k parts with each part having XOR x, then k must divide the length of the subarray in a certain way.

But XOR is not directly related to the length of the subarray.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of times the prefix XOR equals a certain value indicates the number of possible splits.

But I'm still not getting it.

Let me look for a different perspective.

Suppose I have the subarray [l,r], and I want to split it into k parts with each part having XOR x.

Then, the total XOR is k*x if k is odd, and 0 if k is even.

So, if k is odd, total XOR is x, else it's 0.

Therefore, for x != 0, k must be odd, and total XOR is x.

For x == 0, k must be even, and total XOR is 0.

So, in the code, when x == 0, it directly answers "YES", assuming that it's possible to split the subarray into an even number of parts with each part having XOR 0.

But is that always true?

Wait, splitting a subarray with XOR 0 into an even number of parts, each with XOR 0, is not always possible.

For example, if the subarray has XOR 0, but no intermediate splits have XOR 0, then it's not possible to split it into multiple parts with XOR 0.

Wait, for example, consider [2,2], which has XOR 0. It can be split into [2] and [2], each with XOR 2, but that doesn't match the required XOR 0 for each part.

Wait, but according to the problem, y1 = y2 = ... = yk, which should be 0 in this case.

So, in this example, it's not possible to split [2,2] into parts with each part having XOR 0.

Hence, the code might be incorrect in directly answering "YES" when x == 0.

Wait, but in the first test case, query [1,5] has XOR 1, which is x=1, and it's split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

Query [2,4] has XOR 0, and it's split into [1,2] and [3], each with XOR 3, which is not equal to x=0.

Wait, that seems inconsistent.

Wait, in the second query [2,4]: [1,2,3], it's split into [1,2] and [3], each with XOR 3.

But the total XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, and each part has XOR 3, which is not equal to the total XOR.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, the problem says that y1 = y2 = ... = yk, where y_i is the XOR of each part.

In the second query, [1,2,3], split into [1,2] and [3], each has XOR 3, so y1 = y2 = 3.

But the total XOR is y1 XOR y2 = 3 XOR 3 = 0, which matches the subarray XOR.

So, it's valid.

Similarly, in the first query [1,1,2,3,0], split into [1], [1], [2,3,0], each with XOR 1.

Total XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, which matches the subarray XOR.

So, the condition is satisfied.

Hence, for x == 0, it's possible to split into k even parts, each with XOR x=0.

But in reality, as in the [2,2] example, it's not always possible.

Wait, [2,2], XOR is 0.

If I split it into [2] and [2], each has XOR 2, which is not equal to x=0.

So, it's not a valid split.

Hence, the subarray [2,2] is not interesting.

But according to the code, if x == 0, it directly answers "YES", which would be incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps I need to refine my understanding.

Let me look for a different approach.

I found that in problems involving XOR and splits, it's useful to look for the frequency of prefix XOR values.

In this problem, for a subarray [l,r], with XOR x, to be split into k parts with each part having XOR x, we need to have that the prefix XOR values at the split points are equal to pf[l - 1] XOR x.

So, for example, if we have split points at positions p1, p2, ..., pk-1, then pf[p1] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, pf[p2] = pf[p1] XOR x, and so on.

Wait, more carefully:

If we have split points at p1, p2, ..., pk-1, then for each part [l, p1], [p1 + 1, p2], ..., [pk-1 + 1, r], each should have XOR x.

So, pf[p1] XOR pf[l - 1] = x => pf[p1] = pf[l - 1] XOR x

pf[p2] XOR pf[p1] = x => pf[p2] = pf[p1] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l - 1]

pf[p3] XOR pf[p2] = x => pf[p3] = pf[p2] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x

And so on.

So, the prefix XOR values at the split points alternate between pf[l - 1] and pf[l - 1] XOR x.

Wait, in the case of k=2, pf[p1] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and pf[r] XOR pf[p1] = x => pf[r] = pf[p1] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l - 1]

So, pf[r] = pf[l - 1], which implies that the subarray XOR is pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1] = 0, which matches the earlier observation that for k even, total XOR is 0.

Similarly, for k=3, pf[p1] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, pf[p2] = pf[p1] XOR x = pf[l - 1], pf[r] = pf[p2] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x

So, pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, which matches the total XOR x.

Hence, for k odd, pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and for k even, pf[r] = pf[l - 1]

So, in general, for the subarray to be interesting, we need to have that pf[r] equals pf[l - 1] XOR x if k is odd, and pf[l - 1] if k is even.

But x is the total XOR of the subarray, which is pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1].

So, for k even, pf[r] should equal pf[l - 1]

For k odd, pf[r] should equal pf[l - 1] XOR x

Wait, but x = pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1]

So, pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR (pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1]) = pf[r]

Which is tautological.

So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the subarray to be interesting, there must be at least one way to split it into k > 1 parts with each part having XOR x.

Given that, and the relations above, perhaps I can check if there exists at least one index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and pf[r] = pf[i] XOR x.

Wait, but as we saw earlier, pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and pf[r] = pf[i] XOR x = pf[l - 1] XOR x XOR x = pf[l - 1]

So, pf[r] should equal pf[l - 1], which is only possible if x = 0.

Hence, for x != 0, it's impossible to split the subarray into k=2 parts with each having XOR x.

Similarly, for k=3, pf[r] should equal pf[l - 1] XOR x.

But pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, which is consistent.

Hence, for x != 0, we need to have pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x.

But in the code, it seems to be checking for the existence of indices i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[r] and pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x.

But pf[i] can't be equal to both pf[r] and pf[l - 1] XOR x unless pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x.

Which, for x != 0, is possible only if pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x.

But, in general, pf[r] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, since x = pf[r] XOR pf[l - 1]

So, the condition seems always true, but I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the code is checking if there exists an index i in [l,r] where pf[i] = pf[l - 1] XOR x, and another index j > i where pf[j] = pf[r].

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

Array: [1,1,2,3,0]

pf:

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

pf[3] = 0 XOR 2 = 2

pf[4] = 2 XOR 3 = 1

pf[5] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

mp:

0: [0,2]

1: [1,4,5]

2: [3]

Query [1,5]: l=1, r=5

x = pf[5] XOR pf[1 - 1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

So, x != 0

v1 = mp[pf[5]] = mp[1] = [1,4,5]

v2 = mp[pf[1 - 1]] = mp[0] = [0,2]

it1 = bisect_left(v1, 1) = 0

it2 = bisect_left(v2, 5) - 1 = bisect_left([0,2],5) = 2, minus 1 is 1

So, v1[0] = 1 < v2[1] = 2, which is true, so "YES"

Which matches the first query.

Second query [2,4]: l=2, r=4

x = pf[4] XOR pf[2 - 1] = 1 XOR 1 = 0

So, x == 0, directly "YES"

Which matches the second query.

Third query [3,5]: l=3, r=5

x = pf[5] XOR pf[3 - 1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

v1 = mp[pf[5]] = mp[1] = [1,4,5]

v2 = mp[pf[3 - 1]] = mp[0] = [0,2]

it1 = bisect_left(v1, 3) = 2 (since v1[2]=5 >=3)

it2 = bisect_left(v2,5) -1 = 2 -1 =1

So, v1[2]=5 < v2[1]=2 is false (5 < 2 is false), so "NO"

Which matches the third query.

Fourth query [1,3]: l=1, r=3

x = pf[3] XOR pf[1 - 1] = 2 XOR 0 = 2

v1 = mp[pf[3]] = mp[2] = [3]

v2 = mp[pf[1 - 1]] = mp[0] = [0,2]

it1 = bisect_left(v1,1) = 0 (v1[0]=3 >=1)

it2 = bisect_left(v2,3) -1 = 1 -1 =0

So, v1[0]=3 < v2[0]=0 is false (3 < 0 is false), so "NO"

Which matches the fourth query.

Fifth query [3,4]: l=3, r=4

x = pf[4] XOR pf[3 - 1] = 1 XOR 0 = 1

v1 = mp[pf[4]] = mp[1] = [1,4,5]

v2 = mp[pf[3 - 1]] = mp[0] = [0,2]

it1 = bisect_left(v1,3) = 1 (v1[1]=4 >=3)

it2 = bisect_left(v2,4) -1 = 1 -1 =0

So, v1[1]=4 < v2[0]=0 is false (4 < 0 is false), so "NO"

Which matches the fifth query.

So, in this test case, the code produces the correct outputs.

Let me check another test case.

Take the second test case:

5 5

1 2 3 4 5

Queries:

1 5: x = pf[5] XOR pf[1 - 1] = 1 XOR 0 =1 !=0

v1 = mp[1] = [1,4]

v2 = mp[0] = [0]

it1 = bisect_left([1,4],1)=0

it2 = bisect_left([0],5)-1=0-1=-1 (invalid, so "NO")

Which matches the first query's "YES" in the output, but according to the note, it should be "YES" for the first query, but in the sample output, it's "YES" for the first query of the second test case.

Wait, checking the sample output:

For the second test case:

YES

NO

NO

YES

NO

But according to the code, for [1,5]:

x = 1 (pf[5]=1, pf[0]=0, x=1)

v1 = mp[1] = [1,4]

v2 = mp[0] = [0]

it1 = 0 (v1[0]=1 >=1)

it2 = bisect_left([0],5)-1 =0-1=-1 (invalid), so "NO"

But the sample output is "YES", which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Let me compute pf for the second test case:

a: [1,2,3,4,5]

pf[0] = 0

pf[1] = 1

pf[2] = 1 XOR 2 = 3

pf[3] = 3 XOR 3 = 0

pf[4] = 0 XOR 4 = 4

pf[5] = 4 XOR 5 = 1

mp:

0: [0,3]

1: [1,5]

3: [2]

4: [4]

Query [1,5]:

x = pf[5] XOR pf[1 - 1] = 1 XOR 0 =1

v1 = mp[1] = [1,5]

v2 = mp[0] = [0,3]

it1 = bisect_left([1,5],1)=0

it2 = bisect_left([0,3],5)-1=1-1=0

So, v1[0]=1 < v2[0]=0 is false (1 < 0 is false), so "NO"

But according to the sample output, it's "YES".

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

In the sample input, for the second test case, the output is:

YES

NO

NO

YES

NO

But according to my calculation, for [1,5], it should be "NO", but sample output is "YES".

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, sample input has 4 test cases, and sample output has 4 blocks.

First test case has 5 queries with output:

YES

YES

NO

NO

NO

Second test case has 5 queries with output:

YES

NO

NO

YES

NO

Third test case has 4 queries with output:

NO

NO

NO

NO

Fourth test case has 4 queries with output:

YES

NO

YES

YES

So, for the second test case, the first query [1,5] is "YES", but according to my calculation with the code, it should be "NO".

Hence, either the code is wrong or my understanding is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the condition in the code is incorrect.

Let me look back at the code's condition:

if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:

results.append('YES')

else:

results.append('NO')

In the [1,5] query of the second test case:

v1 = [1,5]

v2 = [0,3]

it1 = 0 (v1[0]=1 >=1)

it2 = 0 (bisect_left([0,3],5)-1=1-1=0)

So, v1[it1]=1 < v2[it2]=0 is false, so "NO"

But sample output is "YES", which suggests that the code is incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into more than one part where the bitwise XOR of each part is equal.

### Approach

1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - Compute the prefix XOR array `pf`, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.

2. **Mapping Prefix XOR to Indices**:
   - Use a dictionary to map each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where it occurs.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `[l, r]`, compute the XOR of the subarray `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x == 0`, it directly implies the subarray is interesting because it can be divided into an even number of parts with XOR 0.
   - If `x != 0`, check if there exists at least one split point within `[l, r]` such that the subarrays on both sides have the required XOR value `x`.

4. **Efficient Split Point Check**:
   - Use binary search (with `bisect_left`) on the lists of indices where specific XOR values occur to efficiently check for the existence of valid split points.

### Solution Code

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

def main():
    data = sys.stdin.read().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        mp[0].append(0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
