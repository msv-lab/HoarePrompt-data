Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad is planning to hold m rounds of something, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. He already has a bank of n problems with various difficulty levels, and he might need to come up with some more to have enough for m rounds.

My task is to find out the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

First, I need to understand what's required for m rounds. Since each round needs one problem of each difficulty from A to G, for m rounds, he needs m problems of each difficulty level. So, in total, he needs 7*m problems, with m problems of each level from A to G.

Now, he already has n problems in his bank, and I need to check how many of each difficulty level he has. If he has fewer than m problems of any difficulty level, he needs to make up the difference.

So, the approach should be:

1. Count the number of problems he has for each difficulty level A through G.

2. For each difficulty level, if the count is less than m, he needs to create m - count more problems of that level.

3. Sum up all the additional problems he needs to create for each difficulty level where he doesn't have enough.

4. Output that sum for each test case.

Looking at the example:

Input:

3

10 1

BGECDCBDED

10 2

BGECDCBDED

9 1

BBCDEFFGG

Output:

2

5

1

For the first test case:

n=10, m=1, problems: 'BGECDCBDED'

Count of each letter:

A: 0

B: 3

C: 2

D: 3

E: 2

F: 0

G: 1

He needs m=1 of each:

A: needs 1 - 0 = 1

B: 3 >=1, so 0

C: 2 >=1, so 0

D: 3 >=1, so 0

E: 2 >=1, so 0

F: 0 <1, so 1

G: 1 >=1, so 0

Total additional problems needed: 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2, problems: 'BGECDCBDED'

Counts:

A:0

B:3

C:2

D:3

E:2

F:0

G:1

He needs m=2 of each:

A:2 - 0 = 2

B:3 >=2, so 0

C:2 >=2, so 0

D:3 >=2, so 0

E:2 >=2, so 0

F:0 <2, so 2

G:1 <2, so 1

Total: 2 + 2 + 1 = 5, which matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1, problems: 'BBCDEFFGG'

Counts:

A:0

B:2

C:1

D:1

E:1

F:2

G:2

He needs m=1 of each:

A:1 - 0 =1

B:2 >=1, so 0

C:1 >=1, so 0

D:1 >=1, so 0

E:1 >=1, so 0

F:2 >=1, so 0

G:2 >=1, so 0

Total: 1, which matches the third output.

So, my approach seems correct based on the example.

Now, looking at the provided program:

from collections import Counter

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

ans = 0

p = 'ABCDEFG'

hmp = Counter(s)

for i in p:

if i not in hmp:

ans += m

for i in hmp:

if hmp[i] < m:

ans += m - hmp[i]

print(ans)

Let's analyze this code step by step.

It uses the Counter from collections to count the frequency of each character in the string s.

Then, for each difficulty level in 'ABCDEFG', if that level is not in the counter, it adds m to the answer.

Additionally, for each difficulty level in the counter, if the count is less than m, it adds the difference to the answer.

Wait a minute, there might be an issue here.

Consider that for levels that are not in the counter, it correctly adds m to the answer.

But for levels that are in the counter but have a count less than m, it adds m - count to the answer.

However, in the first loop, for levels not in the counter, it adds m, which is correct.

In the second loop, it seems to be iterating over all keys in the counter, not just 'A' to 'G'. If there are any other characters in s that are not 'A' to 'G', they shouldn't be considered.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "the difficulties of the problems in the bank" are from 'A' to 'G', so s should only contain characters from 'A' to 'G'. But to be safe, we might want to ensure that.

Also, in the second loop, it's iterating over all keys in hmp, which are the characters in s. But some of these might have already been considered in the first loop.

Actually, in the first loop, for each letter in 'ABCDEFG', if it's not in hmp, add m to ans.

Then, in the second loop, for each letter in hmp, if hmp[i] < m, add m - hmp[i].

But this could double-count if, for example, a letter is in hmp and has hmp[i] < m.

Wait, no, it's iterating over all letters in hmp, which are subsets of 'A' to 'G', and checking if their count is less than m.

But actually, in the first loop, for letters not in hmp, it adds m, which is correct.

In the second loop, for letters in hmp that have hmp[i] < m, it adds m - hmp[i].

This seems correct.

Let's take the first example again:

s = 'BGECDCBDED'

hmp = Counter({'B':3, 'G':1, 'E':2, 'C':2, 'D':3, 'F':1})

p = 'ABCDEFG'

For 'A' not in hmp, add m=1 to ans (ans=1)

Then, for 'F' in hmp with count=1 < m=1, add m -1 =0 (ans remains 1)

Wait, m=1, hmp['F']=1, 1 < 1 is False, so no addition.

Wait, 1 < 1 is False.

So, ans remains 1, but in the example, it's 2.

Wait, there's a mistake.

Wait, in the first loop, for 'A' not in hmp, add m=1 to ans (ans=1)

Then, in the second loop:

For 'B':3 >=1, so no addition

'G':1 >=1, no addition

'E':2 >=1, no addition

'C':2 >=1, no addition

'D':3 >=1, no addition

'F':1 >=1, no addition

So, ans remains 1, but according to the example, it should be 2.

Wait, there's a mistake.

In the first loop, for 'A' not in hmp, add m=1 to ans.

In the second loop, for 'F':1 <1 is False, so no addition.

But in the example, 'F' is not in hmp, but in the counter it is present with count=1.

Wait, no, in the first test case, s='BGECDCBDED', which includes 'B','G','E','C','D','B','D','E','D','B'. So, 'F' is not present.

Wait, looking back:

First test case:

n=10, m=1

s='BGECDCBDED'

So, hmp = Counter({'B':3, 'G':1, 'E':2, 'C':2, 'D':3})

'F' is not in hmp.

So, in the first loop:

'A' not in hmp, add m=1 to ans (ans=1)

'F' not in hmp, add m=1 to ans (ans=2)

All other letters are in hmp with counts >=1.

So, total ans=2, which matches the example.

Wait, but in the code, in the first loop, it only adds m for letters in 'ABCDEFG' not in hmp.

Then, in the second loop, it checks for letters in hmp with counts <m.

In this case, 'F' is not in hmp, so it's already accounted for in the first loop.

So, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in the code, it's:

for i in p:

if i not in hmp:

ans += m

for i in hmp:

if hmp[i] < m:

ans += m - hmp[i]

So, in the first loop, for 'A' and 'F', which are not in hmp, ans +=1 for each (ans=2)

In the second loop, for 'B':3>=1, no addition

'G':1>=1, no addition

'E':2>=1, no addition

'C':2>=1, no addition

'D':3>=1, no addition

So, total ans=2, which matches the first output.

Second test case:

n=10, m=2

s='BGECDCBDED'

hmp = Counter({'B':3, 'G':1, 'E':2, 'C':2, 'D':3})

First loop:

'A' not in hmp, ans +=2 (ans=2)

'F' not in hmp, ans +=2 (ans=4)

Second loop:

'B':3>=2, no addition

'G':1<2, add 2-1=1 to ans (ans=5)

'E':2>=2, no addition

'C':2>=2, no addition

'D':3>=2, no addition

Total ans=5, matches the second output.

Third test case:

n=9, m=1

s='BBCDEFFGG'

hmp = Counter({'B':2, 'C':1, 'D':1, 'E':1, 'F':2, 'G':2})

First loop:

'A' not in hmp, ans +=1 (ans=1)

'F' is in hmp with count=2>=1, so no addition in second loop

Total ans=1, matches the third output.

So, the code seems correct based on the examples.

But let's think about potential edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

t=1

n=0, m=1

s=""

He needs to create m=1 of each A to G, so ans=7

Edge Case 2:

t=1

n=7, m=1

s="ABCDEFG"

He has one of each, so ans=0

Edge Case 3:

t=1

n=7, m=1

s="AAAAAAA"

He has seven A's, but needs one of each A to G.

So, he has 7 A's, which covers one A, but needs one of each B to G.

So, ans=6

Edge Case 4:

t=1

n=10, m=2

s="ABBCDDEFGG"

hmp = {'A':1, 'B':2, 'C':2, 'D':2, 'E':1, 'F':1, 'G':2}

First loop:

'A' is in hmp with 1<2, so in second loop, ans +=1

'B':2>=2, no addition

'C':2>=2, no addition

'D':2>=2, no addition

'E':1<2, ans +=1

'F':1<2, ans +=1

'G':2>=2, no addition

Total ans=3

Wait, but according to the approach, in the first loop, 'A','E','F' would need to be checked in the second loop.

Wait, in the first loop, 'A','E','F' are in hmp, so only in second loop, their deficiencies are added.

Wait, no, in the first loop, for letters not in hmp, add m.

In this case, all 'A' to 'G' are in hmp, so first loop adds 0.

In second loop:

'A':1<2, ans +=1

'E':1<2, ans +=1

'F':1<2, ans +=1

Total ans=3, which is correct.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=5, m=5

s="ABCDE"

hmp = {'A':1, 'B':1, 'C':1, 'D':1, 'E':1}

First loop:

'F' and 'G' not in hmp, ans +=5 each, ans=10

Second loop:

'A':1<5, ans +=4

'B':1<5, ans +=4

'C':1<5, ans +=4

'D':1<5, ans +=4

'E':1<5, ans +=4

Total ans=10 + 4*5 = 10+20=30

But actually, he needs 5 of each A to G.

He has 1 of A, B, C, D, E, so he needs 4 more of each A to E, and 5 of F and G.

So total needed: 4*5 (for A to E) +5*2 (for F and G) =20+10=30

So, correct.

Another Edge Case:

t=1

n=7, m=1

s="ABCDEFZ"

hmp = {'A':1, 'B':1, 'C':1, 'D':1, 'E':1, 'F':1, 'Z':1}

First loop:

'A' to 'G': 'Z' is not in 'ABCDEFG', so only 'A' to 'F' are in hmp, 'G' is not.

So, for 'G' not in hmp, ans +=1

Second loop:

'A':1>=1, no addition

'B':1>=1, no addition

'C':1>=1, no addition

'D':1>=1, no addition

'E':1>=1, no addition

'F':1>=1, no addition

'Z':1<1, but 'Z' is not in 'ABCDEFG', so it should be ignored.

Total ans=1, which is correct.

So, the code seems to handle this case correctly.

Wait, in the code, it iterates over p='ABCDEFG', checking if each is in hmp.

Then iterates over hmp keys, checking if hmp[i]<m.

But in this case, 'Z' is in hmp, but since it's not in 'ABCDEFG', it shouldn't be considered in the second loop.

Wait, in the code, it's iterating over all keys in hmp.

So, for 'Z', hmp['Z']=1, which is >=1, so no addition.

So, it's okay.

But to be safe, maybe the second loop should only be over 'ABCDEFG'.

Alternatively, since hmp is created from s, which should only contain 'A' to 'G', according to the problem, it's fine.

But to be extra cautious, perhaps the second loop should only iterate over 'ABCDEFG'.

But as per the problem, s contains only 'A' to 'G', so it's fine.

Another consideration: m=0.

But m >=1 as per constraints, m=1 to 5.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, m can be 1 to 5.

Wait, looking back:

"1 ≤ m ≤ 5"

So, m=1 to 5.

So, no need to handle m=0.

Also, t=1 to 1000, n=1 to 50.

Seems manageable.

Time constraints shouldn't be an issue, as n is small.

So, overall, the code seems correct.

It correctly identifies the missing problems needed for m rounds by checking the counts of each difficulty level.

Thus, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
