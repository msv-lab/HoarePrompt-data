Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game being played on a tree structure with n nodes, and it's given that the tree has exactly two leaves, which makes it sort of like an array. There are t rounds, but in this easy version, t is always 1, so I only need to handle one round. Each round starts with a stone on one node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor until no moves are left. Ron goes first, then Hermione, and so on. The player who can't make a move loses.

First, I need to understand the tree structure. Since it's a tree with exactly two leaves, it should be a linear structure, like a path graph, where each node is connected in a straight line. For example, with n=3, the tree could be 1-2-3, where 1 and 3 are the leaves.

The game is about moving the stone to inactive neighbors, activating them in the process. So, starting from a node, players alternate moves until no more moves can be made. I need to determine who wins if both play optimally.

I recall that in such games, the concept of the "grundy number" or "Nimber" is useful in determining the winner in impartial games like this one. The grundy number for a position is the minimum excludant (mex) of the grundy numbers of the positions reachable in one move.

In this specific game, since it's a tree and the moves are restricted to moving to an inactive neighbor, I think I can model this as a game of Nim where the tree is decomposed into its connected components or paths.

But wait, since the tree is a path with two leaves, it's essentially a linear path. So, starting from any node, the game reduces to moving left or right to inactive neighbors, activating them as we go.

Let me think about the example given:

Input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

So, the tree is 1-3-2. Leaves are 1 and 2. Starting node is 3.

Moves:

- Ron moves to 1 or 2. Let's say he moves to 1.

- Hermione can't move from 1, as 3 is already active. So, she loses.

Hence, Ron wins.

Another example:

Input:

5 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 5

5

Tree is 1-2-3-4-5, leaves are 1 and 5. Starting node is 5.

Moves:

- Ron moves to 4.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 1.

- Ron can't move, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's Hermione who wins in this case.

Wait, no, in the second example, output is "Hermione", which matches the scenario above.

So, in the first example, Ron wins, and in the second, Hermione wins.

I need to find a general way to determine who wins from any starting node.

I think I can model this as a game on a path graph, where the active nodes divide the path into segments of inactive nodes.

But in this problem, since the tree is always a path with two leaves, I can represent it as a linear array.

I need to find the number of moves possible, and see who makes the last move.

Wait, but it's not that simple because players choose which neighbor to move to, and it affects the available moves afterward.

Maybe I can think in terms of the number of tokens (active nodes) and the possible moves.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the "Nim-game" where each independent game corresponds to a heap, and the number of moves in each heap is the size of the heap.

But in this case, the game is not a collection of independent Nim-heaps, but a single path.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the grundy number for each possible position.

Given that the tree is a path, I can consider the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Let me try to compute the grundy number for each possible starting node.

Grundy number for a position is the mex of the grundy numbers of the positions reachable in one move.

In this game, from a node, you can move to any inactive neighbor.

Wait, but in this tree, each node has at most two neighbors, since it's a path.

So, from a node, you can move to one or two directions, depending on the neighbors.

Wait, but as the game progresses, some nodes become active, so the available moves change.

This seems complicated to compute the grundy number dynamically.

Is there a better way?

I recall that in path graphs, many games can be solved using dynamic programming.

Maybe I can compute for each node, the winner if the game starts from there.

Let me try to model this.

Define a function W(x), which returns the winner when starting from node x.

If a node is a leaf, then W(x) = "Hermione", because Ron can't make a move.

Wait, no. If the starting node is a leaf, Ron moves first, but there are no moves available (since leaves have only one neighbor, which might be active or not).

Wait, in the initial state, all nodes are inactive, so starting from a leaf, Ron can move to its only neighbor.

Then, Hermione can move to the next node, and so on, until one player can't move.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Let me think differently.

In a path graph, the game is similar to moving along the path, activating nodes as we go.

The player who is forced to move when only one node is left loses, because there are no moves available.

This seems similar to the game of Nim with a single heap, where the heap size is the number of moves possible.

Wait, but in Nim, the player who takes the last object wins, whereas in this game, the player who can't make a move loses.

So, it's similar in that respect.

Maybe the game is equivalent to a Nim heap of size equal to the number of moves available.

But I need to model the tree as a path and find the number of moves possible from the starting node.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the distance from the starting node to each leaf and find some parity or something.

Let me consider the tree as a path with nodes numbered from 1 to n, where 1 and n are the leaves.

Given that, the starting node is some u.

Then, the game is about moving left or right to inactive neighbors, activating them, until no moves are left.

I think the number of moves is equal to the number of nodes in the path minus one, because starting from u, you can reach all other nodes by moving along the path, activating them one by one.

But actually, it's not that simple because the moves are alternating, and the player who makes the last move wins.

Wait, no, in this game, the player who cannot make a move loses, which is equivalent to the previous player having made the last move.

This is similar to the game of Nim, where the player who takes the last object wins.

So, in game theory terms, this is an impartial game, and I can assign a grundy number to each position.

But computing grundy numbers for each possible subset of active nodes is infeasible for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider the tree as a path graph with nodes in a line.

Let me try to find the number of moves available from the starting node.

Wait, in this game, the number of moves is equal to the number of inactive neighbors that can be moved to.

But as the game progresses, the number of available moves changes.

This seems too dynamic to handle directly.

Perhaps I can find the total number of moves that will be made in the game, and then determine who makes the last move.

Since Ron moves first, if the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

Wait, that seems promising.

Let me think about it.

In the first example:

n=3, starting node=3.

Possible moves:

- Ron moves to 1 or 2. Let's say 1.

- Hermione can't move from 1, so Ron wins.

Total moves: 1 (odd), so Ron wins.

In the second example:

n=5, starting node=5.

Possible moves:

- Ron moves to 4.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 1.

- Ron can't move.

Total moves: 4 (even), so Hermione wins.

This seems to hold.

So, in general, if the total number of moves is odd, Ron wins; if even, Hermione wins.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, but in the first example, n=3, starting from node 3, total moves are 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In the second example, n=5, starting from node 5, total moves are 4 (even), Hermione wins.

Another test case:

n=2, starting from node 1.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione can't move.

Total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

Another test case:

n=4, starting from node 2.

- Ron moves to 1.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 4.

Total moves: 3 (odd), Ron wins.

Wait, but according to my earlier hypothesis, if total moves are odd, Ron wins; even, Hermione wins.

In this case, with n=4, starting from node 2, total moves=3 (odd), Ron wins.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if starting from another node.

n=4, starting from node 1.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 4.

Total moves: 3 (odd), Ron wins.

Same as starting from node 2.

Another test case:

n=6, starting from node 3.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 1.

- Ron can't move from 1.

Total moves: 2 (even), Hermione wins.

Wait, but according to my earlier hypothesis, total moves even means Hermione wins.

But in this case, starting from node 3 in n=6, total moves=2, Hermione wins.

Wait, but in the previous n=4, starting from node 2, total moves=3, Ron wins.

Wait, but in n=6, starting from node 3, moves could be different.

Let me visualize n=6, nodes 1-2-3-4-5-6, leaves are 1 and 6.

Starting from node 3.

Option 1:

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 1.

- Ron can't move.

Total moves: 2 (even), Hermione wins.

Option 2:

- Ron moves to 4.

- Hermione moves to 5.

- Ron moves to 6.

- Hermione can't move.

Total moves: 3 (odd), Ron wins.

Wait, so depending on the moves, the total number of moves can be different.

This is a problem because the total number of moves isn't uniquely determined.

So, my earlier hypothesis might be incorrect.

This means that just counting the total possible moves doesn't work because the sequence of moves affects the total number of moves made.

This complicates things.

I need a better way to determine the winner.

Let me consider the game as a sum of Nim-heaps, but since it's a tree (actually a path), perhaps I can find a way to decompose it.

Wait, but it's not a collection of independent games, so summing grundy numbers might not be directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of the "Nimber" for the entire path.

But I need to find a way to compute the grundy number for the starting position.

Given that the tree is a path, perhaps I can find a formula for the grundy number based on the distance to the leaves.

Let me try to define the grundy number for each node.

Let me denote g(x) as the grundy number for node x.

Then, g(x) = mex{g(y) for y in inactive neighbors of x}.

But computing this for each node dynamically is too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that in a path graph, the grundy number for a node depends only on its distance to the leaves.

Let me consider the distance from the starting node to each leaf.

In the first example, n=3, starting at node 3, distances to leaves are 1 and 0.

Wait, node 3 is connected to 2 and 1.

Leaves are 1 and 2.

Wait, but in the first example, the tree is 2-3 and 3-1, so it's like 1-3-2.

So, starting from 3, distance to leaf 1 is 1, to leaf 2 is 1.

In the second example, n=5, starting at node 5, distance to leaf 5 is 0, to leaf 1 is 4.

Wait, in the second example, the tree is 1-2-3-4-5, so starting from 5, distance to leaf 1 is 4, to leaf 5 is 0.

But I need to consider the moves available from the starting node.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of moves required to reach each leaf.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to model the game as a game of removals.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the path as a line of nodes, and the game is about moving along the line, activating nodes as we go.

This seems similar to a game where players take turns moving a token along a line, and the player who can't move loses.

In such games, the winner often depends on the parity of the number of moves.

But earlier, I saw that the total number of moves can vary based on the moves made.

So, perhaps I need to find the maximum number of moves possible, or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should consider the game as a sum of smaller games, where each segment of the path is a separate game.

But since it's a single path, I'm not sure.

Let me try to look for a pattern.

In n=2:

- Starting from node 1: Ron moves to 2, Hermione can't move. Total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

- Starting from node 2: Ron moves to 1, Hermione can't move. Total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

In n=3:

- Starting from node 3: Ron moves to 1 or 2, Hermione can't move. Total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

- Starting from node 2: Ron moves to 1 or 3.

- If Ron moves to 1, Hermione can't move. Total moves: 1 (odd), Ron wins.

- If Ron moves to 3, Hermione moves to 1. Total moves: 2 (even), Hermione wins.

Wait, so in n=3, starting from node 3, Ron can choose to move to 1 or 2.

- If Ron moves to 1, Hermione can't move. Ron wins.

- If Ron moves to 2, Hermione can't move. Ron wins.

So, Ron can force a win.

In n=4:

- Starting from node 2: Ron moves to 1 or 3.

- If Ron moves to 1, Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 4. Total moves: 3 (odd), Ron wins.

- If Ron moves to 3, Hermione moves to 4, Ron can't move. Total moves: 2 (even), Hermione wins.

So, Ron can choose to move to 1 and win, or move to 3 and lose. So, Ron can force a win.

In n=5:

- Starting from node 5: Ron moves to 4.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 1.

- Ron can't move. Total moves: 4 (even), Hermione wins.

So, in this case, Hermione wins.

Looking for a pattern:

- For n=2: Ron wins.

- n=3: Ron wins.

- n=4: Ron wins.

- n=5: Hermione wins.

Is there a pattern based on n modulo something?

Wait, n=2: Ron wins.

n=3: Ron wins.

n=4: Ron wins.

n=5: Hermione wins.

So, for n=2,3,4 Ron wins; for n=5 Hermione wins.

Doesn't seem straightforward.

Wait, perhaps it's based on the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Wait, in n=5, starting from node 5, distance to leaf 5 is 0, to leaf 1 is 4.

Wait, maybe it's about the XOR of the distances or something.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

I recall that in impartial games, the grundy number of a position determines the winner.

If the grundy number is 0, the position is losing for the player about to move; otherwise, it's winning.

So, if I can compute the grundy number for the starting position, I can determine who wins.

But computing grundy numbers for each node in a tree with n=2e5 is not feasible with a naive approach.

I need a smarter way.

Given that the tree is a path, perhaps there's a formula for the grundy number based on the position in the path.

Let me try to find a pattern for small n.

For n=2:

- Starting at node 1: g(1) = mex(g(2)) = mex(0) = 1 (assuming g(2)=0 if it's a leaf)

Wait, but leaves might have g(x)=0.

Wait, in this game, leaves are positions where no moves are available, so g(leaf)=0.

In n=2:

- Nodes 1 and 2 are leaves.

- Starting at node 1: g(1)=0.

- Starting at node 2: g(2)=0.

But according to earlier examples, Ron should win starting from node 1 or 2 in n=2.

But if g(1)=0 and g(2)=0, that would mean the starting player loses, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that Ron wins.

So perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe in this game, g(x) = number of moves available from x.

But that doesn't seem right.

Let me recall that in impartial games, g(x) = mex{g(y) | y is a position reachable from x}.

In this game, positions are nodes with the stone, and moves are to inactive neighbors.

Given that, I need to define g(x) based on the inactive neighbors.

But since the tree is a path, perhaps I can model it as a sum of Nim-heaps.

Wait, but it's not a sum of independent games.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the path as a single Nim-heap where the size is the number of nodes.

But in standard Nim, the grundy number is just the size modulo 2.

Wait, in standard Nim, the grundy number is the size modulo 2 when each move removes one object.

But in this game, it's not exactly removing objects; it's moving along the path, activating nodes.

Wait, but in a path, moving from a node to an inactive neighbor is like moving along the path, and the game ends when a player reaches a leaf.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the distance from the starting node to the leaves and find the mex of those distances.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define W(x) as the winner when starting from node x.

If x is a leaf, W(x) = "Hermione", because Ron can't make a move.

Otherwise, W(x) = "Ron" if there exists a neighbor y such that W(y) = "Hermione"; else, W(x) = "Hermione".

This is the standard way to determine the winner in impartial games.

So, in code, it would be:

- If the node is a leaf, return "Hermione".

- Else, for each neighbor, compute W(y). If any W(y) = "Hermione", then W(x) = "Ron"; else, W(x) = "Hermione".

But implementing this recursively with n up to 2e5 would cause a stack overflow or be too slow.

So, I need a better way.

Perhaps I can compute the winner for each node in a dynamic programming fashion, starting from the leaves.

Let me try that.

First, identify the leaves of the tree. Since it's a path, there are exactly two leaves.

Then, compute the winner for each node based on the winners of their neighbors.

Define an array winner[1..n], where winner[x] is "Ron" or "Hermione".

Initialize winner[leaf] = "Hermione" for both leaves.

Then, for each non-leaf node, if it has at least one neighbor where winner[y] = "Hermione", then winner[x] = "Ron"; else, winner[x] = "Hermione".

But in a path, this would propagate the winner values from the leaves to the root.

Wait, but in a path, it's a linear structure, so I can process it in linear time.

For example, in n=5, nodes 1 and 5 are leaves.

Set winner[1] = "Hermione", winner[5] = "Hermione".

Then, node 2 is connected to node 3.

But wait, in a path, each non-leaf node has two neighbors, except the leaves.

Wait, in n=5, nodes are 1-2-3-4-5.

Set winner[1] = "Hermione", winner[5] = "Hermione".

Then, for node 2, it's connected to node 1 and node 3.

winner[1] = "Hermione", so winner[2] = "Ron".

For node 4, connected to node 5 and node 3.

winner[5] = "Hermione", so winner[4] = "Ron".

For node 3, connected to node 2 and node 4.

winner[2] = "Ron", winner[4] = "Ron".

So, winner[3] = "Hermione".

Hence, starting from node 3, Hermione wins, which matches the second sample input.

Another test case: n=4, nodes 1-2-3-4.

Leaves are 1 and 4.

Set winner[1] = "Hermione", winner[4] = "Hermione".

For node 2, connected to node 1 and node 3.

winner[1] = "Hermione", so winner[2] = "Ron".

For node 3, connected to node 2 and node 4.

winner[2] = "Ron", winner[4] = "Hermione", so winner[3] = "Ron".

Hence, starting from node 2: winner[2] = "Ron", which matches earlier observations.

Another test case: n=3, nodes 1-3-2.

Leaves are 1 and 2.

Set winner[1] = "Hermione", winner[2] = "Hermione".

For node 3, connected to node 1 and node 2.

winner[1] = "Hermione", winner[2] = "Hermione", so winner[3] = "Ron".

But in earlier manual simulation, starting from node 3, Ron can choose to move to 1 or 2, and in both cases, Hermione wins. Wait, but according to this DP approach, winner[3] = "Ron".

Wait, there's a contradiction.

Wait, no, in the manual simulation, starting from node 3, Ron moves to 1 or 2, and Hermione can't move, so Ron wins.

Hence, winner[3] = "Ron", which matches the DP approach.

Earlier, I thought that in n=3, starting from 3, Ron wins, which is correct.

So, this DP approach seems correct.

Let me try another test case: n=6, nodes 1-2-3-4-5-6.

Leaves are 1 and 6.

Set winner[1] = "Hermione", winner[6] = "Hermione".

For node 2, connected to node 1 and node 3.

winner[1] = "Hermione", so winner[2] = "Ron".

For node 5, connected to node 6 and node 4.

winner[6] = "Hermione", so winner[5] = "Ron".

For node 3, connected to node 2 and node 4.

winner[2] = "Ron", winner[4] = ?.

Wait, need to compute winner[4] first.

Node 4 is connected to node 3 and node 5.

winner[5] = "Ron", so winner[4] = "Ron".

Then, for node 3: winner[2] = "Ron", winner[4] = "Ron", so winner[3] = "Hermione".

Hence, starting from node 3, Hermione wins.

Which matches the earlier manual simulation.

So, this DP approach seems correct.

Hence, to solve the problem, I can:

1. Build the tree from the input edges.

2. Identify the two leaves of the tree.

3. Initialize the winner array for the leaves as "Hermione".

4. Perform a DP traversal from the leaves to the root, setting winner[x] based on the winners of the neighbors.

5. For each starting node in the t rounds (though t=1 in this version), output the corresponding winner.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, I need an efficient way to perform this DP, likely using BFS or DFS.

Since the tree is a path, I can process it linearly.

In code, I can represent the tree as an adjacency list.

Then, find the two leaves (nodes with degree 1).

Initialize their winner as "Hermione".

Then, process the nodes in reverse order, updating the winner based on the neighbors.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a DP where I start from the leaves and propagate the winner values towards the center.

Given that it's a path, I can order the nodes in the path order and compute the winner accordingly.

But I need to make sure that I process nodes in the correct order to have the winner values of their neighbors already computed.

Alternatively, since it's a tree, I can perform a DFS and compute the winner for each node based on its children.

But in this case, since it's a path, it's straightforward.

I'll implement the DP approach as described.

Now, looking at the given program, it seems incomplete and doesn't relate to the problem at hand.

The given program defines a function func_1() that reads input until there are no more pairs of numbers, and collects them into a list of sublists.

Then, it seems to compare numbers in these sublists, counting some kind of comparisons between Ron and Hermione.

Finally, it prints either "Ron" or "Hermione" based on some counts.

This doesn't seem to relate to the tree game problem.

Hence, the given program is incorrect for this problem.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the winner of a game played on a tree with exactly two leaves, where players Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone to inactive neighbors until no more moves are possible. The player who cannot make a move loses.

## Approach

1. **Tree Structure Analysis**:
   - The tree is a linear path with exactly two leaves.
   - We can represent it as a path graph where each node has at most two neighbors.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Winner Determination**:
   - Initialize the winner for the leaves as "Hermione" since no moves can be made from a leaf.
   - Propagate the winner values from the leaves to the root using DP:
     - If any neighbor's winner is "Hermione", then the current node's winner is "Ron".
     - Otherwise, the current node's winner is "Hermione".

3. **Efficient DP Traversal**:
   - Use a queue-based approach to process nodes starting from the leaves.
   - Update the winner for each node based on its neighbors' winners.

## Solution Code

```python
from collections import deque

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    n = int(data[0])
    t = int(data[1])
    edges = []
    for i in range(n-1):
        u = int(data[2*i+2])
        v = int(data[2*i+3])
        edges.append((u, v))
    starting_nodes = list(map(int, data[2*n+2:2*n+2+t]))
    
    # Build adjacency list
    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]
    degrees = [0] * (n+1)
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)
        degrees[u] += 1
        degrees[v] += 1
    
    # Find leaves
    leaves = [i for i in range(1, n+1) if degrees[i] == 1]
    
    # Initialize winner array
    winner = [None] * (n+1)
    for leaf in leaves:
        winner[leaf] = "Hermione"
    
    # Queue for BFS
    queue = deque(leaves)
    visited = set(leaves)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                # If any neighbor is "Hermione", current node is "Ron"
                if winner[neighbor] == "Hermione":
                    winner[neighbor] = "Ron"
                # Otherwise, check other neighbors
                else:
                    all_hermione = True
                    for n in adj[neighbor]:
                        if winner[n] != "Hermione":
                            all_hermione = False
                            break
                    if all_hermione:
                        winner[neighbor] = "Hermione"
                    else:
                        winner[neighbor] = "Ron"
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Output the winner for each starting node
    for u in starting_nodes:
        print(winner[u])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

1. **Input Reading and Tree Construction**:
   - Read input values and construct the tree using an adjacency list.
   - Identify the leaves of the tree (nodes with degree 1).

2. **DP Winner Initialization**:
   - Set the winner for leaves as "Hermione".

3. **BFS-based DP Propagation**:
   - Use a queue to process nodes starting from leaves.
   - For each node, determine the winner based on neighbors' winners:
     - If any neighbor is a "Hermione" win, set current node as "Ron".
     - Otherwise, set as "Hermione".

4. **Output the Results**:
   - For each starting node, output the precomputed winner.

This approach ensures efficient computation with a time complexity of O(n), suitable for the constraints.
