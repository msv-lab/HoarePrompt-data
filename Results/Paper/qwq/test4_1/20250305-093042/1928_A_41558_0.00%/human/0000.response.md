Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces by rotating and moving them as needed. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to a 90-degree rotation, they're considered the same. For example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle.

My task is to determine, for given a and b, whether Bob can form a new rectangle that's different from the original one after cutting and rearranging the pieces.

First, I need to understand the cutting process. Bob can make a cut parallel to either the a-side or the b-side.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the a-side. That means the cut is along the length b, so he's dividing the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size a by something.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the b-side divides the rectangle into two parts along the a-length.

After cutting, he has two rectangles, and he can rotate them or move them to form a new rectangle.

I need to figure out if the two pieces can be rearranged to form a rectangle that's different from the original one, considering that rectangles that are rotations of each other are considered the same.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem: a 2x6 rectangle.

He can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles. Then, he can arrange these two 2x3 rectangles to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6, since 4x3 is not the same as 2x6 even after rotation.

Another example: a 2x1 rectangle.

He can cut it into two 1x1 squares. From two 1x1 squares, he can form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, but since these are considered the same, and the original is 2x1, there's no new rectangle formed.

Wait, but 1x2 and 2x1 are considered the same, so no new rectangle is obtained.

Another example: a 3x2 rectangle.

He can cut it into two 3x1 rectangles. Then, he can arrange these to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x1, but since 1x6 is different from the original 3x2, this would be a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the note, it says that from 3x2, he can cut into two 3x1 and form a 1x6, which is different from 3x2.

So, in this case, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

Now, what's the general approach here?

I need to consider all possible ways Bob can cut the rectangle and then see if he can rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle that's different from the original one.

First, Bob can cut parallel to the a-side or the b-side.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the a-side:

- He's dividing the b-length into two parts, say b1 and b2, so he gets two rectangles of size a x b1 and a x b2.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the b-side:

- He's dividing the a-length into two parts, say a1 and a2, getting two rectangles of size a1 x b and a2 x b.

Then, he can rotate these pieces and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Rotation means that for each piece, he can choose to rotate it by 90 degrees or not.

So, for each piece, there are two options: as is or rotated.

Given that, the total number of configurations is 2^number of pieces, but since there are only two pieces, it's 2^2 = 4 configurations.

But, since rotating the entire arrangement doesn't count as a new rectangle, I need to consider unique rectangle dimensions up to rotation.

Wait, but in the problem, two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

So, I need to consider the aspect ratio, I guess.

Wait, no. It's not just the aspect ratio; it's the actual dimensions considered up to rotation.

So, for rectangles, (x, y) and (y, x) are considered the same.

So, to represent a rectangle uniquely, I can consider ordered pairs where the first number is less than or equal to the second.

So, for any rectangle, I can represent it as (min(x,y), max(x,y)).

Then, the original rectangle is (min(a,b), max(a,b)).

I need to see if Bob can form a new rectangle (min(c,d), max(c,d)) that is different from (min(a,b), max(a,b)).

Now, let's think about the possible ways to cut and rearrange the pieces.

First, consider cutting parallel to the a-side:

- Divide b into b1 and b2, so pieces are a x b1 and a x b2.

Then, Bob can arrange these pieces side by side either horizontally or vertically, with or without rotating them.

Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the b-side:

- Divide a into a1 and a2, so pieces are a1 x b and a2 x b.

Again, he can arrange these pieces side by side horizontally or vertically, with or without rotating them.

I need to consider all possible ways he can arrange the two pieces to form a new rectangle, and check if that new rectangle is different from the original one.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the area.

The total area is a*b, and after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle should have the same area.

So, the new rectangle must have area a*b, and dimensions x*y such that x*y = a*b.

But, since rectangles that are rotations of each other are considered the same, I only need to consider unique pairs (x,y) where x <= y.

So, the original rectangle is (min(a,b), max(a,b)), and the new rectangle is (x,y) where x <= y and x*y = a*b.

I need to check if there exists a pair (x,y) different from (min(a,b), max(a,b)) such that x*y = a*b.

But, Bob has constraints on how he can form this new rectangle from the two pieces.

He has to use both pieces, and he can rotate and move them, but he can't change their shapes or sizes.

So, I need to consider how the two pieces can be combined to form a new rectangle.

Let me consider the possible ways to combine two rectangles.

Option 1: Place them side by side horizontally.

Option 2: Place them side by side vertically.

Option 3: One above the other.

Option 4: One next to the other.

But, since he can rotate them, I need to consider all possible rotations of each piece.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the areas of the pieces.

If Bob cuts the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles, their areas add up to a*b.

Then, to form a new rectangle with area a*b, he needs to arrange these two pieces in such a way that their combined shape forms a rectangle.

But, since he can rotate and move the pieces, as long as the two pieces fit together perfectly to form a rectangle, it should be possible.

But, there might be constraints based on the dimensions.

Let me consider that.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two pieces with dimensions a x b1 and a x b2, where b1 + b2 = b.

Then, if he places them side by side horizontally, he can form a rectangle of size a x (b1 + b2) = a x b, which is the same as the original.

Or, if he places them vertically, he can form a rectangle of size (a + a) x max(b1, b2), but that might not be a rectangle unless b1 = b2.

Wait, no. If he places them vertically, he would have one piece of size a x b1 and another of size a x b2.

If he places them vertically, the widths would be b1 and b2, and the heights would be a.

So, the new rectangle would have width max(b1, b2) and height a, but only if b1 = b2.

Wait, no.

Actually, if he places them vertically, side by side, the width would be b1 + b2, and the height would be a.

But b1 + b2 = b, so it's again a x b, which is the same as the original.

So, in this case, he doesn't get a new rectangle.

Similarly, if he rotates one or both pieces, let's see.

If he rotates one piece, say the a x b1 piece becomes b1 x a, and the a x b2 piece becomes b2 x a.

Then, if he places them side by side horizontally, he gets (b1 + b2) x a, which is b x a, same as original.

If he places them vertically, he gets max(b1, b2) x (a + a) = max(b1, b2) x 2a.

But this may not form a rectangle, or it may not be a valid rectangle unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the key is to consider that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have one side that is a divisor of the original area.

Wait, but that's too vague.

Let me think about the examples again.

In the 2x6 example:

- Cut into two 2x3 rectangles.

- Then, arrange them to form a 4x3 rectangle.

So, the new rectangle has dimensions 4x3, which is different from the original 2x6.

Similarly, in the 3x2 example:

- Cut into two 3x1 rectangles.

- Arrange them to form a 1x6 rectangle.

Again, 1x6 is considered the same as 6x1, which is different from the original 3x2.

In the 2x1 example:

- Cut into two 1x1 squares.

- Arrange them to form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1.

Hence, no new rectangle is formed.

So, in cases where a and b have certain properties, it's possible to form a new rectangle.

I need to find a general condition based on a and b.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

In the 2x6 example, GCD(2,6)=2.

In the 3x2 example, GCD(3,2)=1.

In the 2x1 example, GCD(2,1)=1.

Wait, but in the 3x2 example, GCD is 1, and still, a new rectangle can be formed.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a or b is even.

In the 2x6 example, both a and b are even.

In the 3x2 example, b is even, a is odd.

In the 2x1 example, a is even, b is odd.

Wait, but in the 3x2 example, a is odd and b is even, and a new rectangle can still be formed.

In the 2x1 example, a is even and b is odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

Hmm.

Maybe it's about whether both a and b are odd.

In the 1x1 example, both are odd, and no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but 1x1 can't be cut into two rectangles anyway, as per the problem.

Wait, the problem says that if the rectangle can't be cut into two smaller rectangles, then of course, no new rectangle can be formed.

So, perhaps, if both a and b are odd, then the rectangle can't be cut into two smaller integer-sided rectangles.

Wait, can't it?

Wait, 3x3: can be cut into two 3x1 and 3x2 rectangles, for example.

Wait, 3x3 can be cut into 3x1 and 3x2, both with integer sides.

So, in that case, can he form a new rectangle?

Let's see: from 3x1 and 3x2, he can arrange them to form a 3x3, which is the same as the original, or a 5x1 rectangle, which is different.

Wait, 3x1 and 3x2: if he places them side by side horizontally, he gets 3x(1+2)=3x3, same as original.

If he places them vertically, he gets (3+3)x1=6x1, which is different from the original 3x3.

So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

But according to my earlier thought, if both a and b are odd, which in this case they are not, since a=3 and b=3.

Wait, 3 is odd, so both are odd.

But in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, no new rectangle can be formed, as it can't be cut into two smaller rectangles.

Wait, but 3x3 can be cut into two rectangles, and a new rectangle can be formed.

So, perhaps, if both a and b are odd, and greater than 1, then no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the 3x3 case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, maybe only when a or b is 1 and the other is odd, no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, no new rectangle can be formed.

In the 1x1 case, no new rectangle can be formed.

In the 3x3 case, a new rectangle can be formed.

In the 2x2 case, which is even by even, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, in the 2x2 case, cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and then arrange them to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, cut into two 2x2 rectangles, and arrange them to form a 4x2, which is the same as 2x4, so no new rectangle.

Wait, but according to the problem, for 2x4, the answer is "Yes", meaning a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

The problem says: "if Bob can obtain another rectangle, or if he is just wasting his time."

And in the example, for 2x4, the output is "Yes".

So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Maybe the key is to see if a and b have a common divisor greater than 1.

Wait, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Let me consider the program given.

The program does the following:

- Read the number of test cases, t.

- For each test case:

- Read a and b.

- If both a and b are odd, print 'NO'.

- Else, if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a, print 'NO'.

- Else, print 'YES'.

So, according to this program, if both a and b are odd, it's 'NO'.

If a is twice b or b is twice a, it's 'NO'.

Otherwise, it's 'YES'.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's test it with some examples.

Example 1: 1 1

Both odd, so 'NO'. According to the problem, no new rectangle can be formed, since it can't be cut into two rectangles.

Example 2: 2 1

a even, b odd, and a != 2*b and b != 2*a, so 'YES'. But according to the problem, no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but according to the program, it should be 'YES', but according to the problem, it's 'No'.

Wait, in the problem's sample input, for 2 1, the output is 'No'.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the program's logic, for a=2, b=1:

- a is even, b is odd.

- a / 2 = 1, which equals b.

- So, it should print 'NO'.

But according to the problem, the answer is 'No'.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought that according to the program, it should be 'YES', but actually, according to the program's code, it's 'NO'.

Wait, let's look at the code again.

The code says:

if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:

print('NO')

elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, for a=2, b=1:

- a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 ==1.

- So, first condition is not true.

- Then, a / 2 = 1, which equals b, so second condition is true, print 'NO'.

Which matches the problem's sample output 'No'.

Ok, so in this case, the program is correct.

My mistake was in misreading the code.

Another example: 2 6

- a=2, b=6

- a % 2 ==0, b % 2 ==0

- a / 2 =1 !=6

- b / 2 =3 !=2

- So, else clause, print 'YES'.

Which matches the sample output 'Yes'.

Another example: 3 2

- a=3, b=2

- a % 2 !=0, b % 2 ==0

- a / 2 =1.5 !=2

- b / 2 =1 !=3

- So, 'YES'.

Which matches the sample output 'Yes'.

Another example: 2 2

- a=2, b=2

- a % 2 ==0, b % 2 ==0

- a / 2 =1 !=2

- b / 2 =1 !=2

- So, 'YES'.

Which matches the sample output 'Yes'.

Another example: 2 4

- a=2, b=4

- a % 2 ==0, b % 2 ==0

- a / 2 =1 !=4

- b / 2 =2 ==a

- So, 'NO'.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 2 4, the output is 'Yes'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample input.

Wait, in the sample input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

So, for 2 4, the output is 'Yes', but according to the program, it should be 'NO'.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, for 2 4, the answer is 'Yes'.

So, the program is wrong here.

Wait, but according to the problem note, from 2x4, you can cut into two 2x2 rectangles and form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4, so no new rectangle.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 'Yes'.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the problem statement, for 2x4, it's 'Yes', meaning that a new rectangle can be formed.

But according to my earlier thought, from 2x4, cutting into two 2x2, and forming a 4x2, which is the same as 2x4, so no new rectangle.

So, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe there's another way to cut and form a new rectangle.

Let's see: from 2x4, if I cut it into two 1x4 rectangles, then I can arrange them to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from 2x4.

Hence, a new rectangle can be formed.

So, the program is incorrect in this case, as it would output 'NO' for a=2, b=4, but the correct answer should be 'Yes'.

Another example: 6 3

- a=6, b=3

- a % 2 ==0, b % 2 !=0

- a / 2 =3 ==b

- So, 'NO'.

Which matches the sample output 'No'.

So, in this case, the program is correct.

But for 2 4, it's incorrect.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
