Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each of the resulting connected components has at least x vertices. My task is to find the maximum possible x that allows me to do this.

First, I need to understand what a tree is in graph theory terms. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices. That means any two vertices are connected by exactly one path.

So, if I remove k edges from this tree, I'll be left with k+1 connected components because each edge removal increases the number of components by one.

The problem asks for the largest x such that every one of these k+1 components has at least x vertices.

This sounds like a binary search problem on x, where for each candidate x, I check if it's possible to remove k edges so that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Binary search seems appropriate here because the possible values of x range from 1 to n, and I can check for each x whether it's feasible.

Let me think about how to implement this binary search.

First, I'll set the lower bound l to 1 and the upper bound r to n//k, because if I remove k edges, I get k+1 components, and to maximize x, I need to consider the minimum size among these components.

Wait, actually, the upper bound should be n//(k+1), because with k edge removals, I get k+1 components. So, the maximum possible x where each component has at least x vertices would be n divided by (k+1), rounded down.

But in the code provided, it's set to n//k. Hmm, that might be a mistake.

Let me double-check.

If I remove k edges, I get k+1 components. So, to have each component have at least x vertices, x cannot be larger than n/(k+1). So, the upper bound should be n//(k+1).

Wait, but in the code, it's n//k. That might be incorrect.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first example:

5 vertices, k=1.

So, removing 1 edge results in 2 components.

In the first component, there are 2 vertices, and in the second, there are 3.

So, the maximum x where both components have at least x vertices is 2, because 2 <= 2 and 2 <= 3.

Now, n//(k+1) = 5//2 = 2, which matches.

But in the code, it's n//k = 5//1 = 5, which is too big, because x=5 is not possible since one component has only 2 vertices.

So, yes, it should be n//(k+1), not n//k.

This might be a mistake in the code.

Moving on.

The function func_1 seems to set up the graph adjacency list correctly.

Then, it performs a binary search between l=1 and r=n//k (which might be too high, as discussed).

Inside the binary search, there's a function check(A) that seems to perform some kind of DFS traversal to check if it's possible to have all components with at least A vertices.

Let's look at the check function.

It uses a stack for DFS, starting from node 1.

It keeps track of the size of each subtree in the dictionary d.

As it traverses the tree, it accumulates the sizes of subtrees.

When it finishes processing a node (i.e., all its children have been processed), it checks if the size of that subtree is at least A.

If it is, it increments r (which seems to count the number of components that have at least A vertices).

If not, it adds the subtree size to its parent's size.

Finally, it checks if the number of components with at least A vertices is less than or equal to k, and the remaining component (the root's subtree) also has at least A vertices.

Wait, actually, in the code, it checks if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k).

But r seems to count the number of components with at least A vertices.

Wait, no, in the code, r is initialized to 0, and it's incremented when a subtree has at least A vertices.

But in the binary search, l and r are bounds for x, and the check function is supposed to determine if a given x is feasible.

I think there's some confusion in the implementation.

Let me try to rethink the approach.

In the binary search, for a given x, I need to determine if I can remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I can think of finding the minimum number of edges to remove so that all components have at least x vertices.

If this number is less than or equal to k, then x is feasible.

So, in the check function, I need to compute the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

If this number is <= k, then x is feasible, and I can try a larger x.

Otherwise, I need to try a smaller x.

In the code, it seems like it's trying to count the number of subtrees with at least A vertices, but it's not clear how it relates to the number of edges to remove.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Another approach is to perform a DFS and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for a given x, count how many subtrees have size >= x.

The number of edges to remove is the number of such subtrees minus 1, because removing an edge separates a subtree from the rest.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Actually, in a tree, removing an edge separates the tree into exactly two components.

So, to have all components with at least x vertices, I need to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices.

This is equivalent to finding a way to remove k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems similar to finding a way to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

But partitioning a tree into components with minimum size x requires that the sum of the minimum sizes is less than or equal to n, and that the number of components is k+1.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward.

Let me think about another way.

Suppose I perform a DFS and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for a given x, I can decide to cut edges that separate subtrees of size >= x.

The number of such cuts would be the number of subtrees of size >=x minus one, because the root component is always there.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I should look at standard algorithms for this kind of problem.

I recall that in trees, we can perform DFS and keep track of subtree sizes to make decisions about edge cuts.

Perhaps I need to modify the standard subtree size calculation to count how many subtrees have size >=x.

But I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting something similar.

It performs a DFS, calculates subtree sizes, and counts how many subtrees have size >=A.

Then, it checks if r > k or (d[1] >=A and r ==k).

I think there's a misunderstanding here.

Let me try to clarify.

In the check function, r counts the number of subtrees with size >=A.

When traversing the tree, for each subtree that has size >=A, it's considered as a separate component, and thus an edge is removed to separate it.

So, the number of edges to remove is equal to the number of such subtrees minus one, because the root component doesn't require an edge removal.

Wait, no.

Actually, each time a subtree of size >=A is found, it means that we can separate it by removing the edge connecting it to its parent.

So, the number of edges to remove is equal to the number of subtrees with size >=A.

But, in the code, r seems to count the number of subtrees with size >=A.

Then, the check is if r > k or (d[1] >=A and r ==k).

I think this needs to be adjusted.

If r > k, it means that we need to remove more edges than allowed, which is not feasible.

If r <= k, we can remove r edges to separate these subtrees.

But we need to remove exactly k edges.

So, we need to make sure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

Wait, but in the tree, removing k edges results in k+1 components.

So, to ensure that all components have at least x vertices, we need to ensure that the tree can be partitioned into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

This is equivalent to finding if the tree has a partition where each part has at least x vertices, using k edge cuts.

This seems similar to the minimum number of cuts needed to achieve components of at least x vertices.

I think I need to find the minimum number of edges to remove so that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

If this minimum number is less than or equal to k, then x is feasible.

Otherwise, it's not.

So, in the check function, I need to compute the minimum number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

If this number <=k, then x is feasible, and I can try a larger x.

Otherwise, I need to try a smaller x.

Now, how to compute the minimum number of edges to remove?

One way is to perform a DFS and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for each subtree, if its size >=x, consider it as a separate component and remove the edge connecting it to its parent.

Count how many such subtrees there are, and that's the number of edges to remove.

But, the root subtree might still have size less than x after separating the subtrees.

So, I need to ensure that the remaining component also has at least x vertices.

Wait, in the code, it seems to check if r > k or (d[1] >=A and r ==k).

I think r counts the number of subtrees with size >=A.

So, the number of edges to remove is r.

Then, to have all components have at least x vertices, after removing r edges, there should be r+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Additionally, the sum of the sizes of these components should be n.

So, (r+1)*x <=n.

Also, since r <=k, and we need to remove exactly k edges, we might need to adjust r to be equal to k.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

I recall that in trees, the number of components after removing edges is equal to the number of edges removed plus one.

So, if I remove k edges, I get k+1 components.

Each of these components must have at least x vertices.

Therefore, (k+1)*x <=n.

So, x <= n/(k+1).

This gives an upper bound for x.

So, in the binary search, I can set the upper bound to n//(k+1).

Then, for each x in this range, check if it's possible to remove k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

To check this, I can perform a DFS and count the number of subtrees with size >=x.

Each such subtree can be separated by removing the edge connecting it to its parent.

So, the number of edges to remove is equal to the number of such subtrees.

But, I need to ensure that the remaining component also has at least x vertices.

So, in the check function, I need to:

- Count the number of subtrees with size >=x (let's call this count).

- Then, check if count <=k and the size of the remaining component >=x.

Because, if count <=k, I can remove count edges to separate these subtrees, and the remaining component should have at least x vertices.

If count <=k and remaining component >=x, then it's feasible.

Additionally, if count <k, I can remove some more edges to reach exactly k removals, but I need to ensure that the additional removals don't create components with size <x.

But in a tree, removing more edges will only create smaller components, which might violate the condition.

So, perhaps it's sufficient to check if count <=k and the remaining component >=x.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking if r >k or (d[1]>=A and r==k).

I think there's a mistake here.

Let me try to re-implement the check function properly.

Here's what I think should be done:

- Perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

- For a given x, count how many subtrees have size >=x. Let's call this count.

- Then, check if count <=k and the size of the remaining component (which is the total number of vertices minus the sum of the sizes of these count subtrees) is >=x.

But in a tree, the remaining component's size can be calculated as n - sum of sizes of the count subtrees.

But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, since the tree is being split into count +1 components (count edges removed), and each of the count subtrees has size >=x, and the remaining component has size >=x, then it's feasible.

So, total components are count +1, and each has size >=x, and count <=k.

But, to ensure that the remaining component has size >=x, I can check if n - sum of sizes of the count subtrees >=x.

But this seems inefficient, especially in large trees.

Is there a better way?

I found a similar problem online, and one approach is to perform a DFS and keep track of the number of subtrees with size >=x, and then check if the number of such subtrees is <=k and the remaining component is >=x.

But implementing this correctly is tricky.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting something similar, but there might be mistakes.

In the check function, r counts the number of subtrees with size >=A.

Then, it checks if r >k or (d[1]>=A and r==k).

I think it should check if r <=k and d[1]-sum of sizes of the r subtrees >=x.

But that's complicated.

Perhaps a better way is to sort the subtree sizes and try to remove the smallest possible subtrees first to minimize the number of edges needed to be removed.

But time is limited, so I'll proceed with the initial approach.

In summary, for the binary search:

- Set l=1, r=n//(k+1)

- For each x in [l, r], check if it's possible to remove <=k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

- If possible, try a larger x.

- Else, try a smaller x.

The answer will be the largest x for which it's possible.

Now, regarding the provided code:

- The binary search bounds seem incorrect; r should be n//(k+1), not n//k.

- The check function needs to correctly count the number of subtrees with size >=A and ensure that the remaining component has size >=A.

- The check function in the code seems to have logical errors.

Therefore, I think the provided code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
