Alright, I've got this problem here about three friends playing chess, and I need to figure out the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on their final scores. The scores are p1, p2, and p3, and they're sorted in non-decreasing order, so p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

First, I need to understand how the scoring works. In each game, two players play against each other. If one player wins, they get 2 points, and the other gets 0. If it's a draw, both players get 1 point each. Also, the same pair can play multiple times, and it's possible that no games were played at all.

So, the total points distributed in each game are either 2 (in case of a win and loss) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, hold on, in a draw, both get 1 point, so that's 2 points total, same as a win and loss. Interesting, so regardless of the outcome, each game contributes exactly 2 points to the total sum of all players' points.

Given that, the total points sum S = p1 + p2 + p3. Since each game contributes exactly 2 points to S, the total number of games G must satisfy S = 2G. Therefore, S must be even; otherwise, it's impossible to achieve the given scores.

So, my first check should be if S is even. If S is odd, then it's impossible, and I should output -1.

Now, assuming S is even, I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened.

Let's think about how draws affect the points. Each draw results in both players getting 1 point each, so 2 points distributed. Each win/loss game also results in 2 points distributed (2 to the winner and 0 to the loser).

The difference is in the distribution: in a draw, both players get 1 point, while in a win/loss, one gets 2 and the other gets 0.

To maximize the number of draws, I need to maximize the number of times that both players in a game get 1 point each.

Let me denote:

- D: number of draws

- W: number of win/loss games

Total games: G = D + W

Total points: S = 2G = 2(D + W)

But since in draws, each draw contributes 2 points to the total, and in win/loss games, each contributes 2 points as well, the total points equation is satisfied regardless of D and W, as long as G = S / 2.

However, the distribution of points among the players depends on which pairs are drawing and which are having win/loss games.

I need to maximize D, so I need to see how many draws can be fit into the score distribution without violating the given scores.

Let me consider the possible pairs:

There are three players, so there are three possible pairs:

- Player 1 vs Player 2

- Player 1 vs Player 3

- Player 2 vs Player 3

Each pair can play multiple games, which can be draws or win/loss games.

I need to assign a number of draw games and win/loss games to each pair such that the total points for each player match p1, p2, and p3.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the scores.

Since draws give 1 point to each player involved, and win/loss games give 2 to one and 0 to the other, to maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of win/loss games.

In other words, I need to see how many points can be achieved through draws alone.

But it's not that simple because draws involve two players, so assigning draws affects two players' points simultaneously.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the total points and the possible point differentials.

Wait, but the players are sorted in non-decreasing order, so p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

I need to ensure that the distribution is possible under the constraints of the game.

Let me consider the total points S = p1 + p2 + p3. As established, S must be even; otherwise, it's impossible.

Assuming S is even, G = S / 2.

Now, in G games, some number of them are draws, and some are win/loss games.

But I need to maximize D, the number of draws.

To maximize D, I need to minimize W, the number of win/loss games.

What's the minimal number of win/loss games needed to achieve the given scores?

Well, if all games were draws, then each draw would contribute 1 point to two players.

So, in G draws, the total points would be 2G, which matches S.

But in this case, the points would be distributed such that each pair of players who drew together would have their points increased by 1 each time.

However, with only draws, the points could be distributed in various ways depending on which pairs drew against each other.

But since we can have any number of draws between any pairs, as long as the total points add up, it seems plausible.

Wait, but the problem is to maximize the number of draws, given the final scores.

So, perhaps the maximum number of draws is achieved when as many points as possible are distributed in pairs of 1 point each.

But I need to ensure that the individual scores are met.

Wait, maybe I can think of it in terms of the minimal number of win/loss games needed to account for the differences in scores.

Since win/loss games create a difference of 2 points between players involved.

If I can minimize the number of such games, I can maximize the number of draws.

Let me consider the total points again.

Total points S = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G.

Now, in terms of individual scores, each player's score is the sum of the points they gained from all their games.

Each draw involving a player gives them 1 point, and each win gives them 2 points, and each loss gives them 0 points.

This seems a bit tangled.

Maybe I can look at it differently.

Let me consider that each player has a certain number of games they played.

Wait, but in this problem, games are only between two players, and each game involves exactly two players.

So, the number of games each player is involved in can vary.

This seems complex.

Perhaps I should look for some invariant or some property that must hold for the scores to be achievable.

Let me consider the sum of the points again.

S = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G.

Also, since each game contributes exactly 2 points to S, regardless of outcome.

Now, I need to maximize the number of draws, D.

Each draw contributes 2 points to S (1 for each player involved), and each win/loss game also contributes 2 points (2 for the winner and 0 for the loser).

So, in terms of total points, D and W can vary as long as D + W = G.

But the distribution of points among the players depends on which pairs are drawing and which are having win/loss games.

To maximize D, I need to see how many draws can be accommodated given the individual scores.

Let me consider that in draws, the two players involved both gain 1 point each.

So, for a player with score P, the number of draws they are involved in plus twice the number of wins they have equals P.

Wait, more precisely:

Let me define for each player:

- D_i: number of draws involving player i

- W_i: number of win/loss games where player i won

- L_i: number of win/loss games where player i lost

Then, for each player i, their total points are:

P_i = D_i + 2 W_i + 0 L_i = D_i + 2 W_i

Also, the total number of games involving player i is:

G_i = D_i + W_i + L_i

But since there are three players, and each game involves two players, the total number of games G is related to the individual game counts by:

G = (G_1 + G_2 + G_3) / 2

Because each game is counted twice.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the minimal number of win/loss games needed.

Suppose I try to maximize draws, so I try to have as many draws as possible.

In the extreme case, if all games are draws, then each draw involves two players, and each player involved gets 1 point.

So, if G games are all draws, then each player's points would be equal to the number of draws they are involved in.

But since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and points are sorted, I need to assign draws in a way that respects this ordering.

Wait, but it's possible that not all players are involved in the same number of draws.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total possible draws.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the maximum number of draws is equal to the minimum between the sum of the lowest two scores and the total points divided by 2.

Wait, in the sample input, for example:

0 0 0: no games were played, so no draws.

0 1 1: one draw between player 2 and 3, both get 1 point, player 1 has 0.

1 1 1: this seems impossible because if each player has 1 point, that would require each player to be involved in one draw, but with three players, it's not possible to have three draws involving each pair only once.

Wait, no. With three players, you can have three draws: player 1 vs 2, player 1 vs 3, and player 2 vs 3, each draw giving 1 point to each player involved.

So, after three draws, each player would have 2 points, not 1.

Wait, no. Player 1 would have 2 points (from drawing with 2 and 3), player 2 would have 2 points (from drawing with 1 and 3), and player 3 would have 2 points (from drawing with 1 and 2).

So, to have each player with 1 point, it's impossible, because each draw involves two players, so points are always given in pairs.

Hence, the sum of points is always even, which we already checked, but individual points need to be achievable based on the pairings.

In this case, 1 1 1 is impossible, which matches the sample output of -1.

Another sample input: 3 3 3.

Is this possible?

If each player has 3 points, and p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, so p1 = p2 = p3 = 3.

Total S = 9, which is odd, so it's impossible. Indeed, the sample output is -1.

Wait, but 3 is odd, but S = 9, which is odd, so it's impossible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and they are integers, so S must be even, as established earlier.

Wait, in this case, S = 9, which is odd, so it's impossible.

But in the sample input, it's given as -1, which matches.

Another sample input: 1 1 2.

Total S = 4, which is even.

G = 2 games.

How can we achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Option 1: One draw between player 2 and 3, both get 1 point each.

Then, player 1 has 0 points so far.

But player 1 needs 1 point, so need another game involving player 1.

If player 1 draws with player 2, both get 1 point, so player 1 now has 1, player 2 has 2, player 3 has 1.

But p2 should be 1, but in this case, player 2 has 2, which matches p3.

Wait, p3 is supposed to be the highest, which is 2.

So, this seems possible with one draw between 2 and 3, and one draw between 1 and 2.

Total draws: 2.

Hence, the answer is 2.

Another sample input: 3 4 5.

Total S = 12, which is even, G = 6 games.

Need to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Is this possible?

Let's see.

If we have some draws and some win/loss games.

Suppose we have D draws and W win/loss games, with D + W = 6.

We need to maximize D, so minimize W.

What's the minimal W needed to achieve these scores?

I need to see how much the differences in scores can be explained by win/loss games.

The differences are between the players.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the maximal number of draws such that the sum of points is satisfied and individual scores are achievable.

Another way: since each draw contributes 1 point to two players, and each win/loss game contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other.

So, to maximize draws, I need to maximize the number of times that points are distributed in pairs of 1 to two players.

Given that, the total points from draws would be 2D (since each draw contributes 2 points), and from win/loss games would be 2W (since each win/loss game contributes 2 points).

But S = 2D + 2W = 2(G), which is consistent.

But I need to maximize D, which is equivalent to maximizing the number of times points are distributed in pairs of 1 to two players.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of times a player needs to win to achieve their score.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the minimal number of wins required for each player.

For example, for player i, the minimal number of wins needed is ceil(P_i / 2).

Wait, no, since P_i = D_i + 2 W_i, where D_i is the number of draws player i is involved in, and W_i is the number of wins.

To minimize W_i, I can set W_i = floor((P_i - D_i)/2).

Wait, this seems a bit convoluted.

Maybe I can consider the total possible draws.

In the entire set of games, the maximum number of draws is limited by the sum of the minimal pairs' scores.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of draws is equal to the sum of the two smallest scores.

But in the sample input 1 1 2, sum of two smallest scores is 1 + 1 = 2, and the answer is 2.

In the input 0 1 1, sum of two smallest is 0 + 1 = 1, and the answer is 1.

In the input 3 4 5, sum of two smallest is 3 + 4 = 7, but total games G = 6, so the maximum draws would be min(7, 6) = 6, which matches the sample output of 6.

In the input 1 1 10, sum of two smallest is 1 + 1 = 2, and G = (1+1+10)/2 = 6, so min(2, 6) = 2, which matches the sample output of 2.

In the input 0 0 0, sum of two smallest is 0 + 0 = 0, and G = 0, so min(0, 0) = 0, matches the sample output of 0.

In the input 1 1 2, sum of two smallest is 1 + 1 = 2, and G = 2, so min(2, 2) = 2, matches the sample output of 2.

In the input 3 3 3, sum of two smallest is 3 + 3 = 6, but S = 9 is odd, so invalid.

Hence, the formula seems to be: if S is even, then the maximum number of draws is min(x, y), where x = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 and y = p1 + p2; otherwise, -1.

Wait, in the sample input 3 4 5, x = (3+4+5)/2 = 6, y = 3 + 4 = 7, so min(6,7) = 6, which matches the sample output of 6.

In 1 1 10, x = (1+1+10)/2 = 6, y = 1 + 1 = 2, so min(6,2) = 2, matches the sample output of 2.

In 0 0 0, x = 0, y = 0, min(0,0) = 0, matches the sample output of 0.

In 0 1 1, x = 1, y = 0 + 1 = 1, min(1,1) = 1, matches the sample output of 1.

In 1 1 2, x = 2, y = 1 + 1 = 2, min(2,2) = 2, matches the sample output of 2.

In 3 3 3, S = 9 is odd, so -1, matches the sample output of -1.

In 1 1 10, x = 6, y = 1 + 1 = 2, min(6,2) = 2, matches the sample output of 2.

So, it seems that the formula is:

if (p1 + p2 + p3) is even, then maximum draws = min((p1 + p2 + p3)/2, p1 + p2)

else, -1

This seems to align with all the sample inputs.

Hence, the given program implements this logic correctly.

It reads t test cases, and for each test case, reads p1, p2, p3.

If (p1 + p2 + p3) is odd, it prints -1.

Else, it calculates x = (p1 + p2 + p3)//2 and y = p1 + p2, and prints the minimum of x and y.

This matches the reasoning above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
