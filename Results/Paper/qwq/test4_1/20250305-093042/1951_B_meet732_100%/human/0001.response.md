Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2, and then each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line. The cow with the higher rating always wins.

I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow's position exactly once or choose not to swap at all. My goal is to find out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve with this option.

First, I need to understand how the tournament works. Let's consider the matches step by step.

1. **Initial Matches:**

- Match 1: Position 1 vs. Position 2.

- The winner proceeds to Match 2 against Position 3.

- This continues until only one cow remains.

2. **My Objective:**

- Place my cow in a position where it can win as many matches as possible.

- I can swap my cow with any other position once or choose not to swap.

Given that ratings are unique, and higher-rated cows always win, the key is to position my cow such that it faces weaker opponents as long as possible.

Let's think about the tournament structure. It seems like a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

To maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to ensure that it faces the weakest possible opponents in sequence.

Let me consider the original positions and the impact of swapping.

**Approach:**

1. **Original Position:**

- If I don't swap, my cow is in position k.

- I need to see how many wins it can achieve from this position.

2. **Swapping Positions:**

- If I swap my cow with another position, say position i, then my cow is now in position i, and the original cow in position i is in position k.

- I need to see how many wins my cow can achieve from position i.

- I have to choose the position that maximizes my cow's wins.

But swapping involves replacing my cow with another cow's position, meaning that cow now is in position k.

Wait, the problem says: "you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you choose to do nothing."

So, I can swap my cow with any other cow, meaning my cow goes to that position, and the other cow comes to position k.

I need to consider both scenarios: swapping and not swapping, and choose the one that maximizes my cow's wins.

Let me try to model the tournament to count the wins for my cow in different positions.

**Insight:**

- The tournament proceeds in a way that in each match, the current winner faces the next cow in line.

- So, if my cow is in position p, it first plays against position p+1, then the winner plays against p+2, and so on, until it either loses or beats all remaining cows.

- Similarly, if p < k, then the cows after p would need to be considered.

Wait, actually, the tournament structure is fixed based on the positions:

- Match 1: Position 1 vs. Position 2.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs. Position 3.

- Match 3: Winner of Match 2 vs. Position 4.

- ...

- Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs. Position n.

So, it's a sequence where the winner of each match proceeds to face the next cow in line.

Given this structure, if my cow is in position p, I need to see how many matches it can win in this sequence.

But since the matches are sequential, the number of wins depends on how many cows with lower ratings are after position p.

Wait, no. Actually, it's more nuanced.

Let's consider that the tournament is a series of matches where each match is between the current champion and the next cow in line.

So, starting from position 1 vs. 2, then the winner vs. 3, and so on.

But if I swap my cow to a different position, it changes the sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should think about where to place my cow to maximize the number of cows with lower ratings that it can beat in sequence.

Let me consider that if I place my cow at position p, then it will participate in the tournament sequence starting from position p.

Wait, but the tournament sequence is fixed: it starts from position 1 vs. 2, then the winner vs. 3, and so on.

How does swapping my cow to position p affect this sequence?

Upon swapping, my cow is now at position p, and the original cow at position p is now at position k.

So, the tournament sequence remains the same, but the ratings are adjusted accordingly.

This seems complicated to model directly.

Maybe I need to think differently.

**Alternative Approach:**

Instead of thinking about swapping positions, perhaps I can think about the path my cow takes in the tournament and see how to maximize its wins.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, my cow will keep winning as long as it has higher rating than the next cow it faces.

So, if my cow is in position p, it will first face position p+1, then p+2, and so on, until it faces a cow with higher rating.

Wait, but according to the tournament rules, it's not exactly that.

The tournament is structured as follows:

- Match 1: Position 1 vs. Position 2.

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs. Position 3.

- Match 3: Winner of Match 2 vs. Position 4.

- ...

- Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs. Position n.

So, it's a sequence where the champion so far faces the next cow in line.

Given this, if my cow is in position p, then:

- If p == 1, it first plays against position 2.

- If it wins, it becomes the champion and plays against position 3, and so on.

- If p == 2, it plays against position 1 first.

- If it wins, it becomes the champion and plays against position 3, and so on.

- If p > 2, it waits for the champion to reach it.

This seems complex to handle directly.

Maybe I can simulate the tournament for different positions of my cow and see how many wins it gets.

But that would be inefficient for n up to 10^5 per test case, and t up to 10^4.

I need a smarter approach.

**Key Insight:**

The tournament can be viewed as a sequence of matches where the current champion faces the next cow in line.

The number of wins my cow achieves depends on its position and the ratings of the cows before and after it.

I need to find a position where:

- All cows before it are weaker, so it can keep winning against them.

- Or, if there are stronger cows before it, it loses to them, but I want to maximize the wins after its position.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of cows with lower ratings that are after my cow's position.

But it's not that straightforward because the tournament is a sequence, and the champion has to beat the previous cows first.

This is tricky.

Let me think about the maximum number of wins possible for my cow.

In the best case, it can win against all other cows, which would be n-1 wins.

But that would only happen if my cow has the highest rating and is placed in a position where it can face all other cows.

Given that ratings are unique, there is only one cow with the highest rating.

If my cow has the highest rating, then no matter where I place it, it will win all matches until it reaches another cow with higher rating, but since it has the highest, it will win all matches.

Wait, but if it has the highest rating, it will win against any other cow.

So, if my cow has the highest rating, and I place it in position 1, it will win all n-1 matches.

If it's in position 2, and position 1 has a lower rating, it will win n-1 matches.

If position 1 has a higher rating, it will lose in the first match, winning 0 matches.

Wait, no.

Let's say my cow is in position p, and it has the highest rating.

- If p == 1: it wins all n-1 matches.

- If p == 2: it plays against position 1.

- If position 1 has lower rating, my cow wins and becomes champion, then wins n-2 more matches.

- If position 1 has higher rating, my cow loses in the first match.

- So, in this case, it can win n-2 matches if it beats position 1.

- Similarly, if p == 3: it waits for the champion of match 1 to play against it.

- If the champion has lower rating than my cow, my cow wins and proceeds.

- And so on.

So, in general, if my cow has the highest rating and is placed in position p, it can win n - p matches, provided that all cows before it have lower ratings.

Wait, no.

Wait, if my cow has the highest rating and is placed in position p, it will win against any cow it faces, so it can potentially win n - p matches, but it needs to consider the path to reach those matches.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that for my cow to win a match, it needs to be higher than the cow it's facing.

In the tournament sequence, the cow it's facing is determined by the previous matches.

This seems too involved for direct simulation.

**Another Approach:**

Let's consider that in the tournament, the champion accumulates wins as it defeats more cows.

If my cow is in position p, it will face the champion so far when it's its turn.

So, to maximize the wins for my cow, I need to place it in a position where:

- It hasn't been defeated by a stronger cow earlier in the tournament.

- It can face and defeat as many weaker cows as possible after its position.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of how many cows with lower ratings are after my cow's position, and ensure that my cow can reach them by having higher rating than the cows before it.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of wins by considering the number of cows with lower ratings that are after my cow's position, and ensuring that there are no cows with higher ratings between its position and the start.

This might be a way to approach it.

Let me formalize this.

Letâ€™s denote:

- My cow's rating: x.

- Positions from 1 to n.

- I can swap my cow to any position p, and the original cow at position p goes to position k.

I need to choose p to maximize the number of cows with ratings lower than x that my cow can defeat in sequence.

Given the tournament structure, this is not straightforward.

Let me consider the original sequence without any swaps.

If I don't swap, my cow is at position k.

I need to see how many wins it can achieve from position k.

Similarly, if I swap with position p, my cow is at position p, and I need to see how many wins it can achieve from there.

I need to choose the option that gives the maximum wins.

This seems to require calculating the number of wins for my cow in different positions.

But calculating this for each position individually would be too slow for the given constraints.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

**Insight on Tournament Progression:**

Let's consider the tournament progresses as a sequence of matches, building up the champion step by step.

The champion after each match is the winner of that match.

So, in match 1, champion after match 1 is the winner between position 1 and 2.

In match 2, the champion faces position 3, and so on.

So, the champion accumulates wins as it defeats more cows.

If my cow is in position p, it will face the champion when it's its turn.

So, my cow will win if its rating is higher than the champion's rating at that point.

The champion's rating at the time my cow faces it is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

So, for my cow at position p, to win against the champion, its rating must be higher than the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

If it wins, it becomes the new champion and can proceed to face the next cows.

Each time it wins, it defeats one cow.

So, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows it can defeat in sequence, which is equal to the number of cows after its position with lower ratings, plus one if it can defeat the champion so far.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me define:

- Let m be the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

- If x > m, then my cow can defeat the champion so far and proceed to defeat all cows with ratings lower than x in positions p+1 to n.

- So, the number of wins is the number of cows with ratings lower than x from positions p to n, inclusive.

- If x <= m, then my cow cannot defeat the champion so far and wins 0 matches.

So, for a given p, the number of wins for my cow is:

- If x > max(a[1] to a[p-1]), then count of a[i] < x for i from p to n.

- Else, 0.

My task is to choose p to maximize this value.

Similarly, if I don't swap, p = k.

So, I need to consider p = k, and p = any other position, and choose the one that gives the maximum number of wins.

Given that n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an O(n) per test case solution.

Let me think about how to compute this efficiently.

First, for a fixed p, the number of wins is:

- 0, if x <= max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

- count of a[i] < x for i from p to n, otherwise.

I need to maximize this over p.

So, for each p, I need to compute:

- M_p = max(a[1] to a[p-1]).

- S_p = count of a[i] < x for i from p to n.

Then, for each p, if x > M_p, then wins = S_p, else wins = 0.

I need to find the maximum wins over all p.

To compute this efficiently, I need to precompute M_p and S_p for all p.

M_p can be computed in O(n) time by keeping a running maximum from left to right.

S_p can be computed in O(n) time by counting the number of a[i] < x from right to left, using a suffix array.

Then, for each p, I can check if x > M_p and take S_p, else 0, and take the maximum over all p.

This seems efficient enough.

But since t can be up to 10^4, and n up to 10^5 with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need to make sure that my solution is O(n) per test case.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each test case:

a. Read n, k.

b. Read array a of size n.

c. Set x = a[k-1] (since indices are 0-based).

d. Compute M_p for p from 1 to n:

- M_p = max(a[1] to a[p-1])

- M[0] = 0 (no cows before position 1)

- For p from 2 to n:

- M[p] = max(M[p-1], a[p-1])

e. Compute S_p for p from 1 to n:

- S_p = count of a[i] < x for i from p to n

- Can compute this by starting from p = n and going to p = 1, keeping a running count of a[i] < x.

f. For each p from 1 to n:

- If x > M[p-1], then wins[p] = S_p

- Else, wins[p] = 0

- Take the maximum over wins[p]

g. Also consider not swapping, which is p = k.

Wait, actually, when swapping, my cow goes to position p, and the original cow at position p goes to position k.

Wait, the problem says: "you can ask them to swap the position of your cow with another cow only once, or you choose to do nothing."

So, swapping means choosing another position p, and swapping your cow with the cow at position p.

So, after swapping:

- Your cow is at position p.

- The original cow at position p is now at position k.

But in the tournament, only the positions matter for the matches.

So, for the tournament, it's as if your cow is at position p, and the rest are adjusted accordingly.

But to simplify, perhaps I can think that after swapping, the array a is updated with a[k] and a[p] swapped.

Then, the tournament proceeds with the new array a.

But this might not be the most efficient way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider two scenarios:

1. Not swapping: my cow is at position k.

2. Swapping: my cow is at position p, and the original cow at position p is at position k.

But perhaps it's better to think that after swapping, my cow is at position p, and I need to compute the number of wins from there.

But I need to make sure that the tournament proceeds correctly with the new positions.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to find a better way.

**Alternative Insight:**

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the number of wins for my cow depends on its rating and the ratings of the cows before it in the sequence.

Specifically, in the tournament sequence, my cow can only win if it is higher than all the cows before it in the sequence.

Wait, no. Actually, it needs to be higher than the current champion.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p for my cow.

Then, in the tournament, my cow will face the champion so far when it's its turn.

The champion so far is the maximum of the cows from positions 1 to p-1.

If my cow's rating is higher than this champion, it wins and becomes the new champion, and can proceed to face the remaining cows.

The number of wins it gets is equal to the number of cows after it (from p+1 to n) that have lower ratings than it, plus one for winning against the champion.

But, only if it can defeat the champion.

So, the total wins are:

- 1 (for defeating the champion) + the number of cows after it with lower ratings, provided that it can defeat the champion.

Wait, but actually, defeating the champion is a prerequisite to even get to win against the remaining cows.

So, the total wins are:

- If x > M_p, where M_p is the maximum rating from positions 1 to p-1, then the number of wins is the number of cows from p to n with rating less than x.

- Else, 0 wins.

Because if it can't defeat the champion, it wins 0 matches.

So, for each p, the wins are:

- If x > M_p, then wins = number of cows from p to n with a[i] < x.

- Else, wins = 0.

I need to choose p to maximize this wins.

Additionally, I have the option of not swapping, which is equivalent to p = k.

So, I need to consider all possible p (from 1 to n) and choose the maximum wins among them, including p = k.

Given that, I can precompute M_p and S_p for all p, as described earlier.

Then, for each p, compute wins[p] as:

- If x > M_p, then wins[p] = S_p

- Else, wins[p] = 0

Then, the answer is the maximum wins[p] over all p.

This seems correct.

Let me verify it with the sample input.

**Sample Input 1:**

6 1

12 10 14 11 8 3

So, n=6, k=1, x=a[0]=12

Compute M_p:

M[0] = 0

M[1] = max(0, a[0]) = 12

M[2] = max(12, a[1]) = 12

M[3] = max(12, a[2]) = 14

M[4] = max(14, a[3]) = 14

M[5] = max(14, a[4]) = 14

M[6] = max(14, a[5]) = 14

Compute S_p:

Count of a[i] < 12 from p to n:

p=1: a[0:5] <12: a[1]=10, a[4]=8, a[5]=3 => 3

p=2: a[1:5] <12: a[1]=10, a[4]=8, a[5]=3 => 3

p=3: a[2:5] <12: a[2]=14 (>=12), a[4]=8, a[5]=3 => 2

p=4: a[3:5] <12: a[3]=11 <12, a[4]=8, a[5]=3 => 3

p=5: a[4:5] <12: a[4]=8 <12, a[5]=3 <12 => 2

p=6: a[5:5] <12: a[5]=3 <12 =>1

Now, for each p:

p=1: x=12 > M[0]=0 => wins = S[1]=3

p=2: x=12 > M[1]=12 => no, wins=0

p=3: x=12 < M[2]=14 => wins=0

p=4: x=12 < M[3]=14 => wins=0

p=5: x=12 > M[4]=14 => no

p=6: x=12 > M[5]=14 => no

So, maximum wins is 3.

But in the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, this contradicts the sample.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement:

- The first match is between position 1 and 2.

- Then, the winner plays against position 3, and so on.

- My cow is initially at position k, and I can swap it with another position once.

- I need to maximize the number of wins my cow achieves.

In the first test case:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

If I don't swap, my cow is at position 1.

- Match 1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10): 12 wins.

- Match 2: pos1 (12) vs pos3 (14): 14 wins.

- My cow wins 1 match.

If I swap pos1 and pos3:

- a becomes [14,10,12,11,8,3]

- Match 1: 14 vs 10: 14 wins.

- Match 2: 14 vs 12: 14 wins.

- Match 3: 14 vs 11: 14 wins.

- Match 4: 14 vs 8: 14 wins.

- Match 5: 14 vs 3: 14 wins.

- My cow (12) doesn't participate.

Wait, but according to the problem, swapping my cow with another position means my cow goes to that position, and the original cow at that position goes to position k.

So, in this case, swapping pos1 and pos3:

- My cow (12) is now at pos1.

- Original cow at pos1 (14) is now at pos3.

- So, a becomes [12,10,14,11,8,3]

Wait, same as original.

Wait, no. If I swap pos1 and pos3:

- pos1: 14

- pos2:10

- pos3:12

- pos4:11

- pos5:8

- pos6:3

Wait, but according to the problem, swapping my cow (pos1) with pos3 means:

- My cow goes to pos3.

- Original cow at pos3 goes to pos1.

So, a becomes [14,10,12,11,8,3]

Then, the tournament proceeds as:

- Match1: 14 vs 10: 14 wins.

- Match2: 14 vs 12: 14 wins.

- Match3: 14 vs 11: 14 wins.

- Match4: 14 vs 8: 14 wins.

- Match5: 14 vs 3: 14 wins.

- My cow (12) is at pos3, wins against 10, then against 14 in the next match.

Wait, no.

Wait, in this setup, my cow is at pos3.

- Match1: pos1 (14) vs pos2 (10): 14 wins.

- Match2: pos1 (14) vs pos3 (12): 14 wins.

- Match3: pos1 (14) vs pos4 (11): 14 wins.

- Match4: pos1 (14) vs pos5 (8): 14 wins.

- Match5: pos1 (14) vs pos6 (3): 14 wins.

- So, my cow at pos3 only gets to play in match2: 12 vs 14, loses.

- So, wins =1.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, without swapping, wins=1.

If I swap pos1 and pos3, then my cow is at pos3, and it only wins once.

So, same as not swapping.

Is there a better swap?

Let's try swapping pos1 and pos4.

- a becomes [11,10,12,14,8,3]

- Match1:11 vs10:11 wins.

- Match2:11 vs12:12 wins.

- Match3:12 vs14:14 wins.

- Match4:14 vs8:14 wins.

- Match5:14 vs3:14 wins.

- My cow at pos4 (14) wins against8 and3, so wins=2.

Wait, but my cow is at pos4, which is14, not12.

Wait, no. If I swap pos1 and pos4:

- My cow (12) goes to pos4.

- Original cow at pos4 (11) goes to pos1.

- So, a becomes [11,10,12,14,8,3]

- Match1:11 vs10:11 wins.

- Match2:11 vs12:12 wins.

- Match3:12 vs14:14 wins.

- Match4:14 vs8:14 wins.

- Match5:14 vs3:14 wins.

- My cow at pos4 (14) wins against8 and3, so wins=2.

But my cow is12, which is at pos3.

Wait, no.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in this swap, my cow (12) is moved to pos4.

- So, a[pos4] =12.

- Original a[pos4] =11 moves to pos1.

- So, a=[11,10,12,14,8,3]

- Now, my cow is at pos4 (14).

Wait, no.

Wait, I think I'm misinterpreting the swap.

The problem says: "swap the position of your cow with another cow".

So, swap my cow (at pos k=1) with another cow (say, at pos p=4).

- My cow moves to pos4.

- The original cow at pos4 moves to pos1.

So, a becomes [11,10,12,12,8,3]

Wait, no.

Wait, a[pos1]=11, a[pos4]=14.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Let me consider that after swapping, my cow is at position p, and the original cow at position p is now at position k.

So, in the tournament, my cow is at position p, and the rest of the cows are adjusted accordingly.

But this seems too convoluted.

Maybe I need to consider that swapping allows me to place my cow in any position, and then see how many wins it can achieve from there, considering the tournament structure.

Given the complexity, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

**Alternative Approach:**

Let me consider that in the tournament, the number of wins for my cow is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that it can defeat in sequence, starting from its position.

Given the tournament structure, this is equivalent to:

- If my cow is at position p, it needs to be higher than the champion so far (max of positions 1 to p-1).

- If it is, it can then proceed to defeat all cows with lower ratings in positions p+1 to n.

So, the number of wins is:

- If x > max(a[1] to a[p-1]), then the number of cows with a[i] < x from p to n.

- Else, 0.

Then, I need to choose p to maximize this value.

To compute this efficiently, I can:

1. Precompute M_p = max(a[1] to a[p-1]) for all p.

2. Precompute S_p = count of a[i] < x for i from p to n.

3. For each p, if x > M_p, then wins = S_p, else wins = 0.

4. Take the maximum wins over all p.

This seems correct.

In the first sample input:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

x=12

Compute M_p:

M[0] = 0

M[1] = 0

M[2] = 12

M[3] = 12

M[4] = 14

M[5] = 14

M[6] = 14

Compute S_p:

S[1] = count of a[0:5] <12: a[1]=10,<12; a[2]=14,>=12; a[3]=11,<12; a[4]=8,<12; a[5]=3,<12 => total 4

Wait, but in the earlier calculation, I had S[1]=3, but that was incorrect.

Wait, let's recount:

a[0]=12, a[1]=10,<12; a[2]=14,>=12; a[3]=11,<12; a[4]=8,<12; a[5]=3,<12.

So, a[1], a[3], a[4], a[5] <12 => 4 cows.

Similarly:

S[2]: a[1:5] <12: a[1]=10,<12; a[2]=14,>=12; a[3]=11,<12; a[4]=8,<12; a[5]=3,<12 => 4

S[3]: a[2:5] <12: a[2]=14,>=12; a[3]=11,<12; a[4]=8,<12; a[5]=3,<12 => 3

S[4]: a[3:5] <12: a[3]=11,<12; a[4]=8,<12; a[5]=3,<12 => 3

S[5]: a[4:5] <12: a[4]=8,<12; a[5]=3,<12 => 2

S[6]: a[5:5] <12: a[5]=3,<12 =>1

Now, for each p:

p=1: x=12 > M[0]=0 => wins = S[1]=4

p=2: x=12 > M[1]=0 => wins = S[2]=4

p=3: x=12 < M[2]=12 => wins =0

p=4: x=12 < M[3]=14 => wins=0

p=5: x=12 < M[4]=14 => wins=0

p=6: x=12 < M[5]=14 => wins=0

So, maximum wins is 4.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

This discrepancy suggests that my approach is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the wins.

In the sample explanation, without swapping, my cow is at position1.

- Match1: pos1 (12) vs pos2 (10): 12 wins.

- Match2: pos1 (12) vs pos3 (14): 14 wins.

- My cow wins 1 match.

If I swap pos1 and pos3:

- a becomes [14,10,12,11,8,3]

- Match1:14 vs10:14 wins.

- Match2:14 vs12:14 wins.

- Match3:14 vs11:14 wins.

- Match4:14 vs8:14 wins.

- Match5:14 vs3:14 wins.

- My cow (12) is at pos3, wins against10, then against14.

Wait, no.

Wait, in this setup, my cow is at pos3 (12), and the tournament proceeds with pos1 (14) vs pos2 (10): 14 wins.

Then, pos1 (14) vs pos3 (12): 14 wins.

Then, pos1 (14) vs pos4 (11):14 wins.

Then, pos1 (14) vs pos5 (8):14 wins.

Then, pos1 (14) vs pos6 (3):14 wins.

So, my cow at pos3 only gets to play in Match2:12 vs14, loses.

So, wins=1.

Similarly, in my earlier calculation, I got wins=4, which is incorrect.

So, my approach is flawed.

What's the mistake?

The mistake is that in the tournament structure, my cow at position p only gets to play if it is the champion so far or if it is the next in line.

But in reality, in this tournament structure, once a cow loses, it's out, and the champion proceeds.

So, my earlier assumption that the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings after it is incorrect.

I need to consider the actual sequence of matches.

This seems more involved.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps I can consider that my cow can only win against the cows that are reachable from its position, considering the tournament structure.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look at the provided code and see if I can understand its logic.

**Provided Code:**

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

k -= 1

print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):

x = a[k]

ind = []

c = 0

for i in range(n):

if a[i] > x:

ind.append(i)

c += 1

if c == 2:

break

if ind == []:

return n - 1

if len(ind) == 1:

if ind[0] == 0:

return k - 1

if ind[0] > k:

return ind[0] - 1

return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)

if ind[0] == 0:

return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)

if k > ind[1]:

return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])

return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



**Analysis of Provided Code:**

The function func_1 seems to be trying to find the positions of the cows with ratings higher than x (my cow's rating).

It collects the positions of the first two cows with higher ratings than x.

If there are no cows with higher ratings, it returns n-1, meaning my cow can win all matches.

If there is only one cow with higher rating:

- If that cow is at position 0, then it returns k-1.

- If that cow is after position k, it returns ind[0] -1.

- Else, it returns the maximum of (k - ind[0], ind[0] -1).

If there are two cows with higher ratings:

- If the first one is at position 0, it returns the minimum of (ind[1]-1, k-1).

- If k is after ind[1], it returns the maximum of (ind[0]-1, ind[1]-ind[0]).

- Else, it returns the maximum of (ind[0]-1, k - ind[0]).

This seems like an attempt to calculate the maximum number of wins based on the positions of the stronger cows.

I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let's consider the first sample input:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

x=12

Find positions where a[i] >12:

a[2]=14 >12 => ind=[2]

Only one cow with higher rating.

Since len(ind)==1, and ind[0]=2 > k=1, it returns ind[0]-1=1.

Which is 1, matching the sample output.

Good.

Another sample input:

n=6, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

x=12

Find positions where a[i]>12:

a[2]=727 >12 => ind=[2]

Only one cow with higher rating.

len(ind)==1, ind[0]=2 < k=5, so it returns max(k - ind[0], ind[0]-1) = max(3,1)=3.

But according to the sample explanation, the maximum wins are 2.

So, there is a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to look deeper.

In the second sample, with k=5, x=12.

If I swap to position3:

a becomes [7,2,12,10,727,13]

Then:

- Match1:7 vs2:7 wins.

- Match2:7 vs12:12 wins.

- Match3:12 vs10:12 wins.

- Match4:12 vs727:727 wins.

- Match5:727 vs13:727 wins.

- My cow at position3 (12) wins twice.

So, wins=2.

If I don't swap, my cow is at position5 (12):

- Match1:7 vs2:7 wins.

- Match2:7 vs3 (position3=727):727 wins.

- Match3:727 vs4 (10):727 wins.

- Match4:727 vs5 (12):727 wins.

- Match5:727 vs6 (13):727 wins.

- My cow at position5 only wins once.

So, swapping to position3 gives 2 wins, which is better.

But according to the code, for k=5, x=12, ind=[2], and since ind[0]=2 < k=5, it returns max(5-2,2-1)=max(3,1)=3.

But in reality, the maximum wins are 2, not 3.

So, the code seems incorrect in this case.

Hence, the code is flawed.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
