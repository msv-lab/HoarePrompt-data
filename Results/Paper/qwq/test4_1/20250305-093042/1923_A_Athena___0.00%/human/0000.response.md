Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either has a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what a "single block" means. It means all the chips are together with no gaps between them. So, if I have chips at positions 1, 3, and 4, that's a block because there's no free cell between them. But if I have chips at 1, 3, and 5, there are free cells between them, so it's not a single block.

Okay, so the task is to make sure all the chips are together without any gaps by moving them to the left into free cells, and I need to do this with as few moves as possible.

Let's look at the example provided:

Input:

5

8

0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

6

0 1 0 0 0 0

6

1 1 1 1 1 1

5

1 0 1 0 1

9

0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output:

1

0

0

2

3

In the first case, n=8, and the cells are: 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

So, chips are at positions 2,3,4,6,7.

To make them a single block, I need to have them together without any gaps. One way to do this is to move the chip from position 7 to position 5, which is the closest free cell to the left. After this move, the cells would be: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. Now, all chips are together from position 2 to position 6. So, only one move is needed, which matches the first output.

In the second case, n=6, cells: 0 1 0 0 0 0

Here, only one chip at position 2, and the rest are free. Since there's only one chip, it's already a block by itself, so no moves are needed. Output is 0.

Third case, n=6, cells: 1 1 1 1 1 1

All cells have chips, no free cells, so it's already a single block. Output is 0.

Fourth case, n=5, cells: 1 0 1 0 1

Chips at positions 1,3,5.

To make them a single block, I need to move the chip from position 5 to position 2 or 4. But moving to position 4 is closer. After moving from 5 to 4, cells become: 1 0 1 1 0. Now, chips are at 1,3,4. This is a single block because there are no free cells between them. So, one move. But the output says 2. Hmm, maybe I need to consider moving the chip from position 3 to position 2 as well to make them more compact. So, moving from 5 to 4 (first move), then from 3 to 2 (second move), resulting in cells: 1 1 1 1 0. Now, all chips are together from position 1 to 4. So, two moves are needed. That matches the output.

Fifth case, n=9, cells: 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Chips at positions 2,3,7,8.

To make them a single block, I need to move the chips at 7 and 8 to positions 4 and 5. So, moving chip from 8 to 5, and chip from 7 to 4. That would take two moves. But the output is 3. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's see: moving chip from 8 to 5 (first move), cells become: 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0. Now, chips are at 2,3,5,7. Still not a single block. Then, move chip from 7 to 4 (second move): 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0. Now, chips are at 2,3,4,5. It's a single block. So, two moves are enough, but the output is 3. Maybe there's a constraint I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the operation allows moving only one chip at a time to the closest free cell to the left, and I have to consider the sequence of moves accordingly. Let's try again.

Starting with: 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

First, choose the chip at position 8 and move it to position 5 (closest free cell to the left): 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0

Now, choose the chip at position 7 and move it to position 4: 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0

Now, all chips are at positions 2,3,4,5. It's a single block. Two moves in total.

But the output is 3, so perhaps I need to make an additional move. Maybe I need to move the chip at position 3 to position 6 or something? Wait, no. If I have chips at 2,3,4,5 after two moves, that's already a single block. So maybe the output is wrong, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem.

Wait, maybe the operation is to move a chip to the closest free cell to the left, but I have to choose which chip to move each time based on some criteria.

Let me look back at the problem statement.

"choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the left of it."

So, I can choose any chip that has at least one free cell to its left and move it to the closest free cell to the left.

My goal is to have all chips form a single block with no free cells between them, and find the minimum number of operations to achieve that.

I need to find a way to make the chips contiguous with no gaps.

Looking back at the fourth example:

n=5, cells: 1 0 1 0 1

Chips at positions 1,3,5.

To make them a single block, I need to have them at positions 1,2,3 or 3,4,5.

If I move the chip from position 5 to position 2, cells become: 1 1 1 0 0. That's a single block. Only one move.

But the output is 2, which suggests that perhaps moving from position 5 to position 2 is not allowed, or it's not considered the "closest free cell to the left."

Wait, what's the definition of "closest free cell to the left"?

Does it mean the nearest free cell to the left of the current position?

In the case of position 5, the free cells to the left are positions 2 and 4. The closest to position 5 is position 4.

So, moving from position 5 to position 4 is one move: cells become 1 0 1 1 0.

Now, chips are at positions 1,3,4.

This is still not a single block because there's a free cell at position 2.

So, I need to make another move. Now, I can move the chip at position 3 to position 2: cells become 1 1 1 1 0.

Now, all chips are at positions 1,2,3,4. It's a single block. So, two moves in total, which matches the output.

So, in this case, moving directly from position 5 to position 2 is not allowed because it's not the closest free cell to the left. The closest free cell to the left of position 5 is position 4.

Hence, I have to move step by step to the closest free cell to the left each time.

That makes sense now.

So, the operation is to move a chip to the closest free cell to the left, which is the immediate free cell to the left, if any.

Wait, no. "closest" likely means the nearest in distance, not necessarily the immediate adjacent cell.

Wait, in the first example, moving from position 7 to position 5 makes sense because position 5 is the closest free cell to the left of position 7.

Similarly, in the fourth example, from position 5 to position 4, then from position 3 to position 2.

So, in each operation, I choose a chip and move it to the closest available free cell to its left.

My goal is to arrange all chips into a contiguous block with no free cells between them, using the least number of such operations.

Now, to solve this, I need a way to determine the target positions for the chips and calculate the number of operations required to move them there.

One approach is to find the leftmost and rightmost chips and ensure that all cells between them are occupied.

But, since I can only move chips to the left, I need to make sure that the leftmost chip doesn't move, and I bring all other chips to the left side as much as possible.

Wait, but in the first example, the leftmost chip is at position 2, and the rightmost is at position 7. To make them a single block, I can move the rightmost chip to the left.

But I need a systematic way to calculate the minimum number of moves.

Perhaps I can find the position where the chips should be concentrated.

One way is to find the leftmost chip and bring all other chips to the right of it, filling up the free cells to the left if possible.

Wait, but movement is only to the left.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should find the rightmost position where the chips can be placed to form a block.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have all the positions of the chips. I need to arrange them so that they are contiguous with no gaps.

I can think of the target positions as a consecutive sequence of cells starting from some position and ending at some position, with all cells in between containing chips.

I need to choose the starting and ending positions such that the number of moves to rearrange the chips into this block is minimized.

But since I can only move chips to the left, the right boundary of the block should be to the left of or equal to the current rightmost chip.

Wait, perhaps it's better to fix the number of chips and find the window of size equal to the number of chips that covers all the chips, and then calculate the number of moves required to bring them into a block.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of it in terms of the final positions of the chips.

Suppose I have k chips. I need to choose k consecutive cells to place them, with no free cells in between.

Then, I need to calculate the number of moves required to move each chip to its new position in this block.

Since I can only move chips to the left, the final positions should be to the left of their current positions.

Wait, but in the examples, sometimes moving to the left is sufficient to form a block.

Maybe I should sort the positions of the chips and try to form a block starting from the leftmost chip.

Let me try that.

Take the positions of the chips, sort them, and see what's the minimal number of moves to make them contiguous.

For example, in the first case: positions 2,3,4,6,7.

Sort them: 2,3,4,6,7.

I want to form a block of 5 consecutive cells.

Possible blocks: positions 2-6, 3-7.

In the first case, moving from 7 to 5 would make positions 2,3,4,5,6. That's one move.

In the fourth case: positions 1,3,5.

Sort them: 1,3,5.

To form a block of 3 consecutive cells.

Possible blocks: 1-3, 2-4, 3-5.

To reach 1-3: move from 5 to 2 and from 3 is already at 3. So, one move.

But the output is 2, which suggests that perhaps moving from 5 to 2 is not allowed in one operation, or it's not possible in one move.

Wait, but in the first example, moving from 7 to 5 is allowed in one operation.

Maybe because there's a free cell at 5.

Wait, in the fourth example, moving from 5 to 2: is 2 free at that moment?

Initially, position 2 has a chip, but I'm moving from 5 to 2, which would make position 5 free and position 2 have two chips, but the problem seems to allow multiple chips in a cell.

Wait, the problem says "each cell either contains a chip or is free." So, multiple chips per cell are allowed.

But in the operation, moving a chip to a free cell, that cell becomes occupied by that chip, assuming it was free before.

Wait, no, the operation is: choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left.

So, you select a chip, find the closest free cell to the left, and move it there.

The cell where it was before becomes free.

And the cell where it moves to may already have a chip, but since multiple chips per cell are allowed, it's okay.

Wait, actually, the problem says "each cell either contains a chip or is free." So, it seems that a cell can have at most one chip.

Looking back at the problem statement: "each cell either contains a chip or is free."

And in the operation: "choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left."

So, it seems that each cell can have at most one chip.

Therefore, when moving a chip to a free cell, that cell must be free.

Hence, in the fourth example, moving from 5 to 2 is not allowed because position 2 already has a chip.

So, I cannot move to a cell that already has a chip.

Therefore, in the fourth example, I need to move from 5 to 4, then from 3 to 2, resulting in two moves.

That makes sense now.

So, in each operation, I can only move a chip to a free cell to the left, not to a cell that already has a chip.

Hence, in the fifth example, with positions 2,3,7,8, to make them a single block, I need to move 8 to 5, then 7 to 4, then 3 to 2, totaling three moves.

That matches the output of 3.

Okay, now I understand the problem better.

So, to solve this, I need a way to calculate the minimal number of moves required to make all chips contiguous, moving only to the left, and only into free cells.

One way to approach this is:

1. Find the leftmost chip; it will be the start of the block.

2. Then, for each chip to the right of this start position, if there are free cells between it and the block, move it to the closest free cell to the left, iteratively, until all chips are in the block.

But this seems vague.

Perhaps a better way is to sort the positions of the chips and calculate how many moves are needed to fill the gaps between them.

Wait, but since movement is only to the left, I need to adjust the positions accordingly.

Let me think of it in terms of the final positions.

Suppose I have k chips.

I need to choose k consecutive cells for them, starting from some position s to s+k-1, such that all these cells are occupied, and no free cells are between them.

Since I can only move chips to the left, the starting position s must be less than or equal to the current leftmost chip.

Then, for each chip, I need to move it to one of the positions in this block, specifically to the leftmost possible position in the block that's free.

But this seems complicated.

An alternative approach is to realize that the minimal number of moves is equal to the number of gaps between the chips.

Wait, but in the fourth example, there are two gaps between chips at positions 1,3,5, and it takes two moves to eliminate the gaps.

Similarly, in the first example, there is one gap between positions 4 and 6, which is eliminated in one move.

In the fifth example, there are three gaps between positions 3 and 7, which are eliminated in three moves.

So, perhaps the number of moves required is equal to the number of gaps between chips.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me define a "gap" as a sequence of consecutive free cells between two chips.

In the fourth example, positions 1,3,5 have chips, so gaps are between 1 and 3 (positions 2), and between 3 and 5 (position 4).

So, two gaps, and it takes two moves to eliminate them.

In the first example, positions 2,3,4,6,7 have chips, so there's one gap between 4 and 6 (position 5).

Hence, one move.

In the fifth example, positions 2,3,7,8 have chips, so gaps are between 3 and 7 (positions 4,5,6).

Hence, three gaps, and it takes three moves.

Wait, but in the fourth example, there are two gaps, and it takes two moves.

Similarly, in the fifth example, three gaps, three moves.

In the first example, one gap, one move.

So, it seems that the number of moves required is equal to the number of gaps between chips.

Hence, to find the number of gaps, I can count the number of times a chip is followed by a free cell.

Wait, but in the fourth example, the sequence is 1,0,1,0,1.

There are two transitions from chip to free cell.

Similarly, in the fifth example, 0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0 has three transitions from chip to free cell (positions 3 to 4, 7 to 8, and 8 to 9).

Wait, but according to the earlier analysis, it should be three moves for five example.

Wait, no, in the fifth example, the transitions from chip to free cell are:

- Position 3 to 4: 1 to 0

- Position 7 to 8: 1 to 0

- Position 8 to 9: 1 to 0

That's three transitions, matching the three moves.

In the fourth example, transitions are:

- Position 1 to 2: 1 to 0

- Position 3 to 4: 1 to 0

So, two transitions, matching the two moves.

In the first example:

Positions: 0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0

Transitions:

- 1 to 0 between positions 4 and 5

- 1 to 0 between positions 7 and 8

So, two transitions, but according to the example, only one move is needed.

Wait, this contradicts my earlier hypothesis.

So, perhaps counting the number of transitions from chip to free cell is not the correct way to count the moves.

Alternatively, maybe it's the number of free cells between chips.

In the first example, there's one free cell between positions 4 and 6.

Hence, one free cell, one move.

In the fourth example, there are two free cells between positions 1,3,5.

Hence, two free cells, two moves.

In the fifth example, there are three free cells between positions 3 and 7.

Hence, three moves.

But wait, in the fourth example, positions 2 and 4 are free, so two free cells, two moves.

In the first example, only one free cell between positions 4 and 6, but in the sequence, there are two transitions from chip to free cell: between 4 and 5, and between 7 and 8.

But according to the example, only one move is needed.

So, perhaps it's not simply the number of free cells or transitions.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the positions of the chips.

Suppose I have the positions of the chips sorted.

Let's denote the positions as p1, p2, ..., pk, where p1 < p2 < ... < pk.

I need to move these chips to a block of k consecutive cells.

Since I can only move chips to the left, the block must be to the left of p1.

Wait, no, the block can be between p1 and p1 + k - 1, assuming p1 is the leftmost position.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that the final positions will be a set of k consecutive cells.

I need to choose which k consecutive cells to be occupied by the chips.

Given that I can only move chips to the left, the right boundary of the block cannot be to the right of the current rightmost chip.

Wait, actually, I can move chips to the left, so the block can be to the left of the current rightmost chip.

But to minimize the number of moves, it's better to choose a block that maximizes the number of chips already in place.

Perhaps the optimal block is the one that overlaps as much as possible with the current positions of the chips.

So, I can iterate through all possible blocks of size k and choose the one that requires the fewest moves.

But since n can be up to 50 and t up to 1000, this should be efficient enough.

Wait, n up to 50 and t up to 1000, so maximum 50*1000=5000 operations, which is acceptable.

So, here's the plan:

- For each test case, read n and the array a.

- Find all positions of chips.

- Let k be the number of chips.

- Find all possible blocks of k consecutive cells.

- For each possible block, calculate the number of chips that are already in the block positions.

- The number of moves required is k minus the number of chips already in the block.

- Choose the block that minimizes this number.

- Output this minimal number of moves.

Wait, but since I can only move chips to the left, I cannot move chips to the right to fill the block.

So, I need to ensure that the block is to the left of the current positions of the chips.

Wait, no, I can move chips to the left, but the block can be to the right as long as I move chips from right to left to fill it.

But given that I can only move chips to the left, the block should be to the right or in the current positions.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the block starting from position s to s+k-1.

I need to make sure that all chips are moved into these positions, with each chip moving only to the left.

So, for each chip, its target position should be to the left of or equal to its current position.

But this seems too broad.

Perhaps it's better to sort the positions of the chips and try to make them contiguous from the leftmost position.

Let me try that.

Suppose I have positions p1, p2, ..., pk sorted.

I can try to move p1 to p1 (no move), p2 to p1+1, p3 to p1+2, and so on.

If any of these target positions are already occupied by a chip, I cannot move there because the cell must be free.

Wait, but since I'm moving chips to the left, and the target positions are to the left of their current positions, I need to make sure that the target positions are free at the time of moving.

This seems too involved.

Maybe I should consider the difference between the current positions and the target positions.

Let me consider that the target positions are s, s+1, ..., s+k-1 for some s.

I need to choose s such that s+k-1 <= n, and then calculate the number of moves required to move the chips into these positions.

Each chip must be moved to one of these positions, moving only to the left.

To minimize the number of moves, I should choose s such that as many chips as possible are already in the target positions or can be moved to them with minimal effort.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in similar problems, calculating the median of the positions and moving elements to be centered around the median can minimize the number of moves.

But in this case, since movement is restricted to the left, it might not directly apply.

Wait, perhaps I can find the leftmost position where the block can be placed and calculate the number of moves required to move all chips to that block, moving only to the left.

Let me try that.

First, find the leftmost position where the block can be placed.

That would be the smallest s such that there are k consecutive cells from s to s+k-1, and all these cells are either free or occupied by chips that don't need to move.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider trimming the array to only the relevant parts.

I can remove leading and trailing zeros because they don't affect the block formation.

Wait, perhaps that's a good approach.

Trim the array from the left and right to remove leading and trailing zeros.

Then, in the trimmed array, count the number of free cells.

The number of moves required would be equal to the number of free cells in the trimmed array.

Because each free cell in the trimmed array needs to be filled by moving a chip from the right to the left to fill that free cell.

Wait, let's see.

In the first example:

Original array: 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

Trimmed array: 1 1 1 0 1 1

Number of free cells in trimmed array: 1

Hence, one move.

In the fourth example:

Original array: 1 0 1 0 1

Trimmed array: 1 0 1 0 1

Number of free cells: 2

Hence, two moves.

In the fifth example:

Original array: 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Trimmed array: 1 1 0 0 0 1 1

Number of free cells: 3

Hence, three moves.

In the second example:

Original array: 0 1 0 0 0 0

Trimmed array: 1 0 0 0 0

Number of free cells: 4

But according to the output, it should be 0 because it's already a block.

Wait, but according to this approach, it would be 4 moves, which doesn't match the output of 0.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, no, in the second example, the trimmed array is from position 2 to position 6: 1 0 0 0 0

But the chips are already in a block because there are no free cells between them? Wait, no, there is only one chip at position 2, so it's already a block.

But according to the trimmed array, there are four free cells, which would suggest four moves are needed, but actually, no moves are needed because it's already a block.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

So, trimming the array isn't sufficient.

I need a better way.

Let me think about the positions of the chips again.

Suppose I sort the positions of the chips: p1, p2, ..., pk.

I need to move them to k consecutive positions.

The minimal number of moves is equal to the number of chips not already in their target positions.

But I need to define what the target positions are.

Wait, perhaps the target positions should be from p1 to p1+k-1.

Since I can only move chips to the left, I need to move the chips that are to the right of p1+k-1 to the left, into free positions.

So, the number of moves would be the number of chips that are greater than p1+k-1.

Wait, let's test this.

In the first example:

Positions: 2,3,4,6,7

k=5

p1=2

Target positions: 2,3,4,5,6

Chips at positions 6 and 7 need to be moved to 5 and 6.

Wait, but in the example, moving from 7 to 5 is one move, and 6 is already in the target positions.

So, only one move is needed, which matches the output.

In the fourth example:

Positions:1,3,5

k=3

Target positions:1,2,3

Chips at positions 5 need to be moved to position 2.

But position 2 is already occupied by a chip, but since multiple chips are allowed, it's okay.

Hence, one move.

But according to the output, it's two moves.

So, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, maybe moving a chip to a position that already has a chip isn't allowed, but according to the problem, multiple chips can be in one cell.

But in that case, moving from 5 to 2 would be allowed, and only one move is needed.

But the output is 2, so perhaps moving to a cell that already has a chip doesn't count as making the block contiguous.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that in the final configuration, all cells in the block have at least one chip, with no free cells in between.

But if I move from 5 to 2, and have chips at positions 1,2,3,4, with position 4 having multiple chips, but position 5 is free, which is outside the block.

Wait, maybe I need to make sure that the block is exactly k consecutive cells with no free cells in between, and each cell in the block has at least one chip.

So, in the fourth example, moving from 5 to 2 gives me positions 1,2,3,4, with position 4 having two chips, and position 5 is free.

But the block is from position 1 to 4, which has no free cells in between, and positions 1,2,3,4 have chips.

But the block should be of size k=3, but I have four positions filled.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the target block size to exactly k cells.

So, in the fourth example, target block is 1,2,3.

I need to have chips at 1,2,3, with no free cells in between.

I have chips at 1,3,5.

So, to place them at 1,2,3:

- Move from 5 to 2: one move.

- Now, positions are 1,2,3, with chips at 1,2,3.

- It's a single block with no free cells between them.

- So, one move is sufficient.

But according to the output, it's two moves.

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe moving a chip to a cell that already has a chip counts as an additional move.

Wait, no, the problem allows multiple chips in a cell.

Alternatively, perhaps the operation is to move a single chip to the closest free cell to the left, and this must be done sequentially.

So, in the fourth example:

Initial: 1,0,1,0,1

Move from 5 to 4: now, 1,0,1,1,0

Then, move from 3 to 2: now, 1,1,1,1,0

Now, all chips are in positions 1,2,3,4, with no free cells between them.

So, two moves.

Hence, the minimal number of moves is two.

So, my earlier approach of moving directly from 5 to 2 is not allowed, because in one operation, I can only move a chip to the closest free cell to the left, which in this case would be from 5 to 4, and then from 3 to 2.

Hence, two moves.

So, perhaps the number of moves required is equal to the number of chips that are not already in the target block positions.

In other words, the number of chips that need to be moved to fill the gaps.

Wait, but in the fourth example, only one chip is moved to fill the gap, but the output is two.

So, perhaps it's more nuanced.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I find the leftmost and rightmost chips, and calculate the number of free cells between them.

Then, the number of moves required is equal to the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

In the first example:

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 7.

Free cells between them: position 5.

Hence, one free cell, one move.

In the fourth example:

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5.

Free cells between them: positions 2 and 4.

Hence, two free cells, two moves.

In the fifth example:

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8.

Free cells between them: positions 4,5,6.

Hence, three free cells, three moves.

This seems to match the outputs.

Hence, the minimal number of moves required is equal to the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

So, to implement this:

- Find the leftmost chip position (first 1 from the left).

- Find the rightmost chip position (last 1 from the right).

- Count the number of free cells (0's) between them, inclusive.

- The number of moves required is equal to the number of free cells between leftmost and rightmost chips.

Wait, but in the fourth example, leftmost is 1, rightmost is 5.

Free cells between them are positions 2 and 4, which are two free cells.

Hence, two moves, matching the output.

In the first example, leftmost is 2, rightmost is 7, free cells between them are position 5, one free cell, one move.

In the fifth example, leftmost is 2, rightmost is 8, free cells between them are positions 4,5,6, three free cells, three moves.

Seems consistent.

But wait, in the second example:

Leftmost is 2, rightmost is 2.

No free cells between them, but according to the output, it's 0 moves.

Yes, because there are no free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

Similarly, in the third example, all cells have chips, no free cells between them, so 0 moves.

Hence, this seems to be the correct approach.

So, to implement this:

- For each test case, find the leftmost and rightmost chips.

- Count the number of free cells between them, inclusive.

- Print this count as the number of moves required.

Wait, but in the fourth example, leftmost is 1, rightmost is 5, and there are two free cells between them (positions 2 and 4).

Hence, two moves, matching the output.

Seems correct.

Hence, this should be the solution.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of operations required to move chips on a ribbon such that they form a single block without any free cells between them. Each operation consists of moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left.

### Approach

1. **Identify the boundaries:** Find the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips.
2. **Count the free cells:** Count the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost positions inclusive.
3. **Determine the moves:** The number of operations required is equal to the count of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chips.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        # Find leftmost and rightmost chips
        left = -1
        right = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == 1:
                left = i
                break
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if a[i] == 1:
                right = i
                break
        # Count free cells between leftmost and rightmost chips
        if left == -1 or right == -1:
            res = 0
        else:
            res = 0
            for i in range(left, right+1):
                if a[i] == 0:
                    res += 1
        print(res)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:** Read the input values and parse them accordingly.
2. **Finding Boundaries:** Locate the leftmost and rightmost positions of the chips.
3. **Counting Free Cells:** Count the number of free cells between these boundaries.
4. **Output the Result:** Print the count of free cells, which represents the minimum operations needed.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the required operations by focusing only on the relevant section of the ribbon (between the leftmost and rightmost chips) and counting the free cells within that range.
