Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to right. Each cell either has a chip or is free. I can perform operations where I choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. My goal is to move the chips so that they form a single block without any free cells between them, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

First, I need to understand what a "single block" means. It means all the chips are together with no gaps between them. So, if I have chips at positions 1, 3, 4, and 6, I need to move them so that they are, say, at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4, or positions 3, 4, 5, 6, etc., as long as there are no gaps between them.

Now, the operations allowed are moving a chip to the closest free cell to the left. I can do this any number of times, choosing any chip that has at least one free cell to its left.

I need to find the minimum number of such operations to make the chips form a consecutive block.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to identify the current positions of the chips. Let's say I have their positions stored in a list.

For example, for n=8 and a=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0], the positions of chips are 2,3,4,6,7.

I need to move them so that there are no gaps between them.

One way to think about this is to find the leftmost chip and move all other chips to be adjacent to it, filling in the gaps.

But I need to make sure that I'm moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left, and I have to do this in a way that minimizes the total number of operations.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum number of operations you have to perform."

So, I need to find the minimal number of such moves.

Let me consider the example given:

8

0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

After one operation, moving the chip from position 7 to position 5, the array becomes:

0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0

Now, all chips are together from position 2 to position 6, with no gaps.

So, only one operation was needed.

Another example:

5

1 0 1 0 1

After two operations, moving the chip from position 3 to position 2, and then the chip from position 5 to position 4, the array becomes:

1 1 1 1 0

Now, all chips are together from position 1 to position 4.

So, two operations were needed.

Looking at these examples, it seems that the number of operations required is equal to the number of gaps between the chips.

Wait, in the first example, there was one gap between the chips at positions 4 and 6, and one operation was needed.

In the second example, there were two gaps between chips at positions 1,3,5, and two operations were needed.

Is there a pattern here?

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip, and then make sure that all cells between them are filled with chips.

The number of operations would then be the number of free cells between the leftmost and rightmost chip positions.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right.

In the first example, leftmost chip is at position 2, rightmost at position 7.

Cells between them are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Chips are at 2,3,4,6,7, so cell 5 is free.

So, one operation is needed to fill cell 5 by moving the chip from position 7 to position 5.

So, res=1.

In the second example, leftmost chip at position 1, rightmost at position 5.

Cells between them are 1,2,3,4,5.

Chips are at 1,3,5.

So, free cells are 2 and 4.

So, two operations are needed to fill cells 2 and 4.

So, res=2.

This seems consistent.

So, perhaps the solution is:

Find the leftmost chip and the rightmost chip.

Count the number of free cells between them.

That's the number of operations needed.

Because each operation can fill one free cell by moving a chip to it.

So, in the first example, one free cell between leftmost and rightmost chip, so one operation.

In the second example, two free cells, so two operations.

Wait, but in the third example:

6

1 1 1 1 1 1

All chips are already in a block with no free cells between them, so res=0.

Indeed, no free cells between leftmost and rightmost chip.

In the fourth example:

5

1 0 1 0 1

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5.

Free cells at 2 and 4.

So, res=2.

Seems correct.

Another example:

9

0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8.

Cells between 2 and 8 are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8.

Chips are at 2,3,7,8.

Free cells are 4,5,6.

So, res=3.

Which matches the sample output.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

So, the plan is:

- Find the leftmost chip.

- Find the rightmost chip.

- Count the number of free cells between them, inclusive.

- That's the number of operations needed.

Wait, but in the first step, when finding the leftmost chip, I need to skip leading zeros.

Similarly, find the rightmost chip by skipping trailing zeros.

Wait, in the first example:

0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0

Leftmost chip at position 2, rightmost at position 7.

Cells between 2 and 7 are 2,3,4,5,6,7.

Chips are at 2,3,4,6,7.

Free cells are at 5.

So, res=1.

In the second example:

0 1 0 0 0 0

Leftmost at position 2, rightmost at position 2.

No free cells between them, so res=0.

Wait, but according to the sample output, res=0.

Wait, but according to my logic, if leftmost and rightmost are the same, and there are no free cells in between, res=0, which matches.

Another example:

1 1 1 1 1 1

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 6.

No free cells between them, res=0.

Good.

Another example:

1 0 1 0 1

Leftmost at 1, rightmost at 5.

Free cells at 2 and 4, res=2.

Good.

Last example:

0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Leftmost at 2, rightmost at 8.

Free cells at 4,5,6, res=3.

Good.

So, this seems correct.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 50 and t up to 1000, it's acceptable to have a O(n*t) solution.

For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the array a of size n.

- Find the leftmost chip (first occurrence of 1 from the left).

- Find the rightmost chip (first occurrence of 1 from the right).

- Count the number of zeros between positions leftmost and rightmost, inclusive.

- Print that count.

Wait, but in programming terms, it's easier to slice the array between leftmost and rightmost indices and count the zeros in that slice.

For example, in Python, if leftmost=1, rightmost=6 (0-based indices 1 to 5), slice a[1:6], count the zeros in this slice.

Yes, that works.

Edge cases to consider:

- All cells have chips, no zeros between them. Res=0.

- Only one chip, res=0.

- Chips with multiple gaps between them.

- Leading and trailing zeros.

- All cells are zeros except one chip, which is already a block.

Wait, but the problem says "at least one cell contains a chip", so no test case with all zeros.

I need to make sure that I handle cases where there are leading or trailing zeros correctly.

Also, ensure that the indices are correctly handled in the slice.

Let me think about the implementation step by step.

For each test case:

1. Read n.

2. Read the array a as list of integers.

3. Find the leftmost chip index: find the smallest i where a[i]==1.

4. Find the rightmost chip index: find the largest j where a[j]==1.

5. Slice the array from i to j+1 (inclusive).

6. Count the number of zeros in this slice.

7. Print this count.

Let me verify this with the first example:

n=8, a=[0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

leftmost i=1, rightmost j=5.

Slice a[1:6] = [1,1,1,0,1]

Number of zeros=1.

Correct.

Second example:

n=6, a=[0,1,0,0,0,0]

leftmost i=1, rightmost j=1.

Slice a[1:2] = [1]

Number of zeros=0.

Correct.

Third example:

n=6, a=[1,1,1,1,1,1]

leftmost i=0, rightmost j=5.

Slice a[0:6] = [1,1,1,1,1,1]

Number of zeros=0.

Correct.

Fourth example:

n=5, a=[1,0,1,0,1]

leftmost i=0, rightmost j=4.

Slice a[0:5] = [1,0,1,0,1]

Number of zeros=2.

Correct.

Fifth example:

n=9, a=[0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

leftmost i=1, rightmost j=6.

Slice a[1:7] = [1,1,0,0,0,1]

Number of zeros=3.

Correct.

Seems solid.

Now, in Python, list indices start from 0, so I need to handle indices accordingly.

Also, ensure that when slicing, the end index is exclusive, so a[i:j+1] to include index j.

Yes, as in Python, a[start:stop] includes start and excludes stop.

So, a[i:j+1] includes i to j.

Ok.

I think this is a correct approach.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

res = 0

while a and a[0] == 0:

a.pop(0)

while a and a[-1] == 0:

a.pop()

print(a)

for i in range(len(a)):

if a[i] == 0:

res += 1

print(res)

So, what's happening here?

It reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read the array a.

- Remove leading zeros by popping them from the list while a[0]==0.

- Remove trailing zeros by popping them from the end while a[-1]==0.

- Then, count the number of zeros in the remaining list.

- Print the count.

Wait a minute, is this correct?

In the first step, it removes leading zeros.

In the second step, it removes trailing zeros.

Then, it counts the number of zeros in the remaining list.

Is this equivalent to counting the zeros between the leftmost and rightmost chips?

Wait, in the first example:

Original a: [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

After removing leading zeros: a becomes [1,1,1,0,1,1,0]

After removing trailing zeros: a becomes [1,1,1,0,1,1]

Count of zeros: one zero.

Which is correct.

In the second example:

Original a: [0,1,0,0,0,0]

After removing leading zeros: a becomes [1,0,0,0,0]

After removing trailing zeros: a becomes [1]

Count of zeros: zero.

Correct.

Third example:

Original a: [1,1,1,1,1,1]

After removing leading zeros: already no leading zeros.

After removing trailing zeros: already no trailing zeros.

Count of zeros: zero.

Correct.

Fourth example:

Original a: [1,0,1,0,1]

After removing leading zeros: a remains [1,0,1,0,1]

After removing trailing zeros: a remains [1,0,1,0,1]

Count of zeros: two zeros.

Correct.

Fifth example:

Original a: [0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

After removing leading zeros: a becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0]

After removing trailing zeros: a becomes [1,1,0,0,0,1,1]

Count of zeros: three zeros.

Correct.

So, this approach seems to be working correctly for the given examples.

It effectively removes the leading and trailing zeros, leaving only the part of the array between the leftmost and rightmost chips, and then counts the zeros in that slice.

This matches the approach I thought of earlier.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
