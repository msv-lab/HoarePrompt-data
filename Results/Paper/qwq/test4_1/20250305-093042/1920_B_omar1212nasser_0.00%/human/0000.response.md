Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they're playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum would be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. Each test case starts with three integers: n, k, and x. n is the number of elements in the array, k is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and x is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1. Then, there's a list of n integers, which is the array they're playing with.

The problem says that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which means I need to make sure my solution is efficient enough to handle that amount of data.

Okay, so let's think about how Alice and Bob should play optimally.

Starting with Alice: she wants to maximize the sum after her removals and Bob's subsequent multiplications. So, she needs to remove elements in such a way that, even after Bob tries to minimize the sum by flipping some of the remaining elements, the sum is still as large as possible.

Bob, on the other hand, wants to minimize the sum by choosing up to x elements to multiply by -1 from the array that Alice has left.

To approach this, I need to consider the effects of both players' actions.

First, Alice removes up to k elements. She could remove the smallest elements to make the sum as large as possible before Bob acts. However, Bob will then try to minimize the sum by flipping up to x elements to negative.

Wait, but flipping to negative actually depends on whether the elements are positive or negative already. Hmm.

Let me think differently. Suppose Alice removes k elements, and then Bob multiplies up to x elements by -1 from the remaining elements.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's action, so she needs to anticipate what Bob will do.

Bob will choose to flip the largest positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

So, Alice needs to remove elements in such a way that the remaining elements, after Bob flips the largest up to x elements to negative, still give the maximum possible sum.

This sounds like Alice needs to balance between removing the smallest elements and leaving enough positive elements that Bob can't flip too many large positives to negatives.

Wait, maybe another angle: suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements. Then, Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements to negative. So, the sum would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements (because flipping them to negative effectively subtracts twice their value from the sum).

Alternatively, if Alice removes different elements, perhaps she can minimize the impact of Bob's flipping.

Let me formalize this.

Let's sort the array in ascending order. Suppose Alice removes the smallest k elements. Then, Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements to negative.

The sum would be the sum of elements from k+1 to n, minus twice the sum of the largest x elements in that subset.

But Alice can choose to remove different elements to minimize this effect.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that Bob would flip to negative. For example, if she can remove some of the largest elements that Bob would flip, maybe that helps.

But actually, Bob wants to minimize the sum by flipping up to x elements to negative. So, he will flip the largest positive elements to negative.

Therefore, Alice should try to remove the smallest elements, so that the remaining elements are as large as possible, but also consider that Bob will flip the largest ones.

Wait, but if Alice removes the smallest elements, Bob will flip the largest remaining ones, which reduces the sum the most.

Maybe Alice should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider different scenarios.

Scenario 1: k = 0, Alice can't remove any elements. Then, Bob can flip up to x elements to negative. To minimize the sum, Bob will flip the x largest positive elements to negative.

So, the final sum would be sum of all elements minus twice the sum of the x largest elements.

Because flipping them to negative means they contribute negative their value instead of positive.

Wait, no. If an element is positive, flipping to negative makes it negative. If it's negative, flipping makes it positive. But in the initial array, all elements are positive, as per the input constraints: 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Wait, reading the problem again: "1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000". So all elements are positive.

Therefore, Bob can only flip positive elements to negative.

So, Bob will flip the x largest positive elements to negative to minimize the sum.

Therefore, if Alice removes k elements, she should remove the smallest k elements to maximize the sum before Bob acts.

Then, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, the final sum would be the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If Bob flips x elements to negative, their contribution to the sum changes from +a to -a, so the total sum decreases by 2*a for each such element.

Therefore, to minimize the sum, Bob should flip the x largest positive elements.

So, if Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining elements are the largest n - k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the x largest among these to negative.

Therefore, the sum would be the sum of the remaining n - k elements minus twice the sum of the x largest among them.

So, sum = sum(a[k+1 to n]) - 2 * sum(top x of a[k+1 to n])

Alice can choose k to minimize this expression.

Wait, but Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's action.

So, she needs to choose k to maximize sum(a[k+1 to n]) - 2 * sum(top x of a[k+1 to n])

She can choose k between 0 and k.

Wait, no. The problem says "remove up to k elements", so k can be from 0 to k.

Wait, the variable k is used for both the parameter and the loop variable, which might be confusing.

Let me rephrase.

Let’s denote the parameter as k_max, the maximum number of elements Alice can remove.

So, Alice can choose to remove any number of elements from 0 to k_max.

Then, for each possible number of removals r (from 0 to k_max), Alice considers removing the smallest r elements.

Then, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

So, for each r, the sum would be sum(a[r to n-1]) - 2 * sum(top x of a[r to n-1])

Alice wants to choose r to maximize this sum.

So, I need to compute this sum for each r from 0 to k_max and choose the maximum.

That seems like a plan.

Let me see if this makes sense with the example.

Take the second test case:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

So, n=4, k_max=1, x=1

Array: [3,1,2,4]

Sorted: [1,2,3,4]

Option 1: r=0, remove no elements.

Sum = 1+2+3+4 = 10

Bob flips the largest x=1 element, which is 4, to negative.

Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 - 4 = 2

Option 2: r=1, remove the smallest 1 element, which is 1.

Sum = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

Bob flips the largest x=1 element, which is 4, to negative.

Sum = 2 + 3 -4 = 1

So, Alice would choose r=0, which gives sum=2, which is larger than sum=1 in option 2.

According to the example, the output is 2, which matches this.

Another example:

1 1 1

1

Array: [1]

Option 1: r=0, sum=1, Bob flips 1 to -1, sum=-1

Option 2: r=1, remove 1, sum=0

So, Alice chooses r=1, sum=0, which is better than -1.

According to the example, it's 0.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 0 for the first test case, which matches.

Another test case:

8 5 3

5 5 3 3 3 2 9 9

Sorted: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

Alice can remove up to k_max=5 elements.

So, she can choose r from 0 to 5.

Let's compute for each r:

r=0: sum=2+3+3+3+5+5+9+9=39, top x=3 elements: 9,9,5 → sum=23, final sum=39-2*23=39-46=-7

r=1: sum=3+3+3+5+5+9+9=37, top x=3:9,9,5→sum=23, final sum=37-46=-9

r=2: sum=3+3+5+5+9+9=34, top x=3:9,9,5→sum=23, final sum=34-46=-12

r=3: sum=3+5+5+9+9=31, top x=3:9,9,5→sum=23, final sum=31-46=-15

r=4: sum=5+5+9+9=28, top x=3:9,9,5→sum=23, final sum=28-46=-18

r=5: sum=5+9+9=23, top x=3:9,9,5→sum=23, final sum=23-46=-23

So, the maximum among these is r=0 with -7.

But according to the example, it's -5.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the example, it says:

"it is optimal for Alice to remove 9,9. Bob will then multiply 5,5,3 by -1. So the final sum is -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5."

Wait, in this case, n=8, k_max=5, x=3

Array: [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9]

Sorted: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

Alice removes the last k_max=5 elements, which are [5,5,9,9], but that's only 4 elements. Wait, n=8, k_max=5, so she can remove up to 5 elements.

Wait, in the note, it says "remove 9,9", but according to sorted order, the largest are 9,9.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose which elements to remove, not necessarily the smallest or largest.

Wait, but in the note, it says "it is optimal for Alice to remove 9,9", but according to the sorted array, removing the largest elements doesn't make sense, because Bob would then flip the largest remaining elements.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, in the note, it says "remove 9,9", which are the largest elements. Then, the remaining array is [5,5,3,3,2,3]. Wait, n=8, remove 2 elements (9 and 9), so remaining 6 elements: [2,3,3,3,5,5]

Then, Bob flips the top x=3 elements to negative, which are [5,5,3], so sum becomes 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 -5 -5 = 4.

But in the note, it says "-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5", which is correct: 2 + 3 + 3 -5 -5 -3 = -5.

Wait, but according to my earlier approach, if Alice removes the smallest r elements, that would be different.

So, perhaps my assumption that Alice should remove the smallest r elements is incorrect.

Wait, maybe Alice should remove the largest x elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

Wait, but in this case, removing the largest elements means that Bob can't flip them, but the sum would be smaller.

Wait, it's confusing.

Let me think again.

If Alice removes the largest x elements, then Bob can't flip them, but the sum would be smaller.

Alternatively, if Alice removes the smallest k_max elements, then Bob can flip the largest x remaining elements.

So, perhaps the optimal strategy is to find a balance between removing the smallest elements and removing some of the elements that Bob would flip.

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the note, it suggests that in the fifth test case, it's optimal for Alice to remove the two 9's, and then Bob flips the three 5's and one 3 to negative.

Wait, but in the sorted array, after removing the two 9's, the array is [2,3,3,3,5,5], and Bob flips the top x=3 elements, which are the two 5's and one 3, making them negative.

So, sum = 2 + 3 + 3 -5 -5 -3 = -5.

But according to my earlier calculation, if Alice removes the smallest r elements, it leads to a different result.

So, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Maybe Alice should remove the largest x elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, but that would decrease the sum.

Wait, but in the note, Alice removes the largest elements, and then Bob flips some of the remaining elements.

It's seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove the elements that Bob would flip, i.e., the largest x elements, so that Bob can't flip them.

But by removing them, the sum decreases.

So, it's a trade-off.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any k_max elements to remove, not necessarily the smallest or largest.

But to make it efficient, I need an algorithm that can handle large n efficiently.

Maybe I need to consider the sum after removal and flipping for different choices of removals.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice removes r elements from the smallest ones and k_max - r elements from the largest ones.

But that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the array and consider prefix sums.

Let me try to sort the array in ascending order.

Then, for each possible number of removals r from 0 to k_max, Alice removes the smallest r elements.

Then, Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements to negative.

So, the sum would be sum(a[r to n-1]) - 2 * sum(top x of a[r to n-1])

Then, Alice chooses the r that maximizes this sum.

Wait, in the fifth test case, n=8, k_max=5, x=3

Array sorted: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

Option r=0:

sum = 2+3+3+3+5+5+9+9=38

top x=3 of remaining: 9,9,5 → sum=23

final sum=38 - 46 = -8

Option r=1:

sum = 3+3+3+5+5+9+9=37

top x=3:9,9,5→23

final sum=37-46=-9

Option r=2:

sum=3+3+5+5+9+9=34

top x=3:9,9,5→23

final sum=34-46=-12

Option r=3:

sum=3+5+5+9+9=31

top x=3:9,9,5→23

final sum=31-46=-15

Option r=4:

sum=5+5+9+9=28

top x=3:9,9,5→23

final sum=28-46=-18

Option r=5:

sum=5+9+9=23

top x=3:9,9,5→23

final sum=23-46=-23

So, the maximum among these is r=0 with -8, but according to the note, it's -5.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to flip any x elements, not necessarily the top x.

Wait, no, the problem says "multiply at most x elements of the array by -1", so Bob can choose up to x elements to flip.

To minimize the sum, he will flip the largest positive elements.

But in this case, after Alice removes the two 9's, the remaining array is [2,3,3,3,5,5], and Bob will flip the two 5's and one 3 to negative, sum becomes 2 + 3 + 3 -5 -5 -3 = -5.

Wait, in my earlier calculation for r=0, I considered sum=38 and top x=3 as 9,9,5, but in reality, if Alice removes no elements, Bob can flip the three largest: 9,9,5 to negative, sum=2+3+3+3 -9 -9 -5=-10, which doesn't match the note.

Wait, but according to the note, when Alice removes the two 9's, sum=2+3+3+3+5+5=20, Bob flips three elements: two 5's and one 3 to negative, sum=2 +3 +3 -5 -5 -3=-5.

So, in this case, sum is -5.

But in my earlier calculation for r=0, sum=38, top x=3 as 9,9,5, sum=23, final sum=38-46=-8, which is better than -10.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the x largest remaining elements for Bob to flip, but in reality, Bob can choose any x elements to flip.

But to minimize the sum, he will choose the x largest positive elements to flip.

So, in the case where Alice removes no elements, Bob will flip the two 9's and one 5 to negative, sum=2+3+3+3 -9 -9 -5=-10.

But according to the note, when Alice removes the two 9's, sum=2+3+3+3+5+5=20, Bob flips two 5's and one 3 to negative, sum=2+3+3 -5 -5 -3=-5.

So, in this case, -5 is better than -10.

Wait, but according to the problem, Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's action.

So, in this case, Alice chooses to remove the two 9's to maximize the sum after Bob flips the two 5's and one 3.

Hence, sum=-5 is better than -10.

Therefore, Alice should choose to remove the two 9's.

But according to my earlier approach, where Alice removes r elements from the smallest ones, it doesn't account for removing the largest elements.

So, perhaps my initial approach is incomplete.

I need to consider that Alice can choose to remove any r elements, not necessarily the smallest or largest.

But to make it efficient, I need a way to compute this quickly.

An alternative approach: since all elements are positive, Bob will always flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

Therefore, Alice should aim to minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements after her removals.

To minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements, Alice should remove the x largest elements.

Wait, but that would leave the sum of the remaining elements as sum of all elements minus the sum of the x largest elements.

Then, Bob would flip the x largest remaining elements, which would be the next x largest elements.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove any r elements, and then Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

I need to maximize sum(a[r to n-1]) - 2 * sum(top x of a[r to n-1])

Over r from 0 to k_max.

So, to maximize this, I need to choose r such that the sum of the remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This seems like I need to find a balance between removing small elements to keep the sum high and removing some large elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

This is tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over r from 0 to k_max, compute the sum of elements from r to n-1, and subtract twice the sum of the top x elements in that range.

Then, choose the r that gives the maximum value.

To implement this efficiently, I need to compute the sum from r to n-1 and the sum of the top x elements in that range for each r from 0 to k_max.

I can sort the array in ascending order, so a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-1]

Then, sum from r to n-1 is sum_a[r:], which I can precompute.

Similarly, the sum of the top x elements in a[r:] is sum(a[r+n-x]) if r+n-x >=0, else sum(a[r:])

I need to handle the cases where r + x > n.

Wait, perhaps I can use prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_sum[r] = sum(a[0 to r-1])

Then, sum(a[r to n-1]) = total_sum - prefix_sum[r]

Similarly, the top x elements in a[r to n-1] are a[n-x] to a[n-1], provided r <= n-x.

Otherwise, if r > n-x, then the top x elements are a[r] to a[r+x-1]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

After sorting, a[0] <= a[1] <= ... <= a[n-1]

If r <= n - x, then the top x elements in a[r to n-1] are a[n-x] to a[n-1]

If r > n - x, then the top x elements are a[r] to a[r+x-1]

Wait, no.

If r <= n - x, the top x elements in a[r to n-1] are a[n-x] to a[n-1]

If r > n - x, then the top x elements are a[r] to a[r+x-1], but need to ensure that r + x -1 < n.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the x largest elements remaining after removal.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, sort the array in ascending order.

Compute total_sum = sum(a)

Then, for each r from 0 to k_max:

remaining_sum = total_sum - sum(a[0 to r-1])

if n - r >= x:

top_x_sum = sum(a[n-x] to a[n-1])

else:

top_x_sum = sum(a[r] to a[n-1])

final_sum = remaining_sum - 2 * top_x_sum

Then, choose the maximum final_sum over r from 0 to k_max.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, with n=8, k_max=5, x=3

sorted a: [2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9]

total_sum = 2+3+3+3+5+5+9+9=40

for r=0:

remaining_sum = 40 - 0 = 40

since n - r =8 >= x=3, top_x_sum = a[5:8] =5+9+9=23

final_sum=40 - 46 =-6

for r=1:

remaining_sum=40 -2=38

n - r=7 >=x=3, top_x_sum=a[5:8]=5+9+9=23

final_sum=38-46=-8

for r=2:

remaining_sum=40 -2-3=35

n - r=6 >=x=3, top_x_sum=a[5:8]=5+9+9=23

final_sum=35-46=-11

for r=3:

remaining_sum=40 -2-3-3=32

n - r=5 >=x=3, top_x_sum=a[5:8]=5+9+9=23

final_sum=32-46=-14

for r=4:

remaining_sum=40 -2-3-3-3=32-3=29

n - r=4 >=x=3, top_x_sum=a[5:8]=5+9+9=23

final_sum=29-46=-17

for r=5:

remaining_sum=40 -2-3-3-3-5=40-16=24

n - r=3 >=x=3, top_x_sum=a[5:8]=5+9+9=23

final_sum=24-46=-22

So, the maximum is r=0 with -6, but according to the note, it's
