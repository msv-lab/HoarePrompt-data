Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are participants going on a hike, and they need to figure out how many tents are required based on their preferences. Each tent can hold up to 3 people, and there are three types of participants: introverts, extroverts, and universals, each with different preferences for tent occupancy.

First, I need to understand the preferences:

- Introverts want to be alone in a tent, so each introvert needs their own tent with just one person.

- Extroverts want to be in a tent with two others, meaning each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

- Universals are flexible; they can be alone, with one other person, or with two others.

My goal is to minimize the number of tents while respecting everyone's preferences. If it's impossible to satisfy everyone's preferences, I should return -1.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll consider the constraints imposed by the introverts and extroverts, since universals are flexible and can adjust to whatever is left.

Starting with introverts: each one needs their own tent. So, the number of tents required for introverts is simply 'a'.

Next, extroverts need tents with exactly three people. Since each tent can hold up to three people, but for extroverts, the tent must have exactly three people, including the extrovert themselves. So, for each extrovert, we need to have two other people in their tent.

These two other people can be either universals or other extroverts, but we have to make sure that if we put an extrovert in a tent, that tent must have exactly three people.

Wait, but if an extrovert is in a tent, it must have exactly three people, regardless of who the other two are, as long as there are two others.

So, for extroverts, we need to group them in tents of exactly three people, and these tents can include other extroverts or universals, but we have to ensure that any tent with an extrovert has exactly three people.

But, universals are flexible; they can be in a tent with one or two others, or alone.

So, the key here is to satisfy the extroverts' requirement of being in a tent with exactly two others, while also accommodating the introverts who need their own tents, and using the universals to fill in the remaining spots.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote:

- 'a' = number of introverts

- 'b' = number of extroverts

- 'c' = number of universals

First, the tents for introverts are straightforward: each introvert needs one tent, so we have 'a' tents for them.

Now, for the extroverts, since each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others, we can think of them as requiring pairs of others to share their tent.

Wait, more carefully: each extrovert needs two additional people in their tent, making it three in total including themselves.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need 'b' tents, each containing the extrovert and two others.

But, these 'b' tents are already accounted for in the total tent count, separate from the 'a' tents for introverts.

Wait, no. Actually, each tent can hold up to three people, but for extroverts, their tent must have exactly three people.

So, the tents for extroverts are distinct from those for introverts.

Wait, no, it's not that they are distinct, but that the extroverts' tents must have exactly three people.

So, the total number of tents needed will be the sum of the tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts, plus any additional tents needed for universals.

But, universals are flexible, so they can fill in the tents as needed.

Let me try to think differently.

First, allocate tents for introverts: each introvert gets their own tent, so 'a' tents are reserved for them.

Now, for the extroverts, since each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others, we need to form groups of three for each extrovert.

But, these groups can include other extroverts or universals.

Wait, but if a tent has an extrovert, it must have exactly three people.

If a tent doesn't have an extrovert, it can have one, two, or three people, since universals are flexible.

So, to minimize the total number of tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts sharing tents.

Wait, but each extrovert needs their own tent with exactly three people, including themselves and two others.

So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), but with each tent having exactly three people, including the extrovert.

Wait, that's not quite right.

Wait, each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others.

So, for 'b' extroverts, we need to form groups of three people per tent, where each group includes at least one extrovert, and the tent has exactly three people.

But, extroverts can share tents with other extroverts, as long as each tent has exactly three people.

Wait, but if a tent has two extroverts, then it needs one more person to make it three.

Similarly, if it has one extrovert, it needs two more people.

And if it has three extroverts, that's fine too.

So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / 2), because each tent can take up to two extroverts plus one universal.

Wait, no.

Wait, each tent can have up to three people, but for extroverts, the tent must have exactly three people.

So, the number of tents required for extroverts is ceil(b / 1), because each tent can have one extrovert and two others.

But, we can optimize by putting more extroverts in a tent.

Wait, but each tent must have exactly three people if it contains any extroverts.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts per tent, which is one extrovert per tent, plus two others.

Wait, no, actually, if we put two extroverts in one tent, then we need to have three people in that tent: two extroverts and one universal.

Similarly, if we put three extroverts in one tent, that's allowed, as it satisfies the exactly three people requirement for each extrovert in that tent.

Wait, but each extrovert needs their tent to have exactly three people.

So, if three extroverts are in one tent, each of them has exactly three people in their tent, which satisfies their preference.

Similarly, if two extroverts are in one tent, they need a third person, which can be a universal.

If one extrovert is in a tent, they need two universals to fill the tent.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts per tent.

Therefore, we should aim to have as many tents as possible with three extroverts.

Let me calculate the maximum number of tents that can have three extroverts.

The maximum number of such tents is floor(b / 3).

Then, the remaining extroverts would be b % 3.

If b % 3 == 0, then we can have all tents with three extroverts.

If b % 3 == 1, then after placing floor(b / 3) tents with three extroverts, we have one extrovert left, who needs a tent with two others.

Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, we have two extroverts left, who can share a tent with one universal.

Wait, but for the remaining extroverts, we need to ensure that their tents have exactly three people.

So, if b % 3 == 1, we have one extrovert left, who needs two universals to fill the tent.

If b % 3 == 2, we have two extroverts left, who can share a tent with one universal.

So, in terms of the number of tents for extroverts:

- The number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

Because:

- For every three extroverts, we can use one tent.

- For two extroverts, we can use one tent with one universal.

- For one extrovert, we need one tent with two universals.

Hence, ceil(b / 3) tents are needed for extroverts.

Wait, but in the function provided, it's using func_1(extroverts, universals), which seems to calculate ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3).

Wait, maybe I need to look at the code provided.

Looking at the code:

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:

if extroverts % 3 != 0:

if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:

return None

return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:

ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)

return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

So, func_1 is trying to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals together.

It seems like it's trying to group extroverts and universals into tents of three people.

Wait, but extroverts need their tent to have exactly three people, including themselves.

Universals are flexible and can be in tents with one, two, or three people.

So, perhaps the idea is to group extroverts and universals into tents of three, where each tent has at least one extrovert and the rest can be universals.

But, actually, from earlier thoughts, for extroverts, their tent must have exactly three people, regardless of who is in it, as long as there are three people.

So, perhaps it's valid to have tents with only universals, as long as the extroverts are in tents with exactly three people.

Wait, but the tents for extroverts must have exactly three people, but other tents can have one, two, or three people, depending on the occupants.

So, perhaps the total number of tents is the number of tents for introverts plus the number of tents for extroverts, and then any remaining universals can be placed in existing tents or in their own tents.

But, I need to minimize the number of tents, so I should maximize the number of people per tent where possible.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of tents required for extroverts and universals together, and then add the tents for introverts.

That seems to be the approach in the code.

So, func_1 is trying to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals together.

It checks if extroverts % 3 != 0, meaning there are remaining extroverts that can't form a complete group of three.

In that case, it needs to ensure that there are enough universals to fill up the remaining spots to make the tent have three people.

So, if extroverts % 3 == 1, it needs two more people (universals) to fill the tent.

If extroverts % 3 == 2, it needs one more universal to fill the tent.

Hence, in func_1, if extroverts % 3 != 0, it checks if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3.

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, extroverts % 3 can be 1 or 2.

If extroverts % 3 == 1, it needs two universals to fill the tent.

If extroverts % 3 == 2, it needs one universal.

So, in the code, it's checking if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3.

Wait, that would mean:

- If extroverts % 3 == 1, and universals < 2, it's impossible, because you need two universals to fill the tent.

- If extroverts % 3 == 2, and universals < 1, it's impossible.

Hence, if extroverts % 3 == 1 and universals < 2, or extroverts % 3 == 2 and universals < 1, it returns None, indicating impossibility.

Otherwise, it returns ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3).

Wait, but why is it adding extroverts and universals and then dividing by 3?

Because it's trying to group extroverts and universals into tents of three people.

Each tent can have up to three people, and for extroverts, their tent must have exactly three people.

So, by combining extroverts and universals and dividing by 3, it's calculating the number of tents needed to accommodate them, ensuring that extroverts are in tents with exactly three people.

But, we have to ensure that any tent with an extrovert has exactly three people.

So, perhaps it's better to first assign extroverts to tents, requiring each tent with an extrovert to have exactly three people, and then assign universals to fill in those tents or to their own tents.

Wait, but the code seems to be treating extroverts and universals together, grouping them into tents of three.

But, extroverts need their tent to have exactly three people, but universals are flexible.

So, perhaps the approach is to form as many tents as possible with three people, consisting of extroverts and universals, and then handle any remaining universals separately.

In that case, the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals would be ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3), but with the condition that extroverts are placed in tents with exactly three people.

Wait, but that might not always be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of tents required for extroverts, considering the universals available to fill their tents.

So, for each tent that includes an extrovert, it must have exactly three people.

So, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 2), because each tent can take up to two extroverts plus one universal.

Wait, no, each tent can take up to three people, including extroverts.

Wait, perhaps it's ceil(b / 2), because two extroverts can share a tent with one universal.

Wait, but if three extroverts share a tent, that's also fine.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts per tent.

Hence, grouping three extroverts per tent is the most efficient.

So, the minimal number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3).

But, if b % 3 == 1, we need an additional tent for the remaining extrovert, which requires two universals.

Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, we need an additional tent for the two remaining extroverts, which requires one universal.

Hence, the total number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3), but we need to ensure that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents.

So, in func_1, it's checking if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals.

If b % 3 == 1, we need two universals.

If b % 3 == 2, we need one universal.

Hence, if b % 3 + c < 3, it's impossible, because:

- If b % 3 == 1, we need c >= 2.

- If b % 3 == 2, we need c >= 1.

Otherwise, it's possible, and the number of tents needed is ceil((b + c) / 3).

Wait, but why ceil((b + c) / 3)?

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Because, if we have b extroverts and c universals, and we're grouping them into tents of three, where each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people, then the total number of tents needed is ceil(b / 3) plus any additional tents needed for remaining universals.

Wait, but the code is using ceil((b + c) / 3), which seems to be grouping extroverts and universals together into tents of three.

But, extroverts need their tent to have exactly three people, including themselves and two others.

Universals are flexible and can be in tents with one, two, or three people.

So, perhaps it's better to first assign extroverts to tents, requiring each tent with an extrovert to have exactly three people, and then assign universals to either fill those tents or to their own tents.

Wait, perhaps another way to look at it is:

- Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly three people.

- Universals can be used to fill these tents or be placed in their own tents.

Hence, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3), but we need to ensure that for each tent with extroverts, there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots.

So, for ceil(b / 3) tents, each tent must have exactly three people.

If a tent has one extrovert, it needs two universals.

If a tent has two extroverts, it needs one universal.

If a tent has three extroverts, it needs no universals.

So, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of tents with three extroverts.

Hence, the number of tents needed for extroverts is ceil(b / 3), and we need to ensure that the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots.

Hence, the condition in func_1 is checking if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals.

So, in func_1, if b % 3 == 1, we need c >= 2.

If b % 3 == 2, we need c >= 1.

Otherwise, it's possible, and the number of tents needed is ceil((b + c) / 3).

Wait, but why ceil((b + c) / 3)?

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Because, if we have b extroverts and c universals, and we're grouping them into tents of three, where each tent with extroverts must have exactly three people, then the total number of tents needed is ceil(b / 3), and then any remaining universals can be placed in existing tents or in their own tents.

But, to minimize the number of tents, we should maximize the number of extroverts per tent.

Hence, the minimal number of tents for extroverts is ceil(b / 3), and then the remaining universals can be placed in these tents or in their own tents.

But, we need to ensure that the tents with extroverts have exactly three people.

Hence, the total number of tents is ceil(b / 3) plus the number of additional tents needed for the remaining universals.

But, in the code, it's using ceil((b + c) / 3) for the tents needed for extroverts and universals together.

Wait, perhaps it's treating the extroverts and universals as a pool to be divided into tents of three, with the constraint that each tent with an extrovert must have exactly three people.

But, universals are flexible, so they can be placed in tents with extroverts or in their own tents.

Hence, the minimal number of tents is ceil(b / 3) plus ceil((c - required universals) / 3), where required universals are the ones needed to fill the tents with extroverts.

Wait, perhaps it's more complicated than I thought.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose we group the extroverts into tents of three, as much as possible.

Then, the remaining extroverts can be placed in tents with universals.

If b % 3 == 0, then we need b / 3 tents for extroverts, and the universals can be placed in their own tents.

If b % 3 == 1, then we need ceil(b / 3) = ceil(b / 3) tents for extroverts, and for the remaining extrovert, we need two universals to fill the tent.

Similarly, if b % 3 == 2, we need ceil(b / 3) tents for extroverts, and one universal to fill the last tent.

Hence, the total number of tents is ceil(b / 3) plus the number of tents needed for the remaining universals after filling the extroverts' tents.

But, in the code, it's using ceil((b + c) / 3) for the tents needed for extroverts and universals together.

Wait, perhaps it's considering that all extroverts and universals are grouped together into tents of three, with the condition that each tent with an extrovert has exactly three people.

Hence, the total number of tents needed for extroverts and universals is ceil((b + c) / 3), but with the condition that the extroverts are distributed in such a way that their tents have exactly three people.

Hence, the condition in func_1 is checking if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals.

So, if b % 3 == 1 and c < 2, or b % 3 == 2 and c < 1, it's impossible.

Otherwise, it's possible, and the number of tents needed is ceil((b + c) / 3).

Then, the total number of tents is the number of tents for introverts (a) plus the number of tents for extroverts and universals.

Hence, func_2 is returning a + ceil((b + c) / 3), if the condition is satisfied, else -1.

But, is this correct?

Let me verify with the example given.

In the first test case:

1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals.

So, a = 1, b = 2, c = 3.

func_1(b, c) = ceil((2 + 3)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2.

Hence, total tents = a + ret = 1 + 2 = 3.

Which matches the first output in the example.

Another test case:

1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal.

a = 1, b = 4, c = 1.

func_1(4,1):

4 % 3 == 1, and 1 < 2, so return None.

Hence, func_2 returns -1.

Which matches the second output in the example.

Another test case:

1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 2 universals.

a = 1, b = 4, c = 2.

func_1(4,2):

4 % 3 == 1, and 1 + 2 = 3 >= 3, so return ceil((4+2)/3) = ceil(6/3) = 2.

Hence, total tents = 1 + 2 = 3.

Which matches the third output in the example.

Another test case:

1 introvert, 1 extrovert, 1 universal.

a = 1, b = 1, c = 1.

func_1(1,1):

1 % 3 == 1, and 1 < 2, so return None.

Hence, func_2 returns -1.

Which matches the fourth output in the example.

Another test case:

1 introvert, 3 extroverts, 2 universals.

a = 1, b = 3, c = 2.

func_1(3,2):

3 % 3 == 0, so return ceil((3+2)/3) = ceil(5/3) = 2.

Hence, total tents = 1 + 2 = 3.

Which matches the fifth output in the example.

So, based on these test cases, the code seems to be working correctly.

Hence, the answer is **True**.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants with different preferences for tent occupancy while ensuring that all preferences are satisfied.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Preferences:**
    - **Introverts:** Each needs their own tent.
    - **Extroverts:** Each must be in a tent with exactly two others.
    - **Universals:** Can be in a tent alone, with one other, or with two others.

2. **Tent Allocation Strategy:**
    - Allocate one tent per introvert.
    - For extroverts and universals, group them in tents of up to three people, ensuring that any tent containing an extrovert has exactly three people.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
    - Determines the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
    - If the number of extroverts (`b`) is not a multiple of 3, check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots to make the tent have exactly three people.
    - Returns `None` if it's impossible to satisfy the extroverts' preferences with the available universals; otherwise, returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
    - Uses `func_1` to compute the tents needed for extroverts and universals.
    - Adds the tents needed for introverts to get the total number of tents.
    - Returns -1 if it's impossible to satisfy the preferences.

### Solution Code

```python
import math
from typing import Optional

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if extroverts % 3 == 1:
            if universals < 2:
                return None
        elif extroverts % 3 == 2:
            if universals < 1:
                return None
    return math.ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret

# Example usage
for line in '1 2 3\n1 4 1\n1 4 2\n1 1 1\n1 3 2\n19 7 18\n0 0 0\n7 0 0\n0 24 0\n1000000000 1000000000 1000000000'.splitlines():
    (introverts, extroverts, universals) = map(int, line.split(' '))
    print('line:', line)
    print('ret:', func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals))
```

### Explanation

- **Introverts Handling:** Each introvert requires one tent, so the number of tents for introverts is simply `a`.
- **Extroverts and Universals Handling:** We compute the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals using `func_1`. This function ensures that extroverts' preferences are met by checking if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in their tents.
- **Total Tents Calculation:** The total number of tents is the sum of tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts and universals. If it's impossible to satisfy the extroverts' preferences, we return -1.

This approach ensures that all preferences are satisfied while minimizing the number of tents used.
