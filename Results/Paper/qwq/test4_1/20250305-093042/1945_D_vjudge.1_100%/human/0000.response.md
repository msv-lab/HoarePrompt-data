Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, making it n+1 people in line. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue, aiming to be among the first m people.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill wants to swap places with someone ahead of him (someone at position j, where j < i), he has to pay a_j coins to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

My task is to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to reach a position among the first m people.

First, I need to understand the operations Kirill can perform. He can choose any position j that is ahead of him (j < i) and swap places with that person, paying a_j coins to that person and b_k coins to everyone between j and i.

I need to model this in a way that allows me to compute the minimum cost for Kirill to reach one of the first m positions.

Let me think about this step by step.

Let's consider Kirill is initially at position n (since he's at the end of the line). He wants to move to position i, where i ranges from 1 to m.

For each possible target position i, I need to calculate the cost of moving from position n to position i.

But directly computing this for each i might be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 200,000 and t (number of test cases) can be up to 10,000.

I need a smarter way to compute this.

Let me consider the operations in reverse. Instead of moving from n to i, maybe I can think about moving from i to n and find the minimum cost associated with that.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of choosing a position j < i and moving to j, paying a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

I need to find the minimum cost to reach any position from 1 to m.

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem.

Let me define dp[i] as the minimum cost to be at position i.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to n, and then take the minimum of dp[1] to dp[m].

Initially, Kirill is at position n, so dp[n] = 0, because he hasn't paid anything yet.

For other positions, I need to consider all possible ways to reach them.

Wait, but Kirill can only move from a higher position to a lower position by bribing.

Wait no, in the problem, Kirill starts at position n and can perform operations to move to positions j < i.

But in the code provided, it seems to be calculating something different.

Let me look at the given code.

The code defines a function func_1(n, k, a, b):

It creates a list c where c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]) for each i from 0 to n-1.

Then it computes a suffix sum array suff, where suff[i] is the sum of c from position i to n-1.

Then it iterates from i=0 to i=k-1, and for each i, it calculates a[i] + suff[i+1], and takes the minimum of these values.

Finally, it prints this minimum value.

Wait, I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, I need to understand what the code is doing.

It's computing c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]).

Then, suff[i] is the sum of c from i to n-1.

Then, for each i from 0 to k-1, it calculates a[i] + suff[i+1], and takes the minimum of these.

But is this the correct way to model the problem?

Let me think about what a[i] and b[i] represent.

a_i is the cost to swap with person j, and b_k is the cost to pay to people between j and i.

In the operation, when moving from i to j (j < i), Kirill pays a_j and sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

So, the cost to move from i to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

But in the code, it's using min(a[i], b[i]) which doesn't seem directly related.

Wait, maybe there's a different way to look at it.

Perhaps the code is trying to compute the cost of moving Kirill from position n to position i, and then taking the minimum over i from 1 to m.

But I'm not sure how c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]) fits into this.

Let me consider an example to see if the code works.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

According to the code:

c = [min(7,4), min(3,3), min(6,8), min(9,5)] = [4,3,6,5]

suff = [4+3+6+5=18, 3+6+5=14, 6+5=11, 5]

Then, for i=0 to i=1 (since m=2):

For i=0: a[0] + suff[1] = 7 + 14 = 21

For i=1: a[1] + suff[2] = 3 + 11 = 14

So the minimum is 14, which matches the first output in the example.

Okay, so in this case, it works.

Let me try another example:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

c = [min(6,5)=5, min(9,8)=8, min(7,8)=7, min(1,1)=1, min(8,4)=4, min(3,1)=1]

suff = [5+8+7+1+4+1=26, 8+7+1+4+1=21, 7+1+4+1=13, 1+4+1=6, 4+1=5, 1]

Then, for i=0 to i=1 (m=2):

i=0: a[0] + suff[1] = 6 + 21 = 27

i=1: a[1] + suff[2] = 9 + 13 = 22

Minimum is 22, which matches the second output.

Another example:

7 7

7 2 9 2 6 5 9

9 1 10 7 1 4 9

c = [min(7,9)=7, min(2,1)=1, min(9,10)=9, min(2,7)=2, min(6,1)=1, min(5,4)=4, min(9,9)=9]

suff = [7+1+9+2+1+4+9=33, 1+9+2+1+4+9=26, 9+2+1+4+9=25, 2+1+4+9=16, 1+4+9=14, 4+9=13, 9]

Then, for i=0 to i=6 (m=7):

i=0: 7 + 26 = 33

i=1: 2 + 25 = 27

i=2: 9 + 16 = 25

i=3: 2 + 14 = 16

i=4: 6 + 13 = 19

i=5: 5 + 9 = 14

i=6: 9 + 0 = 9

Minimum is 9, which matches the third output.

Last example:

2 1

2 3

1 1

c = [min(2,1)=1, min(3,1)=1]

suff = [1+1=2, 1]

i=0: 2 + 1 = 3

Only one possible i since m=1.

Matches the fourth output.

So, in all these examples, the code seems to work correctly.

But I need to understand why this approach works.

Let's try to understand the logic behind c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]).

Wait, maybe there's a different way to model the problem.

Perhaps c[i] represents the minimum cost to "skip" person i.

If Kirill chooses to move to position j, he pays a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, perhaps c[i] represents the cost to skip person i.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to the idea of choosing to pay a_j or paying b_k for the intermediate people.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me try to model this as a DP problem.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to be at position i.

We want to compute dp[1] to dp[m], and find the minimum among them.

Initially, Kirill is at position n, so dp[n] = 0.

For positions i from n-1 down to 1, we need to find a way to reach them from some position j where j > i.

Wait, but in the problem, Kirill can only move from a higher position to a lower position.

Wait, no, the operation is defined as moving from i to j where j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, in terms of DP, we can think of dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i from position n.

Then, dp[n] = 0.

For each i from n-1 down to 1, dp[i] = min over j from 1 to i-1 of (a[j] + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1 + dp[j]).

But this seems too slow for n up to 200,000.

I need a better way to compute this.

Maybe I can find a way to express dp[i] in terms of dp[i+1].

Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the cost to move from position i to position j < i.

But I need to find a way to optimize this.

Let me consider that sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1 is the sum between j and i.

Maybe I can precompute prefix sums of b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i].

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can model this using prefix sums.

But I need to find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.

Let me consider that dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1 + dp[j])

This can be rewritten as:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j])

But this still seems too slow for large n.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Maybe I can find a way to express dp[i] in terms of dp[i+1].

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to iterate from i=n down to 1, maintaining some kind of minimum value.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the target position i, and try to find the minimum cost to move Kirill to position i.

To do this, I need to choose a sequence of swaps that move Kirill from position n to position i.

Each swap from position x to position y (y < x) costs a_y + sum of b_k from k=y+1 to x-1.

I need to choose a sequence of such swaps to reach from n to i, minimizing the total cost.

This sounds like a shortest path problem, where positions are nodes, and there are edges from x to y (y < x) with cost a_y + sum of b_k from k=y+1 to x-1.

But for n up to 200,000, building such a graph is impossible.

I need a better approach.

Maybe I can consider moving one step at a time, choosing the best j each time.

But I'm not sure if that leads to an optimal solution.

Wait, perhaps I can consider moving directly from n to i, choosing to swap with some j < i, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n-1.

But that doesn't account for intermediate swaps.

Wait, maybe I can consider moving from n to some j < n, then from j to some k < j, and so on, until I reach i.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1) + dp[j]

But this is too slow for large n.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can find a way to express dp[i] in terms of dp[i+1].

Let me consider that.

If I can express dp[i] in terms of dp[i+1], then I can compute dp[i] iteratively from n down to 1.

Let me see.

If I choose to swap directly from i to j, paying a_j + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1.

But I need to consider all possible j < i.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can consider that sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1 is equal to sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to n-1 minus sum of b[k] from k=i to n-1.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the target position i, and consider all possible j < i that I can swap to.

The cost would be a_j + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1.

I need to choose the j that minimizes this cost.

But I need to consider that after swapping to j, I might need to swap again to some k < j, and so on.

This seems like a recursive process.

But again, for large n, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1 is equal to sum of b[k] from k=1 to i-1 minus sum of b[k] from k=1 to j.

So, if I precompute prefix sums of b, say prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i], then sum from j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Thus, the cost to swap from i to j is a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) + dp[j]

This still seems too slow.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Let me rearrange the terms:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + prefix_b[i-1] + dp[j])

Wait, I can group some terms:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[i-1]

Let me define temp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of temp[j] + prefix_b[i-1]

So, dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1], where min_temp is the minimum temp[j] for j < i.

This is interesting.

So, if I can maintain the minimum temp[j] up to i-1, then dp[i] is just min_temp + prefix_b[i-1].

This can be computed efficiently.

Let me define min_temp = minimum of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) for j from 1 to i-1.

Then, dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

Now, I need to compute dp[i] for all i from 1 to n, using this relation.

Starting from i=1:

dp[1] = min over j < 1 of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[0]

But j < 1 means j=0, which doesn't exist, so dp[1] should be a special case.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[1] = a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to n-1, but I need to think carefully.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me assume that prefix_b[0] = 0, and prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i].

Then, for i=1, sum from j+1 to i-1 is sum from 1 to 0, which is 0.

So dp[1] = min over j < 1 of (a[j] + 0) + dp[j]

But j < 1 is invalid, so dp[1] should be a[0], I think.

Wait, maybe I need to set dp[1] = a[0], and then proceed.

Wait, perhaps I need to initialize dp[1] = a[0], and then for i from 2 to n:

dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b[k]) + dp[j]

But this still seems too slow.

Wait, but with the earlier rearrangement:

Define temp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]

Then dp[i] = min over j < i of temp[j] + prefix_b[i-1]

So, if I maintain the minimum temp[j] for j from 1 to i-1, then dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

And temp[j] depends on dp[j], which is computed similarly.

Wait, this seems recursive, but I need to find a way to compute it iteratively.

Let me try to compute dp[i] iteratively, maintaining the minimum temp[j].

Start with dp[1] = a[0], since to reach position 1 from position n, Kirill needs to swap directly to position 1, paying a[0] and sum of b[k] from k=1 to n-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, actually, in the operation, Kirill can choose to swap from position i to position j, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, if Kirill is at position n and wants to go to position 1, he can choose to swap directly to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to n-1.

Or he can choose to swap to some intermediate position j, then from j to some other position, and so on.

But to minimize the cost, maybe the direct swap to the desired position is the optimal choice.

Is that the case?

In the direct swap from n to i, the cost is a[i-1] + sum of b[k] from k=i to n-1.

Wait, indices are confusing here.

Let me clarify.

Position i ranges from 1 to n.

Kirill starts at position n.

To swap to position j (j < i), he pays a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, to swap directly from n to i, he pays a[i-1] + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to n-1.

Wait, no.

Wait, position i is from 1 to n.

Kirill is at position n.

He wants to swap to position j, where j < i.

Wait, I think I'm getting tangled in indices.

Let me try to rephrase.

Let's consider that Kirill is at position n, and he can choose to swap with any position j < n, paying a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n-1.

Then, from position j, he can choose to swap to any position k < j, paying a_k and sum of b_l from l=k+1 to j-1.

And so on, until he reaches the desired position.

But this seems too recursive and slow for large n.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider that the total cost to reach position i is the cost to swap directly to i from n, plus the cost to reach i through some intermediate positions.

But I need to find the minimal cost.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from higher positions to lower positions with the corresponding costs, and then find the shortest path from n to i for all i from 1 to m.

But with n up to 200,000, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the cost to move from position i to position j (j < i) is a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

I can think of this as a_j + (sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1).

Wait, if I look at the sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1, this is the same as sum from k=j+1 to n-1 minus sum from k=i to n-1.

But perhaps it's better to precompute prefix sums of b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i].

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange this.

Cost to swap from i to j is a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, total cost to reach i is the minimum over j < i of (a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j])

As I thought earlier.

Now, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a_j - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[i-1]

Let me define temp = a_j - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]

Then dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

So, if I can keep track of the minimum temp up to i-1, then dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

This seems efficient, as I can compute min_temp incrementally as I iterate from i=1 to n.

Let me try this.

First, compute prefix_b[i] for i from 0 to n-1.

Set dp[1] = a[0] + prefix_b[0], since to reach position 1, Kirill needs to pay a[0] and sum of b[k] from k=1 to n-1, which is prefix_b[n-1].

Wait, no.

Wait, if Kirill moves directly from n to 1, he pays a[0] and sum of b[k] from k=1 to n-1, which is prefix_b[n-1].

But according to the DP formula, dp[1] = min over j < 1 of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[0]

But j < 1 is invalid, so dp[1] = some initial value.

Maybe dp[1] = a[0] + sum from k=1 to n-1 of b[k] = a[0] + prefix_b[n-1]

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let's consider that positions are from 1 to n.

Kirill starts at position n.

He can choose to swap to any position j < n, paying a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n-1.

Then, from position j, he can choose to swap to any position k < j, paying a_k + sum of b_l from l=k+1 to j-1.

And so on, until he reaches the desired position i.

This seems like a tree structure, with position n as the root, and positions j < n as children, and so on.

But again, for n up to 200,000, this is not efficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach position i is the minimal cost among all possible paths from n to i.

Is there a way to compute this efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can think of it as choosing the best position j < i to swap to, and then summing up the costs.

But I need to consider that sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 is involved.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[i] = a[j] + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 + dp[j], for some j < i that minimizes this expression.

But this seems too slow.

Is there a way to optimize this?

Let me consider that sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 is equal to prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j])

Rearranged: dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[i-1]

Let me define temp[j] = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]

Then dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1], where min_temp is the minimum temp[j] for j < i.

So, if I maintain the minimum temp[j] for j from 1 to i-1, then dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

This can be computed efficiently.

Let me try to implement this.

First, compute prefix_b[i] for i from 0 to n-1.

Initialize dp[1] = a[0] + prefix_b[n-1]

Wait, but according to the formula, dp[1] = min over j < 1 of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[0]

Since j < 1 is invalid, dp[1] should be set to a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to n-1, which is a[0] + prefix_b[n-1]

Wait, but in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices to make it work.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1] to b[i]

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, cost to swap from i to j is a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Then, dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j])

Rearranged: dp[i] = min over j < i of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) + prefix_b[i-1]

Define temp = a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]

So, dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

Therefore, if I keep track of the minimum temp up to i-1, I can compute dp[i] efficiently.

Let me try to write this in code.

Initialize min_temp = a[0] - prefix_b[0] + dp[0]

But dp[0] is not defined.

Wait, perhaps I need to set dp[1] = a[0] + prefix_b[n-1]

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to initialize dp[1] = a[0] + prefix_b[n-1]

Then, for i=2 to n:

min_temp = min(min_temp, a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) for j from 1 to i-1

dp[i] = min_temp + prefix_b[i-1]

But I need to verify this.

Wait, perhaps it's better to iterate from i=1 to n, and maintain the minimum of (a[j] - prefix_b[j] + dp[j]) for j from 1 to i-1.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the provided code again.

In the provided code:

c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]

suff = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

Then, for each i from 0 to k-1:

ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i+1])

Finally, print ans

So, it's computing c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]), then computing suff[i] = sum of c from i to n-1.

Then, for each possible final position i from 0 to k-1, it computes a[i] + suff[i+1], and takes the minimum.

I need to understand why this works.

Let me consider that suff[i+1] represents the sum of c[j] from j=i+1 to n-1.

So, a[i] + suff[i+1] = a[i] + sum of min(a[j], b[j]) from j=i+1 to n-1.

But is this equal to the actual cost of moving to position i?

Wait, perhaps the idea is that Kirill moves directly to position i, paying a[i], and then pays min(a[j], b[j]) for all j from i+1 to n-1.

But I'm not sure if this accounts for all the costs correctly.

Wait, maybe it's considering that for each person from i+1 to n, Kirill has to pay either a_j or b_j, whichever is smaller.

But in reality, when Kirill moves to position i, he has to pay a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1 for each swap operation.

This seems different.

Alternatively, perhaps it's considering that suff[i+1] represents the minimal cost to "skip" from position i to the end.

But I'm still not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose Kirill moves directly from position n to position i, paying a[i-1] + sum of b[k] from k=i to n-1.

Then, the total cost would be a[i-1] + sum of b[k] from k=i to n-1.

This is similar to what the code is computing, but not exactly.

In the code, it's computing a[i] + sum of min(a[j], b[j]) from j=i+1 to n-1.

Wait, indices are off by one because Python uses 0-based indexing.

So, a[i] in the code corresponds to a_{i+1} in the problem statement.

But I need to map this correctly.

Wait, in the problem, positions are from 1 to n, but in the code, a[i] corresponds to a_i in the problem.

Wait, no, in the input, a is list from a1 to an, so a[i] in code is a_{i+1} in problem.

Wait, no, in Python, list indices start at 0, but the problem positions start at 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices accordingly.

Let me assume that a[i] in code corresponds to a_{i+1} in the problem.

Similarly, b[i] corresponds to b_{i+1}.

Then, c[i] = min(a[i], b[i]) = min(a_{i+1}, b_{i+1})

suff[i] = sum of c[j] from j=i to n-1.

Then, for each i from 0 to k-1:

a[i] + suff[i+1] = a_{i+1} + sum of min(a_{j+1}, b_{j+1}) from j=i+1 to n-1.

But in the problem, if Kirill moves directly from n to i, he pays a_i + sum of b_k from k=i+1 to n.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n, with Kirill at n+1.

Wait, I need to be careful with indices.

I think I'm getting too tangled in indices.

Given that the code seems to work for the sample inputs, perhaps it's correct.

But I need to understand why.

Let me consider that suff[i+1] represents some kind of minimal cost to move from position i+1 to the end.

Then, a[i] + suff[i+1] would be the cost to move directly to position i, paying a_i, plus the minimal cost to handle the remaining people from i+1 to n.

But I still don't see why this would give the minimal total cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrectly working for the sample inputs by coincidence, but is not correct in general.

I need to find a counterexample where this approach fails.

Let me try constructing a small test case.

Suppose n=3, m=2

a = [1, 100, 100]

b = [10, 10, 10]

According to the code:

c = [min(1,10)=1, min(100,10)=10, min(100,10)=10]

suff = [1+10+10=21, 10+10=20, 10]

Then, for i=0 to 1 (m=2):

i=0: a[0] + suff[1] = 1 + 20 = 21

i=1: a[1] + suff[2] = 100 + 10 = 110

So, the minimum is 21.

Now, let's see what the actual minimal cost should be.

Kirill starts at position 3.

Option 1: Move directly to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to 2 = 1 + 10 + 10 = 21

Option 2: Move to position 2, paying a[1] + sum of b[k] from k=2 to 2 = 100 + 10 = 110, then move to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to 1 = 1 + 10 = 11, total 110 + 11 = 121

So, the minimal cost is indeed 21.

Another option: Move to position 2, paying 100 + 10 = 110, then move to position 1, paying 1 + 10 = 11, total 121, which is worse than moving directly to position 1.

So, in this case, the code gives the correct answer.

Let me try another test case.

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

As in the first sample input.

According to the code, the output is 14, which matches the sample.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

But I need to understand why.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill moves directly from position n to position i, paying a[i-1] + sum of b[k] from k=i to n-1.

Then, the total cost is a[i-1] + sum of b[k] from k=i to n-1.

In the code, it's computing a[i] + sum of min(a[j], b[j]) from j=i+1 to n-1.

Wait, this suggests that suff[i+1] is sum of min(a[j], b[j]) from j=i+1 to n-1.

But in reality, the cost should be sum of b[k] from k=i+1 to n-1.

So, why is it using min(a[j], b[j])?

This doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's a different way to model the minimal cost.

Wait, maybe it's considering that for each person from i+1 to n-1, the minimal cost is min(a[j], b[j]), and summing those up.

But in reality, if Kirill moves directly to position i, he has to pay sum of b[k] from k=i+1 to n-1, not sum of min(a[j], b[j]).

So, why does this work?

Perhaps it's a mistake, but it happens to work for the sample inputs.

I need to find a test case where this approach fails.

Let me try n=3, m=2

a = [1, 2, 3]

b = [2, 1, 1]

According to the code:

c = [min(1,2)=1, min(2,1)=1, min(3,1)=1]

suff = [1+1+1=3, 1+1=2, 1]

Then, for i=0 to 1:

i=0: a[0] + suff[1] = 1 + 2 = 3

i=1: a[1] + suff[2] = 2 + 1 = 3

So, minimum is 3.

Now, let's compute the actual minimal cost.

Option 1: Move directly to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to 2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Option 2: Move to position 2, paying a[1] + sum of b[k] from k=2 to 2 = 2 + 1 = 3, then move to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to 1 = 1 + 2 = 3, total 3 + 3 = 6

So, the minimal cost is 4, but the code outputs 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but according to the code, it's outputting 3, but the actual minimal cost is 4.

So, this seems to be a counterexample where the code gives an incorrect answer.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seemed to work.

Maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in this test case.

Wait, in my calculation, moving directly to position 1 costs 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Moving to position 2 costs 2 + 1 = 3, then to position 1 costs 1 + 2 = 3, total 6, which is worse than moving directly to position 1.

So, minimal cost is 4, but the code outputs 3, which is less than the actual minimal cost.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, it seemed to work.

Maybe the approach is not generally correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the understanding of the operations.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the operations.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"Kirill can choose any position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j. In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that j < k < i, Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k."

So, when moving from i to j, Kirill pays a_j and sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

Wait, in my earlier test case, n=3, m=2

a = [1,2,3]

b = [2,1,1]

Kirill starts at position 3.

Option 1: Move directly to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to 2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

Option 2: Move to position 2, paying a[1] + sum of b[k] from k=2 to 2 = 2 + 1 = 3, then move to position 1, paying a[0] + sum of b[k] from k=1 to 1 = 1 + 2 = 3, total 3 + 3 = 6

So, minimal is 4.

But according to the code, it's computing a[i] + suff[i+1], which for i=0 is 1 + 2 = 3, and for i=1 is 2 + 1 = 3, so it outputs 3, which is less than the actual minimal cost of 4.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seemed to work.

Maybe the approach is incorrect, but it coincidentally gives the correct answer for the sample inputs.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the understanding of the indices.

Wait, perhaps in the code, a[i] corresponds to a_{i+1}, and suff[i+1] is sum of min(a[j], b[j]) from j=i+1 to n-1.

But in reality, the cost should be a[j] + sum of b[k] from k=j+1 to i-1, for each swap operation.

I think the code is incorrectly simplifying the cost calculation.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
