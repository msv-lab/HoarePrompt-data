Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Alice and Bob have a ribbon divided into n parts, and they want to paint it. Alice first paints each part with one of m colors, and then Bob can choose at most k parts to repaint them all to the same color. Bob wants all parts to be the same color, but Alice wants to prevent that by choosing her initial coloring carefully.

So, I need to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that no matter which k parts Bob chooses to repaint, he cannot make all parts the same color.

First, I need to understand the constraints:

- t is the number of test cases, and it's up to 1000, which is fine for a program.

- For each test case, I have n, m, and k, where n is the number of parts, m is the number of colors, and k is the maximum number of parts Bob can repaint.

I need to output "YES" if Alice can paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

Looking at the example:

Input:

5

1 1 1

5 1 1

5 2 1

5 2 2

5 5 3

Output:

NO

NO

YES

NO

YES

So, for n=1, m=1, k=1: NO

n=5, m=1, k=1: NO

n=5, m=2, k=1: YES

n=5, m=2, k=2: NO

n=5, m=5, k=3: YES

From the note:

- If n=1, obviously all parts are already the same, so Bob doesn't need to do anything.

- If m=1, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color, so Bob can just repaint any k parts to that same color, achieving all parts the same.

- For n=5, m=2, k=1: Alice can paint [1,2,1,2,1], and Bob can't repaint one part to make all parts the same.

- For n=5, m=2, k=2: No matter how Alice paints, Bob can choose 2 parts to repaint to make all parts the same.

- For n=5, m=5, k=3: Alice can paint [1,2,3,4,5], and Bob can't repaint 3 parts to make all parts the same.

So, I need to find a general condition based on n, m, and k.

Let me think about this.

First, if n <= k, then Bob can always repaint up to k parts, which includes all n parts if k >= n. So, he can always make all parts the same color, hence "NO".

Similarly, if m = 1, Alice has no choice but to paint all parts the same color, so Bob can just repaint up to k parts to maintain that color.

But in the case where n > k and m > 1, Alice can try to paint the ribbon in a way that makes it impossible for Bob to make all parts the same color by repainting only k parts.

So, the condition seems to be:

- If n <= k, then "NO"

- If m = 1, then "NO"

- Else, check if Alice can paint in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color with k repainting operations.

But, I need a more precise condition.

Let's think about it in terms of the maximum number of parts that can be the same color after Alice's painting.

Suppose Alice paints the ribbon such that the maximum number of parts that share the same color is some value max_count.

Then, Bob can repaint up to k parts to try to make all parts match that color.

So, if n - max_count <= k, then Bob can repaint the remaining parts to make all parts the same color.

Conversely, if n - max_count > k, then Bob cannot do it.

Therefore, Alice should aim to minimize max_count to make n - max_count > k.

In other words, Alice wants to distribute the colors as evenly as possible to maximize the minimum number of parts that need to be repainted.

Wait, actually, Alice wants to maximize the minimum number of parts Bob needs to repaint for any color.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the Pigeonhole Principle.

If Alice paints the ribbon with m colors, the maximum number of parts in any one color is minimized when the parts are distributed as evenly as possible among the m colors.

So, the maximum number of parts in any one color would be ceil(n / m).

Then, the number of parts that Bob needs to repaint to make all parts that color is n - ceil(n / m).

If n - ceil(n / m) > k, then Bob cannot make all parts that color, regardless of which color he chooses.

But, Alice wants to ensure that for all colors, n - count_of_that_color > k.

Wait, no. Alice wants to ensure that there is no color for which n - count_of_that_color <= k.

Because if n - count_of_that_color <= k, then Bob can repaint those n - count_of_that_color parts to make all parts that color.

So, Alice wants to ensure that for all colors, n - count_of_that_color > k.

Which implies that count_of_that_color < n - k.

But count_of_that_color must be at least ceil((n - k)/m), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think about the minimal number of parts that need to be repainted for any color.

If for every color, the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts that color is greater than k, then Bob cannot achieve his goal.

That is, for every color c, n - count_c > k, where count_c is the number of parts painted with color c.

So, if the maximum count_c across all colors is less than or equal to n - k, then Bob cannot make all parts any single color.

Wait, no.

Wait, n - count_c > k implies count_c < n - k.

So, if for all colors, count_c < n - k, then Bob cannot make all parts that color.

But Alice chooses the coloring, so she wants to choose counts such that the largest count is as large as possible but still less than n - k.

But she also has to distribute the parts among m colors.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the minimal number of parts that need to be repainted over all possible colors.

Alice wants that minimal number to be greater than k.

Wait, more precisely, Alice wants that for every possible color, the number of parts that need to be repainted to make all parts that color is greater than k.

Which means, for every color c, n - count_c > k, or count_c < n - k.

So, the maximal count_c should be less than n - k.

But Alice has to distribute n parts among m colors, and she wants the largest count_c to be as small as possible.

So, the largest count_c is ceil(n / m).

So, if ceil(n / m) < n - k, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but ceil(n / m) is the minimal possible maximal count_c when distributing n parts among m colors.

So, if ceil(n / m) < n - k, then "YES", else "NO".

Wait, but let's check with the sample input.

First test case: n=1, m=1, k=1.

ceil(1 / 1) = 1 < 1 - 1 = 0? 1 < 0 is False, so "NO". Correct.

Second test case: n=5, m=1, k=1.

ceil(5 / 1) = 5 < 5 - 1 = 4? 5 < 4 is False, so "NO". Correct.

Third test case: n=5, m=2, k=1.

ceil(5 / 2) = 3 < 5 - 1 = 4? 3 < 4 is True, so "YES". Correct.

Fourth test case: n=5, m=2, k=2.

ceil(5 / 2) = 3 < 5 - 2 = 3? 3 < 3 is False, so "NO". Correct.

Fifth test case: n=5, m=5, k=3.

ceil(5 / 5) = 1 < 5 - 3 = 2? 1 < 2 is True, so "YES". Correct.

So, this seems to match the sample outputs.

Therefore, the condition should be:

if n <= k or math.ceil(n / m) >= n - k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for itest in range(0, t, 1):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

Wait a second, it has "n - math.ceil(n / m) < k".

But according to my reasoning, it should be "math.ceil(n / m) >= n - k".

Let's see if these are equivalent.

n - ceil(n / m) < k is equivalent to n - k < ceil(n / m)

Which is equivalent to ceil(n / m) > n - k, which is the same as ceil(n / m) >= n - k + 1.

But I had ceil(n / m) >= n - k for "NO".

Wait, I need to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality.

Let me re-express the condition.

Alice wants ceil(n / m) < n - k for "YES".

Which is equivalent to ceil(n / m) >= n - k for "NO".

So, in the program, it has n - ceil(n / m) < k, which is equivalent to ceil(n / m) > n - k, which is the same as ceil(n / m) >= n - k + 1.

But I think there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the inequality.

Let me consider n=5, m=2, k=1.

ceil(5 / 2) = 3

n - ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2

2 < 1? No, 2 is not less than 1, so it should print "YES", which matches the sample.

Another case: n=5, m=2, k=2.

ceil(5 / 2) = 3

n - ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2

2 < 2? No, 2 is not less than 2, so print "NO", matches the sample.

Another case: n=5, m=5, k=3.

ceil(5 / 5) = 1

n - ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4

4 < 3? No, 4 is not less than 3, so print "YES", matches the sample.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, Alice wants ceil(n / m) < n - k for "YES".

So, ceil(n / m) < n - k → "YES"

Else, "NO"

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which is equivalent to ceil(n / m) > n - k → "NO"

Which is the same as ceil(n / m) <= n - k → "YES"

Wait, no.

Wait, n - ceil(n / m) < k is equivalent to ceil(n / m) > n - k, which is ceil(n / m) >= n - k + 1.

But in my earlier condition, Alice wants ceil(n / m) < n - k for "YES".

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice paints in a way that the maximal count of any color is ceil(n / m).

Then, to make all parts that color, Bob needs to repaint n - ceil(n / m) parts.

If n - ceil(n / m) > k, then Bob cannot do it, so "YES".

Else, "NO".

Wait, that seems correct.

So, the condition should be:

if n - ceil(n / m) > k:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

But in the program, it's:

if n <= k or n - ceil(n / m) < k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

Wait, n - ceil(n / m) < k is equivalent to n - ceil(n / m) <= k - 1.

But according to my condition, Alice wants n - ceil(n / m) > k for "YES".

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the program.

Wait, let's see for n=5, m=2, k=1.

n - ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2

2 < 1? No, so print "YES". Correct.

For n=5, m=2, k=2.

2 < 2? No, so print "NO". Correct.

For n=5, m=5, k=3.

4 < 3? No, so print "YES". Correct.

For n=5, m=1, k=1.

ceil(5 / 1) = 5

5 - 5 = 0 < 1? 0 < 1 is True, so print "NO". Correct.

For n=1, m=1, k=1.

1 - 1 = 0 < 1? 0 < 1 is True, so print "NO". Correct.

So, it seems to work, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be n - ceil(n / m) > k for "YES", but in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k for "NO".

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the inequality.

Wait, n - ceil(n / m) > k → "YES"

n - ceil(n / m) <= k → "NO"

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which is equivalent to n - ceil(n / m) <= k - 1 → "NO"

But that's not the same as n - ceil(n / m) <= k → "NO"

So, perhaps there is a mistake in the program.

Wait, let's consider n=5, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(n / m) = 2 <= 2, so "NO". Correct.

n=5, m=2, k=1.

2 <=1? No, so "YES". Correct.

Wait, but according to the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which for n=5, m=2, k=1: 2 < 1 is False, so "YES". Correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be:

if n - ceil(n / m) <= k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

Which is equivalent to the program's condition when n - ceil(n / m) < k + epsilon, but since they are integers, it's the same.

Wait, perhaps the program has a mistake.

Wait, in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

But according to my condition, n - ceil(n / m) <= k → "NO"

So, there's a difference between < and <=.

Wait, let's see for n=5, m=2, k=2.

n - ceil(n / m) = 2 <= 2 → "NO". Correct.

In the program, 2 < 2 is False, so "YES". Wait, that's incorrect.

Wait, no, in the program, for n=5, m=2, k=2:

n - ceil(n / m) = 2 < 2? 2 < 2 is False, so print "NO". Correct.

Because according to my condition, n - ceil(n / m) <= k → "NO", which is 2 <= 2 → "NO". Correct.

Similarly, for n=5, m=2, k=1:

2 <=1? No, so "YES". Correct.

Hence, the program seems correct.

Wait, but in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which is equivalent to n - ceil(n / m) <= k -1 → "NO"

But in reality, it should be n - ceil(n / m) <= k → "NO"

So, there is a discrepancy when n - ceil(n / m) == k.

Wait, in the program, if n - ceil(n / m) == k, it will print "YES", but according to my reasoning, it should be "NO" in that case.

Wait, for n=5, m=2, k=2:

n - ceil(n / m) = 2 == 2, so according to my condition, it should be "NO", but in the program, since 2 < 2 is False, it prints "NO". So, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering.

Wait, in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which means, if n - ceil(n / m) < k, then "NO"

Else, "YES"

But according to my condition, if n - ceil(n / m) <= k, then "NO"

Else, "YES"

So, there's a difference when n - ceil(n / m) == k.

In the program, it's treated as "YES", but according to my condition, it should be "NO"

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=5, m=2, k=2:

n - ceil(n / m) = 2 <= 2 → "NO", which matches the program's output of "NO"

Wait, in the program, n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Else, "YES"

But in my condition, n - ceil(n / m) > k → "YES"

Else, "NO"

Which is equivalent to:

if n - ceil(n / m) > k:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

But earlier, I thought it should be n - ceil(n / m) > k → "YES"

Which matches my condition.

But in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which is equivalent to n - ceil(n / m) >= k → "YES"

Wait, no, n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Else, "YES"

Which is n - ceil(n / m) >= k → "YES"

But according to my condition, n - ceil(n / m) > k → "YES"

So, there's a discrepancy when n - ceil(n / m) == k.

In the program, it's treated as "YES", but according to my condition, it should be "NO"

Wait, perhaps I need to think again.

Let me consider a test case where n - ceil(n / m) == k.

Suppose n=5, m=2, k=3.

ceil(5 / 2) = 3

n - ceil(n / m) = 2

2 < 3 → "NO"

But according to my condition, n - ceil(n / m) > k → "YES"

Which would be 2 > 3 → "NO", correct.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to stick with the program's condition, as it seems to match the sample inputs.

Alternatively, perhaps both conditions are equivalent.

Wait, no.

Wait, n - ceil(n / m) < k is equivalent to ceil(n / m) > n - k

Which is the same as ceil(n / m) >= n - k + 1

But I need to relate it to my condition.

Wait, perhaps I need to express it differently.

Let me think about it in terms of Bob's ability.

Bob can repaint up to k parts to make all parts the same color.

The number of parts he needs to repaint to make all parts color c is n - count_c.

So, if for any color c, n - count_c <= k, then Bob can make all parts that color by repainting at most k parts.

Otherwise, if for all colors, n - count_c > k, then Bob cannot do it.

Alice wants to ensure that for all colors, n - count_c > k, which is count_c < n - k.

Given that Alice chooses the counts, and she has m colors, she needs to distribute n parts among m colors such that no color has count_c >= n - k + 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the worst case, Alice wants to maximize the minimal number of parts that need to be repainted for any color.

Which is equivalent to minimizing the maximum count_c.

So, she wants ceil(n / m) to be as small as possible, but constrained by m.

So, the minimal possible maximal count_c is ceil(n / m).

Then, the number of parts Bob needs to repaint for that color is n - ceil(n / m).

If n - ceil(n / m) > k, then "YES"

Else, "NO"

Hence, the condition should be:

if n - ceil(n / m) > k:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

Which is equivalent to the program's condition:

if n <= k or n - ceil(n / m) < k:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

Wait, no.

Wait, n - ceil(n / m) < k is equivalent to n - k < ceil(n / m)

Which is ceil(n / m) > n - k

Which is the same as ceil(n / m) >= n - k + 1

But according to my condition, n - ceil(n / m) > k → "YES"

Which is ceil(n / m) < n - k → "YES"

Else, "NO"

So, in the program, it's n - ceil(n / m) < k → "NO"

Which is ceil(n / m) > n - k → "NO"

Else, "YES"

Which matches my condition.

Hence, the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**
