Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign occurs every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But the tricky part is that we have to wait for each sign to occur one after another, in order.

So, for example, if n=3 and a = [2, 3, 4], here's how it would work:

- Start waiting for the first sign. It occurs in years 2, 4, 6, etc. So the first occurrence is in year 2.

- Now, starting from year 3, we wait for the second sign, which occurs in years 3, 6, 9, etc. The next occurrence after year 2 is in year 3.

- Then, starting from year 4, we wait for the third sign, which occurs in years 4, 8, 12, etc. The next occurrence after year 3 is in year 4.

- So, the third sign occurs in year 4, which is when the apocalypse happens.

Wait, but in this example, the third sign occurs in year 4, which is fine because it's after the second sign in year 3.

Another example from the problem:

Input:

4

6

3 2 4 5 9 18

5

1 2 3 4 5

5

1 1 1 1 1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Output:

36

5

5

2012

Looking at the first test case:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

- First sign occurs in year 3.

- Starting from year 4, wait for the second sign, which occurs in years 2,4,6,... So the next occurrence after year 3 is in year 4.

- Starting from year 5, wait for the third sign, which occurs in years 4,8,12,... But year 4 has already passed, so the next is year 8. But according to the note, it's year 8, but in the explanation, it's year 8 for the third sign, then year 10 for the fourth, 18 for the fifth, and 36 for the sixth.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here. In the problem's note, for the first test case:

- First sign in year 3

- Second sign in year 4

- Third sign in year 8

- Fourth sign in year 10

- Fifth sign in year 18

- Sixth sign in year 36

So, it seems like for each sign, we calculate the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the year when the previous sign occurred.

So, for sign 1: first occurrence is year 3.

Sign 2: smallest multiple of 2 greater than 3, which is 4.

Sign 3: smallest multiple of 4 greater than 4, which is 8.

Sign 4: smallest multiple of 5 greater than 8, which is 10.

Sign 5: smallest multiple of 9 greater than 10, which is 18.

Sign 6: smallest multiple of 18 greater than 18, which is 36.

So, the year when the sixth sign occurs is year 36.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

- Sign 1: year 1

- Sign 2: smallest multiple of 2 greater than 1, which is 2

- Sign 3: smallest multiple of 3 greater than 2, which is 3

- Sign 4: smallest multiple of 4 greater than 3, which is 4

- Sign 5: smallest multiple of 5 greater than 4, which is 5

So, the fifth sign occurs in year 5.

In the third test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

- Sign 1: year 1

- Sign 2: smallest multiple of 1 greater than 1, which is 2

- Sign 3: smallest multiple of 1 greater than 2, which is 3

- Sign 4: smallest multiple of 1 greater than 3, which is 4

- Sign 5: smallest multiple of 1 greater than 4, which is 5

So, again, the fifth sign occurs in year 5.

In the fourth test case:

n=6, a=[50,30,711,200,503,1006]

- Sign 1: year 50

- Sign 2: smallest multiple of 30 greater than 50, which is 60

- Sign 3: smallest multiple of 711 greater than 60, which is 711

- Sign 4: smallest multiple of 200 greater than 711, which is 800

- Sign 5: smallest multiple of 503 greater than 800, which is 1006

- Sign 6: smallest multiple of 1006 greater than 1006, which is 2012

So, the sixth sign occurs in year 2012.

Okay, so the general approach is, for each sign i from 1 to n:

- Find the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the year when the previous sign occurred.

- That becomes the year when the i-th sign occurs.

So, to implement this, we need to iterate through the signs one by one, keeping track of the year when the previous sign occurred, and for each sign, calculate the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than the previous sign's year.

Mathematically, if p is the year when the previous sign occurred, and we need to find the smallest multiple of a_i greater than p, that can be calculated as:

ceil((p + 1) / a_i) * a_i

This formula gives the smallest multiple of a_i that is greater than p.

Let me verify this formula with some examples.

Take p = 3, a_i = 2:

ceil((3 + 1)/2) * 2 = ceil(4/2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4, which is correct.

p = 4, a_i = 4:

ceil((4 + 1)/4) * 4 = ceil(5/4) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8, which is correct.

p = 8, a_i = 5:

ceil((8 + 1)/5) * 5 = ceil(9/5) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10, correct.

p = 10, a_i = 9:

ceil((10 + 1)/9) * 9 = ceil(11/9) * 9 = 2 * 9 = 18, correct.

p = 18, a_i = 18:

ceil((18 + 1)/18) * 18 = ceil(19/18) * 18 = 2 * 18 = 36, correct.

Another example:

p = 2, a_i = 3:

ceil((2 + 1)/3) * 3 = ceil(3/3) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3, which is correct.

p = 3, a_i = 4:

ceil((3 + 1)/4) * 4 = ceil(4/4) * 4 = 1 * 4 = 4, correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought for p=3, a_i=4, it should be 4, but according to the formula, it's correct.

Ok, so the formula seems valid.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

num_tests = int(input())

while num_tests > 0:

num_tests -= 1

n = int(input())

nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]

start_year = 0

for x in range(0, len(nums)):

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

print(start_year)

So, it reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the list of a_i's.

It initializes start_year to 0.

Then, for each sign, it updates start_year as follows:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Let's see if this matches the formula I derived earlier.

Recall that the formula is:

ceil((p + 1)/a_i) * a_i

In Python, to simulate ceil division, we can use (p + a_i - 1) // a_i.

But in the given code, it's using integer division:

((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Let's see if this is equivalent to ceil((start_year + 1)/nums[x]) * nums[x].

In Python, the expression (start_year + 1) // nums[x] is integer division.

Adding 1 to it and then multiplying by nums[x] should give the next multiple of nums[x] after start_year.

Wait, let's test it with some values.

Take start_year = 3, nums[x] = 2:

((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

But according to the earlier formula, it should be 4.

Wait, discrepancy here.

According to the formula, ceil((3 + 1)/2) * 2 = ceil(4/2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4

But the code gives 6.

Wait, that's incorrect.

Let me check again.

Wait, in the code:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

So, for start_year = 3, nums[x] = 2:

(3 + 1) // 2 = 4 // 2 = 2

Then, 2 + 1 = 3

Then, 3 * 2 = 6

But according to the formula, it should be 4.

So, this seems wrong.

Wait, maybe I misread the formula.

In the formula, ceil((p + 1)/a_i) * a_i

In this case, p = 3, a_i = 2

ceil(4/2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4

But the code gives 6.

So, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula in integer division.

An alternative way to compute ceil(a/b) is (a + b - 1) // b

So, ceil((p + 1)/a_i) * a_i = ((p + 1) + a_i - 1) // a_i ) * a_i

Simplify: ((p + 1 + a_i - 1)) // a_i ) * a_i = ((p + a_i)) // a_i ) * a_i

So, in code, that would be:

((p + a_i) // a_i) * a_i

But in the given code, it's ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Which is different.

Let's compute ((p + 1) // a_i + 1) * a_i

For p=3, a_i=2:

(3 + 1) // 2 + 1 = 4 // 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

Then, 3 * 2 = 6

But according to the correct formula, it should be 4.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe it's intended to be floor division plus one.

Wait, let's think differently.

The smallest multiple of a_i greater than p is equal to:

If p is a multiple of a_i, then next multiple is p + a_i

Else, it's a_i * ceil(p/a_i)

Wait, no.

Wait, to find the smallest multiple of a_i greater than p:

If p % a_i == 0, then next multiple is p + a_i

Else, it's a_i * ceil(p/a_i)

So, in code, it can be:

if p % a_i == 0:

next_multiple = p + a_i

else:

next_multiple = a_i * ((p // a_i) + 1)

Or, more concisely, next_multiple = a_i * ceil((p + 1)/a_i)

Which is ((p + 1) // a_i) * a_i

In Python, yes.

So, in Python, next_multiple = ((p + 1) // a_i) * a_i

Let's test it with p=3, a_i=2:

((3 + 1) // 2) * 2 = (4 // 2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4, correct.

p=4, a_i=4:

((4 + 1) // 4) * 4 = (5 // 4) * 4 = 1 * 4 = 4, but since p is already a multiple, the next multiple should be 8.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 4, which is not greater than 4.

So, there's an issue here.

Wait, the formula should be:

If p is a multiple of a_i, then the next multiple is p + a_i.

Else, it's a_i * ceil(p / a_i)

So, in code, it should be:

if p % a_i == 0:

next_multiple = p + a_i

else:

next_multiple = a_i * ((p // a_i) + 1)

In the earlier formula, ((p + 1) // a_i) * a_i handles both cases.

For p=3, a_i=2:

((3 + 1) // 2) * 2 = 4, correct.

For p=4, a_i=4:

((4 + 1) // 4) * 4 = 5 // 4 = 1 * 4 = 4, but we need it to be 8 because p=4 is already a multiple, so next multiple is 8.

But according to the formula, it's giving 4, which is not greater than 4.

So, the formula needs adjustment.

To get the smallest multiple greater than p, not greater than or equal to p.

So, if p is a multiple of a_i, then next_multiple = p + a_i

Else, next_multiple = a_i * ceil(p / a_i)

In code, that would be:

if p % a_i == 0:

next_multiple = p + a_i

else:

next_multiple = a_i * ((p // a_i) + 1)

Alternatively, a more concise way is:

next_multiple = a_i * ceil(p / a_i)

But if p is a multiple of a_i, then ceil(p / a_i) = p / a_i, so next_multiple = p, which is not greater than p.

So, to ensure it's greater than p, we need:

if p % a_i == 0:

next_multiple = p + a_i

else:

next_multiple = a_i * ceil(p / a_i)

In Python, this can be written as:

if p % a_i == 0:

next_multiple = p + a_i

else:

next_multiple = a_i * ((p // a_i) + 1)

Alternatively, a trick is to use ceil((p + 1)/a_i) * a_i

For p=4, a_i=4:

ceil((4 + 1)/4) * 4 = ceil(5/4) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8, which is correct.

For p=3, a_i=2:

ceil((3 + 1)/2) * 2 = ceil(4/2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4, correct.

For p=8, a_i=5:

ceil((8 + 1)/5) * 5 = ceil(9/5) * 5 = 2 * 5 = 10, correct.

So, the formula next_multiple = ceil((p + 1)/a_i) * a_i seems correct.

In integer division, ceil(a/b) can be implemented as (a + b - 1) // b

So, ceil((p + 1)/a_i) = ((p + 1) + a_i - 1) // a_i

Therefore, next_multiple = ((p + 1 + a_i - 1) // a_i) * a_i = ((p + a_i) // a_i) * a_i

So, in code, it's:

next_multiple = (((p + a_i) // a_i)) * a_i

Now, looking back at the provided code:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Wait, that's different from what we have.

According to our derivation, it should be:

start_year = ((start_year + nums[x]) // nums[x]) * nums[x]

But in the code, it's:

start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]

Which extra +1 inside the integer division.

Let's test it with p=3, a_i=2:

((3 + 1) // 2 + 1) * 2 = (4 // 2 + 1) * 2 = (2 + 1) * 2 = 3 * 2 = 6

But according to the correct formula, it should be 4.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Let me check with another example.

Take p=4, a_i=4:

((4 + 1) // 4 + 1) * 4 = (5 // 4 + 1) * 4 = (1 + 1) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8

According to the correct formula: ((4 + 4) // 4) * 4 = (8 // 4) * 4 = 2 * 4 = 8, which is correct.

Wait, in this case, it matches.

But for p=3, a_i=2, the code gives 6, whereas the correct next multiple greater than p is 4.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem's first test case, if we follow the code's logic:

Start with start_year = 0

For a1=3: ((0 + 1)//3 + 1)*3 = (1//3 + 1)*3 = (0 + 1)*3 = 3

So, start_year = 3

For a2=2: ((3 + 1)//2 + 1)*2 = (4//2 + 1)*2 = (2 + 1)*2 = 6

But according to the problem, the second sign should be in year 4, not 6.

So, the code is incorrect here.

Wait, but in the problem's explanation, for the first test case, it's:

- First sign in year 3

- Second sign in year 4

- Third in year 8

- Fourth in year 10

- Fifth in year 18

- Sixth in year 36

But according to the code:

start_year = 0

a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

After first sign: ((0 + 1)//3 + 1)*3 = (1//3 + 1)*3 = (0 + 1)*3 = 3

After second sign: ((3 + 1)//2 + 1)*2 = (4//2 + 1)*2 = (2 + 1)*2 = 6

After third sign: ((6 + 1)//4 + 1)*4 = (7//4 + 1)*4 = (1 + 1)*4 = 8

After fourth sign: ((8 + 1)//5 + 1)*5 = (9//5 + 1)*5 = (1 + 1)*5 = 10

After fifth sign: ((10 + 1)//9 + 1)*9 = (11//9 + 1)*9 = (1 + 1)*9 = 18

After sixth sign: ((18 + 1)//18 + 1)*18 = (19//18 + 1)*18 = (1 + 1)*18 = 36

So, it matches the problem's output of 36.

Wait, but according to the problem's note, the second sign should be in year 4, but according to the code, it's in year 6.

But in the sequence above, it's showing year 6 for the second sign, but the final answer is still 36, which matches the problem's output.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem's note.

Looking back at the problem's note:

In the first set of input data of the example:

- The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year;

- the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed);

- the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year);

- the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed);

- the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed);

- the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Wait, it says "the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed);"

So, according to the note, the second sign occurs in year 4, but according to the code, it's in year 6.

But the final answer is still 36, which matches the problem's output.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem's note.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence of the (i+1)-th sign, starting from the year x+1"

So, after the first sign in year 3, they start waiting for the second sign starting from year 4.

So, they look for the smallest multiple of a2=2 that is greater than 3, which is 4.

Similarly, after the second sign in year 4, they start waiting for the third sign starting from year 5.

The smallest multiple of a3=4 greater than 4 is 8.

And so on.

So, in the code, for the second sign, it's calculating ((3 + 1)//2 + 1)*2 = (4//2 + 1)*2 = (2 + 1)*2 = 6, which is incorrect according to the problem's note, which says it should be 4.

But the final answer is still 36, which matches the problem's output.

Wait, perhaps in the sequence, even though the intermediate years are different, the final year is the same.

Wait, no, in the code's sequence:

- Sign 1: 3

- Sign 2: 6

- Sign 3: 8

- Sign 4: 10

- Sign 5: 18

- Sign 6: 36

But according to the problem's note:

- Sign 1: 3

- Sign 2: 4

- Sign 3: 8

- Sign 4: 10

- Sign 5: 18

- Sign 6: 36

So, the second sign is different: 4 vs 6.

But the final answer is 36 in both cases.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows multiple sequences, and both are acceptable, as long as the nth sign occurs in the correct year.

But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the way the problem is phrased, the year when the nth sign occurs is the answer, and the intermediate years don't matter as long as the nth sign is in the correct year.

But in the first test case, the answer is 36, which matches the problem's output.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5]

According to the problem, the answer is 5.

Let's see with the code:

start_year = 0

a=[1,2,3,4,5]

First sign: ((0 + 1)//1 + 1)*1 = (1//1 + 1)*1 = (1 + 1)*1 = 2

Second sign: ((2 + 1)//2 + 1)*2 = (3//2 + 1)*2 = (1 + 1)*2 = 4

Third sign: ((4 + 1)//3 + 1)*3 = (5//3 + 1)*3 = (1 + 1)*3 = 6

Fourth sign: ((6 + 1)//4 + 1)*4 = (7//4 + 1)*4 = (1 + 1)*4 = 8

Fifth sign: ((8 + 1)//5 + 1)*5 = (9//5 + 1)*5 = (1 + 1)*5 = 10

So, according to the code, the fifth sign is in year 10, but according to the problem, it's in year 5.

So, the code is giving an incorrect answer for the second test case.

Wait, but in the problem's output, it's 5 for this test case.

So, the code is incorrect here.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

According to the problem, the answer is 5.

With the code:

start_year = 0

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

First sign: ((0 + 1)//1 + 1)*1 = (1//1 + 1)*1 = (1 + 1)*1 = 2

Second sign: ((2 + 1)//1 + 1)*1 = (3//1 + 1)*1 = (3 + 1)*1 = 4

Third sign: ((4 + 1)//1 + 1)*1 = (5//1 + 1)*1 = (5 + 1)*1 = 6

Fourth sign: ((6 + 1)//1 + 1)*1 = (7//1 + 1)*1 = (7 + 1)*1 = 8

Fifth sign: ((8 + 1)//1 + 1)*1 = (9//1 + 1)*1 = (9 + 1)*1 = 10

So, the code gives 10, but the problem says it should be 5.

So, clearly, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the problem's output, it's 5 for this test case.

So, there's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the code works.

Looking back at the first test case, where n=6 and a=[3,2,4,5,9,18], the code gives 36, which matches the problem's output.

But for n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5], the code gives 10, but the problem's output is 5.

Similarly, for n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1], the code gives 10, but the problem's output is 5.

So, the code is incorrect for these test cases.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect, but the problem's output is wrong.

But according to the problem's note, for n=5, a=[1,2,3,4,5], the signs should occur in years 1,2,3,4,5 respectively.

So, the fifth sign occurs in year 5, which matches the problem's output.

But according to the code, it's calculating the fifth sign to be in year 10, which is incorrect.

So, the code is wrong.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
