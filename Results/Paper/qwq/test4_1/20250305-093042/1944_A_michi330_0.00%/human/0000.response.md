Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, right? So, the number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2, which makes sense.

Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. My task is to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, given that Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand what it means for Dominater to act optimally. Dominater wants to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach, so they should destroy bridges in such a way that they cut off as many islands as possible from island 1.

In graph terms, I think this means Dominater wants to disconnect as many nodes as possible from node 1 by removing at most k edges. Since the graph is initially complete, every pair of nodes is connected directly.

I need to find, after removing at most k bridges, the size of the connected component containing node 1.

Let me think about this step by step.

Initially, all islands are connected, so Everule can reach all n islands.

If Dominater removes bridges, they are trying to split the graph into smaller components, and specifically, they want to isolate node 1 as much as possible.

But in a complete graph, there are multiple paths between any two nodes, so removing one bridge doesn't necessarily disconnect two islands.

Wait, in a complete graph, between any two nodes, there are multiple paths, especially if n is large.

But if Dominater removes bridges strategically, they can isolate node 1.

Let me consider a small example to get a better understanding.

Take n=2, k=0.

If k=0, no bridges are removed, so Everule can reach both islands: 1 and 2.

Output should be 2.

n=2, k=1.

There's only one bridge between 1 and 2. If Dominater removes it, Everule can only stay on island 1.

Output should be 1.

Okay, that makes sense.

Another example: n=4, k=1.

Total bridges: 6.

If Dominater removes one bridge, say between 1 and 2, then Everule can still reach island 2 via island 3 or 4.

So, Everule can still reach all 4 islands.

Hence, output is 4.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for n=4, k=1, output is 4.

Yes, that matches.

Another sample: n=5, k=10.

Wait, for n=5, total bridges are 10.

If k=10, Dominater can remove all bridges, so Everule can only stay on island 1.

Output is 1.

Another sample: n=5, k=3.

If Dominater removes 3 bridges, can they isolate Everule from some islands?

In a complete graph with 5 nodes, removing 3 bridges might not be enough to isolate any islands completely, especially since there are multiple paths.

Hence, Everule can still reach all 5 islands.

Output is 5.

Last sample: n=4, k=4.

Total bridges: 6.

If k=4, Dominater can remove 4 bridges.

Can they isolate Everule?

Probably yes, by removing all bridges connected to island 1, which is 3 bridges, but since k=4, they can remove one more.

Wait, in n=4, island 1 is connected to islands 2,3,4 with 3 bridges.

If Dominater removes those 3 bridges, Everule is isolated.

But k=4, which is more than enough.

Hence, output is 1.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, k=4, output is 1.

Yes.

So, from these examples, it seems that as long as k is at least n-1, Everule can be isolated to only island 1.

Because island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands directly.

So, if Dominater removes all n-1 bridges connected to island 1, Everule can't reach any other island.

If k < n-1, then Dominater can't isolate island 1 completely, because some bridges will remain, allowing Everule to reach those islands.

But in a complete graph, even if some bridges are removed, there might still be paths through other islands.

Wait, but in a complete graph, if Dominater removes fewer than n-1 bridges, there will still be at least one path from island 1 to every other island.

Because the graph remains connected unless k >= n-1.

Wait, no.

In a complete graph, it's highly connected.

To disconnect island 1 from the rest, Dominater needs to remove all bridges connected to island 1, which is n-1 bridges.

If Dominater removes fewer than n-1 bridges, there will still be at least one path from island 1 to each of the other islands.

Hence, Everule can reach all n islands.

Only when k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1.

Therefore, the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is:

- 1, if k >= n-1

- n, if k < n-1

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5, k=3, output is 5.

n-1=4, k=3 < 4, so Everule can reach all 5 islands.

For n=5, k=10, which is >=4, output is 1.

For n=4, k=1, which is <3, output is 4.

For n=4, k=4, which is >=3, output is 1.

For n=2, k=0, which is <1, output is 2.

For n=2, k=1, which is >=1, output is 1.

So, it matches this logic.

Hence, the program should check if k >= n-1, then print 1, else print n.

But in the sample input, for n=4, k=1, output is 4, which is n.

For n=5, k=3, output is 5.

Wait, but n-1 for n=4 is 3, and for n=5 is 4.

So, yes, k < n-1 implies Everule can reach all n islands.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, k=1, which is <3, output is 4.

For n=5, k=3, which is <4, output is 5.

Wait, n=5, k=3, n-1=4, k=3 <4, so output is 5.

Yes.

Hence, the logic seems correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n - 1)

Wait a second, in the else clause, it's printing n - 1, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should print n when k < n -1.

In the sample input, for n=4, k=1, it should print 4, but according to this code, it will print 4 -1 =3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=4, k=1, the output is 4.

But according to this code, it will print n -1 =3, which is wrong.

Wait, no, in the sample input, for n=4, k=1, output is 4.

But according to this code, it will print n -1 =3, which doesn't match the sample output.

Hmm, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Let me look again.

if k >= n - 1:

print(1)

else:

print(n - 1)

So, for n=4, k=1:

k=1 < n-1=3, so it prints n -1 =3, but sample output is 4.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

It should print n when k < n -1, not n -1.

Let me confirm with another sample input.

For n=5, k=3:

n-1=4, k=3 <4, so code will print n -1=4, but sample output is 5.

Again, incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=5, k=3, output is 5.

So, the code is indeed incorrect.

It should print n when k < n -1, not n -1.

Hence, the correction should be:

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

That would match the sample inputs.

For n=4, k=1: k=1 <3, print 4.

For n=5, k=3: k=3<4, print 5.

For n=2, k=0: k=0 <1, print 2.

For n=2, k=1: k=1 >=1, print 1.

For n=4, k=4: k=4 >=3, print 1.

For n=5, k=10: k=10 >=4, print 1.

Yes, that matches all sample inputs.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

It should be:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(0, t, 1):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k >= n -1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit, given that Dominater destroys up to \( k \) bridges optimally.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Graph Structure**: 
   - We have `n` islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge, forming a complete graph.
   - Everule starts from island 1 and can visit any island connected via bridges.

2. **Dominater's Objective**:
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.
   - To isolate Everule completely, Dominater needs to disconnect island 1 from all other islands.

3. **Critical Observation**:
   - Island 1 is connected to \( n-1 \) other islands.
   - To isolate island 1, Dominater must destroy all \( n-1 \) bridges connected to it.
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), Dominater can isolate island 1, and Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still reach all islands.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), print 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - Otherwise, print \( n \) (all islands are reachable).

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index+1])
        index += 2
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**: 
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases \( t \).
  - For each test case, read \( n \) and \( k \) from the input list.

- **Condition Check**:
  - If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n-1 \), print 1 because island 1 is isolated.
  - Otherwise, print \( n \) because all islands remain connected to island 1.

This approach ensures that we handle multiple test cases efficiently and determine the correct number of islands Everule can visit based on the given constraints.
