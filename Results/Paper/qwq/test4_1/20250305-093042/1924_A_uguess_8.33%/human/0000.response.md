Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. The task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I need to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Now, I need to generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase letters. Since there are k choices for each position in the string, and the string is of length n, the total number of possible strings is k^n. That can be a large number, especially since n can be up to 26 and k up to 26. But, considering that m can be up to 1000 and the sum of m over all test cases is up to 10^6, I need an efficient way to check if all these possible strings are subsequences of s.

Wait, but generating all k^n strings and checking each one if it's a subsequence of s is not feasible for large n and k because k^n can be up to 26^26, which is astronomically large. There must be a smarter way to approach this problem.

Let me think differently. Instead of trying to check all possible subsequences, maybe I can find a way to determine if s contains all possible subsequences of length n using the first k letters.

One way to approach this is to consider the number of times each of the first k letters appears in s. If for each letter, the number of times it appears is sufficient to cover all the possible positions it can appear in the subsequences, then maybe it's possible.

But that seems too vague. Let's consider smaller values of n and k to get an intuition.

Take the first sample input:

2 2 4

abba

Possible strings of length 2 using a and b: aa, ab, ba, bb.

Check if each is a subsequence of "abba":

- aa: positions 1 and 3 (a at index 1 and a at index 3)

- ab: positions 1 and 2 (a at index 1 and b at index 2)

- ba: positions 2 and 3 (b at index 2 and a at index 3)

- bb: positions 2 and 4 (b at index 2 and b at index 4)

All of them are present, so the answer is YES.

Second sample input:

2 2 3

abb

Possible strings: same as above.

Check:

- aa: positions 1 and 3 (a at index 1 and b at index 3, but b is not a, so no aa)

- ab: positions 1 and 2 (a at index 1 and b at index 2)

- ba: positions 2 and 3 (b at index 2 and b at index 3, not a)

- bb: positions 2 and 3 (b at index 2 and b at index 3)

So, aa and ba are not present. But according to the problem, if any one of them is missing, we should print NO and provide one such string that's missing. So, for this case, NO and then "aa" is provided.

Third sample input:

3 3 10

aabbccabab

Possible strings of length 3 using a, b, c: there are 27 of them.

Need to check if all 27 are subsequences of "aabbccabab".

From the sample output, it's NO and "ccc" is not present.

So, in this case, "ccc" is not a subsequence of "aabbccabab".

Looking at "aabbccabab", let's see if "ccc" is present:

- The string has 'c' at positions 5 and 6. So, "cc" is there, but not "ccc". So, "ccc" is indeed missing.

Now, I need a way to generalize this.

One approach is to model this as a graph where each node represents a state of the subsequence being built. This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where I keep track of how many times each letter has been used in the subsequence.

But that might be too slow for the constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each letter appears in s, and ensure that for any sequence of n letters, there are enough occurrences in s in the correct order.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the frequency of each letter in s. If any letter appears less than the required number in some sequences, then those sequences can't be formed.

But again, with k up to 26 and n up to 26, this seems tricky.

Another way is to think about the minimal number of times each letter needs to appear in s to cover all possible sequences.

But I think I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me look at the provided program and understand what it's doing.

The program reads t test cases. For each test case, it reads n, k, m, and the string s.

Then, it initializes cnt = 0 and cur = 0. It iterates through each character in s, converts it to its corresponding bit in cur by checking if that bit is set. If not set, it sets that bit and increments cur.

When cur becomes (1 << k) - 1, which means all k bits are set, it increments cnt and resets cur to 0.

After processing the entire string s, it checks if cnt >= n. If yes, prints "YES"; else, prints "NO" and constructs a string that's missing.

Wait, this seems fishy.

Let me understand this logic.

It seems like the program is trying to count how many times it can collect all k letters in order from s.

But subsequences don't have to be contiguous, and the order must be preserved.

I think this logic is flawed.

Let me see with the first sample input:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Processing s:

- s[0] = 'a': cur = 1 (binary 001)

- s[1] = 'b': cur = 3 (binary 011)

- s[2] = 'b': cur still 3

- s[3] = 'a': cur = 1 (binary 001)

cnt is incremented only when cur reaches 3 (which is (1<<2)-1 = 3), which happens once. Since n=2, cnt=1 < 2, so it should print NO, but the sample output is YES.

Wait, that's inconsistent.

So, the program's logic is incorrect for this sample.

Hence, the program is wrong.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
