Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer n, and I need to build a string of uppercase letters such that there are exactly n "special" characters in this string. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

First, I need to understand what makes a character special. Let's look at the example provided: in the string "AAABAACC", there are 6 special characters at positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Let's verify that:

- Position 1: 'A' - neighbors are 'A' (left) and 'A' (right). It's equal to both, so it shouldn't be special. Wait, but according to the example, it's considered special. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says "exactly one of its neighbors". So, for position 1, 'A' is equal to its right neighbor 'A', but it doesn't have a left neighbor (or we can consider it has no neighbor on the left). So, it's equal to one neighbor (the right one), making it special.

Ah, got it. For the first and last characters, they only have one neighbor each. So, for any character at the end, it's equal to its only neighbor, it's special. For characters in the middle, they need to be equal to exactly one of their two neighbors.

So, in "AAABAACC":

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (right), no left neighbor → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → not special (equal to both)

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → not special (equal to neither)

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' (left) and 'A' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 6: 'A' == 'A' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to both → not special

- Pos 7: 'A' == 'C' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 8: 'C' != 'A' (left), no right neighbor → special

Wait, but according to the example, positions 1,3,5,6,7,8 are special, but according to my analysis, positions 1,3,5,7,8 should be special, but position 6 should not be special because 'A' == 'A' on both sides. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect or I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let's assume the positions are 1-based indexing.

Let's try another approach. I need to find a string where exactly n characters are special as defined.

I need to find a pattern that allows me to control the number of special characters.

Let's think about the possible strings and count their special characters.

Start with small n.

For n=1:

Is there a string with exactly 1 special character?

Consider "A": 

- 'A' has no neighbors, so no special characters → not valid.

"A" has 1 character, which is special because it has only one neighbor (none on the left), so it's equal to zero neighbors, which is not "exactly one". Wait, the definition is unclear in this case.

Wait, the problem says "exactly one of its neighbors", but for the first and last characters, they only have one neighbor.

So, for the first character, if it's equal to its only neighbor, it's special.

For example, in "AA", the first 'A' is equal to its only neighbor 'A', so it's special. The second 'A' is equal to its only neighbor 'A', so it's also special. So, total special characters: 2.

But we need exactly n=1, so "AA" has 2 special characters, which is more than 1.

What about "AB"?

- 'A' != 'B' → not special

- 'B' != 'A' → not special

Total special characters: 0

Not enough.

What about "AAA"?

- 'A' == 'A' (right), no left neighbor → special

- 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → not special

- 'A' == 'A' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 2

Still not 1.

What about "AAB"?

- 'A' == 'A' (right), no left neighbor → special

- 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- 'B' != 'A' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 3

Too many.

What about "ABB"?

- 'A' == 'B' (right), no left neighbor → not special (doesn't equal its only neighbor)

- 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to one neighbor → special

- 'B' == 'B' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 2

Still not 1.

What about "ABC"?

- 'A' != 'B' → not special

- 'B' != 'A' and != 'C' → not special

- 'C' != 'B' → not special

Total special characters: 0

Nope.

Hmm, seems like it's hard to get exactly 1 special character. Maybe it's impossible.

Let me check n=2.

For n=2:

"AA": 2 special characters, as above.

"AB": 0 special characters.

"AAB": 3 special characters.

"ABB": 2 special characters.

"ABC": 0 special characters.

"AAAB": 3 special characters.

"ABBB": 3 special characters.

"HMM, seems like for n=2, "AA" has 2 special characters, which matches.

But for n=1, it seems impossible to have exactly 1 special character.

Let me check n=3.

For n=3:

"AAB": 3 special characters.

"ABB": 2 special characters.

"ABBC": 3 special characters.

"AABBB": 4 special characters.

Seems like for n=3, "AAB" has 3 special characters.

But I need to see if there's a pattern.

Wait, maybe for n even, it's possible, and for n odd, it's not.

Wait, in the example, for n=1, it's "NO", which aligns with my finding that it's impossible.

For n=2, "MM" is provided as a solution, which has 2 special characters.

So, perhaps the pattern is that for even n, it's possible, and for odd n, it's not.

Let me test this hypothesis.

Suppose n is even.

Can I construct a string where exactly n characters are special?

Looking at the program provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

if n % 2 == 1:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

pattern = []

for i in range(n // 2):

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])

print(''.join(pattern))



So, it checks if n is odd, prints 'NO', else prints 'YES' and constructs a pattern.

The pattern is built by appending 'A' and 'B' in an alternating fashion.

Wait, let's see:

for i in range(n // 2):

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])

pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])



So, for i from 0 to (n//2 - 1):

- append 'A' if i % 2 == 0, else 'B'

- append 'B' if i % 2 == 0, else 'A'

Because 'AB'[0] = 'A', 'AB'[1] = 'B', and i % 2 ^ 1 is equivalent to (i % 2) XOR 1, which flips 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.

So, for i % 2 == 0:

append 'A' and 'B'

for i % 2 == 1:

append 'B' and 'A'

So, the pattern is 'AB' repeated.

Wait, but in the code, it's 'AB' for even i and 'BA' for odd i, but since i starts from 0, it's 'AB' and 'BA' alternating.

Wait, no, for i in range(n//2):

pattern.append('AB'[i%2])

pattern.append('AB'[i%2 ^ 1])



So, for i = 0:

append 'A' and 'B'

for i =1:

append 'B' and 'A'

for i=2:

append 'A' and 'B'

and so on.

So, the pattern is "ABBAABBA..." up to n//2 pairs.

Wait, let's take n=4:

pattern:

- i=0: 'A' and 'B'

- i=1: 'B' and 'A'

So, "ABBA"

Now, let's count special characters in "ABBA":

- Pos 1: 'A' != 'B' → not special

- Pos 2: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'B' (left), 'A' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 4: 'A' != 'B' → not special

Total special characters: 2, which matches n=4.

Wait, but n=4 is even, and the program says it's possible.

Similarly, for n=6:

pattern: "ABBAAB"

- Pos 1: 'A' != 'B' → not special

- Pos 2: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'B' (left), 'A' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 4: 'A' != 'A' → not special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' → not special

- Pos 6: 'B' != 'A' → not special

Wait, that's only 2 special characters, but n=6 requires 6 special characters. That doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in "ABBAAB":

- Pos 1: 'A' != 'B' → not special

- Pos 2: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'B' (left), 'A' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 4: 'A' != 'A' (right), 'B' (left) → equal to neither → not special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to neither → not special

- Pos 6: 'B' != 'A' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 3

Still not 6.

Wait, perhaps the program does something else.

Wait, the program appends 'AB'[i%2] and 'AB'[i%2^1]

Wait, for i in range(n//2):

- i%2: 0 for even i, 1 for odd i

- i%2^1: bitwise XOR, so 0^1=1, 1^1=0

So, for i=0:

append 'A' and 'B'

i=1:

append 'B' and 'A'

i=2:

append 'A' and 'B'

So, for n=6, pattern is "ABBAAB"

But as per above, it has 3 special characters, not 6.

But n=6 requires 6 special characters.

So, perhaps this program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=6, "AAABAACC" has 6 special characters.

But according to the program, for n=6, it outputs "ABBAAB" which has only 3 special characters.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a better pattern to achieve n special characters.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I create a string where every character is equal to exactly one neighbor.

Wait, but in the middle of the string, for a character to be equal to exactly one neighbor, one neighbor should be equal to it, and the other should be different.

So, for example, in "ABABAB", let's see:

- Pos 1: 'A' != 'B' → special

- Pos 2: 'B' != 'A' and 'A' → special

- Pos 3: 'A' != 'B' and 'B' → special

- Pos 4: 'B' != 'A' and 'A' → special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' and 'B' → special

- Pos 6: 'B' != 'A' → special

So, all 6 positions are special.

Wait, that's n=6.

So, "ABABAB" has 6 special characters.

Similarly, "ABAB" has 4 special characters.

So, perhaps for n even, using "ABABAB..." gives n special characters.

Wait, but in the program, it's using "ABBAAB", which has only 3 special characters.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the pattern.

So, if I use alternating 'A' and 'B', like "ABABAB...", then every character is equal to exactly one neighbor, making all characters special.

Thus, for n even, "ABABAB... " with n characters has n special characters.

For n odd, it's "ABABAB... A" with n characters.

Let's check for n=3: "ABA"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'B' → not special

- Pos 2: 'B' == 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → equal to none → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'B' → not special

Wait, no special characters.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps using all 'A's.

For n=2: "AA" has 2 special characters.

For n=4: "AAAA" has 4 special characters.

Wait, in "AAAA":

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'A' and 'A' → not special

- Pos 4: 'A' == 'A' → special

So, only positions 1 and 4 are special, total 2.

Not enough for n=4.

Wait, perhaps combining segments.

Wait, maybe using blocks of 'A's and 'B's.

Wait, perhaps the program should output "A" repeated n times, but that doesn't work as per above.

Wait, for n=4, "AAAA" has 2 special characters, but we need 4.

Similarly, "AA" has 2, "AAAA" has 2, "AAAAA" has 2.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps using a pattern like "ABA" for n=3.

Wait, in "ABA":

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'B' → not special

- Pos 2: 'B' != 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → equal to none → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'B' → not special

Total special characters: 0

Not matching n=3.

What about "AAB":

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 3: 'B' != 'A' → special

Total special characters: 3, which matches n=3.

So, "AAB" has 3 special characters.

But according to the program, for n=3, it's impossible, as n is odd.

But in this case, n=3 is possible with "AAB".

Wait, but in the example, for n=1, it's "NO", which aligns with my earlier thought that it's impossible.

But for n=3, it seems possible with "AAB".

Wait, perhaps my initial hypothesis is wrong.

Wait, in "AAB":

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' (right), no left neighbor → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → equal to one neighbor → special

- Pos 3: 'B' != 'A' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 3

So, for n=3, it's possible.

But according to the program, for n odd, it's 'NO'.

But in this case, n=3 is possible.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a different pattern for odd n.

Wait, perhaps for n odd, it's possible, and for n even, it's possible as well, but the program incorrectly assumes only even n are possible.

But in the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps n=1 is impossible.

Let's check n=1 with a string like "A":

- 'A' has no neighbors, so no special characters → not valid.

Or "AB":

- 'A' != 'B' → not special

- 'B' != 'A' → not special

Still no special characters.

Or "ABB":

- 'A' != 'B' → not special

- 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → equal to one neighbor → special

- 'B' == 'B' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 2, which is more than n=1.

So, it's impossible to have exactly one special character.

Hence, for n=1, it's 'NO'.

But for n=3, "AAB" has 3 special characters.

Wait, that seems contradictory to my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps for n odd greater than 1, it's possible, and for n=1, it's impossible.

So, perhaps the program should be adjusted to handle n=1 as 'NO', and for n even and n odd greater than 1, it's 'YES'.

But in the program, it's checking if n is even, then 'YES', else 'NO'.

But according to this, for n=3, it's 'NO', but actually, it's possible with "AAB".

So, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a different pattern.

Let me think about how to construct a string with exactly n special characters.

I need to control the number of special characters.

Let's think about the properties:

- For a character in the middle, to be special, it must be equal to exactly one neighbor.

- For the first and last characters, they are special if they are equal to their only neighbor.

So, perhaps I can construct the string by placing 'A's and 'B's in a specific pattern to control the number of special characters.

One way is to create a string where the first m characters are 'A', followed by 'B's.

Wait, let's try.

For n=3:

"AAB"

As above, has 3 special characters.

For n=4:

"AABB"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → special

- Pos 4: 'B' == 'B' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 4, which matches n=4.

For n=5:

"A AABB"

Wait, but the maximum length is 200, so that's fine.

But let's see:

"AABB B"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → not special

- Pos 4: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → special

- Pos 5: 'B' == 'B' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 4, which is less than n=5.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps "AAABB"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → not special

- Pos 3: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'A' (right) → not special

- Pos 4: 'A' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → not special

- Pos 5: 'B' != 'A' → not special

Total special characters: 1, which is less than n=5.

Not matching.

What about "AABBA"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → special

- Pos 4: 'B' == 'A' (right), 'B' (left) → not special

- Pos 5: 'A' != 'B' → not special

Total special characters: 3, which is less than n=5.

Still not matching.

What about "AABBB"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'B' (right), 'A' (left) → special

- Pos 4: 'B' == 'B' (left) and 'B' (right) → not special

- Pos 5: 'B' == 'B' (left), no right neighbor → special

Total special characters: 4, which is less than n=5.

Still not matching.

What about "AABAB"

- Pos 1: 'A' == 'A' → special

- Pos 2: 'A' == 'A' (left) and 'B' (right) → special

- Pos 3: 'B' == 'A' (right), 'A' (left) → not special

- Pos 4: 'A' == 'B' (right), 'B' (left) → not special

- Pos 5: 'B' != 'A' → not special

Total special characters: 2, which is less than n=5.

Not matching.

Hmm, seems challenging to get exactly n=5 special characters.

Wait, maybe it's impossible for some n.

But earlier, for n=3, "AAB" works.

For n=4, "AABB" works.

For n=5, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps only certain n are achievable.

Looking back at the program, it assumes that only even n are possible.

But in reality, for n=3 (odd), "AAB" works.

For n=5, I can't find a string that works.

So, perhaps only n even and n=3 are possible.

But for n=3, "AAB" works.

For n=5, no string seems to work.

Wait, maybe only n even and n=3 are possible.

But for n=3, it's possible, for n=5, not possible.

So, perhaps for n >=2 and n !=1, it's possible.

But in the example, for n=1, it's 'NO', and for n=2, "MM" is acceptable.

Wait, but "MM" has 2 special characters, which matches n=2.

So, perhaps for n even and n=3, it's possible, and for n=1, it's impossible.

But in the program, it's checking for n even only.

So, the program is incorrect because it doesn't handle n=3 as possible.

Wait, perhaps the pattern is that n must be even or n=3.

But in that case, the program is incomplete.

Alternatively, perhaps n must be even or n=3.

But in that case, the program is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps n must be even or n >=3 and n is a multiple of 3.

But "AAB" has 3 special characters.

"AABB" has 4.

"AABBA" has 4.

"AABBB" has 4.

So, perhaps only n even and n=3 are possible.

But for n=3, it's possible, for n=5, not possible.

So, perhaps only n even and n=3 are possible.

Hence, the program is incorrect because it doesn't account for n=3.

So, the program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
