Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, Anton has a permutation of size n, and he wants to find a number x using binary search. But here's the twist: binary search requires the array to be sorted, but the permutation might not be sorted. So, I need to perform at most two swap operations on the permutation to make sure that after running the binary search, I end up with p_l equal to x.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of size n is just an array that contains each number from 1 to n exactly once, but in any order. So, for example, [2, 3, 1] is a permutation of size 3.

Now, binary search is a method to find a target value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In each step, it compares the middle element of the current interval to the target value and decides to continue searching in the left or right half accordingly.

But in this problem, the array might not be sorted, and I can perform at most two swaps to make sure that the binary search will find the correct value. The goal is to rearrange the array in such a way that after performing the binary search, p_l equals x.

The problem also mentions that it can be shown two operations are always sufficient. So, I don't need to worry about cases where I need more than two swaps; two will always be enough.

Let's look at the example provided to understand better.

Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

In the first test case, the array is already sorted, so no swaps are needed, and the binary search will directly find x=3 at position 3.

In the second test case, the array is [3,1,6,5,2,4], and x=5 is at position 4. After swapping positions 3 and 4 (elements 6 and 5), the array becomes [3,1,5,6,2,4]. Now, the binary search will find x=5 at position 3.

Wait, but according to the output, only one swap is needed: 3 4.

Let me see what the binary search does in this case.

Initialize l=1, r=7.

First iteration:

m = floor((1+7)/2) = 4

p[4] = 5, which is equal to x=5, so l=4.

But according to the loop condition, if r - l ==1, end the loop.

Wait, r is n+1=7, l is 4, so r - l = 3, which is greater than 1, so continue.

Second iteration:

m = floor((4+7)/2) = 5

p[5] = 2, which is less than x=5, so l=5.

Now, l=5, r=7, r - l = 2, greater than 1, continue.

Third iteration:

m = floor((5+7)/2) = 6

p[6] = 4, which is less than x=5, so l=6.

Now, l=6, r=7, r - l =1, end the loop.

So, p_l = p[6] =4, which is not equal to x=5.

Wait, but according to the output, after swapping 3 and 4, p becomes [3,1,5,6,2,4], and the binary search should find x=5 at position 3.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the binary search implementation.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm, two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is executed:

1. If r - l =1 , end the loop

2. m = floor((r + l)/2)

3. If p_m <= x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m .

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm is executed, so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x ."

So, the loop continues until r - l =1.

In the example, after swapping, p=[3,1,5,6,2,4]

Initialize l=1, r=7

First iteration:

m = floor((1+7)/2)=4

p[4]=6, which is greater than x=5, so r=4

Now, l=1, r=4, r - l =3 >1, continue.

Second iteration:

m = floor((1+4)/2)=2

p[2]=1, which is less than or equal to x=5, so l=2

Now, l=2, r=4, r - l=2 >1, continue.

Third iteration:

m = floor((2+4)/2)=3

p[3]=5, which is equal to x=5, so l=3

Now, l=3, r=4, r - l=1, end the loop.

So, p_l = p[3] =5, which equals x=5.

Thus, one swap was sufficient.

Similarly, in other test cases, either zero, one, or two swaps are needed.

Now, I need to implement this in code.

Looking at the provided program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_3()

def func_1():

return map(int, input().split())

def func_2():

return list(func_1())

def func_3():

(n, k) = func_1()

arr = func_2()

pos = -1

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] == k:

pos = i

(low, high) = (0, n - 1)

st = set()

while low +1 < high:

mid = (low + high) //2

st.add(mid)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

if arr[low] == k:

print(0)

else:

print(1)

print(low +1, pos +1)

So, the code reads t test cases, and for each test case, it calls func_3().

func_1() reads integers from input.

func_2() converts the input to a list.

func_3() gets n and k, reads the array, finds the position of k in the array, initializes low and high for binary search, and then performs a binary search-like loop.

It seems like it's trying to simulate the binary search and see if it finds k at p_l.

If it does, it prints 0, meaning no swaps are needed.

If not, it prints 1 and swaps the element at position low with the element at position pos.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, the binary search loop is implemented as:

while low +1 < high:

mid = (low + high) //2

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

This seems similar to binary search, but with some differences.

In standard binary search, we have low and high pointers, and we calculate mid as floor((low + high)/2), and depending on whether arr[mid] is less than or greater than x, we adjust low or high.

Here, low and high are initialized to 0 and n-1, and the loop continues while low +1 < high.

Inside the loop:

mid = floor((low + high)/2)

if arr[mid] > k:

high = mid

else:

low = mid

This seems like a standard binary search adjustment.

After the loop, it checks if arr[low] == k, and if so, prints 0, meaning no swaps are needed.

If not, it prints 1 and swaps the element at position low with the element at position pos.

Wait, but in the problem, we can perform up to two swaps, not just one.

In the code, it only performs one swap if necessary.

Looking back at the example, in some cases, two swaps are performed.

But in this code, it only performs one swap.

So, perhaps this code is incomplete or incorrect.

Wait, let's check the output for the sample input.

Sample Input:

5

6 3

1 2 3 4 5 6

6 5

3 1 6 5 2 4

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

6 3

4 3 1 5 2 6

3 2

3 2 1

Sample Output:

0

1

3 4

2

2 4

1 5

2

4 5

2 4

1

1 3

But in the code, it only performs at most one swap.

Yet, in the sample output, there are cases where two swaps are performed.

For example, the third test case:

5 1

3 5 4 2 1

Output:

2

2 4

1 5

So, the code only performs one swap, but the sample output shows two swaps.

Therefore, this code cannot be correct because it doesn't handle cases where two swaps are needed.

Wait, but in the code, it prints 1 and performs one swap, but in the sample output, it shows 2 swaps for that case.

So, this discrepancy suggests that the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
