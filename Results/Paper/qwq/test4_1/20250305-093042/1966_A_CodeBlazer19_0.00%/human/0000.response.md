Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have a hand of n cards, each with a number on it, and a fixed integer k. The operation I can perform is to choose any k cards that all have the same number and exchange them for k-1 cards, each with any number I choose. The goal is to find the minimum number of cards I can have in the end after performing this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. If I have k cards with the same number, I can replace them with k-1 cards of any numbers I choose. So, essentially, I'm reducing the number of cards by 1 each time I perform this operation, since I'm replacing k cards with k-1 cards.

But it's not that simple because I can choose the numbers on the new cards, and they can be anything. So, maybe I can strategically choose numbers that allow me to perform more operations in the future.

Let me look at the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first example:

Input:

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

So, n=5, k=3, and the cards are [4,1,1,4,4].

From the description, one possible sequence is shown, ending with 2 cards.

In the second example:

1 10

7

Here, n=1, k=10, and cards=[7]. Since n < k, no operation can be performed, so the answer is 1.

In the fourth example:

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

So, n=10, k=4, and all cards are 1. I can perform the operation by selecting 4 cards with 1 and replacing them with 3 cards of any number. I can repeat this process until I can't perform the operation anymore.

Let's see:

Start with 10 cards all being 1.

Perform operation: select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards (say, all 1 again). Now, total cards are 10 - 4 + 3 = 9.

Repeat: select 4 cards with 1, replace with 3 cards. Now, 9 - 4 + 3 = 8.

Repeat: 8 - 4 + 3 = 7

Repeat: 7 - 4 + 3 = 6

Repeat: 6 - 4 + 3 = 5

Now, I have 5 cards, all 1. Since I can't select 4 cards to perform the operation (as k=4 and n=5 < k), I stop here. But according to the example, the answer is 3, which is different from my calculation. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I can choose different numbers for the new cards to enable more operations.

Wait, in this case, since all cards are 1, if I replace 4 cards with 1 with 3 new cards of any number, say, 2, then I have 3 cards of 2 and potentially some 1's left.

Wait, in the fourth example, the answer is 3, but according to my previous approach, I ended up with 5 cards.

Let me think differently. Maybe there's a mathematical way to compute the minimum number of cards.

Let's consider that each operation reduces the total number of cards by 1 (since k cards are replaced by k-1 cards, the net reduction is 1 card per operation).

So, theoretically, the maximum number of operations I can perform is n - m, where m is the minimum number of cards left.

But I need to consider that each operation requires k cards with the same number.

So, I need to find the maximum number of operations I can perform, given that each operation needs k cards with the same number.

This seems similar to finding how many groups of k cards with the same number I can form, and then reduce the total number of cards accordingly.

Wait, but I can perform operations repeatedly, and after each operation, the pool of cards changes.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in the hand.

Let's say I have frequencies f1, f2, ..., fm for each unique number in the hand.

For each frequency fi, I can perform fi // k operations, each reducing the total number of cards by 1.

But wait, after each operation, I replace k cards with k-1 cards, so the total reduction is 1 card per operation.

But it's not that straightforward because the new cards introduced could have frequencies that allow for more operations.

However, since I can choose the numbers on the new cards, I can strategically choose numbers that are already present in large quantities to potentially enable more operations.

But this seems complicated.

Let me think of it differently.

Suppose I have a frequency fi for a certain number.

Each time I perform an operation on this number, I reduce fi by k and add k-1 new cards.

Wait, but the new cards can be of any number, so maybe I can choose to add them in a way that allows further operations.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I should look for an invariant or some property that remains the same or changes predictably with each operation.

Let me consider the total number of cards modulo (k - 1).

Wait, in the program provided, it simply prints k - 1 for every test case.

That seems suspicious.

Let me check the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

7

5 3

4 1 1 4 4

1 10

7

7 2

4 2 1 100 5 2 3

10 4

1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

5 2

3 8 1 48 7

6 2

10 20 30 10 20 40

6 3

10 20 30 10 20 40

Sample Output:

2

1

1

3

5

1

6

If the program always prints k - 1, then for the first test case, k=3, so it would print 2, which matches the sample output.

For the second test case, k=10, prints 9, but the sample output is 1. So, it's incorrect for this test case.

Wait, but in the sample input, the output is 2,1,1,3,5,1,6, and for k=10, it's printing 9, which doesn't match the sample output of 1.

Wait, no, the program prints k-1 for each test case, regardless of n and the list of cards.

So, for the first test case, k=3, prints 2.

Second test case, k=10, prints 9, but sample output is 1.

So, already, this is incorrect.

So, Correctness: False.

But perhaps there's a pattern where for certain conditions, it's k-1, but clearly not always.

So, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
