Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a permutation of length n, and I have the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums. I need to find out how many different permutations could have these specific prefix and suffix maximum indices. And finally, I have to output this number modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand what prefix and suffix maximums are. A prefix maximum at position i is an element that is greater than all elements before it in the permutation. Similarly, a suffix maximum at position i is greater than all elements after it.

So, for a permutation of length n, the prefix maximums are elements that are larger than all elements to their left, and suffix maximums are larger than all elements to their right.

Given that, I have the indices of these prefix and suffix maximums, and I need to find out how many permutations satisfy these conditions.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I know that in a permutation, each number from 1 to n appears exactly once. So, the positions of the largest elements are crucial for determining prefix and suffix maximums.

For example, if n=4, and the prefix maximum indices are 1 and 2, and suffix maximum indices are 2,3,4, then possible permutations are [1,4,3,2], [2,4,3,1], and [3,4,2,1]. So, there are 3 possible permutations.

Looking at this example, I can see that the largest element must be at the intersection of the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum. In this case, position 2 is both a prefix and suffix maximum, so the largest element is there.

Wait, in the second test case of the example, n=4, m1=2, m2=3, prefix max at 1 and 2, suffix max at 2,3,4. So, position 2 is both a prefix and suffix maximum, which makes sense for the maximum element.

Similarly, in the third test case, n=3, m1=3, m2=1, prefix max at 1,2,3 and suffix max at 3. So, the maximum must be at position 3.

I need to generalize this.

First, the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum should coincide, and that should be the position of the maximum element, which is n.

If they don't coincide, then there are no valid permutations, so the answer is 0.

In the second test case, L = [1,2], R = [2,3,4], so L[-1] = 2 and R[0] = 2, they coincide.

In the fourth test case, L = [1,2,3], R = [2,3,4,5], L[-1] = 3 and R[0] = 2, which don't coincide, so answer is 0.

Indeed, in the output, the fourth case has 0.

So, one condition is that L[-1] == R[0].

But in the sixth test case, L = [1,3], R = [3,4,6], L[-1] = 3 and R[0] = 3, they coincide, and the answer is 10.

Okay, so that's a necessary condition.

But is it sufficient?

Wait, in the fifth test case, L = [1,2,3,4,12], R = [12,13,18,20], L[-1] = 12 and R[0] = 12, they coincide, and the answer is 317580808, which is non-zero.

So, coinciding is necessary, but not sufficient on its own. There might be other conditions to check.

Looking at the code provided, it seems to check for this condition:

if L[-1] != R[0]:

return 0

if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:

return 0

if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:

return 0

ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)

Then, it does some calculations involving combinatorics.

So, it checks that the first prefix maximum is at position 1, and the first suffix maximum is at position N.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "the first suffix maximums", but in the code, it's checking R[0] == N.

Wait, in the input, suffix maximum indices are given in increasing order, so R[0] is the smallest index among suffix maximums.

Wait, no, in the example, for n=4, m2=3, suffix maximum indices are 2,3,4, which are in increasing order.

Wait, but 2 is less than 4, so R[0] = 2, which is not N.

Wait, in that case, R[0] is not N.

Wait, in the second test case, n=4, m2=3, R = [2,3,4], so R[0] = 2, which is not equal to N=4.

But according to the code, it checks if R[0] != N, which in this case would be 4 != 2, which is true, so it would return 0, but in the example, the answer is 3.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking back, the code has:

if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:

return 0

Wait, in the second test case, L[0] = 1, R[0] = 2, and N=4, so R[0] != N, so it should return 0, but in the example, the answer is 3.

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the indexings.

In the problem, it says "the first suffix maximums", and in the example, for n=4, m2=3, suffix maximum indices are 2,3,4.

Wait, but in the code, R is expected to be in increasing order, which it is.

So, R[0] = 2, which is not equal to N=4, so according to the code, it should return 0, but the example shows 3.

This indicates that the code is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the conditions.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the first prefix maximum should be at position 1, and the last suffix maximum should be at position N.

Wait, in the second test case, prefix maximums are at 1 and 2, and suffix maximums are at 2,3,4.

So, the last suffix maximum is at 4, which should be position N.

Wait, but in the code, it's checking R[0] == N, which is R[0] = 2 != 4.

Wait, perhaps R is expected to be in decreasing order, but in the problem, it's stated that suffix maximums are given in increasing order.

Wait, no, in the problem, it says:

"The third line of each test case contains m2 integers s1 < s2 < … < s_{m2} (1 ≤ si ≤ n) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing order."

So, R is in increasing order.

In the second test case, R = [2,3,4], which is increasing.

So, R[0] = 2, which is not equal to N=4.

But according to the code, if R[0] != N, it returns 0, but in the example, the answer is 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the conditions.

Let me try to understand the properties of prefix and suffix maximums.

First, the prefix maximums are positions where the element is larger than all previous elements.

Similarly, suffix maximums are positions where the element is larger than all following elements.

In particular, the last prefix maximum should be the position of the maximum element in the permutation, and the first suffix maximum should also be the position of the maximum element.

Wait, no, the first suffix maximum is the leftmost position that is a suffix maximum.

But in the second test case, with n=4, m1=2, m2=3, L=[1,2], R=[2,3,4], the maximum element is at position 2, which is L[-1] and R[0].

Wait, but in this case, R[0] = 2, which is not N=4.

So, perhaps R[0] should be the position of the maximum element, and L[-1] should also be the position of the maximum element.

Hence, L[-1] should equal R[0].

But in the code, it's checking if R[0] == N, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Looking back at the code:

if L[0] != 1 or R[0] != N:

return 0

But in the second test case, R[0] = 2 != N=4, so it would return 0, but the correct answer is 3.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to rethink this.

Perhaps the first suffix maximum should be the position of the maximum element.

Wait, but in the second test case, the maximum element is at position 2, which is R[0]=2.

But in the third test case, n=3, m1=3, m2=1, L=[1,2,3], R=[3], and N=3, so R[0]=3==N=3, which is correct.

In the fourth test case, L=[1,2,3], R=[2,3,4,5], L[-1]=3 != R[0]=2, so correctly, the answer is 0.

In the fifth test case, L=[1,2,3,4,12], R=[12,13,18,20], L[-1]=12 == R[0]=12, which is correct.

In the sixth test case, L=[1,3], R=[3,4,6], L[-1]=3 == R[0]=3, which is correct.

So, it seems that L[-1] should equal R[0], and moreover, R[0] should be the position of the maximum element, which should be N.

Wait, but in the second test case, R[0]=2 != N=4.

So, perhaps R[0] should be N.

Wait, but in that case, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand that the first suffix maximum is the position of the maximum element in the suffix starting from that position.

Wait, no, suffix maximums are positions where the element is larger than all elements to the right.

So, the first suffix maximum is the leftmost position where the element is larger than all elements to its right.

In the second test case, with n=4, R=[2,3,4], meaning positions 2,3,4 are suffix maximums.

So, position 2 is larger than positions 3 and 4, position 3 is larger than position 4, and position 4 is the last element.

Hence, the maximum element is at position 2, which is R[0]=2.

But in this permutation, the maximum element should be at position 2, not at position 4.

Wait, but in a permutation of length 4, the maximum element is 4.

If position 2 has 4, then position 4 must have a element less than 4.

So, in this case, position 4 can have 1,2, or 3.

Hence, R[0] is the position of the maximum element, which is 2, not N=4.

So, the code's condition if L[0] !=1 or R[0] !=N: return 0 is incorrect because R[0] should be the position of the maximum element, which may not be N.

Hence, the code is wrong.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
