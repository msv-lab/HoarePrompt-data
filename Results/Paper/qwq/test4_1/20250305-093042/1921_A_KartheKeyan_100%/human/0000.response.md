Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given the coordinates of the four corners of a square, but they're provided in a random order. My task is to calculate the area of this square. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, and it's guaranteed to have a positive area.

First, I need to understand the input and output format. The input consists of multiple test cases, starting with an integer t indicating the number of test cases. Each test case has four lines, each containing two integers: the x and y coordinates of a corner of the square.

For each test case, I need to output a single integer, which is the area of the square.

Looking at the example provided:

Input:

3

1 2

4 5

1 5

4 2

-1 1

1 -1

1 1

-1 -1

45 11

45 39

17 11

17 39

Output:

9

4

784

So, for the first test case, the coordinates are (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), and (4,2), and the area is 9. Similarly for the other test cases.

Now, I need to figure out how to compute the area of the square given these coordinates.

Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, that means the sides are either horizontal or vertical, aligned with the x-axis and y-axis.

Given that, the coordinates should consist of points where the x-coordinates and y-coordinates have only two distinct values each. For example, in the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

The x-coordinates are 1 and 4, and y-coordinates are 2 and 5.

So, the side length of the square should be the difference between these distinct x-values or y-values.

In this case, the side length is |4 - 1| = 3, and the area is 3*3 = 9, which matches the first output.

Similarly, for the second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

The x-coordinates are -1 and 1, y-coordinates are -1 and 1.

Side length is |1 - (-1)| = 2, area is 4.

Again, matches the second output.

Third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

x-coordinates: 45 and 17, y-coordinates: 11 and 39.

Side length is |45 - 17| = 28, area is 784.

Perfect.

So, the general approach should be:

1. Collect the four coordinates.

2. Extract the unique x-coordinates and unique y-coordinates.

3. Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, there should be exactly two unique x-values and two unique y-values.

4. Compute the side length as the difference between the two unique x-values (or y-values).

5. Compute the area by squaring the side length.

Now, looking at the provided program:

import math

def func():

n = int(input())

while n:

coord = []

res = 0

for i in range(4):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

coord.append((x, y))

coord = sorted(coord)

p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2

p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2

res = math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2)

print(round(res))

n -= 1

Let's analyze this.

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

For each test case, it reads four coordinates and stores them in a list called coord.

Then, it sorts the coordinates. Since coordinates are tuples of (x, y), sorting them will arrange them in increasing order of x, and if x is same, then by y.

After sorting, it calculates p1 as the squared distance between the first two points (coord[0] and coord[1]), and p2 as the squared distance between the last two points (coord[2] and coord[3]).

Then, it computes the area as the product of the square roots of p1 and p2, and prints the rounded result.

Wait a minute, this seems unnecessarily complicated.

Given that the square has sides parallel to the axes, the area can be simply calculated as the square of the difference between the two unique x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).

In the provided program, it's calculating the Euclidean distances between certain points and then multiplying their magnitudes, which seems like an overkill and not directly leveraging the property that the square sides are parallel to the axes.

Let me consider a simple test case to see if this program works correctly.

Take the first test case:

Points: (1,2), (4,5), (1,5), (4,2)

Sorted coordinates: (1,2), (1,5), (4,2), (4,5)

p1 = ((1-1)^2 + (5-2)^2) = (0 + 9) = 9

p2 = ((4-4)^2 + (5-2)^2) = (0 + 9) = 9

res = sqrt(9) * sqrt(9) = 3 * 3 = 9

Which is correct.

Second test case:

Points: (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1), (-1,-1)

Sorted coordinates: (-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1), (1,1)

p1 = ((-1 - (-1))^2 + (1 - (-1))^2) = (0 + 4) = 4

p2 = ((1 - 1)^2 + (1 - (-1))^2) = (0 + 4) = 4

res = sqrt(4) * sqrt(4) = 2 * 2 = 4

Correct again.

Third test case:

Points: (45,11), (45,39), (17,11), (17,39)

Sorted coordinates: (17,11), (17,39), (45,11), (45,39)

p1 = ((17-17)^2 + (39-11)^2) = (0 + 784) = 784

p2 = ((45-45)^2 + (39-11)^2) = (0 + 784) = 784

res = sqrt(784) * sqrt(784) = 28 * 28 = 784

Correct.

So, even though the approach seems unnecessarily complex, it's producing the correct results for the given test cases.

But let's think about a better way to compute the area.

Since the square has sides parallel to the axes, the side length is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates).

So, for any square, once we have the four coordinates, we can extract the unique x-values and unique y-values.

For example, in the first test case:

x-values: 1, 4

y-values: 2, 5

Side length = 4 - 1 = 3

Area = 3 * 3 = 9

Similarly for others.

So, a more straightforward approach would be:

- Collect all x-coordinates and y-coordinates.

- Find the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinate.

- Find the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinate.

- Since it's a square, both differences should be equal (as all sides are equal).

- Compute the area by squaring this difference.

But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the given points form a valid square with positive area, so we don't need to handle cases where this isn't true.

Therefore, in the program, instead of calculating squared distances and multiplying their square roots, we could simply find the difference between max and min x and y, and square that difference to get the area.

That would be more efficient and straightforward.

However, the provided program, despite being more complicated, is still correct for the given test cases.

But let's think if there could be any edge cases where this program might fail.

Consider a square with coordinates (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1).

Sorted coordinates: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)

p1 = (0-0)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1

p2 = (1-1)^2 + (1-0)^2 = 0 + 1 = 1

res = sqrt(1) * sqrt(1) = 1 * 1 = 1

Which is correct, area is 1.

Another case: (2,3), (2,6), (5,3), (5,6)

Sorted coordinates: (2,3), (2,6), (5,3), (5,6)

p1 = (2-2)^2 + (6-3)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

p2 = (5-5)^2 + (6-3)^2 = 0 + 9 = 9

res = 3 * 3 = 9

Side length is 3, area 9.

Seems correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, a better way is to find the difference between max and min x and y.

In this case, x: 2 and 5, y: 3 and 6.

Difference is 3, area 9.

Same as above.

So, the provided program is correct, even though it's not the most efficient or straightforward way.

Therefore, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
