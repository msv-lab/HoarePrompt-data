Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim needs to spend to buy exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and what they represent. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which tells us how many scenarios we need to evaluate. For each test case, there are three integers: n, a, and b. n is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, a is the regular price per yogurt, and b is the promotional price for two yogurts.

I need to consider how to minimize the cost. To do that, I should compare the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs using the promotion.

Let me think about the example provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

2 5 9

Here, n=2, a=5, b=9.

If Maxim buys two yogurts individually, it would cost 5 * 2 = 10 burles.

But there's a promotion where he can buy two yogurts for 9 burles, which is cheaper than the individual price. So, the minimum cost is 9 burles.

In the second test case:

3 5 9

n=3, a=5, b=9.

Option 1: Buy one pair with the promotion and one individually.

Cost = b + a = 9 + 5 = 14 burles.

Option 2: Buy all three individually.

Cost = a * 3 = 15 burles.

So, the minimum cost is 14 burles.

Third test case:

3 5 11

n=3, a=5, b=11.

Option 1: Buy one pair with the promotion and one individually.

Cost = b + a = 11 + 5 = 16 burles.

Option 2: Buy all three individually.

Cost = a * 3 = 15 burles.

In this case, buying all three individually is cheaper than using the promotion for two and buying one separately. So, the minimum cost is 15 burles.

Wait, but in the note, it says it's more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5. But according to my calculation, buying two for 11 and one for 5 would be 16, which is more than buying three individually for 15. So, the minimum is indeed 15.

Fourth test case:

4 5 11

n=4, a=5, b=11.

Option 1: Buy two pairs with the promotion.

Cost = b * 2 = 11 * 2 = 22 burles.

Option 2: Buy all four individually.

Cost = a * 4 = 5 * 4 = 20 burles.

So, buying individually is cheaper at 20 burles.

Wait, but according to the example output, it's 20 burles, which matches option 2.

But in the note, it says to buy four yogurts, each for 5 burles, totaling 20 burles.

Okay, so in this case, not using the promotion at all is better.

From these examples, it seems that I need to compare the cost of buying as many pairs as possible with the promotion and buying the remaining yogurts individually, against buying all yogurts individually.

I should also consider if buying pairs with the promotion is cheaper than buying two individually.

In the first test case, buying two with promotion is cheaper than buying individually.

In the third test case, buying two with promotion is more expensive than buying individually.

So, I need to decide for each pair whether it's better to buy them with the promotion or individually.

But if n is odd, there will be one yogurt left to buy individually.

Also, I need to consider if buying pairs with promotion is beneficial or not.

Let me think about a general approach.

For any n, the number of pairs that can be bought is n // 2, and the remaining yogurts are n % 2.

So, if I buy n // 2 pairs with the promotion, and n % 2 yogurts individually, the total cost would be (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a.

Alternatively, I could buy all yogurts individually, paying a * n.

I need to choose the minimum between these two options.

Wait, but in the third example, buying all three individually is cheaper than buying one pair with promotion and one individually.

Similarly, in the fourth example, buying all four individually is cheaper than buying two pairs with promotion.

So, my approach should be to calculate both options and choose the minimum.

But let's think if there are cases where buying some pairs with promotion and some individually might be cheaper than either buying all pairs with promotion or all individually.

For example, suppose n=4, a=5, b=9.

Option 1: Buy two pairs with promotion: 2 * 9 = 18 burles.

Option 2: Buy all four individually: 4 * 5 = 20 burles.

Option 3: Buy one pair with promotion and two individually: 9 + 2 * 5 = 19 burles.

In this case, Option 1 is the cheapest.

But in the fourth example, Option 2 is cheaper than Option 1.

So, it's sufficient to compare Option 1 and Option 2, and choose the minimum.

I don't need to consider Option 3 separately because Option 1 (buying as many pairs as possible with promotion and the remaining individually) will always be equal or better than any other combination.

Wait, in the fourth example, Option 1 is 22 burles, and Option 2 is 20 burles.

So, Option 2 is better.

But if b is less than 2*a, then buying pairs with promotion is better than buying individually.

For example, if b < 2*a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible with promotion and buy the remaining individually.

If b >= 2*a, then buying individually is better.

Wait, in the third example, b=11 and a=5, so b=11 is greater than 2*a=10.

So, buying individually is better.

In the first example, b=9 is less than 2*a=10, so buying pairs with promotion is better.

In the second example, b=9 is less than 2*a=10, so buying pairs with promotion is better.

In the fourth example, b=11 is greater than 2*a=10, so buying individually is better.

So, the general approach is:

- If b < 2*a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible with promotion and the remaining individually.

- If b >= 2*a, then it's better to buy all yogurts individually.

But wait, in the third example, b=11 and a=5, so b=11 is greater than 2*a=10, so buy all individually.

In the fourth example, b=11 and a=5, same as above.

So, the formula is:

If b < 2*a, then total cost = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a

Else, total cost = n * a

This seems to match the examples.

Let me verify with the third example:

n=3, a=5, b=11

Since b=11 >= 2*a=10, buy all individually: 3*5=15 burles.

In the first example:

n=2, a=5, b=9

Since b=9 < 2*a=10, buy one pair with promotion: 1*9 + 0*5=9 burles.

In the second example:

n=3, a=5, b=9

Since b=9 < 2*a=10, buy one pair with promotion and one individually: 1*9 + 1*5=14 burles.

In the fourth example:

n=4, a=5, b=11

Since b=11 >= 2*a=10, buy all individually: 4*5=20 burles.

This matches the example outputs.

So, my approach is correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

if n > 1:

ans1 = a * n

ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)

print(min(ans1, ans2))

else:

print(a)

This seems to implement the approach I just described.

It checks if n > 1, and if so, calculates two amounts:

ans1: the cost of buying all yogurts individually.

ans2: the cost of buying as many pairs as possible with promotion and the remaining individually.

Then, it prints the minimum of ans1 and ans2.

If n == 1, it simply prints a, which is correct because he can't buy a pair.

This seems correct.

But let's check if there are any edge cases that might fail.

Edge Case 1: n=1

For n=1, the program correctly prints a, which is the only option.

Edge Case 2: n=2

If n=2, and b < 2*a, then buying the pair with promotion is cheaper.

If b >= 2*a, buying individually is better.

The program calculates both options and chooses the minimum, which is correct.

Edge Case 3: n is even

For even n, it's straightforward: buy n//2 pairs with promotion and calculate the cost.

But the program still calculates both options and chooses the minimum, which is safe.

Edge Case 4: n is odd

For odd n, buy (n//2) pairs with promotion and one individually, which the program does.

Edge Case 5: a and b are equal

If a and b are equal such that b = 2*a, then buying individually or in pairs costs the same.

In this case, it's irrelevant which option is chosen, as both cost the same.

The program would choose the minimum, which would be equal to either option.

So, it's still correct.

Edge Case 6: b is less than 2*a

In this case, buying pairs with promotion is better.

The program calculates ans2: b*(n//2) + a*(n%2), which is the correct minimal cost.

Edge Case 7: b is greater than or equal to 2*a

In this case, buying all individually is better.

The program calculates ans1: a*n, and ans2: b*(n//2) + a*(n%2).

Since b >= 2*a, ans1 would be less than or equal to ans2, so min(ans1, ans2) would be ans1.

Hence, correct.

I can't find any scenario where this program would give an incorrect answer.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{9} \]  
\[ \boxed{14} \]  
\[ \boxed{15} \]  
\[ \boxed{20} \]  
**Correctness: True**
