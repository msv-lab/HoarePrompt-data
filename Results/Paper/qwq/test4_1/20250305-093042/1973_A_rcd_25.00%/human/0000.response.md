Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are three friends playing chess together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or print -1 if such a scenario is impossible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each game results in either a win or a draw. In a win, one player gets 2 points, the other gets 0. In a draw, both players get 1 point each. So, for each game played, the total points distributed are either 2 (in case of a win) or 2 (in case of a draw). Wait, that's interesting. So, regardless of whether it's a win or a draw, each game contributes exactly 2 points to the total points sum.

Let me formalize that. If there are G games in total, then the total points sum should be 2G, because each game contributes 2 points. So, p1 + p2 + p3 should be equal to 2G. That means, p1 + p2 + p3 must be even, because it's equal to 2 times some integer G. If p1 + p2 + p3 is odd, then it's impossible, and we should return -1.

Looking back at the program, in the first if condition, it checks if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0, and if so, it prints -1. That makes sense based on what I just thought.

Now, if the sum is even, we need to find the maximum number of draws possible. A draw occurs when both players get 1 point each, so for each draw, 2 points are distributed (1 to each player). In a win, also 2 points are distributed (2 to the winner, 0 to the loser).

The key here is to maximize the number of draws. To maximize draws, we need to have as many games as possible end in a draw. But, we have to satisfy the given final scores p1, p2, and p3.

Let's think about how points are accumulated. Each draw increases both players' scores by 1, and each win increases one player's score by 2 and the other's by 0.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, I need to distribute the points in such a way that these inequalities hold.

I need to find the maximum number of draws D, such that the remaining games are wins, and the total points add up to p1, p2, and p3.

Let me denote W as the number of wins. Then, total games G = D + W, and total points sum is 2G = p1 + p2 + p3.

So, 2(D + W) = p1 + p2 + p3.

Since we're trying to maximize D, we need to minimize W.

But, there are constraints on how the points are distributed.

Let me consider the possible pairings. There are three players, so there are three possible pairings: (1,2), (1,3), and (2,3).

Each pairing can have multiple games between them.

I need to consider how many times each pairing played and the outcomes.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think in terms of the individual players' points.

Each player's points come from the games they played.

Let me denote for each player, the number of draws they were in, and the number of wins they had.

Wait, but in a draw, both players get 1 point, and in a win, one gets 2 points and the other gets 0.

So, for each player, their total points are equal to the number of draws they were in plus twice the number of wins they had as a winner.

Wait, more formally:

For player i, let's denote:

- d_i: number of draws player i was in.

- w_i: number of wins player i had.

Then, player i's total points p_i = d_i + 2 w_i.

Also, note that each draw involves two players, so the total number of draws D should be equal to half the sum of d_i's, because each draw is counted twice.

Wait, actually, since each draw involves two players, the total number of draws D is equal to the sum of d_i's divided by 2.

Similarly, each win involves one player winning and another losing, so the total number of wins W is equal to the sum of w_i's.

Wait, but in reality, each win is counted only once, assigned to the winner.

So, total wins W = w1 + w2 + w3.

Similarly, since each draw is between two players, total draws D = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2.

Given that, and knowing that p_i = d_i + 2 w_i, for each i.

Also, the total number of games G = D + W = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2 + w1 + w2 + w3.

But we also know that 2G = p1 + p2 + p3.

Wait, but p1 + p2 + p3 = (d1 + 2 w1) + (d2 + 2 w2) + (d3 + 2 w3) = (d1 + d2 + d3) + 2 (w1 + w2 + w3).

But from earlier, G = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2 + w1 + w2 + w3.

So, 2G = (d1 + d2 + d3) + 2 (w1 + w2 + w3), which matches p1 + p2 + p3.

This confirms our earlier equations.

Now, to maximize the number of draws D, which is (d1 + d2 + d3)/2, we need to maximize d1 + d2 + d3.

Given that p_i = d_i + 2 w_i, we can express w_i in terms of p_i and d_i: w_i = (p_i - d_i)/2.

Since w_i must be an integer (you can't have half a win), (p_i - d_i) must be even.

Also, d_i must be less than or equal to the number of times player i played draws.

But this is getting a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the total number of draws D.

Each draw involves two players, so for each draw, two players each get 1 point.

Each win involves one player getting 2 points and the other getting 0.

Given that, the total points sum is 2G, where G = D + W.

We have p1 + p2 + p3 = 2G.

Our goal is to maximize D, given p1, p2, p3.

To maximize D, we need to minimize W.

But we need to ensure that the distribution of points is possible given the constraints of the game.

Let me consider the minimal number of wins required to achieve the given points.

Each win increases the total points by 2, just like a draw, but分配方式不同。

Wait, but since both win and draw add 2 points to the total, the total points don't distinguish between wins and draws.

However, the individual scores do.

So, to maximize D, we need to minimize W.

But we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved with the given number of wins and draws.

Let me think about the minimal number of wins needed.

The minimal number of wins W_min is the number of times a player has to win to achieve their score, beyond what they can get from draws.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the minimal number of wins required for each player.

For each player, their points p_i can be achieved by some combination of draws and wins.

Specifically, p_i = d_i + 2 w_i.

To minimize W, we need to maximize d_i for each player.

But d_i is limited by the number of times player i can participate in draws.

Wait, but d_i can't exceed the total number of games player i played.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I should look for an upper bound on D.

The maximum possible D is when all games are draws, but that would require p_i = d_i for all i, since d_i + 2 w_i = p_i, and w_i = 0.

But in that case, p_i would equal d_i, and since D = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2, then D = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2.

But this assumes that all games are draws, which may not be possible if p_i's don't satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum D is when as many points as possible come from draws, and the rest from wins.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal number of wins.

Let me define W as the total number of wins.

Then, W = (p1 + p2 + p3)/2 - D.

But we need to minimize W, which means maximizing D.

However, W must be such that the individual p_i's can be achieved.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal W such that p_i <= d_i + 2 w_i, but d_i is related to D.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the constraints on the individual p_i's based on the pairings.

Let me consider that the highest scorer, p3, must have achieved their points through a combination of wins and draws against the other two players.

Similarly, p1 and p2 have their points from their games against each other and against p3.

Given that p1 <= p2 <= p3, perhaps p3 has played some number of games against p1 and p2, and similarly for the others.

This seems too vague to work with directly.

Maybe I should look for inequalities that must hold for p1, p2, p3.

For example, in the chess games, no player can have a negative number of wins or draws.

Also, the number of times two players have played against each other must be consistent across all triplets.

This seems complicated.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and outputs to get some intuition.

First sample input: 0 0 0

Output: 0

This makes sense because no games were played, so no draws.

Second sample input: 0 1 1

Output: 1

Wait, how is that possible? If two players have 1 point each, and one has 0, it must be that the two with 1 point drew against each other, and the one with 0 didn't play any game.

Wait, but in this scenario, only one game was played between the two players who have 1 point each, and it ended in a draw.

Hence, one draw occurred.

Third sample input: 1 1 1

Output: -1

Why is this impossible? If all three have 1 point each, but in the previous case, two players having 1 point each was possible.

Wait, but in the previous case, only one game was played, between the two players who have 1 point, and the third player has 0 and didn't play.

In this case, for all three to have 1 point, there would need to be draws involving all of them, but that's not possible because draws are between two players.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible because the total points would be 3, which is odd, but in our earlier reasoning, we saw that the total points must be even, since each game contributes 2 points.

Wait, but in this case, 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is odd, so it should indeed be impossible.

But in the program, it's checking if p3 >= p1 + p2, and in this case, p3 =1, p1 + p2 =2, so p3 < p1 + p2, so it goes to the else clause.

Then it calculates low and high based on p3 - p1 and p3 - p2.

Wait, perhaps the program has a flaw here because it shouldn't even reach this step if the sum is odd.

Wait, but in the program, it first checks if the sum is even, and only if it is even, it proceeds.

In this case, 1 +1 +1 =3, which is odd, so it should have printed -1 immediately.

But in the sample input, it's printed -1, but according to the program, it should have printed -1 in the first if condition.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, it's said that for the third example, it's impossible, so it prints -1.

But according to our earlier reasoning, if the sum is odd, it's impossible, which is correctly handled in the program.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's 1 1 1, sum is 3, which is odd, so it's handled correctly.

Fourth sample input:1 1 2

Sum is 4, which is even.

Program checks if p3 >= p1 + p2, which is 2 >= 1 +1, which is true, so it prints p1 + p2 =2.

Is this possible?

If p3 =2, p1=1, p2=1.

Is it possible to have p3 getting 2 points, and p1 and p2 each getting 1 point?

Yes, for example:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins, so p3 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

- p3 plays against p2: p3 draws with p2, so p3 gets 1 (total 3), p2 gets 1.

Wait, but p3 has only 2 points, so this doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins, p3 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

- p3 plays against p2: p3 loses, p3 gets 0, p2 gets 2.

But then p3 has 2, p2 has 2, p1 has 0, which doesn't match.

Alternatively:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins, p3 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

- p2 plays against p1: p2 wins, p2 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

But then p3 has 2, p2 has 2, p1 has 0, again not matching.

Alternatively:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 draws with p1, p3 gets 1, p1 gets 1.

- p3 plays against p2: p3 draws with p2, p3 gets 1 (total 2), p2 gets 1 (total 1).

- p2 plays against p1: p2 wins, p2 gets 2 (total 3), p1 gets 0 (total 1).

Wait, but p2 has 3, which is more than p3, but p3 is supposed to be the highest.

Wait, perhaps it's invalid because p2 ends up with more points than p3.

Alternatively:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 wins, p3 gets 2, p1 gets 0.

- p3 plays against p2: p3 draws with p2, p3 gets 1 (total 3), p2 gets 1.

- p2 plays against p1: p2 draws with p1, p2 gets 1 (total 2), p1 gets 1 (total 1).

Now, p1=1, p2=2, p3=3.

But in the sample input, p3=2, p2=1, p1=1, which is different.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

But according to the program, it prints 2, meaning that the maximum number of draws is 2.

But in reality, is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me see.

If p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Is it possible?

Let's see:

- p3 plays against p1: p3 draws with p1, p3 gets 1, p1 gets 1.

- p3 plays against p2: p3 draws with p2, p3 gets 1 (total 2), p2 gets 1 (total 1).

- p2 plays against p1: they don't play, or if they play, it would affect their points.

If p2 and p1 don't play, then p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, which matches.

So, with two draws (p3-p1 and p3-p2), and no other games, this is achievable.

Hence, the maximum number of draws is 2.

So, the program is correct in this case.

Fifth sample input:3 3 3

Sum is 9, which is odd, so it should be impossible, and the program prints -1, which is correct.

Sixth sample input:3 4 5

Sum is 12, which is even.

Now, p3=5, p1=3, p2=4.

Is p3 >= p1 + p2? 5 >= 3 +4? No, 5 <7, so it goes to the else clause.

Then, low and high are min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2) and max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2).

p3 - p1 =2, p3 - p2=1, so low=1, high=2.

Then, cur starts at low=1.

Check if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur): 3 -1 <=4 - (5 -1) => 2 <=0, which is false, so cur +=1.

Now cur=2.

Check if 3 -2 <=4 - (5 -2) =>1 <=1, which is true, so print p1 - cur + p3 =3 -2 +5=6.

Hence, maximum draws are 6.

Is this possible?

Let's see.

If there are 6 draws, then total points from draws would be 6*2 =12 points distributed.

But p1 + p2 + p3 =12, so all points come from draws.

But in this case, each draw involves two players, so each draw adds 1 point to each of the two players involved.

So, if there are 6 draws, and three players, let's see how their points can be distributed.

Each player's points would be equal to the number of draws they participated in.

So, let's denote d1, d2, d3 as the number of draws each player participated in.

Then, p1 = d1, p2 = d2, p3 = d3.

But p1 + p2 + p3 = d1 + d2 + d3 =12.

But the total number of draws D = (d1 + d2 + d3)/2 =6.

But in this case, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, which sum to 12, and D=6.

Is this achievable?

Yes, if player 1 participated in 3 draws, player 2 in 4 draws, and player 3 in 5 draws.

But in a set of 6 draws, involving pairs of players, we need to see if such participation is possible.

For example, possible pairings could be:

- Player 1 and Player 2: 2 draws

- Player 1 and Player 3:1 draw

- Player 2 and Player 3:3 draws

Then, d1 =2 (with p2) +1 (with p3) =3

d2 =2 (with p1) +3 (with p3) =5

d3 =1 (with p1) +3 (with p2) =4

Which matches p1=3, p2=5, p3=4.

But in the sample input, p2=4 and p3=5, but since p2 <= p3, it's ordered.

So, this distribution works.

Hence, maximum draws can be 6.

Seems correct.

Seventh sample input:1 1 10

Sum is 12, which is even.

p3=10, p1=1, p2=1.

p3 >= p1 + p2:10 >=1 +1, which is true, so print p1 + p2 =2.

Is this possible?

If p3 plays against p1 and wins all games, getting 2 points per win, and similarly against p2.

But p1 and p2 don't play against each other.

So, p3 plays against p1: to get 10 points, p3 needs to win 5 times (5*2=10), but p1 would then have 0 points, but p1 has 1 point.

Wait, perhaps p3 plays against p1: p3 wins 4 times (8 points), and draws once (1 point each), so p3 gets 9 points, but needs 10.

Wait, doesn't add up.

Alternatively, p3 plays against p1: p3 wins 4 times (8 points), and against p2: p3 wins 1 time (2 points), total 10 points.

p1 has 0 from losses, but needs 1 point.

Wait, unless p1 and p2 play a draw, p1 gets 1 point, p2 gets 1 point.

So, p3 plays against p1: p3 wins 4 times, p1 gets 0.

p3 plays against p2: p3 wins 1 time, p2 gets 0.

p1 and p2 play a draw: p1 gets 1, p2 gets 1.

Total: p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

This matches the required scores.

Number of draws is only 1 (between p1 and p2).

But according to the program, it prints 2, but in reality, only 1 draw is possible.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect here.

Wait, in the program, it prints p1 + p2 when p3 >= p1 + p2.

In this case, p1 + p2 =2, but in reality, only 1 draw is possible.

Hence, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the earlier case with p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, it printed 2, which was achievable with 2 draws.

But in this case, p1=1, p2=1, p3=10, and only 1 draw is possible.

So, the program seems to be incorrect.

Hence, the program is flawed in this scenario.

Therefore, the correctness is False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
