Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Monocarp wants to throw a party and invite some of his friends, but there are some conditions. He has n friends, and each friend has a best friend, which is specified by p_i. The key points are:

1. All p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i. So, no one is their own best friend, and everyone has a unique best friend.

2. For a friend to attend the party, both the friend and their best friend must receive an invitation.

3. Monocarp wants at least 2 friends to attend the party.

4. He needs to send the minimum number of invitations to achieve this.

My task is to determine the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

First, I need to understand the relationship between the friends and their best friends. Since p_i is the best friend of the i-th friend, and all p_i are distinct, this forms a permutation of the friends. In other words, it's like a mapping where each friend is mapped to another unique friend.

Given that, I can think of this as a graph where each friend is a node, and there's a directed edge from friend i to friend p_i. Since p_i are distinct and p_i ≠ i, this graph will consist of disjoint cycles.

For example, if n=3 and p=[2,3,1], then friend 1's best friend is 2, friend 2's best friend is 3, and friend 3's best friend is 1. This forms a cycle of length 3.

Similarly, if n=4 and p=[2,3,4,1], it's a cycle of length 4.

If n=5 and p=[3,1,2,5,4], it seems like there are two cycles: one of length 3 (1->3->2->1) and one of length 2 (4->5->4).

Wait, in the first example, p=[3,1,2,5,4], so:

- Friend 1's best friend is 3

- Friend 2's best friend is 1

- Friend 3's best friend is 2

- Friend 4's best friend is 5

- Friend 5's best friend is 4

So, indeed, there are two cycles: a triangle (1-3-2) and a pair (4-5).

In the second example, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1]:

- 1->2->3->4->1, which is a single cycle of length 4.

Third example, n=2, p=[2,1]:

- 1->2->1, a cycle of length 2.

So, in general, the p array defines a permutation, which can be decomposed into disjoint cycles.

Now, the problem is to select a set of friends to invite such that at least 2 friends attend the party, and a friend attends only if both they and their best friend are invited.

I need to minimize the number of invitations sent.

Let me think about what this means in terms of the cycles.

In a cycle of length k, what is the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends attend?

First, consider a cycle of length 2: A and B are best friends of each other.

If I invite both A and B, then both will attend because each has their best friend invited.

If I invite only one of them, say A, then A won't attend because B isn't invited.

So, to have at least one attend, I need to invite both in a cycle of 2.

But since I need at least 2 friends to attend, and in this case, inviting both is necessary for either to attend.

Wait, but in this case, inviting both A and B makes both attend, which satisfies the condition.

If there are other cycles, I might be able to invite fewer people.

Wait, in the third example, n=2, p=[2,1], and the output is 2.

So, in a single cycle of length 2, inviting both is necessary to have both attend.

Now, in a cycle of length 3: A->B->C->A.

If I invite A and B, then:

- A has B invited, but B's best friend is C, who isn't invited, so A attends but B doesn't.

Wait, no. The condition is that a friend attends if both they and their best friend are invited.

So, for A to attend, both A and p_A = B must be invited.

Similarly, for B to attend, both B and p_B = C must be invited.

So, if I invite A and B:

- A and B are invited.

- A's best friend is B, who is invited, so A attends.

- B's best friend is C, who isn't invited, so B doesn't attend.

- C isn't invited, so doesn't attend.

So, only A attends, which doesn't meet the requirement of at least 2 attending.

If I invite A and C:

- A and C are invited.

- A's best friend is B, who isn't invited, so A doesn't attend.

- C's best friend is A, who is invited, so C attends.

- But only C attends, which is less than 2.

If I invite B and C:

- B and C are invited.

- B's best friend is C, who is invited, so B attends.

- C's best friend is A, who isn't invited, so C doesn't attend.

- Only B attends, which is less than 2.

If I invite A, B, and C:

- A, B, C are invited.

- A's best friend B is invited, so A attends.

- B's best friend C is invited, so B attends.

- C's best friend A is invited, so C attends.

- All three attend, which is more than 2.

So, in a cycle of 3, inviting all three makes all three attend.

But is there a way to have at least 2 attend with fewer than 3 invitations?

Let's see:

Is there a way to have exactly 2 attend with fewer than 3 invitations?

Suppose I invite A and B:

- A attends, B doesn't, C doesn't.

Only A attends.

Invite A and C:

- A doesn't attend, C attends.

Only C attends.

Invite B and C:

- B attends, C doesn't.

Only B attends.

So, in all cases, only one attends if I invite only two.

So, to have at least 2 attend, I need to invite all three in a cycle of 3.

Similarly, in a cycle of 4: A->B->C->D->A.

If I invite A, B, C:

- A, B, C are invited.

- A's best friend B is invited, so A attends.

- B's best friend C is invited, so B attends.

- C's best friend D is not invited, so C doesn't attend.

- D isn't invited.

So, A and B attend.

Is this sufficient? Yes, since at least 2 attend.

So, in a cycle of 4, inviting 3 makes at least 2 attend.

Is there a way to have at least 2 attend with fewer invitations?

Let's try inviting A, B, D:

- A, B, D are invited.

- A's best friend B is invited, so A attends.

- B's best friend C isn't invited, so B doesn't attend.

- D's best friend A is invited, so D attends.

- C isn't invited.

So, A and D attend. That's 2.

So, in a cycle of 4, inviting 3 is not necessary; inviting 3 in a way that includes non-consecutive friends can make at least 2 attend.

Wait, in this case, inviting A, B, D makes A and D attend.

Is there a way to invite fewer than 3?

Try inviting A and C:

- A and C are invited.

- A's best friend B isn't invited, so A doesn't attend.

- C's best friend D is invited, so C attends.

- Only C attends, which is less than 2.

Invite A and D:

- A and D are invited.

- A's best friend B isn't invited, so A doesn't attend.

- D's best friend A is invited, so D attends.

- Only D attends, which is less than 2.

Invite B and D:

- B and D are invited.

- B's best friend C isn't invited, so B doesn't attend.

- D's best friend A isn't invited, so D doesn't attend.

- No one attends.

Invite B and C:

- B and C are invited.

- B's best friend C is invited, so B attends.

- C's best friend D is invited, so C attends.

- D is invited, but D's best friend A isn't invited, so D doesn't attend.

- So, B and C attend.

That's 2.

So, inviting B and C makes B and C attend.

Similarly, inviting A and C wouldn't work as shown earlier.

Wait, in this case, inviting B and C makes B and C attend.

So, in a cycle of 4, inviting 2 specific friends can make 2 attend.

So, in this case, the minimal number of invitations is 2.

Wait, but earlier, in the sample input, for n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], the output is 3.

Wait, but according to this, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample input, it's n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], and the output is 3.

But according to my earlier reasoning, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"In the second test case, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2 have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3 won't come since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come."

So, according to the note, it's impossible to have at least 2 attend with fewer than 3 invitations.

But in my earlier attempt, inviting B and C (friends 2 and 3) makes B and C attend.

Wait, let's check that again.

If I invite friends 2 and 3:

- Friend 2 is invited, their best friend is 3, who is invited, so friend 2 attends.

- Friend 3 is invited, their best friend is 4, who isn't invited, so friend 3 doesn't attend.

- Friend 4 isn't invited.

So, only friend 2 attends.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I confused the indices.

Given p=[2,3,4,1]:

- Friend 1's best friend is 2.

- Friend 2's best friend is 3.

- Friend 3's best friend is 4.

- Friend 4's best friend is 1.

So, in the cycle: 1->2->3->4->1.

If I invite friends 2 and 3:

- Friend 2: invited, best friend 3 is invited, so friend 2 attends.

- Friend 3: invited, best friend 4 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't attend.

- Friend 4: not invited.

So, only friend 2 attends.

Similarly, inviting friends 1 and 3:

- Friend 1: invited, best friend 2 is not invited, so doesn't attend.

- Friend 3: invited, best friend 4 is not invited, so doesn't attend.

- Only friends 1 and 3 are invited, but neither attends.

Wait, according to the note, inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 makes friends 1 and 2 attend.

Let's check that:

- Invite friends 1, 2, 3.

- Friend 1: invited, best friend 2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 2: invited, best friend 3 is invited, so friend 2 attends.

- Friend 3: invited, best friend 4 is not invited, so friend 3 doesn't attend.

- Friend 4: not invited.

So, friends 1 and 2 attend.

Hence, at least 2 attend.

But is there a way to have at least 2 attend with only 2 invitations?

From earlier attempts, it seems not.

Wait, what if I invite friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 2: invited, best friend 3 is not invited, so doesn't attend.

- Friend 4: invited, best friend 1 is invited, so friend 4 attends.

- Friend 1: invited, best friend 2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 3: not invited.

So, friends 1 and 4 attend.

That's 2 friends attending.

So, with only 2 invitations (to friends 2 and 4), friends 1 and 4 attend.

Hence, it seems possible to have at least 2 attend with only 2 invitations.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample input, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], and the output is 3.

But according to my last attempt, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, let's read the problem statement again.

"the i-th friend's best friend is p_i. All p_i are distinct, and for every i ∈ [1,n], p_i ≠ i.

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation.

Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends."

Wait, so the condition for friend i to attend is that both friend i and friend p_i are invited.

So, for friend i to attend, both friend i and friend p_i must be invited.

In my earlier example, inviting friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited, p_1=2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 2: invited, p_2=3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't attend.

- Friend 3: not invited.

- Friend 4: invited, p_4=1 is invited, so friend 4 attends.

Hence, friends 1 and 4 attend.

That's 2 friends attending.

So, with only 2 invitations (to friends 2 and 4), we have 2 friends attending.

But in the sample input, it says the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"In the second test case, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2 have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3 won't come since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come."

But according to my earlier reasoning, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which is at least 2.

So, why is the answer 3 in the sample input?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the attendance condition.

Let me read the problem statement again.

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, for friend i to attend, both friend i and friend p_i must be invited.

Wait, so for friend 1 to attend, both friend 1 and friend p_1=2 must be invited.

Similarly, for friend 2 to attend, both friend 2 and friend p_2=3 must be invited.

For friend 3 to attend, both friend 3 and friend p_3=4 must be invited.

For friend 4 to attend, both friend 4 and friend p_4=1 must be invited.

Now, in my earlier example, if I invite friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't attend.

- Friend 3: not invited.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited, so friend 4 attends.

Hence, friends 1 and 4 attend.

That seems correct.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the friends who are invited also attend, not just that at least 2 attend.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, being invited is different from attending.

You send invitations to certain friends, and based on whether both they and their best friend are invited, they decide to attend.

The goal is to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

In my earlier example, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which should be sufficient.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the friends who are invited but don't attend are still sent invitations, which count towards the total invitations sent.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends."

So, each invitation corresponds to one friend being invited.

The number of invitations sent is equal to the number of friends invited.

The problem is to minimize the number of friends invited, such that at least 2 friends attend.

In my earlier example, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, so with 2 invitations, at least 2 attend.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 3.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted who attends.

Let's re-examine:

If I invite friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited and p_1=2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 2: invited and p_2=3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't attend.

- Friend 3: not invited.

- Friend 4: invited and p_4=1 is invited, so friend 4 attends.

Hence, friends 1 and 4 attend.

That seems correct.

So, why is the sample input answer 3?

Wait, perhaps in the sample input, inviting only 2 friends doesn't always work.

Wait, in the sample input, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], and the output is 3.

But according to my earlier logic, inviting 2 friends can make 2 attend.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more complex, and in some cases, inviting 2 isn't sufficient, but in this particular case, it is.

Wait, perhaps I need to generalize the approach.

Let me consider the cycles.

In a cycle of length k, what is the minimal number of invitations needed to have at least 2 friends attend?

In a cycle of length 2:

- Invite both to have both attend.

- Inviting only one doesn't make any attend.

So, to have at least 2 attend, need to invite both.

Hence, for a cycle of length 2, the minimal number of invitations is 2.

In a cycle of length 3:

- As earlier, inviting all three makes all three attend.

- Inviting any two makes only one attend.

Hence, for a cycle of length 3, need to invite all three to have at least two attend.

Wait, but in the first sample input, n=5 with two cycles: a cycle of 3 and a cycle of 2.

According to the sample input, the answer is 2.

Wait, no, the first sample input is n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], which has a cycle of 3 (1-3-2) and a cycle of 2 (4-5).

The output is 2.

According to my earlier logic, for the cycle of 2, inviting both makes both attend, which would satisfy the condition of at least 2 attending.

Hence, in this case, inviting 2 friends (from the cycle of 2) makes 2 attend.

Similarly, in the third sample input, n=2, p=[2,1], output is 2.

Which aligns with inviting both in a cycle of 2 makes both attend.

But in the second sample input, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], which is a cycle of 4, the output is 3.

But according to my earlier attempt, inviting 2 friends can make 2 attend.

However, perhaps in some cycles, inviting 2 isn't sufficient in general, but in this specific case, it is.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a general formula.

Let me think about the cycles.

Suppose there are multiple cycles.

In each cycle, I need to decide how many invitations to send to that cycle to maximize the number of attendees.

But the goal is global: have at least 2 attendees in total.

So, I need to distribute the invitations across cycles in a way that at least 2 friends from the entire group attend.

Given that, perhaps I can prioritize inviting in cycles where I can get more attendees per invitation.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the minimal number of invitations needed to get at least 2 attendees, considering the entire friendship graph.

Given that the cycles are disjoint, the attendees from different cycles are independent.

Hence, I can consider each cycle separately and see how many attendees I get per invitation in each cycle.

Wait, but since the cycles are disjoint, the best strategy might be to focus on the cycles where I can get the most attendees per invitation.

Wait, but in practice, it's more complex.

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose there are multiple cycles of different lengths.

I need to select a subset of friends to invite such that the total number of attendees is at least 2, and the number of invitations (i.e., the number of friends invited) is minimized.

Given the structure of the cycles, it's essential to consider how invitations to one cycle can affect another.

But since the cycles are disjoint, invitations to one cycle don't directly affect another cycle.

Hence, I can treat each cycle separately.

Wait, but the attendance is cumulative across cycles.

So, I need to ensure that the total number of attendees from all cycles is at least 2.

Hence, I can consider the minimal number of invitations needed across all cycles to have at least 2 attendees.

Let me consider the first sample input:

n=5, p=[3,1,2,5,4], which has a cycle of 3 (1-3-2) and a cycle of 2 (4-5).

In the cycle of 3, inviting all three makes all three attend.

Inviting any two makes only one attend.

Inviting one makes none attend.

In the cycle of 2, inviting both makes both attend.

Inviting one makes none attend.

So, options:

- Invite both from the cycle of 2: 2 invitations, 2 attendees.

- Invite all three from the cycle of 3: 3 invitations, 3 attendees.

- Invite two from the cycle of 3 and one from the cycle of 2: 3 invitations, 1 attendee from cycle of 3 and 0 from cycle of 2, total 1 attendee.

- Invite one from the cycle of 3 and one from the cycle of 2: 2 invitations, 0 from cycle of 3 and 0 from cycle of 2, total 0 attendees.

- Invite two from the cycle of 3 and both from the cycle of 2: 4 invitations, 1 from cycle of 3 and 2 from cycle of 2, total 3 attendees.

So, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 attendees is 2, by inviting both from the cycle of 2.

Hence, the answer is 2.

In the second sample input, n=4, p=[2,3,4,1], which is a single cycle of 4: 1-2-3-4.

From earlier attempts, inviting 2 specific friends can make 2 attend, but according to the sample input, the answer is 3.

Wait, perhaps in a cycle of 4, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 attend is 3.

But in my earlier attempt, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which is 2 attendees.

Hence, according to the sample input, it's 3, but according to my logic, it's 2.

There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, it's required that the friends who are invited also attend, not just that at least 2 attend.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, being invited is different from attending.

You send invitations to friends, and based on whether both they and their best friend are invited, they decide to attend.

The goal is to have at least 2 friends attend the party.

Hence, in the cycle of 4, inviting 2 specific friends can make 2 attend, as in my earlier example.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2, but the sample input says 3.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in which friends are invited and who attends.

Let me double-check.

In the cycle of 4: 1->2->3->4->1.

If I invite friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited (since invited), p_1=2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 2: invited, p_2=3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't attend.

- Friend 3: not invited.

- Friend 4: invited, p_4=1 is invited, so friend 4 attends.

Hence, friends 1 and 4 attend.

That's 2 attendees with 2 invitations.

So, according to this, it should be possible to have at least 2 attend with 2 invitations.

But according to the sample input, the answer is 3.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the sample explanation.

Wait, in the note, it says:

"In the second test case, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3, for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2 have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3 won't come since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come."

But according to my earlier reasoning, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which is at least 2.

Hence, it seems possible with 2 invitations.

Perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the friends who are invited but don't attend still count as invitations sent.

Wait, no, the problem clearly states:

"Each invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends."

So, the number of invitations is equal to the number of friends invited.

The goal is to minimize the number of friends invited, such that at least 2 friends attend.

In my earlier example, inviting 2 friends makes 2 attend, which should be sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that a friend attends only if both they and their best friend are invited, and their best friend attends.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, only needing both to be invited, not that the best friend attends.

Hence, in my earlier example, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which should be sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps there's an error in the sample input or its explanation.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that some friends' attendance depends on others in a more complex way.

Wait, perhaps in larger cycles, inviting only 2 might not be sufficient in general, but in this specific cycle of 4, it is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the friends who are invited also attend, which would mean that they need to satisfy the condition of both being invited and their best friend being invited.

Wait, no, the problem clearly states:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, being invited is separate from attending.

You can invite friends who don't attend, as long as at least 2 attend.

Hence, in the cycle of 4, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which should be sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way invitations are sent.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that for a friend to attend, both they and their best friend are invited, and their best friend also attends.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

There's no mention of the best friend attending, only that both are invited.

Hence, in my earlier example, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in some cases, the friends who are supposed to attend might not attend if their best friend doesn't attend, creating a dependency.

But according to the problem statement, the only condition is that both the friend and their best friend are invited.

Once invited and the condition is met, they attend, regardless of whether their best friend attends.

Hence, in my earlier example, friends 1 and 4 attend because both they and their best friends are invited.

Hence, with 2 invitations, at least 2 attend.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps there's a mistake in the sample input or its explanation.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the friends who are invited but don't attend don't count towards the attendance.

Wait, but in my earlier example, friends 1 and 4 attend, which is sufficient.

Hence, the answer should be 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that the friends who are invited also attend, meaning they must satisfy the condition to attend.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, being invited is separate from attending.

You can have friends who are invited but don't attend if the condition isn't met.

The goal is to have at least 2 friends attend, regardless of how many are invited.

Hence, in my earlier example, inviting friends 2 and 4 makes friends 1 and 4 attend, which should be sufficient.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way the cycles are processed.

Wait, perhaps in cycles of even length, the minimal number is ceil(n/2), and in cycles of odd length, it's the entire cycle.

Wait, in a cycle of 3, inviting all three makes all three attend.

In a cycle of 4, inviting 3 makes 2 attend, as in the sample input.

But according to my earlier example, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

Hence, perhaps the general rule is:

- For cycles of length 2: invite both to have both attend.

- For cycles of length 3: invite all three to have all three attend.

- For cycles of length 4: invite 3 to have 2 attend.

Wait, but in my earlier example, in a cycle of 4, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of even length >=4, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 attend is ceil(n/2).

Wait, in a cycle of 4, ceil(4/2)=2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

But according to my earlier example, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

Hence, perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps there's a different logic.

Alternatively, perhaps in general, for cycles of even length, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 attend is floor((n+1)/2).

For n=4, floor((4+1)/2)=2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Hence, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n-1.

But in n=4, n-1=3, which matches the sample input.

But according to my earlier example, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

Hence, perhaps the sample input is wrong, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in some cycles, inviting floor((n+1)/2) isn't sufficient.

Wait, perhaps the minimal number of invitations needed is the minimal number such that the number of attendees is at least 2.

Given that, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of invitations where the number of attendees is at least 2.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of even length, inviting n/2 isn't always sufficient.

Wait, in a cycle of 4, inviting 2 can make 2 attend, as in my earlier example.

Hence, perhaps for cycles of even length, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 attend is 2.

But in the sample input, it's 3.

Hence, perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the way attendees are calculated is different.

Wait, perhaps the attendees are only those who are invited and their best friend is also invited.

Wait, no, the problem says:

"the i-th friend comes to the party if both the i-th friend and the p_i-th friend receive an invitation."

So, to attend, both the friend and their best friend must be invited.

Hence, attendees are those who are invited and their best friend is also invited.

Wait, but in my earlier example, inviting friends 2 and 4:

- Friend 1: invited (since invited), p_1=2 is invited, so friend 1 attends.

- Friend 2: invited, p_2=3 is not invited, so friend 2 doesn't attend.

- Friend 3: not invited.

- Friend 4: invited, p_4=1 is invited, so friend 4 attends.

Hence, friends 1 and 4 attend.

So, with 2 invitations, 2 attend.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the attendees are only those who are invited and their best friend is invited, but also their best friend attends.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't mention anything about the best friend attending; only that both the friend and their best friend are invited.

Hence, in my earlier example, friends 1 and 4 attend because both they and their best friends are invited.

Hence, with 2 invitations, 2 attend.

Hence, the minimal number should be 2.

But according to the sample input, it's 3.

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the way invitations are sent.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that you can't choose which friends to invite in a cycle; you have to invite in a way that forms a consistent group.

But according to the problem statement, you can send invitations to any subset of friends.

Hence, it should be possible to invite friends 2 and 4.

Hence, perhaps the sample input is wrong, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in a cycle of even length, the minimal number of invitations to have at least 2 attend is floor((n+1)/2).

For n=4, floor((4+1)/2)=2, but according to the sample input, it's 3.

Hence, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps it's n-1.

For n=4, n-1=3, which matches the sample input.

But according to my earlier example, inviting 2 can make 2 attend.

Hence, perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing some constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is more complex and requires a different approach.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me model this as a graph where each cycle is a separate component.

In each cycle, I need to select a subset of friends to invite such that the number of attendees is maximized per invitation.

Then, across all cycles, I need to select invitations to have at least 2 attendees in total.

Given that, perhaps I can prioritize cycles where I can get more attendees per invitation.

But in practice, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a graph and find a minimal dominating set or something similar.

But perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider the program provided.

The program seems to iterate through the friends and checks for certain conditions.

Specifically, it looks for pairs where p_i and p_j are such that they point to each other.

Wait, in the code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

i = 0

j = 0

while i <= n - 1:

p = l[i]

q = l[p - 1]

if q == i + 1:

print(2)

j = 1

break

i += 1

if j == 0:

print(3)

So, for each test case, it reads n and the list p.

Then, it iterates through each friend i from 0 to n-1.

For each i, it gets p_i and then q = p_{p_i -1}.

Then,
