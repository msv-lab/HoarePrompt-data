Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. Alex has n constraints on an integer k, and there are three types of constraints:

1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x.

2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x.

3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

I need to find out how many integers k satisfy all these constraints. It's guaranteed that there's at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, which ensures that the range of possible k values is finite. Also, no two constraints are the same, meaning all (a, x) pairs are distinct.

First, I need to process each test case separately. The input starts with the number of test cases, t. For each test case, I read n, the number of constraints, and then n lines each containing a and x.

My goal is to find the number of integers k that satisfy all these constraints for each test case.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think the key is to determine the range of k based on the type 1 and type 2 constraints and then subtract the numbers that are excluded by the type 3 constraints.

So, for type 1 constraints (k >= x), I need to find the maximum x among all type 1 constraints because k needs to satisfy all constraints. Similarly, for type 2 constraints (k <= x), I need to find the minimum x among all type 2 constraints.

Then, the possible values of k are from max_type1 to min_type2, inclusive.

But, there are also type 3 constraints (k != x), which means I need to exclude certain values from this range.

So, the total number of possible k values would be (min_type2 - max_type1 + 1) minus the number of type 3 constraints that fall within this range.

Wait, but I need to make sure that the type 3 constraints are within this range because if k != x and x is outside the range, it doesn't affect the count.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me denote:

- Let bx be the maximum of all x where a=1 (type 1 constraints).

- Let ax be the minimum of all x where a=2 (type 2 constraints).

- Let cx be the set of all x where a=3 (type 3 constraints).

Then, the possible k values are integers k such that bx <= k <= ax and k not in cx.

So, the total number of k is (ax - bx + 1) - number of elements in cx that are in [bx, ax].

I need to implement this logic.

Let me consider some examples to verify.

Looking back at the first example:

Input:

6

4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

Output:

7

So, bx = max(3) = 3

ax = min(10) = 10

cx = {1, 5}

The range is from 3 to 10, which has 8 numbers: 3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

But k != 1 (which is already outside the range), and k !=5.

So, exclude 5 from the range, so 8 - 1 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Another sample:

Input:

2

1 5

2 4

Output:

0

Here, bx = 5, ax =4. Since bx > ax, no possible k, so 0.

Another one:

Input:

10

3 6

3 7

1 2

1 7

3 100

3 44

2 100

2 98

1 3

3 99

Output:

90

Let's compute bx and ax.

Type 1 constraints: x=2,7,3. So bx = max(2,7,3) =7

Type 2 constraints: x=100,98. So ax = min(100,98)=98

So range is from 7 to 98.

Type 3 constraints: x=6,7,100,44,99

But only x=7 and 44 are within [7,98]. x=6 is 6>=bx=7? No, so not in range.

x=100 is greater than ax=98, so not in range.

x=99 is greater than ax=98, so not in range.

Only x=7 and x=44 are in the range.

So total k without exclusions: 98 -7 +1 =92

Subtract 2 exclusions: 92 -2=90, which matches the sample output.

Seems correct.

Now, in the code provided:

def func():

t = int(input())

r = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

cx = set()

ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)

bx = -1

for _ in range(n):

(a, x) = map(int, input().split())

if a == 1:

bx = max(x, bx)

elif a == 2:

ax = min(x, ax)

else:

cx.add(x)

if bx > ax:

r.append(0)

else:

tmp = 0

for i in cx:

if i >= bx and i <= ax:

tmp += 1

r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)

print(*r, sep='\n')



This seems to match my logic.

It initializes bx to -1 and ax to a large number (1000000007, which is greater than 1e9 as per constraints).

Then, for each constraint:

- If a=1, it takes the maximum x for bx.

- If a=2, it takes the minimum x for ax.

- If a=3, it adds x to the set cx.

Then, if bx > ax, no possible k, so append 0.

Else, count the number of x in cx that are within [bx, ax], and subtract that from (ax - bx +1).

This seems correct.

Let me check if there are any edge cases that might fail.

Consider n=2:

1 1

2 1

So, bx=1, ax=1.

cx is empty.

So, number of k is 1 -0 =1.

But if there is a type 3 constraint k !=1:

1 1

2 1

3 1

Then, bx=1, ax=1, cx={1}

Since 1 is in [1,1], subtract 1, so 1-1=0.

Seems correct.

Another case:

n=3

1 1

2 10

3 5

bx=1, ax=10

cx={5}

So, k from 1 to 10, exclude 5: 9 k values.

Yes.

What if cx has multiple values within [bx, ax]:

n=4

1 1

2 10

3 5

3 6

Then, k from 1 to 10, exclude 5 and 6: 8 k values.

Seems correct.

Also, if cx has values outside [bx, ax], they don't affect the count.

n=4

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 12

Then, bx=3, ax=10

cx={1,12}

Only exclude x=1 and x=12, but since x=1 < bx and x=12 > ax, no exclusions.

So, k from 3 to 10: 8 values.

But in the first sample, it was 7 because x=5 was in the range.

Wait, in the first sample, n=4:

1 3

2 10

3 1

3 5

So, bx=3, ax=10, cx={1,5}

Only x=5 is in [3,10], so exclude 1.

Hence, 10-3+1=8 -1=7.

Yes.

Seems the code handles this correctly.

Also, the code uses a set for cx, which ensures uniqueness and efficient lookup.

Since n <=100 and t <=500, the time constraints should be fine.

Also, the problem states that no two constraints are the same, so no duplicate (a,x) pairs.

Hence, no need to handle duplicates beyond using a set for cx.

Therefore, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
