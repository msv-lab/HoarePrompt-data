Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players, Alice and Bob, and they're playing a game with an array of numbers. The game has two steps: first, Alice can remove up to k elements from the array, and then Bob can multiply up to x elements by -1. Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array after these operations, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what the final sum would be if both play optimally.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with n (the number of elements in the array), k (the maximum number of elements Alice can remove), and x (the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1). Then, there's the array itself. The output should be the sum of the array after both players have done their operations, assuming they play optimally.

Looking at the constraints, n can be up to 2*10^5, and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. So, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough to handle large inputs within reasonable time limits.

Let me think about how Alice and Bob should play.

Alice goes first and can remove up to k elements. Since she wants to maximize the sum, she should remove the smallest elements if Bob doesn't flip any signs, or perhaps consider the impact of Bob's moves.

But Bob goes second, and he can multiply up to x elements by -1, trying to minimize the sum.

So, Alice needs to anticipate what Bob will do and choose which elements to remove accordingly.

This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice is trying to maximize the sum, considering that Bob will then minimize it within his constraints.

I need to find a way to model this interaction.

Let's consider sorting the array. That might help because the smallest elements are the ones Alice might want to remove, and the largest elements are the ones Bob might want to flip negative.

Wait, Bob wants to minimize the sum, so he would flip the largest positive elements to negative to reduce the sum as much as possible.

But Alice can remove some elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

Hmm.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements. Then, Bob will flip up to x elements from the remaining array.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's moves, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, for a given set of elements that Alice removes, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements to negative.

Therefore, Alice should remove elements in such a way that after removing them, the sum minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

Wait, why twice?

Because flipping an element to negative is equivalent to subtracting twice its value from the total sum.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, if I have a sum S of all elements, and Bob flips the x largest elements, each of those flips reduces the sum by twice their value.

Therefore, the final sum would be S - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements after Alice's removal.

So, Alice wants to maximize S - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Which is equivalent to maximizing S minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Since S is fixed for a given array, Alice needs to minimize the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, S is the sum of the original array, but Alice removes k elements, so S decreases by the sum of the removed elements.

Wait, let's be precise.

Let me denote:

- Original sum S = sum of all elements in the array.

- Alice removes k elements, say with sum R.

- Remaining sum after removal is S - R.

- Bob then flips up to x of the remaining elements to negative.

- Flipping an element A to -A is equivalent to subtracting 2*A from the sum.

- So, Bob will flip the x largest remaining positive elements to minimize the sum.

Therefore, the final sum would be (S - R) - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Alice wants to maximize this expression, which means she wants to choose which elements to remove such that (S - R) - 2 * sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose which elements to keep, specifically she keeps n - k elements.

Then, Bob will flip up to x of those remaining elements to negative.

Alice wants to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

So, perhaps I need to select n - k elements to keep, and then Bob will flip up to x of them to negative, to minimize the sum.

I need to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

This sounds like I need to choose which elements to keep such that even after Bob flips up to x of them, the sum is maximized.

This seems like a minimax problem: maximize over the choice of elements to keep, minimize over Bob's choices of which to flip.

This seems complex, but maybe there's a smarter way to approach it.

Let me consider sorting the array in ascending order.

Then, the smallest elements are at the beginning, and the largest at the end.

Alice can remove the smallest k elements to maximize the remaining sum.

But Bob will then flip up to x of the remaining elements to negative.

Bob will choose to flip the largest x remaining elements to negative, to minimize the sum.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the smallest k elements, and then Bob flips the largest x remaining elements to negative.

But is this always optimal for Alice?

Wait, maybe not.

Maybe in some cases, Alice should remove some of the larger elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, let's think.

If Alice removes the smallest elements, Bob will flip the largest remaining elements to negative.

But perhaps, in some scenarios, Alice can remove some large elements to prevent Bob from flipping them, thereby keeping more positive sum.

This is getting confusing.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote the array after Alice's removal as B, which has n - k elements.

Bob will then flip up to x elements in B to negative.

Bob will choose to flip the x largest elements in B to negative, since that minimizes the sum the most.

Therefore, the final sum would be sum(B) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in B.

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

So, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove such that sum(B) - 2 * sum of the x largest elements in B is maximized.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that the final sum is sum(B) - 2 * sum(top x of B).

Which is equal to sum(B) - 2 * (sum(B) - sum(bottom n - k - x of B)).

Wait, no.

Wait, sum of the x largest elements in B is sum(top x of B).

So, sum(B) - 2 * sum(top x of B) = sum(B) - 2 * sum(top x of B).

I can rewrite this as sum(B) - 2 * sum(top x of B) = sum(B) - 2 * (sum(B) - sum(bottom n - k - x of B)).

Wait, no.

Actually, sum(top x of B) = sum(B) - sum(bottom n - k - x of B), but only if n - k >= x.

Wait, no.

Actually, sum(top x of B) is the sum of the x largest elements in B.

sum(bottom n - k - x of B) would be the sum of the smallest n - k - x elements in B, assuming n - k >= x.

But this seems messy.

Maybe another approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove k elements, and Bob will flip up to x elements from the remaining n - k elements.

I need to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

To maximize the sum after Bob flips up to x elements, Alice should aim to have as many positive elements as possible, and make sure that the elements Bob flips are as small as possible.

Wait, but Bob will flip the largest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

So, perhaps Alice should remove the smallest elements, so that the remaining elements are larger, but then Bob will flip the largest ones.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, no.

If Alice removes the smallest elements, the remaining elements are larger, and Bob will flip the largest among them.

If Alice removes some large elements, then the remaining large elements are fewer, and Bob has less to flip.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Alice removes k elements.

Then, Bob will flip the x largest remaining elements.

So, the final sum is sum of all elements minus sum of removed elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, original sum is sum of all elements.

After removing k elements, sum becomes sum of all elements minus sum of removed elements.

Then, Bob flips up to x elements, which reduces the sum by twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Therefore, final sum is sum of all elements minus sum of removed elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

So, to maximize this, Alice needs to choose which k elements to remove such that sum of all elements minus sum of removed elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can consider different scenarios based on the relationship between k and x.

Case 1: k >= x.

In this case, Alice can remove the x smallest elements, so that Bob has to flip the largest x elements.

Wait, no.

Wait, if Alice removes the x smallest elements, then the remaining elements are larger, and Bob will flip the largest x remaining elements.

But perhaps Alice can do better by removing some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

Wait, but if she removes the largest elements, then the sum decreases.

This is confusing.

Let me consider another approach.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove up to k elements, and Bob can flip up to x elements from the remaining.

I need to maximize the sum after Bob's flips.

This is equivalent to maximizing sum of all elements minus sum of removed elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

I need to maximize this expression.

This seems like I need to choose which k elements to remove such that the sum of removed elements plus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is minimized.

Wait, because sum of all elements is constant, so maximizing sum of all elements minus (sum of removed elements plus twice the sum of x largest remaining elements) is equivalent to minimizing sum of removed elements plus twice the sum of x largest remaining elements.

So, I need to minimize sum of removed elements plus twice the sum of x largest remaining elements.

That seems a bit more manageable.

So, I need to choose k elements to remove such that the sum of those k elements plus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is minimized.

This still seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider sorting the array in ascending order.

So, the array is sorted: a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

Now, Alice can choose to remove the smallest k elements, or some other combination.

But since the array is sorted, perhaps there is a pattern.

Let me consider that Alice removes the smallest k elements.

Then, the remaining elements are a_{k+1} to a_n.

Bob will flip the largest x of these remaining elements.

So, he will flip a_{n - x} to a_n to negative.

Wait, no.

He will flip the x largest remaining elements, which are a_{n - x} to a_n, assuming n - k >= x.

Wait, no.

If Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining elements are a_{k+1} to a_n.

Then, the x largest among these are a_{n - x} to a_n, assuming n - k >= x.

So, Bob will flip these to negative.

Therefore, the final sum would be sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} plus sum from -a_{n - x} to -a_n.

Wait, no.

Wait, Bob flips up to x elements.

He can choose to flip fewer than x elements.

But since he wants to minimize the sum, he will flip exactly x elements, assuming x is less than or equal to the number of remaining elements.

So, he will flip the x largest remaining elements.

So, in this case, if Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining elements are a_{k+1} to a_n.

Bob flips a_{n - x} to a_n to negative.

Therefore, the final sum would be sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} plus sum from -a_{n - x} to -a_n.

Wait, but a_{n - x} to a_n are the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, no, a_{n - x} to a_n are the x largest remaining elements.

Wait, indexing is a bit tricky.

Let me think again.

If the array is sorted in ascending order, a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an.

After Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining elements are a_{k+1} to a_n.

Among these, the x largest are a_{n - x} to a_n.

Wait, no.

If Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining are a_{k+1} to a_n.

The x largest among these are a_{n - x} to a_n, assuming that n - k >= x.

So, Bob will flip a_{n - x} to a_n to negative.

Wait, but a_{n - x} to a_n are the largest remaining elements.

So, the final sum would be sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} plus sum from -a_{n - x} to -a_n.

Wait, but a_{n - x} to a_n are being flipped to negative.

Yes.

So, the final sum would be sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} minus sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

Wait, yes.

So, this is sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} minus sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

This can be written as sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} - sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

This is equivalent to sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n} where the last x elements are subtracted twice.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1} minus sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

This is equal to sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n} minus 2 * sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

Because sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n} minus sum from a_{n - x} to a_n is sum from a_{k+1} to a_{n - x - 1}.

Wait, perhaps it's clearer to think in terms of the original sum.

Original sum S = sum from a1 to an.

After removing a1 to ak, sum becomes S - sum from a1 to ak.

Then, Bob flips the x largest remaining elements, which are a_{n - x} to a_n, to negative.

So, he subtracts 2 * sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

Therefore, final sum is S - sum from a1 to ak - 2 * sum from a_{n - x} to a_n.

Alice wants to choose which k elements to remove to maximize this expression.

So, she needs to choose which k elements to remove such that S - sum from removed elements - 2 * sum from the x largest remaining elements is maximized.

This seems tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern.

Let me consider that Alice can choose any k elements to remove.

But perhaps it's optimal for her to remove the smallest k elements.

But I need to verify if that's always the case.

Looking back at the example:

In the second test case:

n=4, k=1, x=1

Array: 3,1,2,4

Sorted: 1,2,3,4

If Alice removes the smallest element, which is 1, remaining elements are 2,3,4.

Bob flips the largest one, which is 4, to -4.

Sum: 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1

But in the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, according to the sample explanation, Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=3+1+2+(-4)=2.

Wait, so in this case, not removing any elements is better.

So, removing the smallest k elements isn't always the best strategy.

Hmm.

So, perhaps Alice should sometimes choose not to remove the smallest elements.

Wait, in this case, if Alice removes 1, then sum is 2 + 3 + (-4) = 1, which is less than 2.

So, not removing any elements is better.

Wait, but according to the sample, output is 2.

So, perhaps Alice should not remove any elements in this case.

Wait, but according to the sample explanation, Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob flips 4 to -4, sum=3+1+2+(-4)=2.

But if Alice removes 1, sum becomes 3+2+(-3)=2, which is the same.

Wait, 3+2+(-4)=1, which is less than 2.

Wait, perhaps removing 1 is worse.

Wait, perhaps Alice should remove the smallest elements only if it benefits her.

But in this case, not removing anything is better.

So, perhaps Alice should remove elements that are negative or something.

Wait, but all elements are positive in the sample.

Wait, no, the array elements are positive, as per the problem statement: 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000.

Wait, in the second test case, array is 3,1,2,4, all positive.

So, perhaps Alice should not remove any elements if all are positive.

But in the first test case, array is [1], k=1, x=1.

If Alice removes it, sum is 0, which is better than keeping it and having Bob flip it to -1.

So, in that case, removing is better.

So, perhaps if n <= k, Alice can remove all elements, sum=0, which might be better than allowing Bob to flip them.

But in the fifth test case, array is [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9], n=8, k=5, x=3.

Alice removes 5 elements, say the smallest 5: 2,3,3,3,5.

Remaining: 5,9,9.

Bob flips the largest 3: 9,9,5 to negative.

Sum: -9 + (-9) + (-5) = -23.

But according to the sample, it's -5.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the sample, Alice removes 9 and 9, sum=5+5+3+3+3+2+(-9)+(-9)=5+5+3+3+3+2-9-9=5+5+3+3+3+2-9-9.

Calculate: 5+5=10, +3=13, +3=16, +3=19, +2=21, -9=12, -9=3.

Wait, that's 3, but the sample output is -5.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample explanation.

Wait, in the fifth test case, it says:

"it is optimal for Alice to remove 9,9. Bob will then multiply 5,5,3 by -1. So the final sum is -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5."

Wait, that makes sense.

So, array is [5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9].

Alice removes two 9's.

Remaining: [5,5,3,3,3,2].

Bob flips the largest three elements, which are 5,5,3.

So, sum is -5-5-3+3+3+2=-5.

So, in this case, Alice removes the two largest elements, and Bob flips the three largest remaining elements.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, if Alice removes two 9's, sum is -5.

But if Alice removes something else, maybe she can get a higher sum.

Wait, perhaps removing two 9's is optimal.

Wait, but I need to think about what's the best sum Alice can achieve, considering Bob's moves.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider different possibilities.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to remove any k elements.

Then, Bob will flip up to x of the remaining elements.

To maximize the sum after Bob's flips, Alice should aim to keep as many large positive elements as possible while minimizing the impact of Bob flipping the largest remaining elements.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to consider the sum after removal and flipping.

Let me consider that the sum after removal is sum of the remaining elements.

Then, Bob flips up to x of them to negative, choosing the largest ones.

So, the final sum is sum of remaining elements minus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Which is sum of remaining elements - 2 * sum of top x remaining elements.

Alice wants to maximize this.

Which is equivalent to sum - 2 * sum of top x remaining elements.

Wait, sum of remaining elements is sum - sum of removed elements.

So, sum - sum of removed elements - 2 * sum of top x remaining elements.

Alice wants to maximize this.

So, she needs to choose which k elements to remove such that sum - sum of removed elements - 2 * sum of top x remaining elements is maximized.

This seems complex, but maybe I can iterate over the number of elements Alice removes.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice can choose to remove some of the largest elements to prevent Bob from flipping them.

But removing larger elements decreases the sum more.

So, there's a trade-off.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can choose to remove elements such that the sum of removed elements plus twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements is minimized.

Wait, earlier I thought about minimizing sum of removed elements plus twice the sum of x largest remaining elements to maximize the final sum.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum after operations is sum - sum of removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, to maximize this, Alice needs to choose removed elements such that sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining is maximized.

Which is equivalent to minimizing sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, I need to minimize sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

This seems manageable.

Let me think about how to compute this efficiently.

Let me sort the array in ascending order.

Then, the top x remaining elements are the largest x after removal.

So, if Alice removes the smallest k elements, the remaining are the largest n - k elements.

Then, the top x remaining are the largest x of these n - k elements.

Which are the largest x elements in the original array, assuming n - k >= x.

Wait, no.

After sorting, the largest n - k elements are a[k] to a[n-1].

Then, the top x of these are a[n - x] to a[n - 1].

So, sum of top x remaining is sum from a[n - x] to a[n - 1].

So, sum removed is sum from a[0] to a[k - 1].

So, sum removed + 2 * sum from a[n - x] to a[n - 1].

Alice needs to choose k elements to remove to minimize this expression.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum removed is sum from a[0] to a[k - 1].

Sum of top x remaining is sum from a[n - x] to a[n - 1].

Wait, but a[k] to a[n - 1] are the remaining elements.

So, sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining is sum from a[0] to a[k - 1] + 2 * sum from a[n - x] to a[n - 1].

Alice wants to minimize this sum.

Wait, but I need to maximize the final sum, which is sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, sum is constant, so maximizing sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining is equivalent to minimizing sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, Alice wants to choose k elements to remove to minimize sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

But sum of top x remaining is sum from a[n - x] to a[n - 1], assuming n - k >= x.

Wait, but if n - k < x, then Bob can flip all remaining elements.

Wait, I need to handle the case when n - k < x.

If n - k < x, then Bob can flip all remaining n - k elements, and still have to flip x elements, but since x >= n - k, he can flip all remaining elements.

Wait, no, Bob can flip up to x elements, so if n - k < x, he flips all n - k remaining elements.

So, in that case, sum of top x remaining is sum of all remaining elements, since he can flip all of them.

Wait, no, he can flip up to x elements, but if n - k < x, he flips all n - k elements.

So, in that case, sum of top x remaining is sum of all remaining elements, since x >= n - k.

Wait, no, if x >= n - k, Bob can flip all remaining n - k elements.

So, in that case, sum of top x remaining is sum of all remaining elements.

Therefore, sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining = sum removed + 2 * sum of remaining elements.

But sum of remaining elements is sum - sum removed.

So, sum removed + 2 * (sum - sum removed) = 2 * sum - sum removed.

Alice wants to minimize this.

Wait, but she wants to minimize 2 * sum - sum removed.

Wait, but 2 * sum is constant, so minimizing 2 * sum - sum removed is equivalent to maximizing sum removed.

So, in this case, Alice wants to maximize sum removed, which means removing the largest elements.

Wait, that seems counterintuitive.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, if n - k < x, then Bob can flip all n - k remaining elements.

So, sum after operations is sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of remaining elements.

Which is sum - sum removed - 2 * (sum - sum removed) = -sum - sum removed.

Alice wants to maximize this sum, which is -sum - sum removed.

To maximize -sum - sum removed, she needs to minimize sum removed.

Wait, but sum removed is sum of the removed elements.

So, to minimize sum removed, she should remove the smallest elements.

Wait, but earlier, when n - k >= x, she seems to have different strategy.

This is getting complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider different cases based on the relationship between k and x.

Case 1: n - k >= x.

In this case, Bob can flip up to x elements, which are the top x remaining elements.

So, sum after operations is sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Alice wants to maximize this, which is equivalent to minimizing sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Case 2: n - k < x.

In this case, Bob can flip all n - k remaining elements.

So, sum after operations is sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of remaining elements.

Which is sum - sum removed - 2 * (sum - sum removed) = -sum - sum removed.

Alice wants to maximize this, which is equivalent to minimizing sum removed.

So, in this case, she should remove the smallest elements.

Wait, but -sum - sum removed is to be maximized, which means minimizing sum removed, so remove the smallest elements.

Wait, but in the first case, she needs to minimize sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

This seems messy.

Maybe I need to find a way to compute the minimal sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining for all possible k removals.

This seems tricky, but perhaps I can iterate over possible k removals.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Alice can choose to remove any k elements, and for each possible k, compute sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining, and choose the one that minimizes this.

But computing this for all possible k is not efficient.

Maybe I can consider that after sorting, the sum removed is the sum of the first k elements, and sum of top x remaining is the sum of the last x elements.

Wait, yes.

If I sort the array in ascending order, then sum removed is sum of the first k elements, and sum of top x remaining is sum of the last x elements.

Wait, no, sum of top x remaining is sum of the last x elements among the remaining n - k elements.

So, if I remove the first k elements, the remaining are from index k to n - 1, and the top x are from n - x to n - 1.

Wait, assuming that k <= n - x.

Wait, if k <= n - x, then sum of top x remaining is sum from n - x to n - 1.

If k > n - x, then sum of top x remaining is sum from k to n - 1.

Wait, no.

Wait, if k <= n - x, then sum of top x remaining is sum from n - x to n - 1.

If k > n - x, meaning that n - k < x, then sum of top x remaining is sum from k to n - 1.

Wait, no.

If k <= n - x, then after removing k elements, remaining are from k to n - 1, and top x are from n - x to n - 1.

If k > n - x, meaning n - k < x, then remaining elements are from k to n - 1, but since n - k < x, Bob can flip all remaining elements.

So, sum of top x remaining is sum from k to n - 1.

Therefore, sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining is:

- If k <= n - x: sum from 0 to k - 1 + 2 * sum from n - x to n - 1

- If k > n - x: sum from 0 to k - 1 + 2 * sum from k to n - 1

Alice wants to choose k to minimize this expression.

So, I need to find the minimal value of:

- sum from 0 to k - 1 + 2 * sum from n - x to n - 1, for k <= n - x

- sum from 0 to k - 1 + 2 * sum from k to n - 1, for k > n - x

Then, the final answer is sum - minimal value among these.

Wait, no.

Wait, earlier I concluded that to maximize the final sum, Alice needs to minimize sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, the minimal value of sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining is what we need to subtract from the total sum to get the final sum.

Wait, no.

Wait, the final sum is sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

And we have that Alice wants to maximize sum - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Which is equivalent to minimizing sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Therefore, the minimal value of sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all possible k is what we need to subtract from the total sum to get the final sum.

Wait, but that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the total sum is S.

After removing k elements, sum of remaining elements is S - sum removed.

Then, Bob flips up to x of the remaining elements to negative, which reduces the sum by twice the sum of the x largest remaining elements.

Therefore, final sum is S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Alice wants to maximize this, so she needs to choose k to maximize S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Since S is constant, she needs to minimize sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, I need to find the minimal value of sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all possible k.

Given that, I can iterate over k from 0 to min(k, n), compute sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining for each k, and choose the minimal one.

Then, the final sum is S minus this minimal value.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum after operations is S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Alice wants to maximize this, so she chooses the k that maximizes S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Which is equivalent to minimizing sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, the minimal value of sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all possible k is what needs to be subtracted from S to get the final sum.

Wait, but that seems inverted.

Wait, sum after operations is S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Alice wants to maximize this, so she chooses k to minimize sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Therefore, the minimal sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all k is what needs to be subtracted from S to get the final sum.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Sum after operations = S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Alice wants to maximize this sum.

This is equivalent to maximizing S - (sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining).

Which is equivalent to minimizing sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Therefore, the minimal value of sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all possible k is what needs to be subtracted from S to get the final sum.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because sum after operations is S - sum removed - 2 * sum of top x remaining.

So, final sum is S - (sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining).

But Alice wants to maximize this, so she minimizes sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining.

Therefore, the final sum is S - minimal (sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all k).

Yes, that seems correct.

So, I need to compute the minimal value of sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining over all possible k, and subtract that from S to get the final sum.

But I need an efficient way to compute this minimal value.

Let me consider that the array is sorted in ascending order.

Then, sum removed is sum from 0 to k - 1.

Sum of top x remaining is:

- If k <= n - x, sum from n - x to n - 1

- If k > n - x, sum from k to n - 1

Therefore, for each k from 0 to min(k, n), I can compute sum removed + 2 * sum of top x remaining, and find the minimal value among these.

Then, the final sum is S - this minimal value.

This seems manageable.

I can precompute prefix sums to compute sum removed and sum of top x remaining efficiently.

Let me outline the steps.

1. Sort the array in ascending order.

2. Compute prefix sums: prefix[i] = sum of elements from 0 to i - 1.

3. Compute suffix sums: suffix[i] = sum of elements from i to n - 1.

4. For each k from 0 to min(k, n):

a. sum_removed = prefix[k]

b. if k <= n - x:

sum_top_x_remaining = suffix[n - x]

c. else:

sum_top_x_remaining = suffix[k]

d. total = sum_removed + 2 * sum_top_x_remaining

e. keep track of the minimal total

5. The final sum is S - minimal total.

This seems correct.

Let me verify with the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

1 1 1

1

Alice can remove the only element, sum removed = 1, sum of top x remaining = 0, total = 1 + 2*0 = 1

Alternatively, if she doesn't remove any, sum removed = 0, sum of top x remaining = 1, total = 0 + 2*1 = 2

Minimal total is 1, so final sum is S - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, which matches the sample output.

Sample Input 2:

4 1 1

3 1 2 4

Sorted: 1,2,3,4

prefix sums: [0,1,3,6]

suffix sums: [10,9,7,4,0]

For k=0:

sum_removed = 0

sum_top_x_remaining = suffix[4-1] = suffix[3] = 4

total = 0 + 2*4 = 8

For k=1:

sum_removed = 1

sum_top_x_remaining = suffix[4-1] = 4

total = 1 + 2*4 = 9

Minimal total is 8, so final sum is S - 8 = 10 - 8 = 2, which matches the sample.

Another sample:

n=8, k=5, x=3

Array:5,5,3,3,3,2,9,9

Sorted:2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9

prefix sums: [0,2,5,8,11,16,21,30,40]

suffix sums: [40,38,35,32,29,26,21,18,0]

For k=0:

sum_removed=0

sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[8-3]=suffix[5]=26

total=0 + 2*26=52

For k=1:

sum_removed=2

sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=26

total=2 + 2*26=54

For k=2:

sum_removed=5

sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=26

total=5 + 52=57

For k=3:

sum_removed=8

sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=26

total=8 + 52=60

For k=4:

sum_removed=11

sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=26

total=11 + 52=63

For k=5:

sum_removed=16

sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=26

total=16 + 52=68

Minimal total is 52, so final sum is S - 52 = 40 - 52 = -12, but the sample output is -5.

Wait, discrepancy here.

In the sample explanation, Alice removes two 9's, sum removed=18.

Sum remaining=22.

Bob flips the top x=3 elements: 5,5,3 to -5,-5,-3.

Sum=2+3+3+(-5)+(-5)+(-3)=2+3+3-5-5-3=6-13=-7, but sample output is -5.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample explanation, it says Alice removes two 9's, sum=18.

Remaining elements:2,3,3,3,5,5.

Bob flips the top x=3 elements:5,5,3 to -5,-5,-3.

Sum=2+3+3+(-5)+(-5)+(-3)=2+3+3-5-5-3=8-13=-5, which matches the sample.

But according to my earlier calculation, for k=5, sum_removed=16, which is less than 18.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the prefix sums.

Wait, sorted array:2,3,3,3,5,5,9,9

prefix[5]=2+3+3+3+5=16, which is sum of first 5 elements.

But if Alice removes two 9's, which are at positions 6 and 7, sum=9+9=18.

Wait, in my earlier approach, k=5 removes the first 5 elements:2,3,3,3,5, sum=16.

But according to the sample, removing the two 9's is better.

Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, in my approach, for k=5, sum_removed=16, sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=5+5=10, total=16 + 2*10=36.

For k=3, sum_removed=8, sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=10, total=8 + 20=28.

Wait, but according to the sample, removing two 9's (sum=18) and having sum_top_x_remaining=5+5+3=13, total=18 + 2*13=44.

Wait, but in my approach, for k=2, sum_removed=5, sum_top_x_remaining=10, total=5+20=25.

Wait, but according to the sample, removing two 9's gives total=18 + 2*13=44, which is higher than my k=5 total of 36.

Wait, but in my approach, the minimal total is 25 for k=2, leading to sum=S - 25=40-25=15, which doesn't match the sample.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when k >= n - x, sum_top_x_remaining is sum from k to n - 1.

Wait, earlier I thought that sum_top_x_remaining is sum from n - x to n - 1 when k <= n - x, else sum from k to n - 1.

Wait, in this case, n=8, x=3, k=5, n - x=5.

Since k <= n - x (5 <=5), sum_top_x_remaining=suffix[5]=10.

But according to the sample, when k=5, sum_removed=16, sum_top_x_remaining=10, total=16+20=36.

But in the sample, when Alice removes two 9's (k=2, sum_removed=9+9=18), sum_top_x_remaining=5+5+3=13, total=18+26=44.

So, the minimal total is 36, leading to sum=40-36=4, but sample output is -5.

Wait, this is not matching.

Perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when k <= n - x, sum_top_x_remaining is sum from n - x to n - 1, else sum from k to n - 1.

Wait, in the case when k <= n - x, sum_top_x_remaining is sum from n - x to n - 1.

When k > n - x, sum_top_x_remaining is sum from k to n - 1.

Wait, in the sample, n=8, x=3, n - x=5.

For k=5, which is equal to n - x, sum_top_x_remaining is sum from n - x=5 to n -1=7, which is 5+5+9+9=28.

Wait, no, n - x=5, suffix[5] is sum from 5 to 7:5+5+9+9=28.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, suffix[5]=26, which might be incorrect.
