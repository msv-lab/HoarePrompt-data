Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about determining whether it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color by performing a series of operations. Each operation allows me to select two squares of the same color and then color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. We have a grid with squares that are either white ('W') or black ('B'). I can perform operations where I pick two squares that are the same color, and then all squares in the rectangle defined by those two corners get set to that color.

The goal is to make the entire grid have squares of the same color, either all 'W' or all 'B', by performing any number of such operations.

I need to determine, for multiple test cases, whether this is possible.

Let's look at the constraints:

- Number of test cases, t, is up to 10^4.

- For each test case, grid size is n x m, where n and m can be up to 500.

- Total sum of n*m across all test cases is up to 3*10^5.

So, efficiency is important because with t=10^4 and n*m up to 500*500, a slow solution would not scale.

Now, I need to think about the operations allowed. When I select two squares of the same color and color the entire rectangle between them to that color, it's like propagating that color across the rectangle.

I need to find a way to propagate the color across the entire grid.

Let me consider some examples to understand better.

Example 1:

2 1

W

B

Output: NO

In this case, the grid has two rows and one column. The first square is 'W' and the second is 'B'. Since they are different, and I can't change them directly because any operation requires two squares of the same color, and the rectangles would only cover single squares in this case, I can't make them the same. Hence, NO.

Example 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

Output: YES

This is a more complex grid, and apparently, it's possible to make all squares the same color with some operations.

I need to find a general approach.

Let me think about connected components where squares are connected if they are adjacent and of the same color, but in this problem, the operation allows me to color entire rectangles based on two squares of the same color.

Wait, rectangles are defined by their corners, so it's not just about adjacency.

I need to find a way to see if I can propagate one color across the entire grid.

Let me consider that if there exists a path where I can select squares of the same color to expand the colored area step by step until the entire grid is covered.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I want to make the entire grid 'W'. I need to see if I can propagate 'W' across the grid using the operations.

Similarly for 'B'.

So, I need to check for both colors and see if it's possible for either.

But efficiency is a concern, so I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid, and if I can't find a way to propagate one color to cover the entire grid, then it's NO.

But I need a concrete approach.

I recall that in the first test case, it's impossible because there are only two squares, one 'W' and one 'B', and they are in different rows and columns, so no operation can change them.

In the second test case, it's possible, but I don't know why exactly.

Let me consider the properties of the operations.

When I select two squares of the same color, say 'W', and color the rectangle between them to 'W', I'm essentially setting all squares in that rectangle to 'W', overriding their previous colors.

So, if I have a 'W' in the grid, I can use it to set entire rectangles to 'W'.

Similarly for 'B'.

So, if I have a 'W' in the grid, I can try to spread 'W' to the entire grid.

Similarly for 'B'.

I need to see if I can cover the entire grid with 'W' or with 'B'.

Let me think about the grid as a graph where nodes are squares, and edges connect squares that can be used together in an operation to set a rectangle to the same color.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of rows and columns.

Let me consider that if I can make an entire row or column 'W', then I can use that to set larger rectangles to 'W'.

Similarly for 'B'.

But I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the first row.

If the first row is all 'W', then I can use any two 'W's in the first row to set the entire first row to 'W', which doesn't change it.

Then, I can use a 'W' from the first row and a 'W' from another row to set the rectangle between them to 'W', effectively setting a subrectangle to 'W'.

But I need to think recursively.

Maybe I can think in terms of connected components where squares are connected if they are in the same row or column and can be used together to set a larger rectangle to the same color.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the grid in terms of rows and columns separately.

Let me consider that if all rows are the same, then it's easy to make the entire grid that color.

Similarly, if all columns are the same.

But in general, that's not the case.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a grid where there exists a path, going only through squares of the same color, such that I can connect any two squares through a series of operations.

Then, perhaps, I can make the entire grid that color.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the grid forms a connected component for one color, meaning that I can reach any 'W' from any other 'W' through a path of 'W's, possibly through rows and columns.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look at the code provided and see what approach it's taking.

The function func() is defined to handle multiple test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and m.

- Read the grid into list a.

- Construct first_row and last_row by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.

- Check conditions:

- If the first row is all one color but the first and last rows are different, print 'NO'.

- If the first column is all one color but the first and last rows are different, print 'NO'.

- Else, print 'YES'.

Wait, actually, in the code:

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

Wait, that seems off.

Wait, a[-1] is the last row.

So, first_row is concatenating the first character of each row, but it's written as first_row += a[-1][0], which is the first character of the last row, repeated n times.

Wait, no, looking back:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

So, a[-1] is the last row.

So, first_row is being built by appending the first character of the last row, n times.

Similarly, last_row is being built by appending the last character of the last row, n times.

This seems incorrect.

I think there's a mistake in the code.

It should be building first_row by taking the first character of each row.

Wait, let's see:

for i in range(n):

a.append(input())

So, a is the list of rows.

Then, first_row += a[-1][0]

This takes the first character of the last row and appends it n times to first_row.

Similarly, last_row += a[-1][-1], appends the last character of the last row n times to last_row.

This doesn't make sense.

I think it's a mistake.

It should be collecting the first character of each row into first_row.

Similarly, the last character into last_row.

Wait, perhaps it's a way to flatten the grid into strings.

But it's confusing.

Let me try to understand what the code is doing.

Then, it checks:

if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:

print('NO')

elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

So, it's checking:

1. If the first row is uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'), but the first and last rows are different, then 'NO'.

2. Else, if the first column is uniform but the first and last rows are different, then 'NO'.

Else, 'YES'.

This seems like a heuristic, but I need to verify if this heuristic correctly solves the problem.

Let me test it with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

2 1

W

B

Output: NO

According to the code:

n=2, m=1

a = ['W', 'B']

first_row = a[-1][0] * n = 'B' * 2 = 'BB'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * n = 'B' * 2 = 'BB'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: a[0] = 'W', set('W') has one element.

a[0] != a[-1]: 'W' != 'B', so print 'NO'. Correct.

Sample Input 2:

6 6

WWWWBW

WBWWWW

BBBWWW

BWWWBB

WWBWBB

BBBWBW

Output: YES

According to the code:

n=6, m=6

a = ['WWWWBW', 'WBWWWW', 'BBBWWW', 'BWWWBB', 'WWBWBB', 'BBBWBW']

first_row = a[-1][0] * n = 'B' * 6 = 'BBBBBB'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * n = 'W' * 6 = 'WWWWWW'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: a[0] = 'WWWWBW', set('WWWWBW') = {'W', 'B'}, len=2, so skip.

Then, len(set(first_row)) == 1: 'BBBBBB', set('B'), len=1.

first_row != last_row: 'BBBBBB' != 'WWWWWW', so print 'NO'. Wait, but the correct output is 'YES'.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

The code would print 'NO' for this case, but the correct output is 'YES'.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Looking back:

first_row += a[-1][0]

last_row += a[-1][-1]

Wait, in Python, += on strings appends.

So, for n=6:

first_row = '' + a[-1][0] + a[-1][0] + ... 6 times.

So, first_row = 'B' * 6 = 'BBBBBB'

last_row = 'W' * 6 = 'WWWWWW'

Then, len(set(first_row)) == 1, since 'B', and first_row != last_row ('B' vs 'W'), so print 'NO'.

But the correct output is 'YES', so the code is wrong.

Another sample input:

1 1

W

Output: YES

n=1, m=1

a = ['W']

first_row = a[-1][0] * 1 = 'W'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * 1 = 'W'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: 'W', set('W'), len=1.

a[0] != a[-1]: 'W' == 'W', so False.

Then, len(set(first_row)) == 1: 'W', set('W'), len=1.

first_row != last_row: 'W' == 'W', False.

So, print 'YES'. Correct.

Another sample input:

2 2

BB

BB

Output: YES

n=2, m=2

a = ['BB', 'BB']

first_row = a[-1][0] * 2 = 'B' * 2 = 'BB'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * 2 = 'B' * 2 = 'BB'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: 'BB', set('B'), len=1.

a[0] != a[-1]: 'BB' == 'BB', False.

Then, len(set(first_row)) == 1: 'BB', set('B'), len=1.

first_row != last_row: 'BB' == 'BB', False.

So, print 'YES'. Correct.

Another sample input:

3 4

BWBW

WBWB

BWBW

Output: YES

n=3, m=4

a = ['BWBW', 'WBWB', 'BWBW']

first_row = a[-1][0] * 3 = 'B' * 3 = 'BBB'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * 3 = 'W' * 3 = 'WWW'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: 'BWBW', set('BW'), len=2, skip.

len(set(first_row)) == 1: 'BBB', set('B'), len=1.

first_row != last_row: 'BBB' != 'WWW', so print 'NO'. But correct output is 'YES'.

So, another discrepancy.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in this case, it's printing 'NO', but the correct output is 'YES'.

So, the code is wrong.

Another sample input:

4 2

BB

BB

WW

WW

Output: NO

n=4, m=2

a = ['BB', 'BB', 'WW', 'WW']

first_row = a[-1][0] * 4 = 'W' * 4 = 'WWWW'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * 4 = 'W' * 4 = 'WWWW'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: 'BB', set('B'), len=1.

a[0] != a[-1]: 'BB' != 'WW', True, so print 'NO'. Correct.

Another sample input:

4 4

WWBW

BBWB

WWBB

BBBB

Output: YES

n=4, m=4

a = ['WWBW', 'BBWB', 'WWBB', 'BBBB']

first_row = a[-1][0] * 4 = 'B' * 4 = 'BBBB'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * 4 = 'B' * 4 = 'BBBB'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: 'WWBW', set('WB'), len=2, skip.

len(set(first_row)) == 1: 'BBBB', set('B'), len=1.

first_row != last_row: 'BBBB' == 'BBBB', False.

So, print 'YES'. Correct.

Last sample input:

1 5

WBBWB

Output: NO

n=1, m=5

a = ['WBBWB']

first_row = a[-1][0] * 1 = 'W'

last_row = a[-1][-1] * 1 = 'B'

Check:

len(set(a[0])) == 1: 'WBBWB', set('WB'), len=2, skip.

len(set(first_row)) == 1: 'W', set('W'), len=1.

first_row != last_row: 'W' != 'B', so print 'NO'. Correct.

So, in summary, the code incorrectly outputs 'NO' for test cases where the correct output is 'YES', as seen in the second and fifth examples.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
