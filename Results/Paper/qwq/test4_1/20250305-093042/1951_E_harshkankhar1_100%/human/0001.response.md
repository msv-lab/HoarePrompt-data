Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of strings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], etc.

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string into substrings, none of which are palindromes. If such a partition exists, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition, and then the partition itself. If no such partition exists, I should output "NO".

Looking at the constraints, there can be up to 10^4 test cases, and each string can be up to 10^6 characters long, with a total sum of |s| across all test cases not exceeding 10^6. So, I need to make sure my solution is efficient, probably linear time per test case.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input:

sinktheyacht

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

Here, the entire string is not a palindrome, so it's a valid partition with only one part.

Example 2:

Input:

lllllllll

Output:

NO

In this case, the string consists of all 'l's, so any substring is a palindrome (since all characters are the same). Therefore, no valid partition exists.

Example 3:

Input:

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

Here, the string is partitioned into three substrings: "uw", "uow", and "ouwu". None of these are palindromes.

Another valid partition is mentioned: ["uw", "uo", "wou", "wu"], which also works.

So, the problem allows multiple valid partitions, and I just need to find one.

Now, I need to think about how to approach this.

First, I should check if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it's not, then I can simply take the whole string as one partition, and I'm done.

If the entire string is a palindrome, then I need to see if I can partition it into smaller substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, in the second test case, "lllllllll", every possible substring is a palindrome because all characters are the same. So, in such cases, I should output "NO".

So, the key seems to be checking if the string has any positions where the characters differ, which can help in creating non-palindromic substrings.

Let me think about this.

Suppose the string has at least two different characters. Can I always find a partition into non-palindromic substrings?

Consider a string like "ab". It's not a palindrome, so I can take it as one partition. If I have "aa", it's a palindrome, and any substring is a palindrome, so "NO". But "ab" works.

What about "aabc"? The whole string is not a palindrome, so "YES" with one partition.

If I have "aaabc", the whole string is not a palindrome, so again "YES" with one partition.

Wait, but in "aaabc", substrings like "aaa" are palindromes, but since I'm considering the entire string for one partition, it's fine as long as the entire partition is not a palindrome.

Wait, no. If I take the entire string "aaabc" as one partition, it's not a palindrome, so it's valid.

But if I have a string that is a palindrome and consists of repeated characters, like "aaaaa", then any partition must consist of substrings that are also "a", "aa", "aaa", etc., all of which are palindromes. So, "NO".

Similarly, if I have a string like "abba", which is a palindrome, and I try to partition it into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes. Wait, "ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome either. So, in this case, "YES" with two partitions.

Wait, but according to the problem, "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes because they don't read the same forwards and backwards. Wait, actually, "ab" reversed is "ba", which is different, so "ab" is not a palindrome. Similarly, "ba" reversed is "ab", which is different, so both are not palindromes.

So, in this case, I can partition "abba" into "ab" and "ba", both of which are not palindromes.

But according to the problem's definition, "ab" is not a palindrome because it's not equal to its reverse.

Wait, but in the example, "ab" is considered not a palindrome, which matches my understanding.

So, in "abba", I can partition it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes, so "YES".

But in "lllllllll", any partition will have substrings that are all 'l's, which are palindromes, so "NO".

So, perhaps the rule is: if the string is not a palindrome, I can take the whole string as one partition. If it is a palindrome, I need to see if I can partition it into smaller non-palindromic substrings.

But in some cases, even if the string is a palindrome, I might be able to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, like "abba" into "ab" and "ba".

But in "abba", the whole string is a palindrome, but I can partition it into two non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, if the string is a palindrome, I need to check if I can split it into smaller parts that are not palindromes.

But how do I do that efficiently?

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome, then it reads the same forwards and backwards.

If I have a string that is a palindrome and consists of more than one character, then its first and last characters are the same.

So, for example, in "abba", a[0] == a[3], and a[1] == a[2].

Now, if I try to partition it into "a" and "bb" and "a", but "a" is a palindrome, and "bb" is a palindrome.

Wait, but in the earlier thought, partitioning into "ab" and "ba" works.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to split the string such that no individual partition is a palindrome.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works because neither is a palindrome.

But in "aa", splitting into "a" and "a" doesn't work because "a" is a palindrome.

So, for "aa", it's "NO".

Similarly, for "aaa", splitting into "aa" and "a" has both parts as palindromes, so "NO".

But for "aabb", it's not a palindrome, so I can take the whole string as one partition, which is not a palindrome, so "YES".

Wait, but "aabb" is not a palindrome because reversing it gives "bbaa", which is different from "aabb".

So, "aabb" is not a palindrome, so one partition works.

What about "abab"? Let's check if it's a palindrome.

"abab" reversed is "baba", which is different from "abab", so it's not a palindrome. So, one partition works.

What if I have a string like "racecar", which is a palindrome.

I need to see if I can partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

"racecar" can be partitioned into "raceca" and "r". Is "raceca" a palindrome? Let's see: "raceca" reversed is "acecar", which is different, so "raceca" is not a palindrome. "r" is a palindrome. So, this partition doesn't work because one part is a palindrome.

Alternatively, partition into "rac" and "ecar". "rac" reversed is "car", which is different, so not a palindrome. "ecar" reversed is "race", which is different, so not a palindrome. So, this works.

So, "YES" with two partitions: "rac" and "ecar".

Another way could be "race" and "car". "race" reversed is "ecar", which is different, and "car" reversed is "rac", which is different. So, both are not palindromes.

So, in "racecar", which is a palindrome, I can partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, for any string that is a palindrome and has length greater than 1, I can always find a way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

But wait, what about "aaa"? It's a palindrome. If I partition it into "a" and "a", both are palindromes. So, no valid partition.

Similarly, "aaaa". Partitioning into "aa" and "aa", both are palindromes. So, no valid partition.

Wait, but "aaaa" is a palindrome. If I partition it into "aaa" and "a", both are palindromes. If I partition it into "aa" and "aa", both are palindromes. If I partition it into "a" and "aaa", both are palindromes. So, no valid partition.

So, it seems that for strings that are palindromes and consist of repeated identical characters, I can't find a valid partition.

Similarly, for strings like "abba", I can partition into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

For strings like "racecar", I can partition into "race" and "car", both not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromic strings, if they have at least two different characters, I can find a way to partition them into non-palindromic substrings.

But if they are palindromic and consist of only one unique character, like "aaa", then no valid partition exists.

Wait, but "abba" has repeated characters, yet I can partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, maybe the key is whether the string has at least two different characters.

If a palindromic string has at least two different characters, then I can find a way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

If a palindromic string has only one unique character, then no valid partition exists.

Is this always true?

Let's test with "abcba". It's a palindrome with different characters.

I can partition it into "abc" and "ba".

"abc" reversed is "cba", which is different, so not a palindrome.

"ba" reversed is "ab", which is different, so not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Another example: "madam". It's a palindrome.

Partition into "mad" and "am". "mad" reversed is "dam", which is different, and "am" reversed is "ma", which is different. So, both are not palindromes.

Thus, "YES".

Now, consider "aaa". It's a palindrome with only one unique character.

Any partition will have substrings that are all "a"s, which are palindromes.

So, "NO".

Similarly, "aaaa" is "NO".

So, it seems that for palindromic strings:

- If they contain only one unique character, "NO".

- If they contain at least two different characters, "YES", and I can partition them into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but is this always the case?

Let me think about a palindromic string with at least two different characters.

Take "abccba". It's a palindrome.

Partition into "abc" and "cba".

"abc" reversed is "cba", which is different, so not a palindrome.

"cba" reversed is "abc", which is different, so not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Another example: "abcdcba".

Partition into "abcd" and "cba".

"abcd" reversed is "dcba", which is different.

"cba" reversed is "abc", which is different.

So, both are not palindromes.

Seems consistent.

Now, what if I have a palindromic string with only two characters, like "aa"?

It's a palindrome with only one unique character, so "NO".

What about "aba"?

It's a palindrome with two different characters.

Partition into "ab" and "a". "ab" reversed is "ba", which is different, and "a" is a palindrome.

So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, partition into "a" and "ba". "a" is a palindrome, "ba" reversed is "ab", which is different.

So, again, one part is a palindrome.

So, in this case, is there any way to partition "aba" into non-palindromic substrings?

Let's see.

Possible partitions:

1. ["aba"] -> "aba" is a palindrome, invalid.

2. ["a", "ba"] -> "a" is a palindrome, "ba" is not.

3. ["ab", "a"] -> "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

4. ["a", "b", "a"] -> all "a"s are palindromes.

So, in this case, no valid partition exists.

But according to my earlier hypothesis, since "aba" is a palindrome with at least two different characters, it should have a valid partition.

But in reality, it doesn't.

So, my hypothesis is incorrect.

So, perhaps there are palindromic strings with at least two different characters that still don't have a valid partition.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I check if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it's not, then I can take the whole string as one partition.

If the entire string is a palindrome, then I need to see if I can split it into smaller parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But from the earlier example, "aba" is a palindrome with at least two different characters, but no valid partition exists.

Wait, but in "aba", every possible partition has at least one palindrome.

So, perhaps the rule is: if the string is not a palindrome, then "YES" with one partition.

If the string is a palindrome, then check if there exists at least one character that is not at the center (for odd-length strings) or check some other property.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the string has all characters identical.

If a palindromic string has all characters identical, then "NO".

Otherwise, "YES".

But in "aba", all characters are not identical, but still "NO".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps for palindromic strings of length greater than 1, if they have at least one character that is different from the first character and it's not at the center, then "YES".

Wait, let's think about "abba".

It's a palindrome, and it has characters different from the first character, and I can partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

In "aba", the only character different from 'a' is 'b', and it's at the center.

So, perhaps, if in a palindromic string, there exists a character that is different from the first character and it's not at the center, then "YES".

Otherwise, "NO".

Let's test this.

In "abba", it's a palindrome, the second character 'b' is different from the first 'a', and it's not at the center, so "YES".

In "aba", the second character 'b' is different from 'a', but it's at the center, so "NO".

In "abcba", it's a palindrome, the third character 'c' is different from 'a', and it's at the center, so "NO".

Wait, but earlier I thought "abcba" could be partitioned into "abc" and "ba", but "ba" is not a palindrome, and "abc" is not a palindrome.

Wait, is "abc" a palindrome? "abc" reversed is "cba", which is different, so not a palindrome.

"ba" reversed is "ab", which is different, so not a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's "YES".

But according to my new hypothesis, since 'c' is different from 'a' and it's at the center, it should be "NO", but actually, it's "YES".

So, my hypothesis is still incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for a palindromic string, if there exists a position i (0 < i < n-1) such that s[i] != s[0], then I can partition the string into two parts: from start to i+1 and from i+1 to end, and check if both parts are not palindromes.

In "abba", let's say i=1, s[1]='b' == s[0]='a'? No, so i=1 is a candidate.

Then, partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:4] = "ba". Both are not palindromes.

So, "YES".

In "aba", s[1]='b' != s[0]='a', so i=1 is a candidate.

Partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:3] = "a". "ab" is not a palindrome, but "a" is a palindrome. So, invalid.

In "abcba", s[1]='b' != s[0]='a', so i=1 is a candidate.

Partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:5] = "cba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome. So, "YES".

In "abccba", s[1]='b' != s[0]='a', so i=1 is a candidate.

Partition into s[0:2] = "ab" and s[2:6] = "ccba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "ccba" is not a palindrome. So, "YES".

In "aaa", s[1]='a' == s[0]='a', so no such i exists. So, "NO".

In "aaabaaa", it's a palindrome (assuming it is), s[1]='a' == s[0], s[2]='a' == s[0], s[3]='b' != s[0], so i=3 is a candidate.

Partition into s[0:4] = "aaab" and s[4:7] = "aaa". "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome. So, invalid.

Wait, but according to this approach, it should be "YES", but in this case, one part is a palindrome.

So, perhaps this approach isn't always correct.

Wait, maybe I need to choose a different i.

In "aaabaaa", let's try i=3: partition into "aaab" and "aaa". "aaab" is not a palindrome, "aaa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Try i=4: s[4]='a' != s[0]? No, s[4]='a' == s[0].

So, only i=3 satisfies s[i] != s[0].

Hence, according to this approach, it's "NO", but maybe there's another way to partition it.

For example, partition into "aaa" and "baaa". "aaa" is a palindrome, invalid.

"aaaba" and "aa". "aaaba" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome. Invalid.

"aaab" and "aaa". Same as before.

So, in this case, no valid partition exists.

Hence, "NO".

So, perhaps this approach works.

Let me summarize:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with one partition.

- If the entire string is a palindrome:

- Try to find an index i (1 <= i < n) such that s[i] != s[0].

- If such an i exists, try partitioning into s[0 to i+1] and s[i+1 to n].

- Check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both are not palindromes, output "YES" with two partitions.

- If not, output "NO".

- If no such i exists, output "NO".

Wait, but in "aaabaaa", such an i exists (i=3), but partitioning into "aaab" and "aaa" results in one palindrome. So, it's "NO".

So, perhaps I need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

But in "abba", partitioning into "abb" and "a" would make "a" a palindrome, which is invalid.

Wait, but earlier I partitioned "abba" into "ab" and "ba", which works.

So, perhaps choosing i such that s[i] != s[0], and then partitioning into s[0 to i+1] and s[i+1 to n], and checking if both parts are not palindromes.

In "abba", i=1 (s[1]='b' != s[0]='a'), partition into s[0:2]="ab" and s[2:4]="ba", both not palindromes.

In "aaabaaa", i=3 (s[3]='b' != s[0]='a'), partition into s[0:4]="aaab" and s[4:7]="aaa", but "aaa" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's invalid.

Maybe I need to choose a different i.

In "aaabaaa", is there another i where s[i] != s[0]? Only i=3.

So, in this case, no valid partition exists.

Hence, "NO".

Similarly, in "aba", i=1 (s[1]='b' != s[0]='a'), partition into s[0:2]="ab" and s[2:3]="a", but "a" is a palindrome.

So, "NO".

In "abcba", i=1 (s[1]='b' != s[0]='a'), partition into s[0:2]="ab" and s[2:5]="cba", both not palindromes.

So, "YES".

So, this seems to be a consistent approach.

Hence, I can implement this logic.

Now, let's see the provided program and see if it follows this logic.

Looking at the code:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_2()

def func_1(s) -> bool:

return s == s[::-1]

def func_2():

s = input()

(n, x) = (len(s), -1)

if func_1(s[0:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(s)

return

for i in range(1, n):

if s[i] != s[0]:

x = i

break

if x == -1:

print('NO')

return

if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])

elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])

So, it seems to follow the logic I described.

First, it checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If it's not, it outputs "YES" with one partition.

If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first index i where s[i] != s[0].

If no such i exists, it outputs "NO".

If such an i exists, it tries to partition the string into s[0 to x+1] and s[x+1 to n].

It checks if the second part s[x+1:] is not a palindrome. If it is not, it outputs the partition.

If the second part is a palindrome, it checks if x == 1 or x == n // 2. If so, it outputs "NO". Otherwise, it partitions into s[0 to x+2] and s[x+2 to n].

Wait, this seems a bit different from my initial approach.

In my approach, I only considered partitioning into s[0 to i+1] and s[i+1 to n], and checking if both parts are not palindromes.

But in this code, if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome, it outputs the partition.

But in my earlier example, "aaabaaa", s[0 to 4]="aaab", s[4 to 7]="aaa", but "aaa" is a palindrome, so it shouldn't be a valid partition.

But according to this code, it would check if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome, and if it is not, output the partition.

But in "aaabaaa", s[x+1:]="aaa" is a palindrome, so it wouldn't output the partition.

Wait, but in the code, it only checks if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome. If it is not, it outputs the partition.

If s[x+1:] is a palindrome, it checks if x == 1 or x == n // 2.

If x == 1 or x == n // 2, it outputs "NO".

Otherwise, it partitions into s[0 to x+2] and s[x+2 to n].

So, in "aaabaaa", x=3, s[x+1:]="aaa" is a palindrome, x !=1 and x != n//2 (n=7, n//2=3), so it doesn't output "NO".

Then, it outputs "YES", prints 2, and prints s[0 to x+2]="aaaba" and s[x+2 to n]="aa".

But "aaaba" is not a palindrome, and "aa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Wait, but according to the code, it prints them anyway.

Wait, no, in the code, it only checks if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome.

If it is not, it prints the partition.

If it is a palindrome, and x !=1 and x !=n//2, it prints another partition.

But in "aaabaaa", s[x+1:]="aaa" is a palindrome, x=3, n//2=3, so it goes to "NO".

Hence, it outputs "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but in the code, it has:

if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])

elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])

So, in "aaabaaa", x=3, s[x+1:]="aaa", which is a palindrome, so func_1(s[x+1:]) == True.

Then, x == n // 2 (since n=7, n//2=3), so it outputs "NO", which is correct.

In "abba", x=1, s[x+1:]="ba", which is not a palindrome, so it outputs "YES" with partitions "abb" and "a", but "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Wait, but according to the code, it would print them anyway.

Wait, but in "abba", x=1, s[x+1:]="ba", which is not a palindrome.

So, it outputs "YES", 2, and "abb" and "a".

But "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Wait, but according to the problem, as long as each part is not a palindrome, it's valid.

But in this case, "a" is a palindrome, so it's invalid.

So, why does the code output it?

Oh, because the code only checks if s[x+1:] is not a palindrome, but it doesn't check if s[:x+1] is not a palindrome.

Wait, in "abba", s[:x+1]=s[0:2]="ab", which is not a palindrome, and s[2:4]="ba", which is not a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abba", s[2:4]="ba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "ba" reversed is "ab", which is different, so it's not a palindrome.

Hence, it's a valid partition.

Wait, in my earlier thought, I had mistakenly thought that "abb" and "a", but according to the code, it prints s[:x+1]="abb" and s[x+1:]="a".

But "a" is a palindrome, which makes it invalid.

Wait, but in "abba", x=1, s[:x+1]=s[0:2]="ab", and s[2:4]="ba".

Both "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes, so it's valid.

Wait, but according to the code, in "abba", x=1, s[x+1:]="ba", which is not a palindrome, so it outputs "YES", 2, "ab" and "ba", which is valid.

So, it's correct in this case.

Wait, but in "abba", s[:x+1]=s[0:2]="ab", which is not a palindrome, and s[2:4]="ba", which is not a palindrome.

Hence, it's a valid partition.

So, the code seems correct.

In "aba", x=1, s[x+1:]="a", which is a palindrome.

x == n//2 (n=3, n//2=1), so it outputs "NO", which is correct.

In "abcba", x=1, s[x+1:]="cba", which is not a palindrome, so it outputs "YES", 2, "abc" and "ba", both not palindromes.

Hence, correct.

In "aaabaaa", x=3, s[x+1:]="aaa", which is a palindrome, and x == n//2 (n=7, n//2=3), so it outputs "NO", which is correct.

So, it seems the code correctly handles these cases.

Now, is there any case where this approach fails?

Let me think about a string like "abacaba".

It's a palindrome (check: "abacaba" reversed is "abacaba"), so it's a palindrome.

Find x where s[x] != 'a', which is x=1 (s[1]='b').

Then, s[x+1:]="acaba", which is a palindrome.

x == n//2? n=7, n//2=3, x=1 !=3.

So, it goes to the else clause: print "YES", 2, s[:x+2]="abac" and s[x+2:]="aba".

Now, check if both are not palindromes.

"abac" reversed is "caba", which is different, so not a palindrome.

"aba" reversed is "aba", which is a palindrome.

So, this partition is invalid.

But according to the code, it prints them anyway.

Hence, it's incorrect.

Wait, but according to the problem, if you output any valid partition, it's acceptable.

But in this case, it's outputting an invalid partition.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "print "YES" if there exists a partition of s into some substrings, each of which is not a palindrome."

So, it must print "YES" only if such a partition exists.

If it prints "YES" with a partition that has palindromic substrings, it's incorrect.

Hence, in this case, "abacaba", it's outputting "YES" with a partition ["abac", "aba"], where "aba" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, the answer is **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. We need to ensure that our solution is correct and efficient, considering the constraints provided.

### Approach

1. **Check if the entire string is not a palindrome:** If the entire string is not a palindrome, we can take it as a single partition.
2. **If the string is a palindrome:** 
   - Find the first index where the character is different from the first character.
   - Try partitioning the string at this index and check if both parts are not palindromes.
   - If partitioning results in at least one palindrome, further checks are needed to see if another partitioning method can be used.

### Solution Code

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_string(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Check if the whole string is not a palindrome
    if not is_palindrome(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    # Find the first character that is different from the first character
    x = -1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:

### Explanation

1. **is_palindrome Function:** This helper function checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
2. **partition_string Function:** This function handles the logic for each test case.
   - It first checks if the entire string is not a palindrome. If so, it prints 'YES' followed by the string itself as a single partition.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it finds the first character that differs from the first character.
   - It attempts to partition the string at this point and checks if both resulting substrings are not palindromes.
   - If the substring after the partition point is a palindrome, it checks additional conditions to see if another partitioning approach can yield valid non-palindromic substrings.
   - If no valid partitioning is found, it prints 'NO'.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of partitioning the string while adhering to the constraints provided.
