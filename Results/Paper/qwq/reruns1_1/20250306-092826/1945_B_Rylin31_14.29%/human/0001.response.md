Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals: one every 'a' minutes and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the timings work. Let's consider the launch times for each installation.

For the first installation, it launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

Similarly, the second installation launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible from its launch time up to m minutes after its launch time, inclusive. So, a firework launched at time t is visible from t to t + m.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible in the sky.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the visibility periods of the fireworks and see how they overlap.

But since the numbers can be up to 10^18, I can't simulate this over time; it's too big.

I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any given time.

Let me consider the launch times and their visibility periods.

For the first installation, the visibility periods are [a, a + m], [2a, 2a + m], [3a, 3a + m], and so on.

Similarly, for the second installation: [b, b + m], [2b, 2b + m], [3b, 3b + m], etc.

I need to find a time t where the number of intervals that include t is maximized.

This sounds like a classic problem of finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

In general, for a set of intervals, to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals, you can sort the start and end times and iterate through them.

But again, since the numbers are large, I need a mathematical approach rather than iterating through each time.

Let me think about the possible scenarios.

First, consider that fireworks from one installation don't overlap with each other if m < a.

Wait, actually, if m < a, then no two fireworks from the same installation can be in the sky at the same time because the next launch is after a minutes, and m is less than that.

Similarly, if m >= a, then there can be overlapping fireworks from the same installation.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If m < a, then no two fireworks from the same installation overlap because the next launch is after a minutes, which is more than m, so the previous firework would have faded away before the next one is launched.

If m >= a, then the next firework is launched before the previous one fades, so they overlap.

Similarly for the other installation.

So, for each installation, if m < a, then at most one firework is in the sky at any time.

If m >= a, then the number of overlapping fireworks from that installation is floor(m / a) + 1.

Wait, not exactly. Let's think.

If m >= a, then the number of overlapping fireworks from the same installation would be floor(m / a) + 1.

For example, if a = 3 and m = 5, then at time t = 3, fireworks from t=3 to t=8.

At t=6, fireworks from t=6 to t=11.

These two overlap from t=6 to t=8.

So, overlapping count is 2.

Similarly, from t=3 to t=6, only one firework is visible.

From t=6 to t=8, two fireworks are visible.

From t=8 to t=11, one firework is visible.

So, maximum overlapping is 2.

Which is floor(5/3) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Similarly, for b, if m >= b, the maximum overlapping from that installation is floor(m / b) + 1.

If m < a, then only one firework is visible from the first installation at any time.

Similarly for the second.

Now, I need to consider the overlapping between the two installations.

So, the total maximum overlapping would be the sum of the maximum overlapping from each installation, but I need to consider if there are times when their fireworks launch times coincide, which could increase the overlapping.

Wait, but if they launch at the same time, then the fireworks from both installations are visible together.

So, the total maximum overlapping would be the sum of the maximum overlapping from each installation, plus any additional overlapping due to simultaneous launches.

But, if they launch at the same time, it's just that the fireworks from both installations are visible together, but I already accounted for the maximum overlapping in each installation separately.

Wait, no.

Actually, if they launch at the same time, then at that time, the fireworks from both installations are visible together, so I need to add an extra count if there is a time when both launch simultaneously.

But, I need to think carefully.

Let me consider the maximum possible overlapping.

Case 1: m < a and m < b.

Then, only one firework from each installation can be visible at any time, so the maximum overlapping is 2.

Case 2: m >= a and m < b.

Then, from the first installation, up to floor(m / a) + 1 fireworks can be overlapping, and from the second installation, only one, so total is floor(m / a) + 1 + 1.

Similarly for m >= b and m < a.

Case 3: m >= a and m >= b.

Then, from the first installation, floor(m / a) + 1, and from the second, floor(m / b) + 1.

But, there might be times when fireworks from both installations are launched simultaneously, which could increase the overlapping.

Wait, but even if they launch simultaneously, the overlapping is just the sum of their individual maximum overlapping minus any overlapping counts that are double-counted.

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I calculate the maximum overlapping for each installation separately, and then find the time when the sum of their overlapping is maximum.

To do this, I need to find a time t where the number of active fireworks from the first installation plus the number of active fireworks from the second installation is maximized.

Given that the fireworks from each installation have regular launch intervals, I can think in terms of the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b to find when their launch times coincide.

But maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the time when the first installation launches a firework at time a, and the second at time b.

I need to find a time t where the number of active fireworks from both installations is maximized.

One approach is to find the time t where the number of active fireworks from the first installation is maximized, and similarly for the second installation, and then see if these can coincide.

But I'm not sure.

Let me look for a mathematical formula or pattern.

I recall that in similar problems involving periodic events, the maximum overlapping can be found by considering the density of events over time.

In this case, the density of fireworks in the sky from each installation.

For the first installation, the density is (m + 1)/a, since each firework lasts m + 1 minutes, and they are launched every a minutes.

Similarly, for the second installation, it's (m + 1)/b.

But density might not directly give the maximum overlapping.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of fireworks active per unit time.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to find a general formula.

Let me consider that for the first installation, the number of active fireworks at any time t is the number of launches before t whose fireworks are still visible at t.

That is, the number of k such that k*a <= t < k*a + m + 1.

Similarly for the second installation.

So, for the first installation, the number of active fireworks at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a).

Similarly for the second installation.

Then, the total number of active fireworks at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b).

I need to maximize this sum.

But calculating this for large t and large a, b, m is not feasible directly.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the maximum overlapping occurs when t is such that it's within the visibility period of as many fireworks as possible from both installations.

One idea is to choose t such that it's as close as possible to multiple launch times from both installations.

But again, this is vague.

Let me consider specific examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example from the problem:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

So, m + 1 = 5 minutes visibility.

First installation launches at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, etc.

Second installation launches at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, etc.

Each firework is visible for 5 minutes after launch.

So, for the first installation:

Firework launched at 6 is visible from 6 to 10.

Firework launched at 12 is visible from 12 to 16.

Firework launched at 18 is visible from 18 to 22.

And so on.

Similarly, for the second installation:

Firework launched at 7 is visible from 7 to 11.

Firework launched at 14 is visible from 14 to 18.

Firework launched at 21 is visible from 21 to 25.

And so on.

Now, let's see at time t=7:

Fireworks visible: from first installation, the one launched at 6 (visible until 10), and from second installation, the one launched at 7 (visible until 11). So, two fireworks.

At t=14:

Fireworks from first installation: launched at 12 (visible until 16), and from second installation: launched at 14 (visible until 18). So, two fireworks.

At t=21:

Fireworks from first installation: launched at 18 (visible until 22), from second installation: launched at 21 (visible until 25). So, two fireworks.

It seems like at these times, only two fireworks are visible.

But according to the problem, the answer is 2, which matches.

Now, let's look at the third example:

a = 7, b = 8, m = 56

So, m + 1 = 57 minutes visibility.

First installation launches at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, etc.

Second installation launches at 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, etc.

Each firework is visible for 57 minutes after launch.

So, for the first installation:

Firework launched at 7 is visible from 7 to 63.

Firework launched at 14 is visible from 14 to 70.

Firework launched at 21 is visible from 21 to 77.

And so on.

Similarly, for the second installation:

Firework launched at 8 is visible from 8 to 64.

Firework launched at 16 is visible from 16 to 72.

Firework launched at 24 is visible from 24 to 80.

And so on.

Now, let's see at time t=56:

Fireworks from first installation:

Launched at 7 (visible until 63), at 14 (until 70), at 21 (until 77), at 28 (until 84), at 35 (until 91), at 42 (until 98), at 49 (until 105), at 56 (until 112).

So, 8 fireworks from first installation.

Fireworks from second installation:

Launched at 8 (visible until 64), at 16 (until 72), at 24 (until 80), at 32 (until 88), at 40 (until 96), at 48 (until 104), at 56 (until 112).

So, 7 fireworks from second installation.

Total fireworks at t=56: 8 + 7 = 15.

But according to the problem, the answer is 17.

Hmm, maybe I missed some.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some fireworks are visible from both installations if their launch times coincide.

But in this case, at t=56, both installations launch a firework at t=56, so the firework from first installation launched at 56 is visible until t=112, and the firework from second installation launched at 56 is visible until t=112.

So, at t=56, we have 8 from first installation and 7 from second installation, totaling 15.

But the problem says 17.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the launch times are inclusive, and m is inclusive.

Wait, the problem says "visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., from x to x + m inclusive."

So, in this case, m + 1 = 57 minutes, so from x to x + m = x + 56.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the number of fireworks.

Let me recalculate.

For first installation:

Fireworks launched at 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56.

At t=56:

Fireworks launched at 7 are visible until 7 + 56 = 63.

Similarly, launched at 14 until 70, and so on, up to launched at 56 until 112.

So, how many of these intervals include t=56?

Any firework launched at time k*a where k*a >= t - m = 56 - 56 = 0, and k*a <= t = 56.

So, k*a <= 56.

Since a=7, k<=56/7=8.

So, k from 1 to 8, so 8 fireworks from first installation.

Similarly, for second installation, b=8, m=56.

Fireworks launched at 8,16,24,32,40,48,56.

At t=56, fireworks launched at 8,16,24,32,40,48,56 are visible, since 56 - 56 = 0, and k*b <=56.

56/8=7, so k from 1 to7, so 7 fireworks.

Total 8 +7=15.

But the problem says 17.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some fireworks launched at times that are multiples of both a and b are counted twice.

In this case, at t=56, both installations launch a firework, so the firework from first installation and second installation at t=56 are both visible, adding two to the total.

But in my previous count, I already added them separately.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the firework launched at t=56 from both installations are both visible at t=56, so I need to count both.

Wait, but in my previous count, I did count both separately, so total should be 8 +7=15.

But the problem says 17.

I must be missing something.

Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the time when t = LCM(a,b), but in this case, LCM(7,8)=56, which is the time considered.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a larger t.

Wait, perhaps at t=112.

Let's see.

At t=112:

Fireworks from first installation:

Launched at 7 (visible until 63), 14 (70), 21 (77), 28 (84), 35 (91), 42 (98), 49 (105), 56 (112), 63 (119), etc.

So, fireworks launched at 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63 are visible at t=112.

Wait, no.

At t=112, fireworks launched at 7 are visible until 63, which is before 112, so not visible.

Similarly, launched at 14 until 70, not visible at 112.

Launched at 21 until 77, not visible at 112.

Launched at 28 until 84, not visible at 112.

Launched at 35 until 91, not visible at 112.

Launched at 42 until 98, not visible at 112.

Launched at 49 until 105, not visible at 112.

Launched at 56 until 112, visible at t=112.

Launched at 63 until 119, visible at t=112.

So, from first installation, only the ones launched at 56 and 63 are visible at t=112.

Similarly, for second installation:

Launched at 8 (visible until 64), 16 (72), 24 (80), 32 (88), 40 (96), 48 (104), 56 (112), 64 (120), etc.

So, at t=112, fireworks launched at 56 and 64 are visible.

Total fireworks at t=112: 2 from first installation + 2 from second installation = 4.

But according to the problem, the answer is 17, which is much higher.

So, my previous approach is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the general case.

I need to find a time t where the number of active fireworks from both installations is maximized.

An active firework from the first installation is one where t - m <= k*a <= t for some integer k >=1.

Similarly for the second installation.

So, for the first installation, the number of active fireworks at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a).

Similarly for the second installation.

So, total active fireworks at time t is:

floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)

I need to maximize this expression.

But calculating this for large t and large a, b, m is not feasible directly.

I need to find a mathematical way to maximize this.

Let me consider that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) is equal to floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a).

This is equal to the number of multiples of a in the interval [t - m, t].

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize the sum of these two.

Let me consider that t is such that it's close to multiples of a and b.

In other words, t is such that t mod a is small, and t mod b is small.

Ideally, t is a common multiple of a and b.

Let me consider t being the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

But in the third example, LCM(7,8)=56, but as I saw earlier, at t=56, total fireworks are 8 +7=15, but the problem says 17.

So, perhaps I need to choose a different t.

Wait, maybe t is not exactly the LCM, but some multiple of it.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to choose t such that it's as close as possible to multiples of both a and b.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose t such that t is the smallest number greater than or equal to m that is a multiple of both a and b.

But in the third example, m=56, and LCM(7,8)=56, so t=56.

But as per the problem, at t=112, perhaps more fireworks are visible.

Wait, at t=112, from first installation: launched at 56 and 63.

From second installation: launched at 56 and 64.

Total 4, but the problem says 17.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time, not necessarily at a specific t.

Wait, but in the third example, the answer is 17, which is higher than what I calculated.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Let me consider that for each installation, the number of active fireworks at any time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a).

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) + floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b).

Let me consider that floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) is equal to ceil((t - (t - m -1)) / a) = ceil((m +1)/a).

Similarly for b.

Wait, no.

Actually, floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a) is equal to floor(t / a) - floor((t - m -1)/a).

This can be equal to floor((t - (t - m -1))/a) + something.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the number of active fireworks from the first installation is floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a).

Similarly for the second installation.

So, total active fireworks is floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a) + floor((t + m)/b) - floor((t -1)/b).

I need to maximize this sum.

But I need a way to find t that maximizes this.

This seems tricky.

Let me look for a pattern or formula.

I recall that in similar problems, the maximum number of overlapping intervals can be found by considering the density of events.

But perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for each installation, the maximum number of overlapping fireworks is floor(m / a) + 1.

Similarly for b.

Then, the total maximum overlapping would be floor(m / a) + 1 + floor(m / b) +1.

But in the first example, a=6, b=7, m=4.

floor(4/6)+1 + floor(4/7)+1 = 1 +1 +0 +1 = 3, but the answer is 2.

So, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if m < a and m < b, then only one firework from each installation can be visible at a time, so maximum is 2.

If m >= a and m < b, then floor(m / a) +1 +1.

Similarly for m >= b and m < a.

If m >= a and m >= b, then floor(m / a) +1 + floor(m / b) +1.

But in the third example, a=7, b=8, m=56.

floor(56/7)+1 + floor(56/8)+1 = 8 +1 +7 +1 =17, which matches the problem's answer.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated at t=56, I got 8 +7=15, but according to this, it's 17.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier calculation.

Wait, floor(56 /7 ) +1 =8 +1=9.

Floor(56 /8 ) +1=7 +1=8.

Total 9 +8=17.

But earlier, at t=56, I thought only 8 from first installation and 7 from second installation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a).

At t=56, floor((56 +56)/7) - floor((56 -1)/7) = floor(112/7) - floor(55/7) = 16 - 7 =9.

Similarly, floor((56 +56)/8) - floor((55)/8) = floor(112/8) - floor(55/8) =14 -6=8.

Total 9 +8=17.

So, perhaps the general formula is floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a) + floor((t + m)/b) - floor((t -1)/b).

And to maximize this, I need to choose t such that this sum is maximized.

But it seems that choosing t such that t is a multiple of LCM(a,b) maximizes this.

In this case, t=56, which is LCM(7,8)=56.

So, perhaps choosing t=m +1, or t=LCM(a,b), whichever is larger.

Wait, in this case, m +1=57, but LCM=56.

But according to the formula, at t=56, it's 17.

At t=57, floor((57 +56)/7) - floor(56/7) + floor((57 +56)/8) - floor(56/8) = floor(113/7)=16 - floor(56/7)=8 + floor(113/8)=14 - floor(56/8)=7.

So, 16 -8 +14 -7=8 +7=15.

Which is less than at t=56.

So, t=56 is better.

Similarly, at t=112, floor((112 +56)/7)=floor(168/7)=24 - floor(111/7)=15=24-15=9.

Floor((112 +56)/8)=floor(168/8)=21 - floor(111/8)=13=21-13=8.

Total 9 +8=17.

Same as at t=56.

So, it seems that choosing t to be a multiple of LCM(a,b) gives the maximum.

Let me test this with the first example.

a=6, b=7, m=4.

LCM(6,7)=42.

At t=42:

floor((42 +4)/6) - floor(41/6) + floor((42 +4)/7) - floor(41/7)= floor(46/6)=7 - floor(41/6)=6=1 + floor(46/7)=6 - floor(41/7)=5=1.

Total 1 +1=2.

Which matches the answer.

At t=0: floor(4/6)=0 - floor(-1/6)=0 + floor(4/7)=0 - floor(-1/7)=0=0.

At t=1: floor(5/6)=0 - floor(0)=0 + floor(5/7)=0 - floor(0)=0=0.

At t=6: floor(10/6)=1 - floor(5/6)=0=1 + floor(10/7)=1 - floor(5/7)=0=1.

Total 2.

At t=7: floor(11/6)=1 - floor(6/6)=1=0 + floor(11/7)=1 - floor(6/7)=0=1.

Total 1.

At t=12: floor(16/6)=2 - floor(11/6)=1=1 + floor(16/7)=2 - floor(11/7)=1=1.

Total 2.

At t=14: floor(18/6)=3 - floor(13/6)=2=1 + floor(18/7)=2 - floor(13/7)=1=1.

Total 2.

At t=42: floor(46/6)=7 - floor(41/6)=6=1 + floor(46/7)=6 - floor(41/7)=5=1.

Total 2.

So, indeed, the maximum is 2.

So, in this case, choosing t=LCM(a,b) gives the maximum overlapping.

Similarly, in the third example, choosing t=LCM(a,b)=56 gives the maximum overlapping of 17.

So, perhaps the general formula is to choose t=LCM(a,b), and then calculate floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a) + floor((t + m)/b) - floor((t -1)/b).

But in the first example, t=LCM(a,b)=42 gives 2, which is the maximum.

In the third example, t=LCM(a,b)=56 gives 17, which matches the problem's answer.

So, perhaps this is the way to go.

Now, to compute LCM(a,b), it's (a*b)/GCD(a,b).

But since a and b can be up to 10^18, and t can be up to a*b/gcd(a,b), which can be up to 10^36, which is too big to handle directly.

I need a way to compute floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a) + floor((t + m)/b) - floor((t -1)/b) without computing t directly.

But since t=LCM(a,b), and LCM(a,b)=a*b/gcd(a,b), I can compute it if I can compute gcd(a,b).

In Python, I can compute gcd using math.gcd.

But even then, t can be up to 10^36, which is manageable in Python, but I need to make sure that the operations are efficient.

But since t can be up to 10^36, and m up to 10^18, t + m can be up to 10^36, which is fine in Python.

So, perhaps I can implement this formula directly.

But let's see.

In the first example, a=6, b=7, m=4.

LCM(a,b)=42.

floor((42 +4)/6)=floor(46/6)=7.

floor((42 -1)/6)=floor(41/6)=6.

Difference:7-6=1.

Similarly, floor((42 +4)/7)=floor(46/7)=6.

floor((42 -1)/7)=floor(41/7)=5.

Difference:6-5=1.

Total:1+1=2.

Which matches.

In the third example, a=7, b=8, m=56.

LCM=56.

floor((56 +56)/7)=floor(112/7)=16.

floor((56 -1)/7)=floor(55/7)=7.

Difference:16-7=9.

floor((56 +56)/8)=floor(112/8)=14.

floor((55)/8)=6.

Difference:14-6=8.

Total:9+8=17.

Which matches.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Now, let's see if there are any edge cases.

Consider a=1, b=1, m=1.

Then, LCM(a,b)=1.

floor((1 +1)/1)=2.

floor((1 -1)/1)=0.

Difference:2-0=2.

Similarly for b.

Total:2+2=4.

Which matches the last example in the problem.

Another example: a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000.

Then, LCM=1.

floor((1 +1000000000000000000)/1)=1000000000000000001.

floor((1 -1)/1)=0.

Difference:1000000000000000001 -0=1000000000000000001.

Similarly for b.

Total:1000000000000000001 +1000000000000000001=2000000000000000002.

Which matches the last example in the problem.

So, this seems correct.

Now, let's see if there are any cases where this formula doesn't hold.

Suppose a=2, b=3, m=0.

Then, m +1=1.

LCM(a,b)=6.

At t=6:

floor((6 +0)/2)=3 - floor(5/2)=2=1.

floor((6 +0)/3)=2 - floor(5/3)=1=1.

Total:1+1=2.

But, at t=2:

Firework from a launched at t=2 is visible from 2 to2.

Firework from b launched at t=3 is visible from3 to3.

At t=2, only the first firework is visible.

At t=3, only the second firework is visible.

At t=6, same as above.

So, maximum is 1, but the formula gives 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, m +1=1, so visibility is from t to t +0.

So, only at t.

So, at t=2: firework from a at t=2.

At t=3: firework from b at t=3.

At t=6: firework from a at t=6.

So, maximum is 1.

But according to the formula, it's 2.

So, in this case, the formula is giving a higher value than actual.

What's going on?

Wait, perhaps the formula is not always correct.

Wait, in this case, m=0, m +1=1.

Then, floor((t + m)/a)=floor((6 +0)/2)=3.

floor((t -1)/a)=floor(5/2)=2.

Difference:1.

Similarly for b: floor((6 +0)/3)=2, floor(5/3)=1.

Difference:1.

Total:1 +1=2.

But in reality, only one firework is visible at any time.

So, the formula is overcounting.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when m=0, the visibility is only at t.

So, at t=6, only the firework launched at t=6 is visible, not the one launched at t=6 from both installations.

Wait, but in this case, only one installation launches at t=6, which is a=2, launched at t=6.

b=3, launched at t=3, t=6 is outside its visibility.

Wait, m=0, so visibility is only at launch time.

So, at t=6, only the firework from a is visible.

At t=3, only the firework from b is visible.

At t=2, only the firework from a is visible.

So, maximum is 1.

But according to the formula, it's 2.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect when m=0.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me check the general formula again.

The number of active fireworks from the first installation at time t is floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a).

Similarly for the second installation.

In this case, m=0, so floor((t +0)/a) - floor((t -1)/a).

Which is floor(t/a) - floor((t -1)/a).

This is equal to 1 if t is a multiple of a, else 0.

Similarly for b.

So, at t=6, which is a multiple of a=2, but not of b=3.

So, floor(6/2) - floor(5/2)=3 -2=1.

Floor(6/3) - floor(5/3)=2 -1=1.

Total:1 +1=2.

But in reality, only one firework is visible at t=6, from a.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when m=0, the visibility is only at t, so if both installations launch at t, then both are visible.

But in this case, only a launches at t=6, b launches at t=3.

So, only one is visible.

But according to the formula, it's counting both.

Wait, perhaps the formula is counting potential overlaps, but in reality, if m=0, only one firework can be visible at a time unless both launch at the same time.

In this case, only a launches at t=6, so only one is visible.

So, perhaps the formula needs adjustment.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when m=0, the visibility is only at t, so if both installations launch at t, then both are visible.

Otherwise, only one.

So, in general, the maximum overlapping is the number of installations that launch at t.

In this case, only a launches at t=6, so maximum overlapping is 1.

But according to the formula, it's 2.

So, the formula is overcounting in this case.

Perhaps I need to adjust the formula to account for m=0.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct when m >=1, but incorrect when m=0.

Wait, in the first example, m=4, which is >=1, and it matches.

In the third example, m=56, which is >=1, and it matches.

In this test case, m=0, and it doesn't match.

So, perhaps I need to handle m=0 separately.

When m=0, the maximum overlapping is the number of installations that launch at the same time.

Which is 1 if a and b do not have a common launch time, or 2 if they do.

Wait, but in this case, a=2, b=3, which are co-prime, so no common launch time.

Hence, maximum overlapping is 1.

But according to the formula, it's 2.

So, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted for m=0.

Let me think of another way.

Perhaps, for m >=1, the formula holds.

For m=0, the maximum overlapping is the number of installations that launch at the same time.

Which is 1 if a and b are co-prime, or more if they have a common multiple.

Wait, no.

If a and b have a common multiple, then at that time, both installations launch, so both are visible.

So, maximum overlapping is 2.

But in the case above, a=2, b=3, which are co-prime, so they only launch at t=0, which is not considered, I think.

Wait, t starts from 0 or 1?

In the first example, t starts from 0.

But in the problem statement, it seems t starts from 0.

So, at t=0, if a installation launches at t=0, but probably not, as per problem description, installations start launching after a, b minutes.

Wait, the first launch is at a, b minutes.

So, first installation launches at a, 2a, 3a, etc.

Similarly for b.

So, t starts from a, b, etc.

But in the problem, t is from 0 to infinity.

But fireworks are launched starting from a, b, etc.

So, at t=0, no fireworks are visible.

At t=a, firework from first installation is visible from t=a to t=a +m.

Similarly for b.

So, for m=0, visibility is only at t=a for first installation, and t=b for second installation.

If a != b, then maximum overlapping is 1.

If a == b, then maximum overlapping is 2.

So, in the case where a != b and m=0, maximum overlapping is 1.

In the case where a == b and m=0, maximum overlapping is 2.

But in the formula, it's counting floor((t + m)/a) - floor((t -1)/a) + floor((t + m)/b) - floor((t -1)/b).

When m=0, this becomes floor(t/a) - floor((t -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t -1)/b).

Which is 1 if t is a multiple of a, plus 1 if t is a multiple of b.

So, if a != b, and t is a multiple of both, which is LCM(a,b), then it's 2.

Otherwise, 1.

But in reality, if a != b, and m=0, maximum overlapping is 1.

Unless a == b, in which case, it's 2.

So, perhaps the formula needs to account for a == b.

Wait, in the formula, if a == b, then LCM(a,b)=a, and at t=a, both installations launch, so both are visible at t=a.

Hence, maximum overlapping is 2.

If a != b, then at t=LCM(a,b), both launch, but since m=0, only at t=LCM(a,b), both are visible.

So, maximum overlapping is 2.

But earlier, in the example with a=2, b=3, m=0, according to reality, only one firework is visible at any time, because their launch times don't coincide.

Wait, but LCM(2,3)=6, which is a multiple of both, so at t=6, both launch, so both are visible.

Hence, maximum overlapping is 2.

But earlier, I thought only one is visible, but actually, at t=6, both are visible since m=0 at t=6.

Wait, but m=0 means visibility only at t=6 for both.

So, at t=6, both are visible.

Hence, maximum overlapping is 2.

So, perhaps the formula is correct even for m=0.

Wait, in this case, a=2, b=3, m=0.

At t=6, both are visible.

Hence, maximum overlapping is 2.

But earlier, I thought only one is visible, but actually, both are visible at t=6.

Hence, the formula is correct.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, according to the formula, at t=6, it's 2, which matches.

So, perhaps my earlier confusion was incorrect.

Hence, the formula seems correct.

Another test case: a=1, b=1, m=0.

Then, LCM(a,b)=1.

At t=1:

floor((1 +0)/1)=1 - floor(0/1)=0=1.

Similarly for b:1 -0=1.

Total:2.

In reality, both installations launch at t=1, and m=0, so both are visible at t=1.

Hence, maximum overlapping is 2.

So, the formula
