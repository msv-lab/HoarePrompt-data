Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are two players playing a card game with a 32-card deck. Each card has a suit and a rank. The suits are clubs (C), diamonds (D), hearts (H), and spades (S), and the ranks are from '2' to '9'. So, each card is represented by a two-character string, like '8H' for 8 of Hearts.

At the beginning of the game, one suit is chosen as the trump suit. The rules for beating a card are a bit specific here. If both cards have the same suit, the one with the higher rank beats the other. But if a trump card is played, it can beat any non-trump card, regardless of its rank. Also, trump cards can only be beaten by higher-ranked trump cards.

So, in the game, there are n rounds, and in each round, the first player plays a card, and the second player has to beat it with one of their cards. After that, both cards are moved to the discard pile. Now, after n rounds, the discard pile has 2n cards, and these cards are shuffled. My task is to reconstruct a possible sequence of n rounds based on these discarded cards.

Given that, the input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, I get n (the number of rounds), the trump suit, and then a list of 2n unique cards.

My goal is to output n lines, each containing two cards: the first card played by the first player and the card used by the second player to beat it. If there's no possible way to reconstruct such a sequence, I should output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to understand the constraints and the rules thoroughly.

- There are 32 cards in total: 4 suits, each with 8 ranks ('2' to '9').

- One suit is chosen as trump.

- In each round:

- Player 1 plays a card.

- Player 2 must play a card that beats it, based on the rules.

- Both cards are discarded.

- After n rounds, there are 2n cards in the discard pile, shuffled.

- I need to reconstruct a possible sequence of n rounds from these 2n cards.

Rules for beating a card:

1. If both cards are of the same suit:

- Higher rank beats lower rank.

2. If the first card is a trump card:

- It can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

- It can only be beaten by a higher-ranked trump card.

3. If the first card is not a trump card:

- A trump card can beat it, regardless of rank.

Wait, point 2 seems a bit unclear. Let's make sure:

- A trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

- To beat a trump card, you need a higher-ranked trump card.

- Non-trump cards can only beat other non-trump cards of the same suit if they have a higher rank.

Got it.

Now, in the discard pile, I have 2n cards, shuffled. I need to pair them up in such a way that in each pair, the second card beats the first card, according to the rules above.

Moreover, I need to make sure that the sequence of pairs makes sense as a sequence of rounds. That is, in each round, Player 1 plays a card, and Player 2 plays a card that beats it, and this continues for n rounds.

But since the cards are shuffled, I need to find any possible way to pair them up that satisfies these conditions.

Let me think about how to do this.

First, I should categorize the cards based on whether they are trumps or not.

Let's denote:

- T: trump suit.

- N: non-trump suits.

So, cards are either T cards (trumps) or N cards (non-trumps).

Now, according to the rules:

- A T card can beat any N card.

- A T card can only be beaten by a higher T card.

- An N card can only beat another N card of the same suit if it has a higher rank.

- An N card can be beaten by any T card.

So, in terms of pairing:

- If Player 1 plays a T card, Player 2 must play a higher T card to beat it.

- If Player 1 plays an N card, Player 2 can either play a higher N card of the same suit or any T card.

Wait, no.

Wait, according to the problem:

- Player 2 must play a card that beats it, based on the rules.

So, for Player 1 playing a T card:

- Player 2 can only beat it with a higher T card.

For Player 1 playing an N card:

- Player 2 can beat it either with a higher card of the same suit or with any T card.

Got it.

So, in the discard pile, I have a mix of T and N cards.

I need to pair them up such that in each pair, the second card beats the first card according to the rules above.

Moreover, I need to make sure that all pairs are valid based on these beating rules.

Now, to make this manageable, perhaps I can group the cards by suit and rank, and then try to pair them accordingly.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

2. For non-trump suits, handle each suit separately, since beats are only within the same suit.

3. For trumps, handle them separately, since they have their own beating rules.

4. Try to pair non-trump cards first, making sure that in each pair, the second card beats the first within its suit.

5. Then, use the trump cards to beat other non-trump cards if necessary.

Wait, perhaps I need a better strategy.

Let me think differently.

Since each pair must have the second card beating the first, and given the specific rules, maybe I can model this as a graph where cards are nodes, and directed edges indicate that one card can beat another.

Then, the problem reduces to finding a set of n disjoint pairs where each pair has a directed edge from the first card to the second.

This sounds similar to finding a matching in a graph.

But this might be too time-consuming to implement, especially since n can be up to 16, leading to up to 32 cards.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider the following plan:

- First, separate the cards into trumps and non-trumps.

- For non-trump suits, sort the cards by suit and rank.

- For trumps, sort them by rank.

- Then, try to pair non-trump cards within their suits, making sure that the second card beats the first within the suit.

- Any remaining non-trump cards must be paired with trumps, since a trump can beat any non-trump.

- Finally, use the remaining trumps to pair among themselves, with higher trumps beating lower trumps.

Does this make sense?

Let me try to outline the steps more clearly.

Step 1: Categorize cards into trumps and non-trumps.

Step 2: For each non-trump suit, sort the cards by rank.

Step 3: Try to pair within each non-trump suit, matching lower ranks to higher ranks.

Step 4: For any unpaired non-trump cards, pair them with trumps.

Step 5: Pair the remaining trumps among themselves, with higher trumps beating lower trumps.

Step 6: If at any point it's not possible to pair all cards according to the rules, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Let me consider an example to see if this works.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

3

S

3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S

So, n=3, trump=S.

Cards: 3C, 9S, 4C, 6D, 3S, 7S.

Separate into trumps and non-trumps:

Trumps: 9S, 3S, 7S.

Non-trumps: 3C, 4C, 6D.

Now, handle non-trumps by suit.

Suit C: 3C, 4C.

Suit D: 6D.

For suit C, pair 3C with 4C, since 4 beats 3.

For suit D, only one card, 6D, so it needs to be paired with a trump.

Choose the smallest available trump, say 3S, to beat 6D.

Now, remaining trumps: 7S, 9S.

Pair 7S with 9S, since 9 beats 7.

So, the pairs would be:

3C 4C

6D 3S

7S 9S

Which matches the first output in the example.

Good.

Another test case:

2

C

3S 5D 9S 6H

So, n=2, trump=C.

Cards: 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H.

Separate into trumps and non-trumps:

Trumps: none, since trump is C and none of the cards are C.

Non-trumps: 3S, 5D, 9S, 6H.

Now, try to pair within suits.

Suit S: 3S, 9S. Pair 3S with 9S.

Suit D: 5D.

Suit H: 6H.

Both have only one card, so cannot pair within suits.

Need trumps to pair them, but there are no trumps.

So, impossible.

Which matches the second output in the example: IMPOSSIBLE.

Good.

Another test case:

1

H

6C 5D

n=1, trump=H.

Cards: 6C, 5D.

Both are non-trumps.

Try to pair within suits:

Suit C: 6C (single)

Suit D: 5D (single)

Cannot pair within suits.

Need to pair with trumps, but no trumps available.

So, impossible.

Matches the third output: IMPOSSIBLE.

Good.

Next test case:

1

S

7S 3S

n=1, trump=S.

Cards: 7S, 3S.

Both are trumps.

Pair 3S with 7S, since 7 beats 3.

Output:

3S 7S

Matches the fourth output.

Good.

Another test case:

1

H

9S 9H

n=1, trump=H.

Cards: 9S, 9H.

One is trump (9H), one is non-trump (9S).

Player 1 plays 9S (non-trump), Player 2 can play 9H (trump) to beat it.

So, pair 9S with 9H.

Output:

9S 9H

Matches the fifth output.

Good.

Next test case:

1

S

9S 9H

n=1, trump=S.

Cards: 9S, 9H.

Player 1 plays 9H (trump), Player 2 needs to play a higher trump to beat it.

But the only other card is 9S (non-trump), which cannot beat 9H.

Alternatively, Player 1 plays 9S (non-trump), Player 2 plays 9H (trump) to beat it.

So, pair 9S with 9H.

Output:

9S 9H

Same as previous.

Wait, but in the example output, it's:

3S 7S

9S 9H

9H 9S

Wait, for test case 6:

Input:

1

S

7S 3S

Output:

3S 7S

And test case 7:

1

H

9S 9H

Output:

9S 9H

And test case 8:

1

S

9S 9H

Output:

9H 9S

Wait, seems inconsistent.

Wait, in test case 6:

n=1, trump=S.

Cards: 3S, 7S.

Pair 3S with 7S.

In test case 7:

n=1, trump=H.

Cards: 9S, 9H.

Pair 9S with 9H.

In test case 8:

n=1, trump=S.

Cards: 9S, 9H.

Pair 9H with 9S.

Wait, in test case 8, trump is S, so 9S is a trump, and 9H is a trump.

Wait, no, trump is S, so 9S is trump, 9H is trump.

Wait, but in the output, it's 9H 9S, which is okay, since 9S beats 9H, because both are trumps and S is the trump suit.

Wait, but ranks are the same, both are '9'.

Wait, hold on, in trumps, higher rank beats lower rank, but both are '9', so equal rank.

Wait, perhaps equal rank trumps cannot beat each other.

But in the example, it's accepted.

Wait, maybe in the code, it's allowed.

I need to check the code.

Wait, perhaps the code allows pairing equal rank trumps.

But according to the rules, a trump can only beat a lower-ranked trump.

So, equal rank trumps cannot beat each other.

But in the example, it's accepted.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows equal ranks to be considered as valid beats.

I need to check the problem statement.

Looking back at the problem, it says:

"a trump card can beat any non-trump card, regardless of the rank of the cards, for example, if the trump suit is clubs ('C'), then 3C can beat 9D. Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher rank."

So, for trumps, only higher-ranked trumps can beat them.

Equal-ranked trumps cannot beat each other.

Therefore, pairing 9H with 9S should be invalid when trump is S.

But in the example, it's accepted.

Wait, perhaps in the code, it's allowed.

I need to see what the code does.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

So, in this code, for trumps, it sorts them and pairs them in order.

For non-trump suits, it pairs the lowest with the highest within the suit.

Wait, no, for non-trump suits, if there are two cards, it pairs them in sorted order.

For example, if suits[suit] is not None, it pairs the existing rank with the new rank.

Wait, let's see:

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for each card:

rank, suit = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

So, for non-trump suits, if suits[suit] is None, it sets suits[suit] to rank.

If suits[suit] is not None, it pairs the existing rank with the new rank, and sets suits[suit] to None.

Then, for any remaining suits[suit] that are not None, it pairs them with a trump card, if available.

Finally, it pairs the remaining trumps among themselves.

Now, in test case 8:

n=1, trump=S.

Cards: 9S, 9H.

trump=S.

trumps: '9', since 9S is trump.

non-trump: 9H is not trump, but suit is H.

So, suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': '9', 'S': None}

Then, for suit H, rank='9', and trumps=['9'].

So, it appends '9H 9S' to answers.

Then, trumps is empty, so no more pairing.

Then, print '9H 9S'.

But according to the rules, 9S can beat 9H, since both are trumps and S is the trump suit, and 9S has the same rank as 9H.

But according to the rules, only higher-ranked trumps can beat lower-ranked trumps.

Since both have the same rank, neither can beat the other.

So, this seems incorrect.

But in the example, it's accepted.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows equal ranks to beat each other.

Or perhaps it's a mistake in the example.

I need to clarify this.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Note that trump cards can be beaten only by the trump cards of higher rank."

So, higher rank, meaning strictly higher.

Equal rank cannot beat.

Therefore, pairing 9H with 9S should be invalid.

But in the example, it's accepted.

Wait, perhaps the example is incorrect.

Or perhaps the code is incorrect.

I need to decide whether to consider equal ranks as valid beats or not.

Given the problem statement is clear that only higher-ranked trumps can beat lower-ranked trumps, equal ranks cannot beat each other.

Therefore, the code is incorrect in allowing equal-ranked trumps to be paired.

In this case, for n=1, trump=S, cards 9S, 9H.

9H is a trump, 9S is a trump.

Since both are trumps of same rank, neither can beat the other.

So, it should be "IMPOSSIBLE".

But in the example, it's accepted.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows equal ranks to beat each other.

I need to check the problem statement again.

Looking back, it says "higher rank", which typically means strictly higher.

So, probably, equal ranks cannot beat each other.

Therefore, the example might be incorrect.

But since the example accepts it, perhaps the problem allows equal ranks to beat each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect.

I need to make a decision.

I think I should follow the problem statement strictly.

Given that, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but the example accepts it.

Perhaps the problem allows equal ranks to beat each other.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

To be safe, I'll assume that equal ranks cannot beat each other, and adjust the code accordingly.

Now, looking back at the code.

In func_1():

- It reads n, trump, and the list of cards.

- It separates trumps and non-trumps.

- For non-trump suits, it pairs the lowest and highest ranks within the suit.

- For remaining non-trump cards, it pairs them with trumps.

- Then, pairs the remaining trumps among themselves.

But there are issues:

1. Pairing equal-ranked trumps as valid beats, which is incorrect.

2. It sorts trumps and pairs them in order, but it should only pair higher trumps with lower trumps.

3. It pairs non-trump cards within the same suit by sorting ranks, but it should ensure that the second card beats the first within the suit.

4. It doesn't handle cases where it's impossible to pair all cards correctly.

Let me think about how to fix this.

First, for non-trump suits:

- Within each suit, sort the ranks in ascending order.

- Then, pair the lowest with the highest, the next lowest with the next highest, and so on.

- This ensures that in each pair, the second card beats the first within the suit.

- If there's an odd number of cards in a suit, it's impossible, but since total cards are even, and distributed across suits, need to ensure that pairings are possible.

For trumps:

- Sort the trumps by rank in ascending order.

- Pair the lowest with the highest, the next lowest with the next highest, and so on.

- Ensure that in each pair, the second card beats the first (higher rank).

For pairing non-trump cards with trumps:

- Any non-trump card can be paired with a trump card, since trump beats any non-trump.

- So, if there are unpaired non-trump cards, they can be paired with trumps.

- Need to use the smallest available trump to beat each non-trump card.

- So, sort the non-trump cards by some order, and pair them with the smallest available trumps.

Wait, but trumps can only beat non-trumps, and trumps can only be beaten by higher trumps.

So, in pairing non-trump with trump, the trump beats the non-trump.

No problem there.

But need to ensure that after pairing non-trumps with trumps, the remaining trumps can be paired among themselves with higher trumps beating lower trumps.

Now, let's think about the steps in detail.

Step 1: Separate cards into trumps and non-trumps.

Step 2: For each non-trump suit, sort the cards by rank.

Step 3: Pair within each non-trump suit, matching lower ranks with higher ranks.

- For example, if a suit has ranks ['2', '3', '4', '5'], pair '2' with '5' and '3' with '4'.

Step 4: Collect any unpaired non-trump cards (if the number of cards in a suit is odd, which shouldn't happen since total cards are even and distributed).

Step 5: Sort the trumps by rank.

Step 6: Pair the remaining trumps, matching lower ranks with higher ranks.

Step 7: Pair any remaining non-trump cards with trumps, using the smallest available trump to beat each non-trump card.

Step 8: If at any point there aren't enough trumps to pair with the remaining non-trump cards, or if there are trumps left that cannot be paired among themselves, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Now, in the code provided, it seems to somewhat follow these steps, but with some flaws.

Specific issues in the code:

- It pairs trumps among themselves by sorting and popping from the end, which might not ensure that higher trumps beat lower trumps correctly.

- It allows pairing equal-ranked trumps, which is invalid.

- It doesn't handle cases where there are an odd number of cards in a non-trump suit.

Wait, but since total cards are even, and distributed across suits, and trumps, need to ensure that the pairing is possible.

Wait, but in reality, since each suit may have an odd number of cards, need to handle that.

But given that total cards are even, and distributed across suits, need to ensure that pairings are possible.

Wait, perhaps better to group cards by suit, handle non-trump suits separately, and handle trumps separately.

Now, considering the above, perhaps a better approach is:

- For each non-trump suit, pair the cards within the suit, ensuring that the second card beats the first (higher rank).

- Collect all unpaired non-trump cards (if any).

- Pair these unpaired non-trump cards with trumps.

- Pair the remaining trumps among themselves, ensuring that the second card beats the first (higher rank).

- If at any point it's not possible to make such pairings, output "IMPOSSIBLE".

Now, in the code, it seems to attempt this, but with some mistakes.

Specifically, in handling trumps:

- It sorts trumps and pairs them in order, but needs to ensure that in each pair, the second card beats the first, meaning higher rank.

- So, perhaps sort trumps in ascending order, and pair the lowest with the highest, the next lowest with the next highest, and so on.

Similarly, for non-trump suits:

- Sort the ranks in ascending order.

- Pair the lowest with the highest, the next lowest with the next highest, and so on.

This ensures that in each pair, the second card beats the first.

Now, in the code, it does something similar, but not exactly.

In the code, for non-trump suits:

- It keeps track of the rank in suits[suit].

- If suits[suit] is None, it sets it to the rank.

- If suits[suit] is not None, it pairs the existing rank with the new rank, sorts them, and adds to answers, and sets suits[suit] to None.

This is somewhat pairing cards within the suit, but it's not clear if it's pairing lower with higher correctly.

Moreover, for trumps, it sorts them and pairs them in order, but again, need to ensure that in each pair, the second card beats the first.

Now, to fix the code, I need to ensure that:

- When pairing within non-trump suits, lower ranks are paired with higher ranks.

- When pairing trumps among themselves, lower ranks are paired with higher ranks.

- When pairing non-trump cards with trumps, any trump can beat any non-trump.

- Ensure that all pairings are valid based on the rules.

- Handle cases where it's impossible to make such pairings correctly.

Looking back at the code:

def func_1():

input()

trump = input()

trumps = []

answers = []

suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

for card in input().split():

(rank, suit) = card

if suit == trump:

trumps.append(rank)

elif suits[suit] is not None:

answers.append(' '.join([x + suit for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))

suits[suit] = None

else:

suits[suit] = rank

for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

if rank is None:

continue

if trumps != []:

answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

else:

print('IMPOSSIBLE')

return

trumps = sorted(trumps)

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

for answer in answers:

print(answer)

So, issues:

1. When pairing within non-trump suits, it sorts the ranks and pairs them, but it should ensure that the second card beats the first.

- In Python, sorted() sorts in ascending order, so '2' before '3', etc.

- So, '2C 3C' would have '3C' beating '2C', which is correct.

- But in the code, it's joining them with a space, but it's not clear if it's pairing the lower with the higher correctly.

2. When pairing trumps among themselves, it sorts them and pairs them by popping from the end.

- But sorted(trumps) sorts in ascending order.

- Then, trumps.pop() pops from the end, which would be the highest trump.

- Then, trumps.pop() again would be the next highest.

- So, pairing higher with higher, which might not be correct.

Wait, in the code, it's:

while trumps != []:

print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')

So, if trumps = ['2', '3', '4', '5'], sorted ascendingly.

trumps.pop() would be '5', then '4', then '3', then '2'.

So, it's pairing '5S 4S', then '3S 2S', which is higher beating lower.

Which is correct.

So, in this case, it's correct.

But, it allows pairing equal-ranked trumps, which is invalid.

Wait, if there's an even number of trumps, it's fine.

But if there's an odd number, it would fail, but total cards are even, so should be fine.

Wait, total cards are 2n, and n rounds, so should be even.

But in this code, it doesn't handle odd number of trumps.

Wait, but 2n cards, and each round has 2 cards, so total cards are even.

But, in practice, since n can be up to 16, total cards up to 32, which is even.

But in the code, if there's an odd number of trumps, it would fail.

Wait, but total trumps can be odd or even, depending on the distribution.

Wait, but in reality, total trumps can be odd or even.

Wait, but in the problem, total trumps can be odd or even, depending on the distribution of cards.

So, need to handle cases where the number of trumps is odd.

But in that case, some trumps would be paired with non-trump cards.

Wait, but in the code, it pairs non-trump cards with trumps first, and then pairs remaining trumps among themselves.

So, if there are an odd number of trumps, and some non-trump cards, it might still work.

Wait, need to think carefully.

Let me consider an example where n=2, trump=S.

Cards: 3S, 4S, 5H, 6H.

So, trumps: 3S, 4S.

Non-trump suits:

H: 5H, 6H.

Pair within H: 5H 6H.

Then, pair trumps: 3S 4S.

Output:

5H 6H

3S 4S

Which is correct.

Another example: n=2, trump=S.

Cards: 3S, 4S, 5H.

Wait, 5H? No, total cards should be 4 for n=2.

Wait, suppose n=2, trump=S.

Cards: 3S, 4S, 5H, 6C.

Pair within H: 5H with trump.

Pair within C: 6C with trump.

But only two trumps.

Wait, need to ensure that the number of non-trump cards can be paired with trumps or within suits.

It's getting complicated.

I think the code's approach is generally correct, but needs some adjustments.

Specifically:

- Need to ensure that when pairing trumps among themselves, only strictly higher trumps can beat lower trumps.

- Need to handle cases where equal-ranked trumps are being paired.

- Need to ensure that all pairings are valid based on the rules.

Given that, perhaps the code is acceptable, despite allowing equal-ranked trumps to be paired, assuming that the problem allows equal ranks to beat each other.

But according to the problem statement, only higher-ranked trumps can beat lower-ranked trumps.

Therefore, equal ranks cannot beat each other.

Hence, the code is incorrect in allowing equal-ranked trumps to be paired.

To fix this, need to ensure that when pairing trumps among themselves, the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Similarly, when pairing non-trump cards within the same suit, the second card must have a higher rank than the first.

Now, in the code, it sorts the ranks in ascending order and pairs them in order.

For non-trump suits, this is correct, since '2' < '3' < ... < '9'.

For trumps, it sorts in ascending order and pairs the highest with the second highest, and so on.

Which should be correct, since higher trumps can beat lower trumps.

But need to ensure that in the pairing, the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Wait, in the trump pairing, it pairs '5S' with '6S', '7S' with '8S', etc.

Which is correct, since '6' > '5', '8' > '7'.

But if there are an odd number of trumps, it's impossible, but since total cards are even, and distributed, need to ensure that the pairing is possible.

Moreover, need to handle cases where there are not enough trumps to pair with the remaining non-trump cards.

In summary, the code seems to handle most cases correctly, but allows equal-ranked trumps to be paired, which is invalid.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

To fix it, need to ensure that when pairing trumps among themselves, the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Moreover, need to ensure that when pairing non-trump cards within the same suit, the second card has a higher rank than the first.

Additionally, need to handle cases where there are an odd number of trumps or non-trump cards in a suit.

Given the time constraints, and the complexity of implementing a fully correct solution, I'll conclude that the given code is incorrect due to the equal-ranked trump pairing issue.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
