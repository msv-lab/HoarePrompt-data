Alright, I have this problem to solve. There are n cities on a number line, each with a unique coordinate in ascending order. For each city, there's a closest city to it, and this closest city is unique. I need to handle m queries, where each query asks for the minimum coins needed to travel from one city to another, given two types of moves: traveling directly to any city with a cost equal to the distance, or traveling to the closest city for 1 coin.

First, I need to understand the problem thoroughly. The cities are on a number line, and their coordinates are strictly increasing. So, the distance between city i and city j is simply the absolute difference in their coordinates, which is a[i] - a[j] since they are in order.

Each city has a unique closest city, meaning that for any city, there is exactly one other city that is closer to it than any other city. This uniqueness is guaranteed by the problem, so I don't need to handle cases where a city has multiple closest cities.

Now, for each query, I need to find the minimum cost to go from city x to city y using the two types of moves:

1. Travel directly to any city for a cost equal to the distance.

2. Travel to the closest city for 1 coin.

I need to find the sequence of moves that minimizes the total cost.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, if I can travel directly from x to y, the cost is simply the distance between them. But there might be a cheaper way using the "travel to closest city for 1 coin" move.

So, perhaps I can build some kind of graph where each city is a node, and there are edges to their closest cities with cost 1, and direct edges to all other cities with their respective distances.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, building such a graph explicitly is not feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to calculate the minimum cost without explicitly modeling the graph.

Let me think about the properties of the "closest city" relationship.

Given that the cities are on a number line and their coordinates are strictly increasing, the closest city to city i must be either city i-1 or city i+1, because those are the immediate neighbors.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me consider an example:

Suppose cities are at positions [0, 8, 12, 15, 20].

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (8), since 8 - 0 = 8.

- City 2 (8): closest is city 3 (12), since 12 - 8 = 4, which is less than 8 - 0 = 8.

- City 3 (12): closest is city 4 (15), since 15 - 12 = 3, which is less than 12 - 8 = 4.

- City 4 (15): closest is city 3 (12), since 15 - 12 = 3, which is less than 20 - 15 = 5.

- City 5 (20): closest is city 4 (15), since 20 - 15 = 5, which is less than 20 - 12 = 8.

So in this case, the closest city for each city is indeed one of its immediate neighbors.

Wait, but city 4's closest city is city 3, which is the left neighbor, because 15 - 12 = 3 is less than 20 - 15 = 5.

Similarly, city 3's closest city is city 4, since 15 - 12 = 3 is less than 12 - 8 = 4.

So, in this arrangement, the closest city is always one of the immediate neighbors.

Is this always the case?

Let me think of a case where the closest city is not an immediate neighbor.

Suppose cities are at [0, 1, 100].

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (1), distance 1.

- City 2 (1): closest is city 1 (0), distance 1.

- City 3 (100): closest is city 2 (1), distance 99.

Wait, but according to the problem, the closest city must be unique. In this case, city 2's closest city is city 1, and city 3's closest city is city 2.

So, seems like in this case as well, the closest city is an immediate neighbor.

Another example: [0, 2, 3].

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (2), distance 2.

- City 2 (2): closest is city 3 (3), distance 1.

- City 3 (3): closest is city 2 (2), distance 1.

Again, closest cities are immediate neighbors.

Wait, is it possible to have a city where the closest city is not an immediate neighbor?

Suppose [0, 1, 2].

- City 1 (0): closest is city 2 (1), distance 1.

- City 2 (1): closest is city 1 (0) or city 3 (2), both distance 1.

But the problem says that the closest city is unique, so this arrangement is invalid because city 2 would have two closest cities, city 1 and city 3, both at distance 1.

But the problem states that in the input, for every city, the closest city is unique. So, I don't have to worry about such cases.

Hence, in all valid inputs, each city's closest city is uniquely determined and is one of its immediate neighbors.

So, for city i, its closest city is either i-1 or i+1, whichever is closer.

Given that, I can model the "travel to closest city for 1 coin" as moving to either the left or right neighbor for 1 coin, depending on which is closer.

Wait, but in the earlier example, city 4's closest city is city 3, so moving to city 3 costs 1 coin.

Similarly, city 3's closest city is city 4, so moving to city 4 costs 1 coin.

So, it's like each city has a directed edge to its closest city with cost 1.

Moreover, I can always choose to move directly from any city to any other city with cost equal to their distance.

I need to find the minimum cost path from city x to city y using these two types of moves.

Given that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Building a graph with n nodes and edges to closest cities and then running Dijkstra for each query is too slow.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the possible paths I can take.

Option 1: Move directly from x to y with cost |a_x - a_y|.

Option 2: Move to the closest city of x for 1 coin, and then proceed from there.

But since I can choose to move directly or move to the closest city, I need to consider the combination of these moves.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

But with n up to 1e5, building such a graph is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city for 1 coin is cheaper than moving directly if the distance to the closest city is greater than 1 coin.

Wait, no. If the distance to the closest city is d, and I can move directly to it for cost d or move to it for 1 coin, then moving for 1 coin is better if d > 1.

But in the problem, the coordinates can be up to 1e9, so d can be large.

In the example, moving from city 1 to city 2 costs 8 coins directly or 1 coin by moving to the closest city.

Similarly, moving from city 1 to city 4 can be done directly for |0 - 15| = 15 coins, or by moving step by step:

- Move from city 1 to city 2 for 1 coin.

- Move from city 2 to city 3 for 1 coin.

- Move from city 3 to city 4 for 1 coin.

Total cost: 3 coins, which is better than 15 coins.

Similarly, moving from city 1 to city 5 can be done directly for |0 - 20| = 20 coins, or via the closest cities for a lower cost.

So, moving through the closest cities can be cheaper if there is a path through closest cities with total cost less than the direct distance.

I need to find the minimum cost path from x to y, where I can either move directly to any city for the distance cost or move to the closest city for 1 coin.

I need an efficient way to compute this for m queries.

Let me think about the structure of the moves.

Suppose I start at city x.

I can choose to move directly to y for cost |a_x - a_y|.

Alternatively, I can move to the closest city of x for 1 coin, then from there to its closest city for another coin, and so on, until I reach y.

But this could take many steps, and I need to find the minimum cost among all possible sequences of moves.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with a large graph, so I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also edges to all other cities with their respective distances.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, building such a graph and running Dijkstra for each query is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the fact that moving to the closest city is always moving to one of the immediate neighbors, as per the earlier examples.

So, the "closest city" move allows me to move to the left or right neighbor for 1 coin.

Then, I can think of this as moving along a line, where each step to a neighbor costs 1 coin, but I can also make a direct jump to any city for the distance cost.

I need to find the minimum cost to go from x to y using these moves.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimum cost as the distance between x and y minus the number of "closest city" moves I can make.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city for 1 coin is cheaper than moving directly if the direct distance is greater than 1.

In other words, if the distance to the closest city is d, and d > 1, then moving to the closest city for 1 coin is better.

But in the problem, coordinates can be up to 1e9, so d can be large.

Wait, in the first step, I can choose to move directly to y for |a_x - a_y| coins, or move to the closest city for 1 coin, and then proceed from there.

I need to find the optimal sequence of moves.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a mathematical way to compute this without simulating each move.

Let me think about the properties of the number line.

Since the cities are on a number line, and their coordinates are strictly increasing, I can think of them as points on a straight line.

In such a case, the shortest path would be the direct distance if I choose to move directly, or the sum of the costs of moving through intermediate cities.

But I need to choose the minimum among these options.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimum cost as the direct distance minus the sum of the savings from using the "closest city" moves.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that each "closest city" move saves me some coins compared to moving directly to that city.

For example, if I move from city x to its closest city c for 1 coin, and the direct distance is d, then I save d - 1 coins.

But I need to accumulate these savings along a path from x to y.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider that moving through closest cities is akin to moving step by step along the number line, each step costing 1 coin, but potentially covering more distance than just moving to the immediate neighbor.

Wait, no, in this problem, moving to the closest city is moving to one specific city, which is pre-determined for each city.

So, for each city, I know its closest city, and I can represent this as a directed edge from city to its closest city with cost 1.

Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph, where there are these directed edges to closest cities with cost 1, and also direct edges to any city with cost equal to the distance.

But again, building such a graph explicitly is not feasible for large n and m.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the "closest city" moves allow me to traverse the line in steps of varying lengths, each step costing 1 coin, but the step lengths are determined by the closest city relationships.

Given that, perhaps I can model this as a way to jump between cities in a way that minimizes the cost.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming.

Let me define dp[y] as the minimum cost to reach city y from city x.

But with n up to 1e5 and m up to 1e5, this seems too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is always moving to a neighbor, and the closest city for each city is unique and is one of its immediate neighbors.

Given that, I can model the "closest city" moves as moving along the number line in steps of varying lengths, each step costing 1 coin.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum cost to go from x to y, where I can either make direct jumps with cost equal to the distance or make step-by-step moves to neighbors with cost 1 per step.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the "closest city" moves as a way to traverse the number line with steps of cost 1, and the direct moves as a way to make larger jumps with cost equal to the distance.

Then, the minimum cost would be the minimum between the direct distance and the number of steps needed to go from x to y via the "closest city" moves.

But I need to compute the number of steps needed to go from x to y using the "closest city" moves.

Given that each "closest city" move takes me to a specific neighbor, I can model this as moving along a path where each step takes me closer to y, and I can compute the number of steps needed to go from x to y via these moves.

But I need to consider that moving to the closest city might not always be towards y.

Wait, in the example, moving from city 1 to city 2, then to city 3, then to city 4, which is the path to y=4.

But in other cases, it might not be straightforward.

Wait, in the earlier example, moving from city 3 to city 4 is towards y=4, but moving from city 4 to city 3 is away from y=4.

So, I need to ensure that I'm moving in the direction of y.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the shortest path from x to y would be the minimum among:

- Directly going from x to y with cost |a_x - a_y|.

- Going through a sequence of closest city moves, each costing 1 coin, until reaching y.

But again, with large n and m, this is not feasible.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the "closest city" moves allow me to traverse the number line in a way that is similar to moving to a specific neighbor for 1 coin.

Then, perhaps I can model the cost as the direct distance minus the sum of savings from using the "closest city" moves.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that each time I move to the closest city, I save (distance to closest city) - 1 coins compared to moving directly.

But I need to accumulate these savings along a path.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference between the direct distance and the sum of the "closest city" move costs.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I fix x and y, and I want to find the minimum cost to go from x to y.

Option 1: Move directly from x to y with cost |a_x - a_y|.

Option 2: Make a sequence of moves to the closest city, each costing 1 coin, until reaching y.

I need to find the minimum between these two options.

But computing the cost of the sequence of moves to the closest city until reaching y is time-consuming for large n and m.

Is there a way to precompute something to make this efficient?

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city the cost to reach y using only "closest city" moves.

But that still seems too slow for large n and m.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a tree, where each city has a single parent, which is its closest city, and then compute the distance in this tree.

But in that case, the tree would have multiple components, and I need to handle that.

Wait, but in the problem, all cities are on a number line, so perhaps it's a single component.

But in the example, city 1 points to city 2, city 2 points to city 3, city 3 points to city 4, city 4 points to city 3, city 5 points to city 4.

So, there are cycles in this "closest city" graph.

Wait, city 4 points to city 3, which points back to city 4, so there is a cycle between city 3 and city 4.

Similarly, city 2 points to city 3, which points to city 4, and so on.

So, it's not a tree; it can have cycles.

Hence, modeling it as a tree might not work.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving to a specific neighbor with cost 1, and I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from x to y in this graph, where there are these edges with cost 1 to the closest city, and also direct edges to any city with cost equal to their distance.

But again, with large n and m, building such a graph and running shortest path for each query is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of the "closest city" moves.

Suppose I start at city x and repeatedly move to its closest city until I reach y, counting the number of moves.

Each move costs 1 coin.

Alternatively, I can move directly to y with cost |a_x - a_y|.

I need to choose the minimum between these two options.

But in reality, moving through the "closest city" path might not be a straight line to y; it might involve going back and forth.

In the example, from city 1 to city 4, moving through city 2, then city 3, then city 4 costs 3 coins, which is better than the direct 15 coins.

But in other cases, it might not be the best option.

I need a general way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal number of "closest city" moves needed to go from x to y.

Each "closest city" move costs 1 coin, and then compare that to the direct cost.

But computing the minimal number of moves is equivalent to finding the length of the path from x to y in the "closest city" graph.

But with cycles in the graph, this could be infinite in some cases, but in this problem, since the closest city is unique, there are no ties, so there are no cycles.

Wait, are there cycles?

In the earlier example, city 3 points to city 4, and city 4 points to city 3.

So, that's a cycle.

Hence, there might be cycles in the graph.

But in that case, if there is a cycle, moving through the cycle doesn't help, as I can loop forever without making progress.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider only the acyclic part of the graph.

Wait, but cycles would cause infinite loops, which might not be useful for reaching y.

Hence, perhaps I should consider the graph as a DAG by breaking the cycles, but I'm not sure.

This seems complicated.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is moving to a specific neighbor with cost 1, and I can model this as moving along the number line in steps of varying lengths, each step costing 1 coin.

Then, the minimal cost to go from x to y would be the minimal number of steps needed to go from x to y, where each step is moving to the closest city.

But computing this for each query is too slow for large n and m.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the "closest city" moves allow me to traverse the number line in a way that is potentially faster than moving directly, especially if the closest city is far away.

Wait, but in the problem, the closest city is the nearest one, so it's not necessarily far.

Wait, no, the closest city is the one with the smallest distance.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's defined that the closest city is the one with the smallest distance, and this is unique for each city.

Hence, for each city, its closest city is the one with the smallest distance among all other cities, and this is unique.

Given that, and the cities are on a number line in ascending order, the closest city for each city is either its left neighbor or its right neighbor, whichever is closer.

Hence, for city i, its closest city is city i-1 or city i+1, depending on which is closer.

Given that, I can model the "closest city" moves as moving to the left or right neighbor with cost 1.

Then, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal number of moves needed to go from x to y, moving only to left or right neighbors with cost 1 per move, or moving directly with cost equal to the distance.

But this seems similar to moving along a path graph, where each edge has cost 1, but with the added option of moving directly with cost equal to the distance.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimal between the direct distance and the number of steps needed to go from x to y via the "closest city" moves.

But computing the number of steps for each query is too slow for large n and m.

I need a better way.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute something to make this efficient.

Let me consider that the "closest city" moves form a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1.

Then, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal path cost in this graph from x to y, considering that I can also make direct jumps with cost equal to the distance.

But again, with large n and m, this is not feasible.

I need a mathematical insight here.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city for 1 coin is effectively allowing me to cover distance d (the distance to the closest city) for 1 coin, which is potentially cheaper than paying d coins to move directly.

Hence, it's like having a special move that allows me to cover certain distances for reduced cost.

I need to find a way to accumulate these savings along a path from x to y.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix y and precompute the minimal cost to reach y from any x.

But with m up to 1e5 and n up to 1e5, this is still too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the direct distance minus the maximal savings I can get by using the "closest city" moves.

The savings would be the sum of (distance to closest city - 1) for each move.

But this seems too hand-wavy.

I need a more concrete idea.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city for 1 coin is effectively allowing me to cover that distance for 1 coin, regardless of the actual distance.

Hence, it's like having a special edge with cost 1 to the closest city.

Then, the minimal cost path from x to y would be the minimal sum of the costs of the edges in the path.

But again, with large n and m, I need a smarter way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with cost 1, and also edges to all other cities with cost equal to their distance.

Then, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

But building such a graph is not feasible for large n and m.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the "closest city" moves allow me to traverse the number line in steps of cost 1, and the direct moves allow me to jump directly with cost equal to the distance.

Hence, the minimal cost is the minimal number of steps needed to go from x to y via the "closest city" moves, or the direct distance, whichever is smaller.

But computing the minimal number of steps for each query is too slow.

I need a mathematical formula or a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference in coordinates between x and y, and the distances to the closest cities.

But I'm stuck.

Let me look back at the sample input and output to see if I can find a pattern.

Sample input:

1

5

0 8 12 15 20

5

1 4

1 5

3 4

3 2

5 1

Sample output:

3

8

1

4

14

Let's see what's happening in the first query: from city 1 (0) to city 4 (15), cost 3.

As explained in the problem, moving from 1 to 2 (cost 1), then 2 to 3 (cost 1), then 3 to 4 (cost 1), total 3 coins.

Alternatively, moving directly from 1 to 4 would cost |0 - 15| = 15 coins, which is worse.

Hence, the minimal cost is 3.

Second query: from city 1 (0) to city 5 (20), cost 8.

The explanation is to move from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5, which would be 4 moves, costing 4 coins, but the output is 8.

Wait, in the problem's note, it says that for the first query, moving from 1 to 2 (cost 1), 2 to 3 (cost 1), 3 to 4 (cost 1), total 3 coins.

For moving from 1 to 5, it says using the same way to get from 1 to 4 (3 coins), and then from 4 to 5 for 5 coins, total 8 coins.

Wait, but moving from 4 to 5 directly costs |15 - 20| = 5 coins.

Alternatively, moving from 4 to 3 (cost 1), but that's moving away from 5.

Hence, the optimal path is 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, with costs 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins.

But why not move from 1 directly to 5 for 20 coins, which is worse than 8.

Alternatively, is there a better path?

Wait, perhaps moving from 1 to 2 (1 coin), then from 2 to 3 (1 coin), then from 3 to 5 (cost |12 - 20| = 8 coins), total 1 + 1 + 8 = 10 coins, which is worse than 8.

Or moving from 1 to 3 (cost |0 - 12| = 12 coins), then from 3 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 5 (1 coin), total 12 + 1 + 1 = 14 coins, which is worse.

Hence, the minimal cost is indeed 8 coins.

Third query: from city 3 (12) to city 4 (15), cost 1.

Direct move costs |12 - 15| = 3 coins, but moving to the closest city (city 4) costs 1 coin, which is better.

Hence, minimal cost is 1 coin.

Fourth query: from city 3 (12) to city 2 (8), cost 4.

Direct move costs |12 - 8| = 4 coins.

Moving to city 4 (cost 1 coin), then to city 3 (cost 1 coin), then to city 2 (cost 1 coin), total 3 coins, which is better than 4.

Wait, but city 4's closest city is city 3, and city 3's closest city is city 4.

Hence, moving from 3 to 4 (1 coin), then from 4 to 3 (1 coin), then from 3 to 2 (1 coin), total 3 coins, which is better than direct 4 coins.

But the sample output is 4, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem's note, for the second query, it says moving from 1 to 4 costs 3 coins, then from 4 to 5 costs 5 coins, total 8 coins.

But in the fourth query, from 3 to 2, the output is 4 coins.

If moving from 3 to 4 costs 1 coin, then from 4 to 3 costs 1 coin, then from 3 to 2 costs 1 coin, total 3 coins, which is less than the direct 4 coins.

But the sample output is 4, not 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I can't move from 4 to 3 and then to 2, because that would involve moving away from the target.

Hence, perhaps such a path is not allowed or doesn't make sense.

But according to the problem, you can travel to any city, including moving away from the target.

However, in reality, moving away from the target would not be optimal.

Hence, perhaps the minimal path is from 3 to 2 directly for 4 coins, which is better than going through 4 first.

Hence, in this case, moving directly is better.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it's 4 coins, not 3.

Hence, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Maybe the path 3 to 4 to 3 to 2 is not valid or is more expensive.

Wait, moving from 3 to 4 costs 1 coin, from 4 to 3 costs 1 coin, from 3 to 2 costs 1 coin, total 3 coins.

But the sample output is 4 coins, so perhaps this path is not allowed or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there is a restriction on revisiting cities, but the problem doesn't specify any such restriction.

Hence, I'm confused why the minimal cost is 4 instead of 3.

Wait, perhaps the path 3 to 4 to 2.

But city 4's closest city is city 3, not city 2.

Hence, from city 4, I can only move to city 3 for
