Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. That condition sounds a bit tricky, so I need to understand it better.

First, let's rephrase the condition: a + b should be divisible by b * GCD(a, b). In mathematical terms, that means (a + b) mod (b * GCD(a, b)) = 0.

I know that GCD(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b, which divides both a and b. Let's think about how we can simplify this condition.

Let me denote GCD(a, b) as d. So, a = d * k and b = d * l, where k and l are coprime integers (since d is the greatest common divisor).

Substituting these into the condition:

(a + b) = d*k + d*l = d*(k + l)

And b * GCD(a, b) = d*l * d = d^2 * l

So, the condition becomes: d*(k + l) must be divisible by d^2 * l.

Simplifying, that means (k + l) must be divisible by d * l.

But since k and l are coprime, and d is the GCD of a and b, I need to see how these relate.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the condition again: a + b is a multiple of b * GCD(a, b).

That is, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Since GCD(a, b) divides a and GCD(a, b) divides b, it divides a + b as well. So, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

But I need to find pairs (a, b) where this is true.

Let me try to find a relationship between a and b that satisfies this condition.

Let me consider b fixed and see what a should satisfy.

Given b, and GCD(a, b), I need a such that b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

But GCD(a, b) divides a and b, so GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Therefore, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Let me denote d = GCD(a, b).

Then, d divides b, so b = d * k for some integer k.

Similarly, a = d * m, where m is an integer, and GCD(m, k) = 1, since d is the GCD.

Now, a + b = d*m + d*k = d*(m + k)

And b * GCD(a, b) = d*k * d = d^2 * k

So, d^2 * k divides d*(m + k), which implies that d * k divides m + k.

But m and k are coprime, since GCD(m, k) = 1.

So, d * k divides m + k, with GCD(m, k) = 1.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me try to express the condition in terms of d, m, and k.

We have:

d * k divides m + k.

Since m and k are coprime, and d divides k (because b = d * k and b is divisible by d), I need to find a relationship that allows d * k to divide m + k.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should look for patterns in small values of n and m.

Let me consider the first test case: n = 1, m = 1.

Only pair is (1, 1).

Check if 1 + 1 is a multiple of 1 * GCD(1, 1) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Yes, 2 is a multiple of 1.

So, only one pair, which matches the sample output.

Second test case: n = 2, m = 3.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3).

Let's check each:

(1,1): 1+1=2, b*GCD(1,1)=1*1=1, 2 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(1,2): 1+2=3, b*GCD(1,2)=2*1=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(1,3): 1+3=4, b*GCD(1,3)=3*1=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(2,1): 2+1=3, b*GCD(2,1)=1*1=1, 3 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(2,2): 2+2=4, b*GCD(2,2)=2*2=4, 4 is a multiple of 4. OK.

(2,3): 2+3=5, b*GCD(2,3)=3*1=3, 5 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

So, valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). Total 3, which matches the sample output.

Third test case: n = 3, m = 5.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5).

Checking each:

(1,1): 1+1=2, 1*1=1, 2 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(1,2): 1+2=3, 2*1=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(1,3): 1+3=4, 3*1=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(1,4): 1+4=5, 4*1=4, 5 is not a multiple of 4. Not OK.

(1,5): 1+5=6, 5*1=5, 6 is not a multiple of 5. Not OK.

(2,1): 2+1=3, 1*2=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(2,2): 2+2=4, 2*2=4, 4 is a multiple of 4. OK.

(2,3): 2+3=5, 3*2=6, 5 is not a multiple of 6. Not OK.

(2,4): 2+4=6, 4*2=8, 6 is not a multiple of 8. Not OK.

(2,5): 2+5=7, 5*2=10, 7 is not a multiple of 10. Not OK.

(3,1): 3+1=4, 1*3=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(3,2): 3+2=5, 2*3=6, 5 is not a multiple of 6. Not OK.

(3,3): 3+3=6, 3*3=9, 6 is not a multiple of 9. Not OK.

(3,4): 3+4=7, 4*3=12, 7 is not a multiple of 12. Not OK.

(3,5): 3+5=8, 5*3=15, 8 is not a multiple of 15. Not OK.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for n=3, m=5, the output is 4, but according to my checks, I only have (1,1) and (2,2) as valid pairs. That's only 2 pairs, but the sample output is 4. Maybe I missed some pairs.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output. Wait, the sample output for the sixth input is 1643498, but for n=3, m=5, it's 4. Maybe I need to check again.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in my manual checking.

Let me recheck for n=3, m=5.

(1,1): 1+1=2, b*GCD(1,1)=1*1=1, 2 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(1,2): 1+2=3, b*GCD(1,2)=2*1=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(1,3): 1+3=4, b*GCD(1,3)=3*1=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(1,4): 1+4=5, b*GCD(1,4)=4*1=4, 5 is not a multiple of 4. Not OK.

(1,5): 1+5=6, b*GCD(1,5)=5*1=5, 6 is a multiple of 5? 6/5 is 1.2, which is not an integer. So, not OK.

(2,1): 2+1=3, b*GCD(2,1)=1*2=2, 3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(2,2): 2+2=4, b*GCD(2,2)=2*2=4, 4 is a multiple of 4. OK.

(2,3): 2+3=5, b*GCD(2,3)=3*2=6, 5 is not a multiple of 6. Not OK.

(2,4): 2+4=6, b*GCD(2,4)=4*2=8, 6 is not a multiple of 8. Not OK.

(2,5): 2+5=7, b*GCD(2,5)=5*2=10, 7 is not a multiple of 10. Not OK.

(3,1): 3+1=4, b*GCD(3,1)=1*3=3, 4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(3,2): 3+2=5, b*GCD(3,2)=2*3=6, 5 is not a multiple of 6. Not OK.

(3,3): 3+3=6, b*GCD(3,3)=3*3=9, 6 is not a multiple of 9. Not OK.

(3,4): 3+4=7, b*GCD(3,4)=4*3=12, 7 is not a multiple of 12. Not OK.

(3,5): 3+5=8, b*GCD(3,5)=5*3=15, 8 is not a multiple of 15. Not OK.

Wait, according to this, only (1,1) and (2,2) are valid, but the sample output is 4 for n=3, m=5. Maybe I missed some pairs.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all possible pairs again:

(1,1): OK

(1,2): Not OK

(1,3): Not OK

(1,4): Not OK

(1,5): Not OK

(2,1): Not OK

(2,2): OK

(2,3): Not OK

(2,4): Not OK

(2,5): Not OK

(3,1): Not OK

(3,2): Not OK

(3,3): Not OK

(3,4): Not OK

(3,5): Not OK

That's only 2 valid pairs, but the sample output is 4. There must be something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output. Wait, no, the sample input is 6 lines:

6

1 1

2 3

3 5

10 8

100 1233

1000000 1145141

And the corresponding outputs are:

1

3

4

14

153

1643498

So, for n=3, m=5, output is 4, but according to my manual check, only 2 pairs satisfy the condition. There must be an error in my reasoning.

Let me try to find where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I mis-calculated the condition for some pairs.

Let me check (3,1) again.

a=3, b=1

a + b = 4

b * GCD(3,1) = 1 * 1 = 1

4 is a multiple of 1. So, it should be OK.

Wait, I thought 4 is not a multiple of 1, but actually, 4 is a multiple of 1. So, it should be OK.

Similarly, (2,1):

a=2, b=1

a + b = 3

b * GCD(2,1) = 1 * 1 = 1

3 is a multiple of 1. So, it should be OK.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was not OK. Maybe I made a mistake there.

Similarly, (1,1):

a=1, b=1

a + b = 2

b * GCD(1,1) = 1 * 1 = 1

2 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(1,2):

a=1, b=2

a + b = 3

b * GCD(1,2) = 2 * 1 = 2

3 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(1,3):

a=1, b=3

a + b = 4

b * GCD(1,3) = 3 * 1 = 3

4 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(1,4):

a=1, b=4

a + b = 5

b * GCD(1,4) = 4 * 1 = 4

5 is not a multiple of 4. Not OK.

(1,5):

a=1, b=5

a + b = 6

b * GCD(1,5) = 5 * 1 = 5

6 is a multiple of 5? 5 divides 6? No, so Not OK.

(2,1):

a=2, b=1

a + b = 3

b * GCD(2,1) = 1 * 1 = 1

3 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(2,2):

a=2, b=2

a + b = 4

b * GCD(2,2) = 2 * 2 = 4

4 is a multiple of 4. OK.

(2,3):

a=2, b=3

a + b = 5

b * GCD(2,3) = 3 * 1 = 3

5 is not a multiple of 3. Not OK.

(2,4):

a=2, b=4

a + b = 6

b * GCD(2,4) = 4 * 2 = 8

6 is not a multiple of 8. Not OK.

(2,5):

a=2, b=5

a + b = 7

b * GCD(2,5) = 5 * 1 = 5

7 is not a multiple of 5. Not OK.

(3,1):

a=3, b=1

a + b = 4

b * GCD(3,1) = 1 * 1 = 1

4 is a multiple of 1. OK.

(3,2):

a=3, b=2

a + b = 5

b * GCD(3,2) = 2 * 1 = 2

5 is not a multiple of 2. Not OK.

(3,3):

a=3, b=3

a + b = 6

b * GCD(3,3) = 3 * 3 = 9

6 is not a multiple of 9. Not OK.

(3,4):

a=3, b=4

a + b = 7

b * GCD(3,4) = 4 * 1 = 4

7 is not a multiple of 4. Not OK.

(3,5):

a=3, b=5

a + b = 8

b * GCD(3,5) = 5 * 1 = 5

8 is not a multiple of 5. Not OK.

So, according to this, the valid pairs are:

(1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1)

Total of 4 pairs, which matches the sample output.

I must have miscounted earlier. So, in this case, it's 4 pairs.

Now, let's try to generalize this.

Looking at the pattern, for each b, we need to find a such that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

But GCD(a, b) divides both a and b, so it divides a + b.

Therefore, b * GCD(a, b) divides a + b if and only if b divides (a + b)/GCD(a, b).

Wait, let's see.

Since GCD(a, b) divides a + b, we can write a + b = k * GCD(a, b), for some integer k.

Then, b * GCD(a, b) divides k * GCD(a, b), which simplifies to b divides k.

But k = (a + b)/GCD(a, b).

So, b divides (a + b)/GCD(a, b).

Therefore, (a + b)/GCD(a, b) must be divisible by b.

In other words, a + b must be divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

This seems a bit circular. Maybe I need to think in terms of simplifying the condition.

Let me consider d = GCD(a, b), then a = d * a', b = d * b', where GCD(a', b') = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

a + b = d * a' + d * b' = d * (a' + b')

b * GCD(a, b) = d * b' * d = d^2 * b'

So, d * (a' + b') must be divisible by d^2 * b'.

Simplifying, a' + b' must be divisible by d * b'.

But since GCD(a', b') = 1, and b' divides b, I need to find a' such that a' + b' is divisible by d * b'.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me try to fix b and find for which a the condition holds.

For a fixed b, we need to find a such that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

But GCD(a, b) divides a, so GCD(a, b) divides a + b.

Moreover, b divides b * GCD(a, b), so b divides a + b.

Wait, b divides a + b implies that a ≡ b (mod b), which means a ≡ 0 (mod b).

Wait, no, a + b ≡ 0 (mod b) implies a ≡ -b (mod b), which is a ≡ 0 (mod b), since -b ≡ 0 (mod b).

So, a must be a multiple of b.

Wait, does that mean that a must be a multiple of b?

Wait, but in the earlier example, for n=3, m=5, we have valid pairs where a is not a multiple of b.

For example, (1,1): 1 is a multiple of 1.

(2,1): 2 is a multiple of 1.

(2,2): 2 is a multiple of 2.

(3,1): 3 is a multiple of 1.

So, in this case, it seems that a must be a multiple of b.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=10, m=8, the sample output is 14.

Let me see which pairs satisfy a being a multiple of b.

Possible b values from 1 to 8.

For b=1: a can be from 1 to 10, all are multiples of 1. So, 10 pairs.

For b=2: a must be multiple of 2, so a=2,4,6,8,10. So, 5 pairs.

For b=3: a must be multiple of 3, so a=3,6,9. So, 3 pairs.

For b=4: a must be multiple of 4, so a=4,8. So, 2 pairs.

For b=5: a must be multiple of 5, so a=5,10. So, 2 pairs.

For b=6: a must be multiple of 6, so a=6. So, 1 pair.

For b=7: a must be multiple of 7, so a=7. But n=10, so a=7. So, 1 pair.

For b=8: a must be multiple of 8, so a=8. So, 1 pair.

Total pairs: 10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25.

But the sample output is 14, which is less than 25. So, my assumption that a must be a multiple of b is incorrect.

Therefore, the condition is not simply that a is a multiple of b.

I need to find another way to approach this.

Let me try to look for a mathematical formula or pattern that can help me compute the number of valid pairs efficiently, especially since n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and the sum of n and m across all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^6.

I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) or better.

Let me think about the condition again: a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

Let d = GCD(a, b). Then a = d * a', b = d * b', with GCD(a', b') = 1.

Then a + b = d * (a' + b'), and b * GCD(a, b) = d * b' * d = d^2 * b'.

So, d * (a' + b') must be divisible by d^2 * b'.

Simplifying, a' + b' must be divisible by d * b'.

But a' and b' are coprime.

So, d * b' divides a' + b'.

Since GCD(a', b') = 1, and b' divides b, I need to find a' such that a' + b' is divisible by d * b'.

This seems complicated. Maybe I need to express d in terms of b'.

Wait, d divides b, since b = d * b'.

So, d divides b.

Also, d divides a, since a = d * a'.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over possible d and b, and find corresponding a.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider small values of b and see if I can find a pattern.

For b=1:

Then, b * GCD(a,1) = 1 * 1 = 1, since GCD(a,1)=1.

So, a + 1 must be divisible by 1, which is always true.

Therefore, for b=1, all a from 1 to n are valid.

So, number of pairs for b=1 is n.

For b=2:

b * GCD(a,2) = 2 * GCD(a,2).

a + 2 must be divisible by 2 * GCD(a,2).

Let me consider possible GCD(a,2):

If a is odd, GCD(a,2)=1, so 2 * 1 = 2 divides a + 2, which means a + 2 must be even, which is true if a is even. Wait, but a is odd in this case, so a + 2 is odd + even = odd, which is not divisible by 2. So, no solutions when a is odd.

If a is even, GCD(a,2)=2, so 2 * 2 = 4 divides a + 2.

Since a is even, let a = 2k.

Then, a + 2 = 2k + 2 = 2(k + 1).

This must be divisible by 4, so 2(k + 1) divisible by 4 implies k + 1 is even, so k is odd.

Therefore, a = 2k, with k odd.

So, a must be of the form 2*(2m + 1) = 4m + 2, for integer m >= 0.

So, a must be congruent to 2 mod 4.

Therefore, for b=2, a must be congruent to 2 mod 4.

Similarly, for b=3:

b * GCD(a,3) = 3 * GCD(a,3).

a + 3 must be divisible by 3 * GCD(a,3).

Consider possible GCD(a,3):

If GCD(a,3)=1, then 3 divides a + 3, which is always true since a + 3 is divisible by 3 if a ≡ 0 mod 3. But GCD(a,3)=1 implies a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

Wait, if GCD(a,3)=1, then a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3.

But a + 3 ≡ a mod 3, since 3 ≡ 0 mod 3.

So, a + 3 ≡ a mod 3.

We need a + 3 to be divisible by 3, which is equivalent to a ≡ 0 mod 3.

But if GCD(a,3)=1, then a ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3, which contradicts a ≡ 0 mod 3.

Therefore, no solutions when GCD(a,3)=1.

If GCD(a,3)=3, then a is divisible by 3.

Then, b * GCD(a,3) = 3 * 3 = 9.

a + 3 must be divisible by 9.

Since a is divisible by 3, let a = 3k.

Then, a + 3 = 3k + 3 = 3(k + 1).

This must be divisible by 9, so 3(k + 1) divisible by 9 implies k + 1 divisible by 3, so k ≡ 2 mod 3.

Therefore, a = 3*(3m + 2) = 9m + 6, for integer m >= 0.

So, a must be congruent to 6 mod 9.

Therefore, for b=3, a must be congruent to 6 mod 9.

Similarly, for b=4:

b * GCD(a,4) = 4 * GCD(a,4).

a + 4 must be divisible by 4 * GCD(a,4).

Possible GCD(a,4):

- GCD(a,4)=1: then 4 divides a + 4, which means a ≡ -4 ≡ 0 mod 4.

But GCD(a,4)=1 implies a is not divisible by 2, so a ≡ 1 or 3 mod 4.

Contradiction.

- GCD(a,4)=2: then 4 * 2 = 8 divides a + 4.

a is even but not divisible by 4, so a ≡ 2 mod 4.

Then, a + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 ≡ 6 mod 8.

For 8 to divide a + 4, a + 4 must be divisible by 8, but 6 mod 8 is not 0.

Therefore, no solutions when GCD(a,4)=2.

- GCD(a,4)=4: then a is divisible by 4, a = 4k.

a + 4 = 4k + 4 = 4(k + 1).

This must be divisible by 16 (since b * GCD(a,b) = 4 * 4 = 16).

So, 4(k + 1) divisible by 16 implies k + 1 divisible by 4, so k ≡ 3 mod 4.

Therefore, a = 4*(4m + 3) = 16m + 12, for integer m >= 0.

So, a must be congruent to 12 mod 16.

Therefore, for b=4, a must be congruent to 12 mod 16.

From these examples, it seems that for each b, there is a specific modulus condition that a must satisfy, related to b and its multiples.

Specifically, for b, a must be congruent to some value modulo b * GCD(a,b), but since GCD(a,b) depends on a, it's still complicated.

I need to find a better way to generalize this.

Let me consider that for b=1, a can be any value from 1 to n.

For b >= 2, a must satisfy a ≡ some value mod (b * something).

But this seems too vague.

Looking back at the earlier examples:

- For b=1: a can be any value from 1 to n.

- For b=2: a must be congruent to 2 mod 4.

- For b=3: a must be congruent to 6 mod 9.

- For b=4: a must be congruent to 12 mod 16.

Wait a minute, in each case, the modulus is b^2, and the congruence is a ≡ something mod b^2.

Specifically, a ≡ b * (b - 1) mod b^2.

Wait, for b=2: b*(b-1) = 2*1 = 2 mod 4.

For b=3: 3*2 = 6 mod 9.

For b=4: 4*3 = 12 mod 16.

Yes, this seems to hold.

So, generalizing, for each b >= 2, a must be congruent to b*(b-1) mod b^2.

And a must be at least 1 and at most n.

So, for each b >= 2, the number of valid a is floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1, provided that b*(b-1) <= n.

For b=1, the number of valid a is n.

So, the total number of valid pairs is n plus the sum over b from 2 to min(n, m) of floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1, but only if b*(b-1) <= n.

Wait, let's verify this formula with the earlier examples.

For n=3, m=5:

b=1: n=3 pairs.

b=2: b*(b-1)=2*1=2, b^2=4.

floor((3 - 2)/4) + 1 = floor(1/4) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 pair.

b=3: b*(b-1)=3*2=6, which is greater than n=3, so no pairs.

Total pairs: 3 + 1 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Another test case: n=10, m=8.

b=1: 10 pairs.

b=2: b*(b-1)=2, b^2=4.

floor((10 - 2)/4) + 1 = floor(8/4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 pairs.

b=3: b*(b-1)=6, b^2=9.

floor((10 - 6)/9) + 1 = floor(4/9) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 pair.

b=4: b*(b-1)=12, which is greater than n=10, so no pairs.

Total pairs: 10 + 3 + 1 = 14, which matches the sample output.

Great, this seems to work.

So, the formula is:

Total pairs = n + sum over b=2 to min(n, m) of floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1, if b*(b-1) <= n.

But, we need to make sure that b*(b-1) <= n to have at least one a.

So, in code, for each b from 2 to min(n, m), if b*(b-1) <= n, then add floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1 to the total.

Otherwise, no pairs for that b.

Also, since n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, with sum of n and m across all test cases up to 2*10^6, we need an efficient implementation.

In Python, reading t test cases, and for each, reading n and m, then computing the total pairs as described.

To optimize, since the sum of n and m across all test cases is up to 2*10^6, the total time should be acceptable.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

t = int(input())

for T in range(t):

[n, m] = input().split()

[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]

ans = n

for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):

ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)

print(ans)

Wait, in the code, it's adding (n + b) // (b * b) to ans for each b from 2 to min(n, m).

But according to my earlier reasoning, it should be floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1.

Let me check if (n + b) // (b * b) is equal to floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1.

Let's see:

(n + b) // (b * b) = floor((n + b) / (b^2))

floor((n + b) / b^2) = floor(n / b^2 + b / b^2) = floor(n / b^2 + 1 / b)

Since b / b^2 = 1 / b, which is less than 1 for b >= 2, floor(n / b^2 + 1 / b) = floor(n / b^2)

But wait, floor(n / b^2 + 1 / b) = floor(n / b^2 + 1/b)

Since 1/b < 1, if n / b^2 is an integer, adding 1/b won't reach the next integer, so floor(n / b^2 + 1/b) = floor(n / b^2).

But in reality, n / b^2 + 1/b might or might not cross an integer boundary.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider specific values.

Let me take n=10, b=2.

(n + b) // (b * b) = (10 + 2) // 4 = 12 // 4 = 3

According to my earlier formula: floor((10 - 2*1)/4) + 1 = floor(8/4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

So, matches.

For b=3: (10 + 3)//9 = 13//9 = 1

My formula: floor((10 - 6)/9) + 1 = floor(4/9) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Matches.

For b=4: (10 + 4)//16 = 14//16 = 0

My formula: since b*(b-1)=12 > n=10, so no pairs. Matches.

Another test case: n=3, b=2.

(n + b)//(b*b) = (3 + 2)//4 = 5//4 = 1

My formula: floor((3 - 2)/4) + 1 = floor(1/4) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Matches.

So, it seems that (n + b) // (b * b) is equivalent to floor((n - b*(b-1)) / b^2) + 1.

Therefore, the given code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, satisfying the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

## Approach

1. **Initial Setup**: 
   - Read the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, read the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - For b = 1, all values of a from 1 to n are valid since b * GCD(a, 1) = 1 and a + 1 is always divisible by 1.
   - For b ≥ 2, derive the condition that a must be congruent to b*(b-1) modulo b². This is derived from the condition that a + b is divisible by b * GCD(a, b).

3. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - Initialize the answer with n (for b = 1).
   - For each b from 2 to the minimum of n and m:
     - Calculate the number of valid a's using the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
     - Add this to the answer.

4. **Output**:
   - Print the answer for each test case.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans += (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)

func()
```

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step breakdown**:
  1. Read the number of test cases, `t`.
  2. For each test case:
     - Read `n` and `m`.
     - Initialize `ans` to `n` (since all a for b=1 are valid).
     - For each `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`:
       - Compute the number of valid `a` using the formula `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
       - Add this to `ans`.
     - Print `ans`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The solution efficiently handles the constraints by iterating up to the minimum of `n` and `m` for each test case.
  - Given the constraints, the total time complexity is acceptable
