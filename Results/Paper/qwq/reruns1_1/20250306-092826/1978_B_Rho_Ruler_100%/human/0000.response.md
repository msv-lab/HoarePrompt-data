Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a bakery, and on the opening day, he baked n buns that he wants to sell. Normally, each bun costs a coins, but he's running a promotion to attract customers. The promotion works like this: he can choose some integer k (between 0 and the smaller of n or b), and for the first k buns sold, each bun's price is b - i + 1 coins, where i is the ith bun in the sequence. The remaining n - k buns are sold at the usual price of a coins each.

My task is to help Bob determine the maximum profit he can make by choosing the best k for this promotion.

First, I need to understand the promotion clearly. If Bob chooses k = 0, he sells all n buns at the usual price of a coins each, so the total profit would be n * a. If he chooses k = 1, he sells the first bun at b coins and the remaining n - 1 buns at a coins each, so the total profit would be b + (n - 1) * a. If k = 2, the first two buns are sold at b and b - 1 coins, respectively, and the remaining n - 2 buns at a coins each, so the total profit is b + (b - 1) + (n - 2) * a, and so on.

So, in general, for a chosen k, the total profit is the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns plus the usual price for the remaining n - k buns. The modified prices for the first k buns form a decreasing sequence starting from b down to b - k + 1.

I need to maximize this total profit over all possible values of k from 0 to min(n, b).

Let me think about how to compute this efficiently. Since n, a, and b can be up to 10^9, and t, the number of test cases, can be up to 10^4, I need a solution that is O(1) or nearly O(1) per test case, or at least very efficient.

First, let's think about the sum of the modified prices for the first k buns. This is an arithmetic series: b + (b - 1) + (b - 2) + ... + (b - k + 1). The sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic series is k * (first term + last term) / 2. So, sum = k * (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 = k * (2*b - k + 1) / 2 = (2*b*k - k^2 + k)/2 = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2.

But since k and b can be large, I need to make sure that this computation handles large numbers correctly without overflowing or losing precision. In programming, especially in languages like Python, this isn't an issue as Python handles big integers well.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the sum of the first k terms of an arithmetic sequence: sum = (k/2) * (2*b - k + 1).

Then, the total profit for a given k is this sum plus a*(n - k).

So, profit(k) = (k/2) * (2*b - k + 1) + a*(n - k).

I need to maximize profit(k) over k from 0 to min(n, b).

Now, since k is an integer between 0 and min(n, b), and n, a, b can be up to 10^9, iterating over all possible k is not feasible due to time constraints.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to find the maximum profit.

Let me consider the behavior of the profit function as k increases.

Let's look at the difference in profit when increasing k by 1:

delta_profit = profit(k+1) - profit(k).

Let's compute that:

profit(k+1) = ( (k+1)/2 ) * (2*b - (k+1) + 1) + a*(n - (k+1))

            = ( (k+1)/2 ) * (2*b - k) + a*(n - k - 1)

profit(k)   = (k/2) * (2*b - k + 1) + a*(n - k)

So, delta_profit = profit(k+1) - profit(k)

                 = [ (k+1)/2 * (2*b - k) + a*(n - k - 1) ] - [ k/2 * (2*b - k + 1) + a*(n - k) ]

Let's simplify this:

First, expand (k+1)/2 * (2*b - k):

(k+1)/2 * (2*b - k) = (k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 = (2*b*k - k^2 + 2*b - k)/2 = b*k - k^2/2 + b - k/2

Similarly, k/2 * (2*b - k + 1) = (2*b*k - k^2 + k)/2 = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2

Now, a*(n - k - 1) = a*n - a*k - a

And a*(n - k) = a*n - a*k

So, putting it all together:

delta_profit = [b*k - k^2/2 + b - k/2 + a*n - a*k - a] - [b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k]

Simplify:

= b*k - k^2/2 + b - k/2 + a*n - a*k - a - b*k + k^2/2 - k/2 - a*n + a*k

= (b - a - k) - k

= b - a - 2*k

So, delta_profit = b - a - 2*k

This is useful because it tells me how the profit changes when I increase k by 1.

If delta_profit > 0, then increasing k increases the profit.

If delta_profit < 0, then increasing k decreases the profit.

If delta_profit = 0, then increasing k doesn't change the profit.

Therefore, the profit function is increasing when b - a - 2*k > 0, which is when k < (b - a)/2.

And it's decreasing when b - a - 2*k < 0, which is when k > (b - a)/2.

At k = floor((b - a)/2), the profit is at its peak.

Wait, but k has to be an integer between 0 and min(n, b).

So, the maximum profit should occur at k = floor((b - a)/2), but I need to make sure that this k is within the allowed range.

Wait, let's think again.

Actually, from the delta_profit = b - a - 2*k.

This looks like a linear function in k, decreasing by 2 for each increment in k.

So, the profit increases as long as b - a - 2*k > 0, which is k < floor((b - a)/2).

At k = floor((b - a)/2), delta_profit is positive, and at k = floor((b - a)/2) + 1, delta_profit becomes non-positive.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at k = floor((b - a)/2), but again, I need to ensure that this k is within 0 to min(n, b).

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, for the first test case:

n = 4, a = 4, b = 5

Then, (b - a)/2 = (5 - 4)/2 = 0.5, floor of that is 0.

So, according to this, k = 0 should give the maximum profit.

But in the explanation, it says that k = 1 gives the maximum profit of 17, which is higher than k = 0, which would be 4 * 4 = 16.

So, my earlier conclusion seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating delta_profit.

Let me recalculate delta_profit carefully.

profit(k+1) - profit(k) = [sum of first k+1 modified prices + a*(n - k - 1)] - [sum of first k modified prices + a*(n - k)]

= [sum first k+1 - sum first k] + a*(n - k - 1 - n + k)

= (b - k) + a*(-1)

= b - k - a

So, delta_profit = b - a - k

Earlier, I had delta_profit = b - a - 2*k, which was incorrect.

I must have made a mistake in expanding the expressions.

Let me recast this.

Given:

profit(k) = sum of first k modified prices + a*(n - k)

sum of first k modified prices = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2

Therefore, profit(k) = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

Now, profit(k+1) = (k+1)*(2*b - (k+1) + 1)/2 + a*(n - (k+1))

Simplify:

(k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 + a*(n - k - 1)

Now, delta_profit = profit(k+1) - profit(k)

= [ (k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 + a*(n - k - 1) ] - [ k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k) ]

Let's expand both terms:

First term: (k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 = (2*b*(k+1) - k*(k+1))/2 = (2*b*k + 2*b - k^2 - k)/2 = b*k + b - k^2/2 - k/2

Second term: a*(n - k - 1) = a*n - a*k - a

From profit(k):

k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k) = (2*b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

Therefore, delta_profit = [b*k + b - k^2/2 - k/2 + a*n - a*k - a] - [b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k]

Simplify:

= b*k + b - k^2/2 - k/2 + a*n - a*k - a - b*k + k^2/2 - k/2 - a*n + a*k

= b - a - k

So, delta_profit = b - a - k

Therefore, profit increases when b - a - k > 0, i.e., k < b - a

And profit decreases when b - a - k < 0, i.e., k > b - a

At k = b - a, delta_profit = 0, meaning profit is equal to the previous one.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at k = b - a, but only if b - a is within 0 to min(n, b).

Wait, but in the first example:

n = 4, a = 4, b = 5

Then, b - a = 1

So, k = 1 should give the maximum profit, which matches the example where k = 1 gives 17, while k = 0 gives 16.

Another example:

n = 5, a = 5, b = 9

b - a = 4, which is less than min(n, b) = 5, so k = 4 should give the maximum profit.

But in the example, it says k = 5 gives 35, which is higher than k = 4, which would give 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 for k = 5.

Wait, but according to my formula, k = b - a = 4 should be optimal.

Wait, for k = 4:

profit = sum of first 4 modified prices: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30

plus a*(n - k) = 5*(5 - 4) = 5

total = 35

Similarly, for k = 5:

profit = 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35

plus a*(n - 5) = 0

total = 35

So, both k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit of 35.

But according to my earlier conclusion, k = b - a = 4 should be the optimal, but k = 5 also gives the same profit.

So, perhaps when k >= b - a, the profit remains the same or decreases after that.

Wait, in this case, delta_profit when k = 4 to k = 5:

delta_profit = b - a - k = 9 - 5 - 4 = 0

So, profit doesn't change.

And for k = 5 to k = 6, delta_profit = 9 - 5 - 5 = -1, which would decrease profit.

But in this case, min(n, b) = 5, so k cannot be more than 5.

Hence, in this case, both k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit, and k = 5 is also optimal.

So, in general, the optimal k is k = b - a, but if b - a > min(n, b), then set k = min(n, b).

Wait, but in the third test case:

n = 10, a = 10, b = 5

b - a = 5 - 10 = -5

According to this, k should be 0, since k cannot be negative.

And indeed, in the example, k = 0 gives the maximum profit of 100, which is better than k = 5, which would give 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 10*(10 - 5) = 15 + 50 = 65, which is less than 100.

So, when b - a <= 0, k = 0 is optimal.

When b - a > 0, k = min(b - a, min(n, b)) is optimal.

Wait, but in the second example, b - a = 4, and min(n, b) = 5, so k = 4 is optimal, but k = 5 also gives the same profit.

So, perhaps I need to consider the point where delta_profit becomes zero or negative.

Given that delta_profit = b - a - k

We should increase k as long as b - a - k > 0, i.e., k < b - a

At k = b - a, delta_profit = 0, meaning profit is equal to the previous one.

Beyond that, delta_profit < 0, meaning profit starts decreasing.

Therefore, the optimal k is k = b - a, but capped at min(n, b).

In other words, k = min(b - a, min(n, b))

But in the second example, k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit, and k = 5 is allowed.

Wait, but according to this formula, k = min(4, 5) = 4, but k = 5 is also optimal.

So, perhaps there is a range of k values that give the same maximum profit.

Specifically, from k = b - a up to some point where delta_profit remains non-negative.

Wait, since delta_profit at k = b - a is zero, and for k > b - a, delta_profit becomes negative.

But in the second example, at k = 4, delta_profit = 0, and at k = 5, delta_profit = -1, which would decrease the profit, but in reality, profit remains the same.

Wait, perhaps there is a mistake in the delta_profit formula.

Let me recalculate delta_profit carefully again.

Given:

profit(k+1) - profit(k) = [sum of first k+1 modified prices + a*(n - k - 1)] - [sum of first k modified prices + a*(n - k)]

= [sum first k+1 - sum first k] + a*(n - k - 1 - n + k)

= (b - k) + a*(-1)

= b - k - a

Yes, that's correct.

So, delta_profit = b - a - k

At k = b - a, delta_profit = b - a - (b - a) = 0

At k = b - a + 1, delta_profit = b - a - (b - a + 1) = -1

So, at k = b - a, profit is equal to profit at k - 1, and beyond that, profit starts decreasing.

Therefore, the maximum profit occurs at k = b - a, and staying at k = b - a gives the peak profit.

In the second example, k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit because at k = 4, delta_profit = 0, meaning profit doesn't increase but remains the same.

At k = 5, delta_profit = -1, but since we are dealing with integers, the profit drops by 1, but in this specific case, it seems that profit remains the same.

Wait, in the second example, k = 5 gives the same profit as k = 4.

But according to the formula, delta_profit at k = 4 is 0, and at k = 5 is -1.

So, profit at k = 5 should be equal to profit at k = 4 plus (-1), which is less than profit at k = 4.

But in the example, it's shown as 35 for both k = 4 and k = 5.

Wait, perhaps there is a miscalculation.

Let's compute profit for k = 4 and k = 5 in the second example.

n = 5, a = 5, b = 9

sum of first 4 modified prices: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30

plus a*(5 - 4) = 5

total profit for k = 4: 30 + 5 = 35

sum of first 5 modified prices: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35

plus a*(5 - 5) = 0

total profit for k = 5: 35 + 0 = 35

So, indeed, both k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit of 35.

But according to delta_profit, at k = 5, delta_profit = b - a - k = 9 - 5 - 5 = -1, which suggests that profit at k = 5 should be less than at k = 4.

But in reality, it's the same.

So, perhaps there is something wrong with the delta_profit formula.

Wait, maybe I need to recast the sum of the first k modified prices.

Let me verify the sum formula.

Sum of first k modified prices: b + (b - 1) + ... + (b - k + 1)

This is an arithmetic series with first term b and last term b - k + 1, and common difference -1.

The sum is k*(first term + last term)/2 = k*(b + b - k + 1)/2 = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2

Now, profit(k) = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

Let's compute profit(k+1) - profit(k):

profit(k+1) = (k+1)*(2*b - (k+1) + 1)/2 + a*(n - k - 1)

            = (k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 + a*(n - k - 1)

profit(k)   = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

So, delta_profit = profit(k+1) - profit(k)

                 = [ (k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 + a*(n - k - 1) ] - [ k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k) ]

Let's expand both terms:

First term: (k+1)*(2*b - k)/2 = (2*b*(k+1) - k*(k+1))/2 = (2*b*k + 2*b - k^2 - k)/2 = b*k + b - k^2/2 - k/2

Second term: a*(n - k - 1) = a*n - a*k - a

From profit(k):

k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k) = (2*b*k - k^2 + k)/2 + a*n - a*k = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

Therefore, delta_profit = [b*k + b - k^2/2 - k/2 + a*n - a*k - a] - [b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k]

Simplify:

= b*k + b - k^2/2 - k/2 + a*n - a*k - a - b*k + k^2/2 - k/2 - a*n + a*k

= b - a - k

So, delta_profit = b - a - k

This matches my earlier calculation.

Now, in the second example, n = 5, a = 5, b = 9

So, delta_profit = 9 - 5 - k = 4 - k

At k = 4, delta_profit = 0, meaning profit remains the same.

At k = 5, delta_profit = -1, which should decrease the profit.

But in reality, profit remains the same.

Wait, perhaps there is a rounding issue or something.

Wait, let's compute profit for k = 4 and k = 5.

For k = 4:

sum of first 4 modified prices: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 30

plus a*(5 - 4) = 5

total = 35

For k = 5:

sum of first 5 modified prices: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35

plus a*(5 - 5) = 0

total = 35

So, indeed, profit remains the same.

But according to delta_profit, at k = 5, it should decrease by 1, but in reality, it stays the same.

So, perhaps there is an error in the delta_profit formula.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when k >= b, the modified price becomes zero or negative, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, but in this case, b = 9, k = 5 is less than b, so all modified prices are positive.

Wait, but 9 - 5 + 1 = 5, which is positive.

So, no issue there.

Wait, perhaps the delta_profit formula doesn't account for something.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that when k increases beyond b - a, the profit doesn't necessarily decrease, but remains the same.

Wait, in the second example, b - a = 4, and for k = 4 and k = 5, profit is the same.

So, perhaps the optimal k is the minimum of (b - a, min(n, b))

But in the third example, n = 10, a = 10, b = 5

b - a = -5, so k = 0 is optimal, which is correct.

In the first example, b - a = 1, min(n, b) = 4, so k = 1 is optimal.

In the second example, b - a = 4, min(n, b) = 5, so k = 4 is optimal, but k = 5 also gives the same profit.

So, perhaps I need to choose k = min(b - a + 1, min(n, b))

Wait, in the second example, b - a + 1 = 5, which is equal to min(n, b), and profit remains the same at k = 5.

Similarly, in the first example, b - a + 1 = 2, but k = 1 gives higher profit than k = 2.

Wait, for the first example, b - a + 1 = 2

But profit at k = 1 is 17, and at k = 2 is 17 (5 + 4 + 4*4 = 5 + 4 + 16 = 25, wait, no.

Wait, for k = 2:

sum of first 2 modified prices: 5 + 4 = 9

plus a*(4 - 2) = 4*2 = 8

total = 9 + 8 = 17

Wait, same as k = 1.

But according to delta_profit, at k = 1, delta_profit = b - a - k = 5 - 4 - 1 = 0

So, profit remains the same from k = 1 to k = 2.

But in reality, profit remains the same.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, profit should decrease at k = 2, but in reality, it remains the same.

So, perhaps the delta_profit formula isn't accurately capturing the change.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when k <= b - a, increasing k increases profit.

When k = b - a, profit remains the same as k = b - a - 1.

And beyond that, profit starts decreasing.

But in the first example, b - a = 1, and at k = 1, profit remains the same as k = 0.

Wait, but in the first example, k = 0 gives 16, and k = 1 gives 17, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps my earlier conclusion is incorrect.

Wait, in the first example, b - a = 1

At k = 0, profit = 16

At k = 1, profit = 17

At k = 2, profit = 17

So, profit increases from k = 0 to k = 1, remains the same at k = 2.

According to delta_profit:

At k = 0, delta_profit = b - a - k = 5 - 4 - 0 = 1 > 0, so profit increases from k = 0 to k = 1

At k = 1, delta_profit = 5 - 4 - 1 = 0, so profit remains the same from k = 1 to k = 2

At k = 2, delta_profit = 5 - 4 - 2 = -1 < 0, so profit decreases from k = 2 to k = 3

But in reality, profit remains the same from k = 1 to k = 2.

So, perhaps the optimal k is k = b - a, but also including k = b - a + 1, since profit remains the same.

But in the first example, k = 1 (b - a) and k = 2 (b - a + 1) both give the same profit.

In the second example, k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit.

So, perhaps the optimal k is in the range [b - a, min(n, b)]

And within this range, profit remains the same.

Therefore, to maximize profit, choose any k in [b - a, min(n, b)]

But in the first example, k = 1 (b - a) and k = 2 (b - a + 1) give the same profit, but k = 3 would give less.

Similarly, in the second example, k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit, but k = 6 would give less.

So, perhaps the maximum profit is achieved for k from b - a up to some point where delta_profit becomes negative.

But in practice, since delta_profit at k = b - a is zero, and beyond that, it becomes negative, but in some cases, profit remains the same.

So, perhaps the best way is to choose k = b - a, but since for some k > b - a, profit remains the same, I should choose the smallest such k to maximize profit.

Wait, no, I should choose the k that gives the highest profit.

But in these cases, multiple k values give the same maximum profit.

So, perhaps I can choose k = b - a, and if k > min(n, b), set k = min(n, b)

But in the first example, b - a = 1, which is less than min(n, b) = 4, so k = 1

In the second example, b - a = 4, which is less than min(n, b) = 5, so k = 4 or k = 5

In the third example, b - a = -5, so k = 0

This seems consistent.

Therefore, in code, I can set k = min(max(b - a, 0), min(n, b))

But in the first example, k = 1, which is correct.

In the second example, k = 4, but k = 5 also gives the same profit.

So, perhaps to maximize profit, I should set k = min(max(b - a, 0), min(n, b))

And compute the profit accordingly.

But in the second example, k = 4 gives profit 35, and k = 5 also gives 35.

So, it's fine.

In the third example, k = 0 gives profit 100, which is higher than any k > 0.

So, this seems correct.

Now, let's consider edge cases.

Case 1: n = 1, a = 10, b = 1

b - a = -9, so k = 0

Profit = 1 * 10 = 10

If k = 1, sum of first 1 modified price = 1, plus a*(1 - 1) = 0, total = 1 < 10

So, k = 0 is optimal.

Case 2: n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 10^9

k = min(max(10^9 - 10^9, 0), min(10^9, 10^9)) = 0

Profit = 10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18

Which matches the fifth test case in the example.

Case 3: n = 10^9, a = 10^9, b = 1

k = min(max(1 - 10^9, 0), min(10^9, 1)) = 0

Profit = 10^9 * 10^9 = 10^18

Which matches the sixth test case.

Case 4: n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000

k = min(max(1000 - 1, 0), min(1000, 1000)) = 999

Profit = sum of first 999 modified prices: 1000 + 999 + ... + (1000 - 999 + 1) = 1000 + 999 + ... + 2 = sum from 2 to 1000

Sum from 2 to 1000 = sum from 1 to 1000 minus 1 = (1000*1001)/2 - 1 = 500500 - 1 = 500499

Plus a*(n - k) = 1*(1000 - 999) = 1

Total profit = 500499 + 1 = 500500

Which matches the seventh test case.

Wait, but in the seventh test case, output is 500500, which matches k = 999.

But according to my earlier formula, k = b - a = 999, which is within min(n, b) = 999, so k = 999.

But in the earlier examples, sometimes k = b - a and k = min(n, b) give the same profit.

So, perhaps choosing k = b - a is sufficient, but to be safe, I should choose k = min(max(b - a, 0), min(n, b))

Now, in terms of implementing this in code, I need to compute the sum of the first k modified prices, which is k*(2*b - k + 1)/2, and add a*(n - k).

Given that n, a, b can be up to 10^9, and t up to 10^4, I need to make sure that the code is efficient and handles large numbers correctly.

In Python, handling large integers is not an issue, but I need to make sure that there are no floating points; all divisions should be integer divisions.

Wait, in the sum formula, k*(2*b - k + 1)/2, since we're dealing with integers, I need to ensure that this is an integer.

Given that, I can write the profit function as:

profit = (k * (2*b - k + 1)) // 2 + a*(n - k)

This ensures that the division is integer division.

Now, in code, I can set k = min(max(b - a, 0), min(n, b))

Then compute profit using the above formula.

This should be efficient enough, as it's O(1) per test case.

But in the provided code, it seems to be using a different approach.

Let's look at the provided code:

if __name__ == '__main__':

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

print(func_2(n, a, b))

def func_1(k, n, a, b):

return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

def func_2(n, a, b):

(low, high) = (0, min(n, b))

max_profit = 0

while low <= high:

mid = (low + high) // 2

profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)

profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)

max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)

if profit_next > profit_mid:

low = mid + 1

else:

high = mid - 1

return max_profit

So, it defines func_1 to compute the profit for a given k, and func_2 to perform a binary search between low = 0 and high = min(n, b), to find the k that maximizes the profit.

In func_1, the profit is calculated as k*b - k*(k - 1)//2 + (n - k)*a

Wait, is this the same as my earlier formula?

My formula was: profit = k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 + a*(n - k)

Let's expand this:

k*(2*b - k + 1)/2 = (2*b*k - k^2 + k)/2 = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2

Plus a*(n - k) = a*n - a*k

Total profit = b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

Now, in func_1, it's k*b - k*(k - 1)//2 + (n - k)*a

Let's expand this:

k*b - (k*(k - 1))/2 + a*n - a*k

Which is b*k - (k^2 - k)/2 + a*n - a*k

Which is b*k - k^2/2 + k/2 + a*n - a*k

This matches my earlier formula.

Therefore, func_1 is correctly computing the profit for a given k.

Now, func_2 performs a binary search between low = 0 and high = min(n, b), and iteratively selects mid, computes profit at mid and at mid + 1, and decides whether to go left or right based on which profit is higher.

It keeps track of the maximum profit found during this process.

This seems like a valid approach to find the maximum profit without having to iterate through all possible k values.

Given that min(n, b) can be up to 10^9, a binary search approach is efficient enough, as it runs in O(log(min(n, b))) per test case.

Now, is this necessary? Given that we can compute the optimal k directly, as discussed earlier, but perhaps the problem setter wanted to illustrate a binary search approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a reason to use binary search instead of directly computing k.

Wait, in the earlier analysis, I concluded that k = min(max(b - a, 0), min(n, b)) gives the optimal profit.

But in the second example, k = 4 and k = 5 give the same profit, so choosing k = 4 or k = 5 is equally optimal.

Therefore, computing k directly as min(max(b - a, 0), min(n, b)) would work, and computing the profit using the formula would be sufficient.

However, the provided code uses a binary search to find the optimal k, which is also correct.

Therefore, both approaches are valid.

Given that, I can conclude that the provided code is correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**
