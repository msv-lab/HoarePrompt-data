Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1, meaning they take up one cell, and others are 2x2, meaning they take up four cells in a square.

The goal is to place all these icons on the minimum number of screens possible. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, and the 2x2 icons must be placed in a way that they cover four consecutive cells in a square.

First, I need to understand the constraints and how to optimize the screen space.

Each screen has 15 cells. A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon takes up 1 cell. I need to maximize the use of screen space by efficiently placing the larger icons without wasting space.

Let me think about how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen. Since each screen is 5 rows by 3 columns, I need to see how many 2x2 squares can be placed within this grid.

Visually, a 5x3 grid can fit two 2x2 squares without overlapping. For example, placing one in the top-left corner covering rows 1-2 and columns 1-2, and another one in the bottom-left corner covering rows 4-5 and columns 1-2. That would use up 8 cells (2 icons * 4 cells each).

Alternatively, I could place one 2x2 icon in the top-left and another in the top-right, but that would overlap in row 1, which isn't allowed since each cell can only be occupied by one icon.

Wait, let's sketch this out.

Imagine the grid:

Row 1: Cells 1,2,3

Row 2: Cells 4,5,6

Row 3: Cells 7,8,9

Row 4: Cells 10,11,12

Row 5: Cells 13,14,15

If I place a 2x2 icon in cells 1,2,4,5 (top-left), and another in cells 10,11,13,14 (bottom-left), that uses up 8 cells, leaving 7 cells available for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if I place only one 2x2 icon, say in cells 1,2,4,5, that uses up 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, if I don't place any 2x2 icons, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

So, the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen seems to be 2, using up 8 cells, leaving 7 for 1x1 icons.

But, perhaps there's a better way to arrange them to fit more 2x2 icons. Let's try.

If I place one 2x2 icon in cells 1,2,4,5, and another in cells 7,8,10,11, that would use cells 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11, leaving cells 3,6,9,12,13,14,15, which is 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, placing one 2x2 in cells 2,3,5,6, and another in cells 8,9,11,12, which uses cells 2,3,5,6,8,9,11,12, leaving cells 1,4,7,10,13,14,15, again 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

It seems that the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is 2, using 8 cells, leaving 7 for 1x1 icons.

Now, the problem is to minimize the number of screens needed to place all the icons.

Given that, I need to maximize the use of each screen by placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, since they take up more space.

But, I also need to consider how the 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.

Wait, but in the arrangement where two 2x2 icons are placed, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if only one 2x2 icon is placed, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, no 2x2 icons, using all 15 cells for 1x1 icons.

I need to decide, for a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, what's the optimal way to arrange them to minimize the number of screens.

Let me think in terms of how many screens are needed based on the number of 2x2 icons.

If I have y 2x2 icons, and each screen can hold at most 2 of them, then the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 2).

But, since placing 2x2 icons also affects the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on the same screen, I need to consider that.

Wait, in the arrangement where two 2x2 icons are placed, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen, if I place two 2x2 icons, I can place up to 7 1x1 icons along with them.

Alternatively, if I place one 2x2 icon, I can place up to 11 1x1 icons.

Or, if I don't place any 2x2 icons, I can place up to 15 1x1 icons.

I need to maximize the use of screen space, so I should try to place as many 2x2 icons as possible, but also make sure that the remaining space is used efficiently for 1x1 icons.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons, which is ceil(y / 2).

2. Then, calculate the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons.

3. Subtract the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens from the total x.

4. Finally, calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons, if any.

But, I need to make sure that the remaining space on the screens with 2x2 icons is used optimally for 1x1 icons.

Let's formalize this.

Let s be the number of screens needed.

First, s = ceil(y / 2), because each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons.

Then, the total number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on these s screens is s * 7, since each screen with two 2x2 icons can have up to 7 1x1 icons.

If x <= s * 7, then s screens are sufficient.

Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons are x - s * 7, and each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons (since no 2x2 icons are placed on them).

So, the additional screens needed are ceil((x - s * 7)/15).

Therefore, the total number of screens is s + ceil((x - s * 7)/15).

But, we need to make sure that s is at least ceil(y / 2).

Wait, actually, s is already ceil(y / 2), and then we add ceil((x - s * 7)/15), if x - s * 7 > 0.

Also, if y is zero, then s = 0, but we need to handle the case when x is non-zero.

Wait, but in the initial step, s = ceil(y / 2), which is correct.

Let me see with an example.

Take the first test case: x=1, y=1.

s = ceil(1 / 2) = 1 screen.

This screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But we have only one 2x2 icon and one 1x1 icon, so one screen is sufficient.

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=7, y=2.

s = ceil(2 / 2) = 1 screen.

This screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

We have seven 1x1 icons, so one screen is sufficient.

Again matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=12, y=4.

s = ceil(4 / 2) = 2 screens.

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed: 2 * 7 = 14, which is more than 12.

Hence, two screens are sufficient.

Matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=3.

s = ceil(3 / 2) = 2 screens.

Each screen can hold two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But y=3, so on the first screen, place two 2x2 icons, and on the second screen, place one 2x2 icon.

Total screens needed are two, which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=1, y=0.

s = ceil(0 / 2) = 0 screens.

But we have one 1x1 icon, so additional screens needed: ceil(1 / 15) = 1 screen.

Total screens: 0 + 1 = 1.

But according to the sample input, when t=11, and the inputs are:

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

The corresponding outputs are:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Wait, for x=1, y=0, the output is 1, which matches my calculation.

For x=0, y=0, output is 0, which makes sense.

For x=0, y=9, output is 5.

Let's check: s = ceil(9 / 2) = 5 screens.

Each screen holds two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons.

But y=9, so 5 screens can hold 10 2x2 icons, which is more than enough for y=9.

But actually, 5 screens can hold 10 2x2 icons, but y=9, so one screen will have only one 2x2 icon and seven 1x1 icons.

But since x=0, no 1x1 icons, so five screens are needed just for the nine 2x2 icons.

Wait, but ceil(9 / 2) = 5, so five screens are needed.

Yes, matches the sample output.

Seems like the approach is correct.

Now, let's see how the given program implements this logic.

The program is:

def func():

n = int(input())

for i in range(n):

(a, b) = input().split()

a = int(a)

b = int(b)

t = b

if t % 2 == 0:

t = t // 2

else:

t = t // 2 + 1

t1 = t * 15 - b * 4

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

print(t)

Let's analyze this step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases, n.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, it sets t = b (which is y, the number of 2x2 icons).

Then, it checks if t is even:

if t % 2 == 0:

t = t // 2

else:

t = t // 2 + 1

This is equivalent to t = ceil(b / 2), which is the number of screens needed just for the 2x2 icons.

Then, it calculates t1 = t * 15 - b * 4.

Let's see what this represents.

t is the number of screens used for the 2x2 icons.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells.

So, t * 15 is the total cells used by t screens.

b * 4 is the total cells used by b 2x2 icons.

So, t * 15 - b * 4 is the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

But, in reality, when t screens are used for b 2x2 icons, the number of cells used by the 2x2 icons is b * 4, and the remaining cells are t * 15 - b * 4.

But, in our earlier approach, we considered that each screen with two 2x2 icons has 7 remaining cells.

Wait, with t screens and b 2x2 icons, the remaining cells are t * 15 - b * 4.

Then, t1 = t * 15 - b * 4 is the number of cells available for 1x1 icons.

If t1 >= a, meaning that the remaining cells can accommodate all the 1x1 icons, then t screens are sufficient.

Else, the remaining 1x1 icons are a - t1, and we need additional screens to accommodate them.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons (since no 2x2 icons are placed on them).

So, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((a - t1)/15).

Therefore, the total number of screens is t + ceil((a - t1)/15).

But in the code, it's written as:

if t1 >= a:

t = t

else:

t2 = a - t1

if t2 % 15 == 0:

t = t + t2 // 15

else:

t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

Which is exactly calculating t + ceil((a - t1)/15).

Hence, the logic in the code matches our reasoning.

Therefore, the program is correct.
