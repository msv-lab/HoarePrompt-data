Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm the CEO of a startup, and I need to buy tickets for my employees to a concert. There are n days to buy tickets, and each day has a certain price per ticket, given by the list a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on a particular day, the price per ticket increases by x for all subsequent days.

My goal is to buy exactly k tickets at the minimum total cost.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's look at the example to get a better grasp.

In the first test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 3

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6, 4, 2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4, 2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10

In the second test case:

n = 4, m = 2, k = 8

a = [8, 6, 4, 2]

The only way is to buy 2 tickets each day:

- Day 1: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16; prices become [8, 6, 4]

- Day 2: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16; prices become [8, 6]

- Day 3: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16; prices become [8]

- Day 4: 2 tickets at 8 each, total 16

Total cost = 64

From these examples, it seems that the strategy is to delay buying tickets as much as possible to take advantage of lower prices later, but with the constraint that buying tickets increases future prices.

Let me think about this differently. Since buying tickets increases future prices, it seems like a trade-off between buying now at a lower price but increasing future prices, or waiting for lower prices but potentially needing to buy more later at higher prices.

I need to find a way to minimize the total cost. Maybe I can model this as selecting certain days to buy certain numbers of tickets, considering the increasing prices for future days.

Let me consider sorting the days based on their initial prices. If I sort the days in increasing order of a_i, that might help me decide which days to buy tickets on.

Wait, but the prices change based on how many tickets I buy on previous days. This seems complicated.

Another approach: since the price increase is uniform across all future days for each ticket bought, maybe I can think in terms of the total price paid per ticket considering the increases.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote:

- Let’s say I buy x1 tickets on day 1

- Then, on day 2, the price increases by x1, so the price per ticket on day 2 is a2 + x1

- Similarly, if I buy x2 tickets on day 2, then on day 3, the price increases by x1 + x2, so the price is a3 + x1 + x2

- And so on.

Wait, actually, the problem says that buying x tickets on day i increases the price by x for all subsequent days. So, the price on day j (j > i) becomes a_j + x.

So, if I buy x1 on day 1, then for days 2 to n, the price is a_j + x1

Then, if I buy x2 on day 2, for days 3 to n, the price becomes a_j + x1 + x2

And so on.

Given this, it seems like the order of buying matters, but since the days are fixed, I need to decide how many tickets to buy on each day, respecting the constraint that I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I decide how many tickets to buy on each day, considering the increased prices for future days.

However, given the constraints (n up to 3e5, m up to 1e9, k up to min(nm, 1e9)), a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost.

Let me consider the following idea:

- Since buying x tickets on day i increases the price by x for all future days, the total price increase for future days is x * (n - i)

- So, each ticket bought on day i has an immediate cost of a_i, and an additional cost of (n - i - 1) * x for future days.

Wait, no. Let's think again.

If I buy x tickets on day i, then for each of the remaining days (j > i), the price increases by x.

So, the total additional cost for future days is x * sum of number of tickets bought on future days.

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, respecting the m limit per day, and ensure that the total is k.

Then, the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j) * x_i

Because each x_i is bought at price a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

This seems like a sum of products, where each x_i is multiplied by a_i plus the sum of previous x_j's.

I need to minimize this total cost.

This looks similar to minimizing the sum of a sequence where each term is multiplied by a cumulative sum.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider that the order of days doesn't matter because the price increases are uniform for all future days based on the tickets bought on previous days.

Wait, but the days have specific prices, so the order does matter.

Alternatively, maybe I can reorder the days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Let me think about sorting the days based on their original prices.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can try to buy as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest a_i, but considering the constraints on m and the increasing prices for future days.

But, since buying on a day with a low a_i increases the prices for future days, it might not be optimal to buy on those days.

On the other hand, buying on days with higher a_i would mean that future days have higher prices as well.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I decide to buy x_i tickets on day i.

Then, the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

This is because each x_i is bought at the price a_i plus the sum of all x_j for j < i.

Let me denote s_i = sum over j from 1 to i of x_j

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

And the total cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

This can be rewritten as sum over i from 1 to n of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1})

This seems complicated to minimize directly.

Maybe I can think of this as a cumulative sum.

Let me try to find a way to express this total cost in terms of s_i.

Let me denote s_0 = 0

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

And the cost is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1}

Which is sum over i from 1 to n of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

This seems like a non-linear function in terms of s_i, which makes it hard to minimize directly.

Perhaps I need to consider the derivative with respect to x_i, but since x_i are integers bounded by m, that might not help.

Let me consider small values of n to see a pattern.

Take n=2, m=2, k=3

Wait, but m=2, k=3, so I need to buy 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2.

With a=[1,2]

Then, buying 2 on day 1: cost=2*1=2, prices for day 2 become a2 +2=4

Then, buying 1 on day 2: cost=4, total cost=6

Alternatively, buying 1 on day 1: cost=1, prices for day 2 become a2 +1=3

Then, buying 2 on day 2: cost=6, total cost=7

So, the first approach is better.

Another option: buying 0 on day 1, prices for day 2 become a2 +0=2

Then, buying 3 on day 2: cost=6, total cost=6

Same as previous.

Wait, in this case, it's the same cost.

But according to the problem constraints, m=2, so buying 3 on day 2 is not allowed.

Wait, in this case, k=3 and m=2, so I must buy at least one on day 1.

Wait, no, if n=2, m=2, k=3, I can buy 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2.

Alternatively, buy 1 on day 1 and 2 on day 2.

Or buy 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2.

All these result in the same total cost.

Wait, but in the first approach, cost is 2*1 +1*3=2+3=5

In the second approach, 1*1 +2*3=1+6=7

Wait, in this case, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2 gives a lower cost.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, buying 2 on day 1 and 1 on day 2:

Cost day 1: 2*1=2

Prices for day 2: a2 +2=4

Cost day 2:1*4=4

Total:6

Wait, in the alternative approach, buying 1 on day 1 and 2 on day 2:

Cost day 1:1*1=1

Prices for day 2: a2 +1=3

Cost day 2:2*3=6

Total:7

So, indeed, buying more on earlier days seems better.

Wait, but in the first test case, buying on later days was better.

This is confusing.

Let me think again.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a=[8,6,4,2]

Buying 0 on day1: prices become [6,4,2]

Buying 0 on day2: prices become [4,2]

Buying 1 on day3: cost=4, prices become [3]

Buying 2 on day4: cost=6

Total:10

Alternatively, buying 2 on day1: cost=16, prices become [8,6,4]

Buying 2 on day2: cost=16, prices become [8,6]

Buying 2 on day3: cost=16, prices become [8]

Buying 2 on day4: cost=16

But k=3, so only need to buy 3 tickets.

Wait, but in this case, buying on earlier days is more expensive.

Wait, a=[8,6,4,2]

If I buy 2 on day1: cost=16, prices become [8,6,4]

Then buy 1 on day2: cost=7 (6+1*1), since buying one ticket increases the price for day3 by1, so day3 price becomes 4+1=5

Then, total cost=16+7=23, which is worse than the optimal 10.

Wait, but in the optimal approach, buying on later days is better because the prices are lower, even though buying on later days doesn't increase the prices as much.

Wait, maybe I need to prioritize buying on days with lower a_i + the accumulated increases.

But considering the constraints, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider another approach.

Let's consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j from 1 to i-1 of x_j)

Let s_i = sum over j from 1 to i of x_j

Then s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

So, the cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum over i of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1})

But s_{i-1} = s_{i-2} + x_{i-1}, and so on.

This seems recursive, but maybe not helpful for minimization.

Let me try to rearrange this.

Total cost C = sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

The second term is sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

But s_{i-1} is the cumulative sum up to day i-1.

So, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

This seems like a quadratic term in x_i.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that the problem can be transformed into selecting a subset of days to buy tickets, considering the increasing prices.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to sort the days based on their adjusted prices.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i plus the accumulated increases.

But since the increases depend on the number of tickets bought on previous days, it's interdependent.

This seems too recursive.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

Suppose I always buy tickets on the day with the current lowest price, considering the accumulated increases.

So, I sort the days based on a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

But since I don't know x_j in advance, I can't sort them statically.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and then decide how many tickets to buy on each day.

But, as I buy tickets on earlier days, it increases the prices for later days.

So, buying on cheaper days might not be optimal because it makes future days more expensive.

Alternatively, buying on more expensive days might not be optimal because you're paying more upfront.

It's a trade-off.

Maybe I need to find a balance where I buy enough on days with reasonable prices without making future days too expensive.

This seems tricky to balance, especially with large n and k.

Let me consider the constraints again.

n can be up to 3e5, m up to 1e9, k up to min(nm, 1e9).

So, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n log n) at worst.

Given the time constraints, I need something efficient.

Let me think about sorting the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints.

But, since buying on cheaper days increases the prices for future days, it might not be optimal.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total increase in price due to buying x tickets on a particular day.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the total cost.

Let me consider that each ticket has a cost based on the day it's bought, plus the sum of x_j for all j < i.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day i has a cost of a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x1, x2, ..., xn, with x_i <= m and sum x_i = k.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

Let me denote s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

So, the cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum over i of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1})

This seems like a function that's quadratic in s_i.

Maybe I can find a way to minimize this by choosing the right s_i.

But s_i is cumulative, so it's constrained by previous choices.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me consider the dual problem.

Suppose I fix the total number of tickets k, and I need to distribute them across n days, with each day having a maximum of m tickets.

Additionally, the price per ticket on day i is a_i plus the sum of x_j for j < i.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the days, maintaining the current price for each day, and always choose to buy as many tickets as possible on the day with the lowest current price.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

So, I can sort the days based on their current price, and buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest day, then update the prices for the remaining days, and repeat until I've bought all k tickets.

But with n up to 3e5, this would be too slow if implemented naively.

I need a way to efficiently find the day with the lowest current price and update the prices for all remaining days when I buy tickets on a particular day.

This sounds like a priority queue (min-heap) problem.

I can maintain a min-heap of the days, sorted by their current price.

Each time, I pop the day with the lowest current price, buy as many tickets as possible on that day (up to m), update the total cost, and then increase the price of that day by the number of tickets bought.

Then, push it back into the heap if there are still remaining tickets to buy.

Wait, but in this problem, buying x tickets on a day increases the price by x for all subsequent days.

So, it's not just increasing the price of that day, but all future days.

This complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain a global increase value, which is the sum of x_j for all j < i.

Then, the current price for day i is a_i plus the global increase.

When I buy x tickets on a day, I increase the global increase by x.

Then, for the remaining days, their prices are a_j plus the global increase.

This seems more manageable.

So, I can sort the days based on their initial a_i, and decide in what order to buy tickets on them.

But I need to consider that buying on a day increases the prices for all remaining days.

So, perhaps buying on days with lower a_i should be prioritized, but with the understanding that it increases the prices for future days.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can consider buying tickets on the days with the lowest a_i first.

But, since buying on these days increases the prices for all future days, it might not be optimal to buy too many on these days.

Alternatively, if I buy on days with higher a_i, the increase in prices for future days is applied to higher a_i, which might be less impactful.

This is still confusing.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

- Then, decide how many tickets to buy on each day, starting from the lowest a_i.

- But, each time I buy x tickets on a day, I increase the a_i for all future days by x.

- So, I need to find a distribution of x_i on each day i, such that sum x_i = k, x_i <= m, and the total cost is minimized.

This still seems too vague.

Let me consider the cost function again.

Total cost C = sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

Let me denote s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

So, C = sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum over i of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1})

This can be rewritten as sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

Now, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

This is equivalent to sum over all pairs (j,i) with j < i of x_j * x_i

So, C = sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over all pairs (j,i) with j < i of x_j * x_i

This seems like a quadratic form.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of matrix multiplication or something similar.

But, given the constraints, this might not be helpful.

Let me consider that the total cost C can be expressed as sum over i of x_i * b_i, where b_i = a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j

But since b_i depends on x_j for j < i, it's still interdependent.

This seems too circular.

Let me try to think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the number of tickets bought on each day, x1, x2, ..., xn.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

This can be rewritten as sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j

Which is sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of sum over j=1 to i-1 of (x_i * x_j)

This seems like a sum of individual costs plus interaction costs between different days.

Minimizing this directly is not straightforward.

Perhaps I need to consider the problem in a different way.

Let me consider that the total increase in price for future days is proportional to the number of tickets bought on previous days.

So, perhaps I can think in terms of prefix sums.

Let me denote s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j

Then, the price on day i is a_i + s_{i-1}

And x_i <= m, with s_n = k

So, I need to minimize sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Given that s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i, and s_0 = 0, s_n = k

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where I can define dp[i][s] as the minimum cost to buy s tickets in the first i days.

But with n up to 3e5, and s up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into assigning k tickets to n days, with each day having a cost that depends on the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

This seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each ticket bought on day i has a cost of a_i plus the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

So, the cost of the p-th ticket bought on day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on days 1 to i-1.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of assigning tickets to days, and calculating the cost for each ticket based on the day it's assigned to and the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

This seems too involved.

Let me consider that the total cost is the sum over all tickets of the price on the day they are bought, plus the number of tickets bought on all previous days.

So, for each ticket, its cost is the price on its day plus the number of tickets bought on all days before its day.

This seems correct.

So, to minimize the total cost, I need to assign tickets to days in such a way that the sum of these per-ticket costs is minimized.

So, for each ticket, its cost is a_i (price on day i) plus the number of tickets assigned to days before i.

Given that, perhaps I can sort the days based on a_i and assign as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i, considering the constraints.

But, since assigning tickets to earlier days increases the cost of tickets assigned to later days, it's a trade-off.

Wait, maybe I can sort the days in increasing order of a_i and assign tickets accordingly.

Let me try to think about it.

Suppose I sort the days such that a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n

Then, I need to assign x1, x2, ..., xn tickets to these days, with x_i <= m and sum x_i = k

The total cost is sum over all tickets of (a_j + number of tickets assigned to days before j)

Where j is the day assigned to the ticket.

This seems complex to minimize directly.

Let me consider that for each ticket assigned to day j, its cost is a_j plus the sum of x_i for i < j

So, the cost for all tickets assigned to day j is x_j * a_j + x_j * sum over i=1 to j-1 of x_i

This is similar to what I had earlier.

So, total cost C = sum over j of (x_j * a_j + x_j * s_{j-1}), where s_{j-1} = sum over i=1 to j-1 of x_i

This seems the same as before.

I need to find a way to minimize this.

Let me consider that s_{j-1} is fixed when I decide x_j.

Wait, but s_{j-1} depends on the previous x_i's.

This seems too interdependent.

Maybe I can fix the order of days and decide how many tickets to buy on each day in that order.

But with n up to 3e5, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider that if I sort the days in increasing order of a_i, then assigning more tickets to days with lower a_i would be beneficial, but considering the increase in prices for future days.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the minimum cost by considering the days in sorted order and assigning tickets accordingly.

Let me try to think about it.

Suppose I sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

Then, I can consider assigning tickets to these days in this order, but keeping in mind that assigning tickets to earlier days increases the cost for future days.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the sorted days and assign as many tickets as possible to each day, considering the constraints.

But I need to make sure that the total cost is minimized.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a minimum cost assignment problem.

But with n up to 3e5, I need something more efficient.

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into assigning tickets to days, where each ticket assigned to day j has a cost of a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

So, for each ticket, its cost is a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

To minimize the total cost, I need to assign tickets to days such that the sum of these per-ticket costs is minimized.

This seems like I should assign tickets to days with the lowest a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

But since the number of tickets assigned to previous days is cumulative, it's not straightforward.

Let me consider that for each ticket, I can assign it to day j, and its cost would be a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to days before j.

So, to minimize the total cost, I should assign tickets to days in order of increasing a_j plus the number of tickets assigned to previous days.

But this is recursive because the number of tickets assigned to previous days depends on the assignments.

This seems too circular.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the order of days and decide how many tickets to buy on each day.

Then, the total cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

This seems similar to the sum of a sequence where each term is multiplied by its prefix sum.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the problem can be modeled as a linear assignment problem, where I assign tickets to days, considering the increasing prices.

But with k up to 1e9, this is not feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the total cost can be expressed as sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1}

Which is sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of x_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

This is equal to sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over i of sum over j=1 to i-1 of (x_i * x_j)

This seems like a quadratic form.

Maybe I can think of it in terms of matrix multiplication.

But with n up to 3e5, this is not practical.

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into minimizing a quadratic function.

Given that, perhaps there's a mathematical formula or a known algorithm to solve this.

But I need something more concrete.

Let me consider that the total cost C can be expressed as sum over i of x_i * c_i, where c_i = a_i + sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j

But since c_i depends on x_j for j < i, it's still interdependent.

This seems too recursive.

Let me try to think about the problem in terms of prefix sums.

Let me denote s_i = sum over j=1 to i of x_j

Then, s_i = s_{i-1} + x_i

And the cost is sum over i of x_i * (a_i + s_{i-1})

Which is sum over i of (x_i * a_i + x_i * s_{i-1})

Now, s_{i-1} = sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j

So, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (s_{i-1})

This seems like sum over all pairs (j,i) with j < i of x_j * x_i

This is getting too complicated.

Let me consider that the total cost C can be expressed as sum over i of x_i * a_i + sum over all pairs (j,i) with j < i of x_j * x_i

This seems correct.

Now, to minimize C, I need to find x_i's such that sum x_i = k, x_i <= m, and C is minimized.

This seems like a optimization problem with constraints.

Given the complexity, perhaps there's a mathematical formula or a known algorithm to solve this efficiently.

Let me consider that the problem can be transformed into assigning tickets to days in a way that minimizes the sum of individual costs plus interaction costs.

But I need something more concrete.

Let me consider that the problem can be solved by sorting the days in increasing order of a_i and then assigning tickets accordingly.

So, sort the days such that a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n

Then, assign as many tickets as possible to the first day (cheapest), then to the second day, and so on, respecting the constraint that no more than m tickets can be bought per day.

However, since buying tickets on earlier days increases the prices for future days, it might not be optimal to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days.

Wait, in the first test case, the optimal approach was to buy on later days with lower a_i, considering the increases.

This contradicts the idea of buying on the cheapest days first.

So, perhaps sorting in decreasing order of a_i is better.

But in the second test case, buying on the first day is more expensive, but it increases the prices for future days.

So, it's not clear.

This is confusing.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is achieved by distributing the tickets in such a way that the sum of the costs is minimized, taking into account the increases.

Perhaps I can think of it in terms of water filling algorithm, where I fill the "lowest" available slots first.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is achieved by assigning as many tickets as possible to the days with the lowest a_i, but considering the increases due to previous purchases.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the days sorted by a_i, and assign tickets to them, updating the global increase accordingly.

So, here's an idea:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

- Initialize a global increase value to 0.

- Iterate through the sorted days.

- For each day, calculate the available tickets as min(m, remaining k)

- Assign as many tickets as possible to this day, up to m or remaining k.

- Add the cost for these tickets: (a_i + global_increase) * number_of_tickets

- Increase the global_increase by the number of tickets assigned to this day.

- Repeat until all k tickets are assigned.

This seems like a greedy approach.

Let me test this with the first test case.

First test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

Initialize global_increase=0

Iterate through sorted days:

Day with a_i=2:

Assign min(m, k)=min(2,3)=2 tickets

Cost: (2 + 0)*2 = 4

global_increase +=2 → global_increase=2

Remaining k=1

Day with a_i=4:

Assign min(m, k)=min(2,1)=1 ticket

Cost: (4 + 2)*1 = 6

global_increase +=1 → global_increase=3

Remaining k=0

Total cost:4+6=10

Which matches the optimal cost in the example.

Let's try the second test case.

Second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

Initialize global_increase=0

Iterate through sorted days:

Day with a_i=2:

Assign min(m, k)=min(2,8)=2 tickets

Cost: (2 + 0)*2 = 4

global_increase +=2 → global_increase=2

Remaining k=6

Day with a_i=4:

Assign min(m, k)=min(2,6)=2 tickets

Cost: (4 + 2)*2 = 12

global_increase +=2 → global_increase=4

Remaining k=4

Day with a_i=6:

Assign min(m, k)=min(2,4)=2 tickets

Cost: (6 + 4)*2 = 20

global_increase +=2 → global_increase=6

Remaining k=2

Day with a_i=8:

Assign min(m, k)=min(2,2)=2 tickets

Cost: (8 + 6)*2 = 28

global_increase +=2 → global_increase=8

Remaining k=0

Total cost:4+12+20+28=64

Which matches the example.

Another test case:

n=5, m=100, k=1

a=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

Sort a: [1,10,100,1000,10000]

Initialize global_increase=0

Assign min(100,1)=1 ticket to the first day with a_i=1

Cost: (1 + 0)*1 =1

global_increase +=1 → global_increase=1

Remaining k=0

Total cost:1

Which matches the third test case.

Last test case:

n=6, m=3, k=9

a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

Sort a: [5,5,5,5,5,5]

Initialize global_increase=0

Assign min(3,9)=3 tickets to first day

Cost: (5 + 0)*3=15

global_increase +=3 → global_increase=3

Remaining k=6

Assign min(3,6)=3 tickets to second day

Cost: (5 + 3)*3=24

global_increase +=3 → global_increase=6

Remaining k=3

Assign min(3,3)=3 tickets to third day

Cost: (5 + 6)*3=33

global_increase +=3 → global_increase=9

Remaining k=0

Total cost:15+24+33=72

Which matches the fourth test case.

So, this greedy approach seems to work for the given examples.

Therefore, the strategy is:

- Sort the days in increasing order of a_i.

- Initialize a global_increase to 0.

- Iterate through the sorted days:

- Assign as many tickets as possible to the current day, up to m or remaining k.

- Add the cost: (a_i + global_increase) * number_of_tickets

- Update global_increase by adding the number of tickets assigned to this day.

- Subtract the assigned tickets from remaining k.

- Continue until k=0.

This seems efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, which is acceptable given n <= 3e5.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

l.sort()

s = 0

c = k * k / 2

for i in range(n):

s = min(m, k)

k -= s

c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2

print(int(c))



First, it reads the number of test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, m, k and the list l of a_i's.

It sorts l in increasing order.

Then, it initializes s=0 and c=k*k/2

Then, it iterates through the sorted list:

s = min(m, k)

k -= s

c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2

Finally, it prints int(c)

Now, let's see if this matches the logic I described.

In my logic, the total cost is sum over assigned tickets of (a_i + number of tickets assigned to previous days).

In the program, it's calculating c as k*k/2 plus sum over days of l[i]*s - s*s/2.

Wait, where does k*k/2 come from?

Let's see.

In my earlier derivation, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over all pairs (j,i) with j < i of x_j * x_i

Which is equivalent to sum over j < i of x_j * x_i

This is the interaction cost between different days.

If I consider that s_{i-1} = sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j

Then, sum over i of x_i * s_{i-1} = sum over i of x_i * (sum over j=1 to i-1 of x_j)

Which is sum over j < i of x_j * x_i

This is indeed equal to (sum over all x_i)^2 / 2 - sum over i of x_i^2 / 2

Which is k^2 / 2 - sum over i of x_i*(x_i -1)/2

Wait, more precisely:

sum over j < i of x_j * x_i = (sum over all x_i)^2 / 2 - sum over i of x_i^2 / 2

Because (sum x)^2 = sum x_i^2 + sum over j < i of 2*x_j*x_i

So, sum over j < i of x_j*x_i = (sum x)^2 - sum x_i^2 / 2

Wait, no.

Actually, sum over j < i of x_j*x_i is equal to (sum x)^2 - sum x_i^2)/2

Because sum over all j < i of x_j*x_i + sum over j > i of x_j*x_i = sum x_j * sum x_i - sum x_i^2

But sum over j < i of x_j*x_i = sum over j < i of x_j*x_i

This is getting too complicated.

But in the program, c is initialized to k*k/2, and then for each day, it adds l[i]*s - s*s/2

So, total c = k*k/2 + sum over days of l[i]*s - s*s/2

I need to verify if this equals the total cost as per my earlier logic.

Wait, perhaps the author is using some mathematical optimization to compute the total cost efficiently.

But I'm not sure about this formula.

Let me verify it with the first test case.

First test case:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a=[8,6,4,2]

sorted a=[2,4,6,8]

Initialize c=3*3/2=4.5

Iterate through days:

Day1: s=min(2,3)=2

k=3-2=1

c += 2*2 - 2*2/2 =4 -2=2 → c=4.5+2=6.5

Day2: s=min(2,1)=1

k=1-1=0

c +=4*1 -1*1/2=4-0.5=3.5 → c=6.5+3.5=10

Total c=10, which matches the expected cost.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a=[8,6,4,2]

sorted a=[2,4,6,8]

c=8*8/2=32

Iterate through days:

Day1: s=2

k=8-2=6

c +=2*2 -2*2/2=4-2=2 → c=32+2=34

Day2: s=2

k=6-2=4

c +=4*2 -2*2/2=8-2=6 → c=34+6=40

Day3: s=2

k=4-2=2

c +=6*2 -2*2/2=12-2=10 → c=40+10=50

Day4: s=2

k=2-2=0

c +=8*2 -2*2/2=16-2=14 → c=50+14=64

Total c=64, matches the expected cost.

Similarly, for the third test case:

n=5, m=100, k=1

a=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

sorted a=[1,10,100,1000,10000]

c=1*1/2=0.5

Day1: s=1

k=1-1=0

c +=1*1 -1*1/2=1-0.5=0.5 → c=0.5+0.5=1

Total c=1, matches expected.

Fourth test case:

n=6, m=3, k=9

a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

sorted a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

c=9*9/2=40.5

Day1:
