Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a "diagonal" in this grid. In a square grid, diagonals can be either leading from the top-left to bottom-right or from the top-right to bottom-left. For an n x n grid, there are a total of 4n - 2 diagonals. I think this is because for the main direction (top-left to bottom-right), there are n diagonals, and for the other direction (top-right to bottom-left), there are also n diagonals. Then, for the additional diagonals that are offset from these main ones, there are another 2(n-1) diagonals. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused about the exact count.

Let me try to visualize this. Take a 3x3 grid:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

The main diagonals are:

- 1,5,9 (main diagonal)

- 3,5,7 (other main diagonal)

Then there are the diagonals offset by one:

- 2,6

- 4,8

So in total, for n=3, there are 4 diagonals in one direction and 4 in the other, but wait, according to the problem, it's 4n - 2 = 10 diagonals. Hmm, maybe I'm missing some.

Wait, perhaps diagonals are considered in both directions, and each direction has 2n - 1 diagonals. So total diagonals would be 4n - 2.

For n=3:

- Main diagonal: 1,5,9

- One cell above: 2,6

- One cell below: 4,8

- Other main diagonal: 3,5,7

- One cell above: 1,7

- One cell below: 3,9

Wait, that seems like 6 diagonals in one direction and 4 in the other, but that doesn't match 4n - 2 = 10.

I need to clarify how diagonals are counted. Maybe the problem considers all possible diagonals in both directions.

Let me check for n=2:

Grid:

1 2

3 4

Diagonals:

- Main diagonal: 1,4

- Other diagonal: 2,3

- Then, single cell diagonals: each individual cell can be considered a diagonal of length 1, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps only diagonals of length >=1 are considered. For n=2, 4n-2=6 diagonals. But visually, I only see 2 main diagonals and then possibly others if we consider shorter diagonals.

I think I need to refer back to the problem statement to understand exactly what is meant by "diagonals."

The problem says: "Note that the square grid of size n x n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals."

So, for n=2, 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Similarly, for n=3, 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals.

I need to find a pattern or formula that allows me to cover k diagonals with the fewest colored cells.

Now, the program provided seems to handle this problem. Let's look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k == 1:

print(1)

continue

if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

First, it reads the number of test cases, t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and k.

There's a special case when k == 1, in which case it prints 1.

Then, there's a condition: if k <= 2*(n + (n - 2)), it prints ceil(k / 2), else it prints floor(k / 2) + 1.

Wait, math.ceil(k / 2) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to k / 2.

k // 2 + 1 is the floor of k / 2 plus 1, which is essentially ceil(k / 2).

Wait, in Python, for integers, math.ceil(k / 2) is the same as (k + 1) // 2.

Similarly, k // 2 + 1 is equal to (k + 1) // 2.

So, both expressions are equivalent to ceil(k / 2).

But in the code, it's written differently, which might be confusing.

Wait, actually, k // 2 + 1 is not always equal to ceil(k / 2).

For example, k=3:

ceil(3 / 2) = 2

3 // 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2

k=4:

ceil(4 / 2) = 2

4 // 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

So, they are not always equal.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Let me verify with the sample input and output.

Sample Input:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Sample Output:

2

2

6

5

4

6

2

Let's see for n=3, k=4:

According to the code:

k=4 <= 2*(3 + (3 - 2)) = 2*(3 + 1) = 8

So, print ceil(4 / 2) = 2, which matches the sample output.

For n=3, k=3:

k=3 <= 8

ceil(3 / 2) = 2, matches sample output.

For n=3, k=10:

k=10 > 8

print(10 // 2 + 1) = 5 + 1 = 6, matches sample output.

For n=3, k=9:

k=9 > 8

print(9 // 2 + 1) = 4 + 1 = 5, matches sample output.

For n=4, k=7:

k=7 <= 2*(4 + (4 - 2)) = 2*(4 + 2) = 12

ceil(7 / 2) = 4, matches sample output.

For n=7, k=11:

k=11 <= 2*(7 + (7 - 2)) = 2*(7 + 5) = 24

ceil(11 / 2) = 6, matches sample output.

For n=2, k=3:

k=3 <= 2*(2 + (2 - 2)) = 2*(2 + 0) = 4

ceil(3 / 2) = 2, matches sample output.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

But I need to understand why this logic works.

First, I need to understand the structure of the diagonals in the grid.

Let's consider the two types of diagonals: those sloping down to the right and those sloping down to the left.

For an n x n grid:

- Number of diagonals sloping down to the right: 2n - 1

- Number of diagonals sloping down to the left: 2n - 1

- Total diagonals: 4n - 2

But according to the problem, it's 4n - 2 diagonals in total.

Wait, but in reality, for an n x n grid, the number of diagonals in one direction is 2n - 1, and in the other direction is also 2n - 1, so total 4n - 2 diagonals.

But in the code, there's 2*(n + (n - 2)) = 4n - 4, which seems off.

Wait, perhaps there's a different way to group the diagonals.

Let me think about how to cover diagonals with the fewest cells.

Each cell can be part of two diagonals: one sloping down to the right and one sloping down to the left.

Wait, no, in general, a cell is part of two diagonals, unless it's on the edge.

But for the purpose of this problem, we need to ensure that at least one cell in each of the specified k diagonals is colored.

To minimize the number of colored cells, we need to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each colored cell.

So, ideally, each colored cell should cover two diagonals.

But some diagonals might only be covered by one cell, especially if they are short diagonals.

Wait, in a grid, the main diagonals that run from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left have different lengths.

For example, in a 3x3 grid:

- The main diagonal (1,5,9) has 3 cells.

- The other main diagonal (3,5,7) has 3 cells.

- Diagonals like (2,6) and (4,8) have 2 cells.

- Single cells can be considered as diagonals of length 1, but I'm not sure.

According to the problem, for n=3, there are 4n - 2 = 10 diagonals.

So, perhaps there are 10 diagonals in total.

Now, to cover k diagonals with the fewest cells, we need to find a way to maximize the overlap, i.e., have each cell cover as many diagonals as possible.

Since each cell can cover two diagonals, in the best case, each colored cell covers two diagonals.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, we would need ceil(k / 2) cells.

But the code has a condition:

if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

Wait, 2 * (n + (n - 2)) = 2*(2n - 2) = 4n - 4.

So, for k <= 4n - 4, use ceil(k / 2), else use floor(k / 2) + 1.

But in the earlier sample inputs, for n=3, k=10, which is equal to 4*3 - 2 = 10, it uses floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

But according to the sample output, it's 6, which matches.

Wait, but 4n - 4 is 8 for n=3, and k=10 > 8, so it uses floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6.

But in the sample input where n=3, k=9, it's floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 5, which matches the sample output of 5.

Similarly, for n=4, k=7, which is less than 4*4 - 4 = 12, so ceil(7 / 2) = 4, matches sample output.

Wait, but earlier I thought ceil(k / 2) is the same as floor(k / 2) + 1, but that's not always true, as ceil(4 / 2) = 2 and floor(4 / 2) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which is different.

So, why does the code use different formulas based on the value of k?

I need to understand when to use ceil(k / 2) and when to use floor(k / 2) + 1.

Perhaps there's a threshold where beyond a certain number of diagonals, the coverage changes.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps for k <= some value, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient, but beyond that value, more cells are needed.

But according to the sample inputs, it seems to work correctly.

Wait, perhaps the condition is to handle cases where k exceeds a certain number of diagonals that can be covered with a certain number of cells.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose we have an n x n grid.

Each cell can cover two diagonals.

So, in theory, with m cells, we can cover up to 2m diagonals.

But in practice, there might be overlaps and dependencies.

If we need to cover k diagonals, the minimal number of cells required would be ceil(k / 2), assuming that each cell covers two unique diagonals.

However, in reality, some diagonals might only be coverable by specific cells, leading to a situation where certain diagonals can only be covered by one cell.

For example, in the smallest diagonals consisting of only one cell, that cell must be colored to cover that diagonal.

But the problem allows for k to be up to 4n - 2, which is the total number of diagonals.

In such cases, if k is small, we can cover them efficiently with ceil(k / 2) cells.

But if k is large, approaching the total number of diagonals, we might need more cells to cover the remaining diagonals.

Wait, but in the code, for k <= 4n - 4, it uses ceil(k / 2), and for k >= 4n - 2, it uses floor(k / 2) + 1.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=10 (which is 4n - 2), it uses floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for k=9, which is less than 10, it uses floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 5, which also matches.

Wait, but in another test case, n=4, k=7, which is less than 4*4 - 4 = 12, so it uses ceil(7 / 2) = 4, which matches the sample output.

So, the condition seems to be working correctly.

But I still don't understand why there's a distinction based on k <= 4n - 4.

Perhaps, for k up to 4n - 4, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient, and for k >= 4n - 2, floor(k / 2) + 1 is needed.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider n=2:

Total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

For k=3, which is less than or equal to 4*2 - 4 = 4, it uses ceil(3 / 2) = 2, which matches the sample output.

For k=4, which is less than or equal to 4, it uses ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

For k=5, which is greater than 4, it uses floor(5 / 2) + 1 = 3.

For k=6, it uses floor(6 / 2) + 1 = 4.

But in reality, for n=2, the grid is small, and I need to see if these numbers make sense.

Let's consider n=2:

Grid:

1 2

3 4

Diagonals:

- 1,4 (main diagonal)

- 2,3 (other main diagonal)

- 1,2 (diagonal down to the right)

- 3,4 (diagonal down to the right)

- 2 (single cell diagonal)

- 4 (single cell diagonal)

Wait, I'm getting confused about how many diagonals there are.

According to the problem, for n=2, there should be 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Perhaps, in addition to the two main diagonals, there are also the individual cells considered as diagonals of length 1.

So, diagonals are:

- Main diagonal: 1,4

- Other main diagonal: 2,3

- Diagonals of length 1: 1,2,3,4

Wait, but that would be 4 diagonals of length 1, plus 2 main diagonals, totaling 6 diagonals.

But in this case, if k=5, meaning we need to cover 5 diagonals, then according to the code, since k=5 > 4n - 4 = 4, it uses floor(5 / 2) + 1 = 3.

Is 3 cells enough to cover 5 diagonals?

In a 2x2 grid, the minimal number of cells to cover 5 diagonals.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, to cover 5 diagonals, since there are only 4 cells, and each cell can cover two diagonals.

Wait, but there are only 4 cells:

- Cell 1 covers diagonals: 1,4 and 1

- Cell 2 covers: 2,3 and 2

- Cell 3 covers: 2,3 and 3

- Cell 4 covers: 1,4 and 4

Wait, but according to this, some diagonals are covered by multiple cells.

If I color cell 1 and cell 2:

- Cell 1 covers diagonals: 1,4 and 1

- Cell 2 covers: 2,3 and 2

- Total diagonals covered: 1,2,3,4

That's 4 diagonals.

To cover all 6 diagonals, I need to color all 4 cells.

But according to the code, for k=5 (>4n - 4 = 4), it would print floor(5 / 2) + 1 = 3.

But in reality, to cover 5 diagonals, I might need to color 3 cells.

For example, coloring cells 1,2,3:

- Cell 1: diagonals 1,4 and 1

- Cell 2: diagonals 2,3 and 2

- Cell 3: diagonals 2,3 and 3

- Total diagonals covered: 1,2,3,4

Wait, that's still only 4 diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider different diagonals.

Wait, maybe the diagonals are differently defined.

Let me try to list all 6 diagonals for n=2:

1. Diagonal: 1,4

2. Diagonal: 2,3

3. Diagonal: 1,2

4. Diagonal: 3,4

5. Diagonal: 1

6. Diagonal: 2

7. Diagonal: 3

8. Diagonal: 4

Wait, that's 8 diagonals, but according to the problem, it should be 6.

I must be miscounting.

Perhaps, diagonals are only the lines with slope 1 and -1, and not including single cells.

So, for n=2, there are:

- Diagonals with slope 1: 1,4 and 2,3

- Diagonals with slope -1: 1,2 and 3,4

- Total diagonals: 4

But the problem says 4n - 2 = 6 diagonals.

So, perhaps there are also the single cell diagonals.

Wait, maybe the formula 4n - 2 includes both main diagonal directions.

For n=2, 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Perhaps, in addition to the two main diagonals, there are also diagonals of length 1.

Alternatively, maybe there are multiple diagonals with the same slope but different positions.

I need to find a consistent way to count the diagonals.

Let me try a general approach.

In an n x n grid, the number of diagonals with slope 1 is 2n - 1.

Similarly, the number of diagonals with slope -1 is 2n - 1.

Total diagonals: 4n - 2.

So, for n=2, that's 4*2 - 2 = 6 diagonals.

Now, I need to identify what these 6 diagonals are.

For n=2:

- Diagonals with slope 1:

- Starting from (1,1): cell 1

- Starting from (1,2): cells 2,3

- Starting from (2,2): cell 4

- Diagonals with slope -1:

- Starting from (1,2): cell 2

- Starting from (2,2): cells 3,4

- Starting from (2,1): cell 1

Wait, perhaps I need to list all possible diagonals.

But this seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers all possible diagonals, including those that pass through only one cell.

In that case, for n=2, there are:

- Two main diagonals: 1,4 and 2,3

- Four single-cell diagonals: 1,2,3,4

- Total: 6 diagonals, matching 4n - 2 = 6.

Now, to cover k diagonals with the fewest cells, we need to maximize the number of diagonals covered by each cell.

Each cell can cover two diagonals: one with slope 1 and one with slope -1.

So, in general, ceil(k / 2) should be the minimal number of cells needed.

But the code has a condition based on k <= 4n - 4.

I need to understand why.

Perhaps, when k is less than or equal to 4n - 4, ceil(k / 2) is sufficient.

When k is larger, more cells are needed.

Wait, in the sample input for n=3, k=9, which is less than 4*3 - 2 = 10, but greater than 4*3 - 4 = 8.

According to the code, for k=9 > 8, it uses floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 5.

Similarly, for k=10, it uses floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6.

But for k=7 <= 8, it uses ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

I need to see if this makes sense.

Perhaps, up to 4n - 4 diagonals can be covered with ceil(k / 2) cells, and beyond that, more cells are needed.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=9, the output is 5, which is floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 5.

But ceil(9 / 2) = 5 as well.

Wait, no, ceil(9 / 2) = 5, floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5.

So, in this case, both expressions give the same result.

Similarly, for k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6.

Wait, but ceil(10 / 2) = 5, which is less than floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6.

So, in this case, they differ.

But according to the sample input, for k=10, the output is 6.

So, the code is using floor(k / 2) + 1 for k > 4n - 4.

Hence, for k=10, it's using floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6, which matches the sample output.

But for k=9, it's using floor(9 / 2) + 1 = 5, which also matches the sample output.

Wait, but ceil(9 / 2) = 5 as well.

So, in this case, ceil(k / 2) would also give 5, which is the same as floor(k / 2) + 1.

But for k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, while floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6.

So, the code is using a different formula for k > 4n - 4.

I need to understand why.

Perhaps, for k > 4n - 4, more cells are needed because of overlapping constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the number of diagonals that can be covered with ceil(k / 2) cells.

Wait, maybe for k > 4n - 4, the number of diagonals that need to be covered exceeds the dual coverage of cells, requiring additional cells.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition should be based on k > 2n - 1 or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the threshold should be when k exceeds the number of pairs of diagonals that can be covered by one cell.

But I'm getting stuck.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have m cells colored.

Each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals.

So, m cells can cover up to 2m diagonals.

But in reality, there might be overlaps, so the actual number of diagonals covered could be less than 2m.

Therefore, to cover k diagonals, I need m such that 2m >= k, so m >= ceil(k / 2).

But in some cases, due to the grid structure, more cells might be needed.

Perhaps, for larger k, the overlaps become more significant, requiring more cells.

Hence, the condition in the code might be addressing that.

But I need to verify this logic.

Looking back at the code:

if k <= 2 * (n + (n - 2)):

print(math.ceil(k / 2))

else:

print(k // 2 + 1)

Wait, 2 * (n + (n - 2)) = 2*(2n - 2) = 4n - 4.

So, for k <= 4n - 4, use ceil(k / 2), else use floor(k / 2) + 1.

But, as I saw in the sample inputs, for k=9 and k=10, which are around 4n - 4 and 4n - 2, the code uses floor(k / 2) + 1.

But ceil(k / 2) is equal to floor(k / 2) + 1 when k is odd.

For even k, ceil(k / 2) = k / 2, and floor(k / 2) + 1 = k / 2 + 1, which are different.

So, for even k, ceil(k / 2) < floor(k / 2) + 1.

In the sample input, for k=10 (even), it uses floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6, which matches the sample output.

But ceil(10 / 2) = 5, which would be incorrect in this case.

Hence, the code is using the correct formula based on the value of k.

Therefore, the condition is necessary to handle the cases where k is large enough that ceil(k / 2) underestimates the number of cells needed.

Wait, but in the sample input, for k=10, ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the correct answer is 6, which is floor(10 / 2) + 1 = 6.

Hence, for even k, when k > 4n - 4, the code uses floor(k / 2) + 1, which is correct.

For odd k, ceil(k / 2) = floor(k / 2) + 1, so it's the same.

Hence, the condition in the code ensures that for k > 4n - 4, it uses floor(k / 2) + 1, which matches the sample outputs.

Therefore, the code is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{see explanation}} \]
