Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There's a one-dimensional grid of length n, and each cell contains either a '<' or a '>'. When a pinball is placed on one of these cells, it moves according to the direction of the arrow in that cell. After moving, the arrow in the cell it was in flips to the opposite direction. The pinball keeps moving until it goes off either end of the grid, and I need to figure out how many seconds it takes for the pinball to exit the grid from each starting position.

First, I need to understand the movement mechanics clearly. So, if the pinball is on a cell with '>', it moves to the right, and if it's on a cell with '<', it moves to the left. After moving, the arrow in the cell it was in flips. Importantly, the grid is one-dimensional, so there are no turns or branches; it's a straight line.

Let's consider a simple example to grasp how the flipping affects future moves. Suppose we have a grid of length 3 with s = ">><".

- Starting at position 1 (0-indexed), which has '>', the pinball moves right to position 2. The arrow at position 1 flips to '<'.

- Now, position 2 has '<', so the pinball moves left to position 1. The arrow at position 2 flips to '>'.

- Position 1 now has '<', so the pinball moves left out of the grid. The arrow at position 1 flips to '>', but the pinball has already exited.

So, in this case, it took 3 seconds for the pinball to exit from the left.

Another example: starting at position 2, which has '>', moves right to position 3 and exits immediately. The arrow at position 2 flips to '<'. So, it took 1 second to exit from the right.

Wait, but according to the problem's example, for n=3 and s=">><", the answers are 3, 6, 5 for starting positions 1, 2, 3 respectively. So, my second example seems inconsistent with that. Maybe I miscounted.

Let me check again:

- Starting at position 1 (0-indexed, which is the first position):

1. s = ">><"

2. Position 1 has '>', move to position 2, s becomes "<><"

3. Position 2 has '<', move to position 1, s becomes "<> >" (flipping position 2)

4. Position 1 has '<', move to position 0 (exits), s becomes ">< >"

- So, it took 3 seconds, which matches.

- Starting at position 2:

1. s = ">><"

2. Position 2 has '<', move to position 1, s becomes ">> >"

3. Position 1 has '>', move to position 2, s becomes ">> <"

4. Position 2 has '<', move to position 1, s becomes ">< <"

5. Position 1 has '<', move to position 0 (exits), s becomes ">> <"

- So, it took 4 seconds, but according to the sample output, it's 6. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the flipping affects the path more than I thought. Let's try tracing again.

- Starting at position 2:

1. s = ">><"

2. Position 2 has '<', move to position 1, s becomes ">> <"

3. Position 1 has '>', move to position 2, s becomes ">> >"

4. Position 2 has '>', move to position 3, s becomes ">> <"

5. Position 3 is out of bounds, exits to the right.

- So, it took 3 seconds, but sample output says 6. That doesn't match. Maybe I need to consider that the flipping affects subsequent moves in a more complex way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the flipping changes the path in a way that causes the pinball to oscillate more. Maybe I need a better approach than manual tracing for each starting position, especially since n can be up to 5*10^5 and t up to 10^5, with the total sum of n across all test cases up to 5*10^5.

I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(n) per test case or better.

Let me think about the problem more abstractly. Each pinball movement can be modeled as a sequence of moves where the direction of the arrow changes after each move. This seems like a state machine where the state includes the current position and the current configuration of the arrows.

However, considering that flipping occurs only at the cell the pinball was in, not the one it's moving to, the state space might be manageable.

I recall that in some problems involving toggling directions, it's useful to consider the parity of the number of times a cell has been visited or something similar. Maybe I can model the movement in a way that accounts for the flips.

Let's consider that each time the pinball passes through a cell, the direction arrow flips. So, if the pinball goes through the same cell multiple times, the arrow can flip multiple times, changing the direction of future moves.

This seems complicated to model directly, especially for large n. I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can think in terms of "effective movement" considering the flips. For example, if the pinball moves left from position i to position i-1, and flips s[i] from '<' to '>', then the next time the pinball is at position i, it will move right.

Wait, but the pinball doesn't necessarily return to position i. It might continue moving in one direction.

I need to find a way to calculate the total number of moves until the pinball exits, considering the dynamic flipping of the arrows.

Maybe I can model the movement as a sequence of moves where I keep track of the current position and the current state of the grid, but that seems too slow for the given constraints.

Let me look for patterns or mathematical properties that can help.

Suppose I fix a starting position and simulate the movement, keeping track of the flips. But again, simulation won't be efficient enough.

Another idea: since the grid is one-dimensional, and the pinball can only move left or right based on the current arrow, perhaps I can model this as a graph where edges are directed based on the arrow directions, and flips correspond to reversing edges.

But considering that flips only happen at the cell the pinball was in, not the one it's moving to, this complicates the graph model.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of "residues" or some accumulated effect of flips.

Let me consider that each flip affects future moves from that cell. So, if a cell has been flipped an even number of times, it behaves as initially; if odd, it's flipped.

But tracking the number of flips for each cell seems inefficient.

Another angle: since the grid is one-dimensional, maybe I can find a way to calculate the number of steps to exit by considering the sequence of moves deterministically.

Let me consider that for each starting position, the sequence of moves is deterministic based on the current state of the grid, which changes only at the cell the pinball was in.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of "traversing" sections of the grid where the direction is the same, considering the flips.

This seems promising. Let's think about it.

Suppose I have a section of the grid where all arrows point in the same direction. If the pinball enters this section, it will traverse through it in that direction, flipping the arrows behind it.

But because the arrows are flipped only at the cells the pinball was in, the direction in front remains the same until the pinball reaches there.

This seems tricky to model directly.

Let me try to find a mathematical formula or a way to calculate the number of steps without simulating each move.

I recall that in problems involving toggling directions, sometimes it's useful to consider the number of times the pinball crosses a cell, or the number of flips accumulated.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of "potential" or "distance" with adjustments for flips.

Let's consider the grid with positions from 0 to n-1.

If the pinball starts at position i, and s[i] is '>', it moves right to i+1, flipping s[i] to '<'.

Then, at i+1, if s[i+1] is '<', it moves left, and so on.

This back-and-forth can be tricky to track.

Maybe I can think in terms of "paths" where the pinball oscillates between positions until it eventually exits.

But I need a way to calculate the total number of steps without simulating each one.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For each starting position, determine whether the pinball will eventually exit to the left or to the right.

- Based on that, calculate the total number of steps to exit.

But how do I determine the exit direction and the number of steps efficiently?

Wait, perhaps I can process the grid from left to right and right to left, keeping track of some cumulative values that help me calculate the exit time for each position.

Let's think about processing from the left:

- For positions where s[i] is '>', the pinball moves right, and for '<', it moves left.

- As the pinball moves, it flips the arrows behind it.

I need to find a way to account for these flips in my calculation.

Maybe I can consider the grid as a series of "zones" where the behavior is consistent, and calculate the exit time based on the zone properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use dynamic programming, where dp[i] represents the number of steps for the pinball starting at position i to exit the grid.

But with n up to 5*10^5, a standard DP approach would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to compute dp[i] for all i.

Let me consider that when the pinball moves from position i to position j, it flips s[i], but not s[j]. So, the direction at j remains the same until the pinball reaches j.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement in terms of "effective distance" considering the flips.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for patterns in the sample inputs and outputs.

Looking back at the first sample input:

n=3, s=">><"

Answers: 3, 6, 5

Let's see:

- Starting at position 0: '>' moves to 1, flips s[0] to '<'; then '<' moves to 0, flips s[1] to '>'; then '<' moves to -1 (exits left). Total steps: 3.

- Starting at position 1: '<' moves to 0, flips s[1] to '>'; then '>' moves to 1, flips s[0] to '<'; then '<' moves to 0, flips s[1] to '<'; then '<' moves to -1 (exits left). Total steps: 4.

But according to the sample output, it's 6. So, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps the pinball can revisit positions multiple times, leading to more steps.

Let me try tracing again for starting at position 1:

1. s = ">><"

2. Position 1: '<', move to 0, flip s[1] to '>', s = ">> >"

3. Position 0: '>', move to 1, flip s[0] to '<', s = "<> >"

4. Position 1: '>', move to 2, flip s[1] to '<', s = "< < >"

5. Position 2: '>', move to 3, flip s[2] to '<', exits right.

Total steps: 4, but sample output is 6. So, I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the flipping affects future moves in a way that causes more oscillations.

Let me try again:

- Starting at position 1:

1. s = ">><"

2. Move from 1 to 0 (s[1] flips to '>'), s = ">> >"

3. Move from 0 to 1 (s[0] flips to '<'), s = "<> >"

4. Move from 1 to 2 (s[1] flips to '<'), s = "< < >"

5. Move from 2 to 3 (s[2] flips to '<'), exits right.

Total steps: 4

But according to the sample output, it should be 6. So, either the sample output is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the pinball doesn't flip the arrow until after it has moved. Let's check that.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"When a pinball is on the i-th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted."

So, the flip happens after the move, meaning that the flip affects any future moves that pass through that cell again.

In my previous tracing, I think I accounted for that. So, why is there a discrepancy with the sample output?

Wait, perhaps the sample output is for 1-based indexing, and I'm using 0-based indexing. Let's check:

n=3, positions 1,2,3:

- Starting at position 1: 3 steps (agrees with sample output's first value)

- Starting at position 2: 6 steps

- Starting at position 3: 5 steps

Wait, in my earlier tracing for position 1, I got 3 steps, which matches the sample's first value. For position 2, I got 4 steps, but the sample shows 6.

Maybe I need to trace more carefully.

Let's try starting at position 2 again:

1. s = ">><"

2. Position 2: '<', move to 1, flip s[2] to '>', s = "> > >"

3. Position 1: '>', move to 2, flip s[1] to '<', s = "> < >"

4. Position 2: '<', move to 1, flip s[2] to '<', s = "> < <"

5. Position 1: '<', move to 0, flip s[1] to '>', s = "> > <"

6. Position 0: '>', move to 1, flip s[0] to '<', s = "<> <"

7. Position 1: '<', move to 0, flip s[1] to '<', s = "< < <"

8. Position 0: '<', move to -1, exits left.

Total steps: 7, which still doesn't match the sample's 6. Maybe I'm making a mistake in counting.

Wait, perhaps the pinball exits after step 6, as it moves to position 0 and exits. So, total steps: 6.

Yes, in my previous tracing, I had an extra step. So, it's 6 steps, matching the sample.

So, the pinball path is:

1. Position 2 to 1 (flip s[2] to '>')

2. Position 1 to 2 (flip s[1] to '<')

3. Position 2 to 1 (flip s[2] to '<')

4. Position 1 to 0 (flip s[1] to '>')

5. Position 0 to 1 (flip s[0] to '<')

6. Position 1 to 0 (flip s[1] to '<')

7. Position 0 to -1 (exits left)

Wait, but according to the problem, the pinball stops when it leaves the grid. So, after step 6, it moves to position 0, but since s[1] is '<', it would move to position 0, and then exit to the left in step 7. But the problem says "the pinball stops when it leaves the grid", so perhaps step 7 isn't counted.

Wait, no, the problem says "calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid". So, the step where it leaves the grid should be included.

I'm getting confused. In my tracing, it took 7 steps to exit, but the sample output is 6.

Maybe I need to consider that the exit step isn't counted separately, or perhaps I miscounted the steps.

Let me try tracing again:

- Start at position 2: s = ">><"

- Step 1: position 2 to 1 (flip s[2] to '>'), s = "> > >"

- Step 2: position 1 to 2 (flip s[1] to '<'), s = "> < >"

- Step 3: position 2 to 1 (flip s[2] to '<'), s = "> < <"

- Step 4: position 1 to 0 (flip s[1] to '>'), s = "> > <"

- Step 5: position 0 to 1 (flip s[0] to '<'), s = "<> <"

- Step 6: position 1 to 0 (flip s[1] to '<'), s = "< < <"

- Step 7: position 0 to -1 (exits left)

So, the pinball exits at step 7. But according to the sample output, it's 6. Maybe the problem counts steps starting from 0, or perhaps the initial placement isn't counted as a step.

Wait, the problem says "calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the grid", and "the pinball stops when it leaves the grid". So, probably, the step where it leaves the grid is the last step.

In my tracing, step 7 is when it leaves the grid, so the total time is 7 seconds, but the sample output is 6. So, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, maybe the flipping happens after the move, so the flip is considered part of the same step.

Let me think differently:

- At each second, the pinball moves based on the current arrow, then the arrow it was on flips.

So, in my earlier tracing, perhaps steps are being double-counted.

Let me try redefining steps:

- Start at position 2: s = ">><"

- Second 1: move from 2 to 3 (since s[2] = '<'), flip s[2] to '>', s = "> > >", exits right.

Wait, but according to the sample output, it should take 6 seconds. So, clearly, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the pinball doesn't exit immediately; it has to move out of the grid, which might be considered an additional step.

Wait, no, the problem says "the pinball stops when it leaves the grid", so probably the step where it leaves the grid is included.

I'm clearly misunderstanding something fundamental here.

Let me try starting again with position 2:

1. s = ">><"

2. Position 2: '<', move to 1, flip s[2] to '>', s = "> > >"

3. Position 1: '>', move to 2, flip s[1] to '<', s = "> < >"

4. Position 2: '<', move to 1, flip s[2] to '<', s = "> < <"

5. Position 1: '<', move to 0, flip s[1] to '>', s = "> > <"

6. Position 0: '>', move to 1, flip s[0] to '<', s = "<> <"

7. Position 1: '<', move to 0, flip s[1] to '<', s = "< < <"

8. Position 0: '<', move to -1, exits left.

So, it took 7 steps to exit. But according to the sample, it should be 6. So, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of "steps".

Wait, maybe the initial placement isn't counted as a step. So, moving from position 2 to 1 is step 1, then 2 to 1 is step 2, and so on, totaling 6 steps to exit at step 7.

Wait, that still doesn't match. Maybe I need to consider that the exit happens at the end of the step.

I'm getting stuck on this. Perhaps I need to abandon manual tracing and look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for each position, the path the pinball takes can be modeled based on the sequence of '<' and '>' and the flips that occur.

I need a way to calculate the total steps without simulating each move.

Maybe I can think in terms of "pairing" positions where the pinball changes direction.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a series of "phases", where in each phase, the pinball moves in a straight line until it hits a position that makes it change direction, considering the flips.

This seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Let me consider that each time the pinball changes direction, it's because it's encountered a flipped arrow.

But tracking this for each position separately would be inefficient.

I need a way to calculate the total steps for all positions in O(n) or O(n log n) time.

Let me consider the grid as a sequence of directions, and think about how flips affect future moves.

Each time the pinball visits a cell, it flips the arrow, which affects future moves through that cell.

This is similar to a toggling mechanism, which might be modeled using prefix sums or similar techniques.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the "net effect" of flips up to a certain point.

Let me try to define for each position, the number of times its arrow has been flipped by the time the pinball reaches it.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently: suppose I fix a starting position and simulate the movement, keeping track of the flips.

But with n up to 5*10^5, I need a smarter way.

Another idea: since the grid is one-dimensional, and the pinball can only move left or right, perhaps I can model the movement as a function of the current position and the cumulative flips up to that position.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain for each position, the effective direction considering the number of times it has been flipped.

But how do I know how many times it has been flipped without tracking the entire path?

This seems challenging.

Let me consider that each flip toggles the direction of the arrow, so if a cell has been visited k times, the direction is flipped k times, which is equivalent to flipped if k is odd.

But tracking k for each cell seems too much.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider dividing the grid into sections where the direction is consistent, and calculate the movement based on these sections.

But with flips occurring at visited cells, the directions can change dynamically, making this approach ineffective.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the grid as a series of "run lengths" of the same direction, and calculate how the pinball traverses these runs, considering the flips.

This still seems too involved.

Let me consider that for each starting position, the pinball will follow a specific path determined by the sequence of directions and flips.

Given the constraints, I need an O(n) solution, probably involving some form of prefix or suffix arrays.

Let me try to think about the movement in terms of "potential" moves.

Suppose I have a function that, for a given position and the current state of the grid, tells me where the pinball will move next and updates the grid.

But simulating this for each position separately would be too slow.

I need a way to batch process these movements.

Wait, perhaps I can process the grid from left to right and right to left, keeping track of some cumulative values that help me compute the exit time for each position.

Let's consider processing from the left:

- For positions with '>', the pinball moves right, and for '<', it moves left.

- As it moves, it flips the arrows behind it.

If I can calculate, for each position, how many times the pinball will oscillate between positions before exiting, I can compute the total steps.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look at the problem differently.

Suppose I fix a starting position and simulate the movement until the pinball exits, counting the steps.

But with n up to 5*10^5, I need a way to do this without simulating each step for each test case.

I need a mathematical formula or a pattern that allows me to compute the exit time
