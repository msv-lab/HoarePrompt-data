Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play again with the remaining numbers. This continues until there are no numbers left. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For a sequence of numbers, the XOR is the bitwise XOR of all of them.

Given that each number in the sequence is at most 4, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. But according to the problem, the sequence consists of ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, I assume that zero is not included, but I need to confirm that.

Wait, looking back at the problem, it says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4." So, it could include zero as well. But in the input description, it mentions "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, it seems like zeros are not included, or perhaps zero is not considered since it's not mentioned.

Wait, but in the example input, there are p_i values for ones, twos, threes, and fours. If zero is possible, it should be included, but it's not mentioned. Maybe the sequence only consists of 1,2,3,4.

Wait, looking back, the problem says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4." So, it could include 0,1,2,3,4. But in the input, it's given as the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, perhaps zeros are not present in the sequence.

Wait, but in the first test case, it's 1 1 1 0, which probably means one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4's. So, the sequence is [1,2,3]. No zeros in this case.

In the second test case, 1 0 1 2, which is one 1, zero 2's, one 3, and two 4's, so the sequence is [1,3,4,4].

So, it seems like zeros are not included in the sequence.

Now, the problem is to find out how many times Bob can win, given that Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, they play with the remaining numbers.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, I need to find, for each possible subset of the sequence obtained by removing one element at a time, how many times the XOR of the subset is zero.

Wait, no. Actually, Eve removes one number at a time, sequentially, and after each removal, they play with the remaining numbers.

Wait, let's read the problem again carefully.

"Alice and Bob play with n numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it's a sequence of games, each time with one fewer number, as Eve removes one number each time.

So, there are n games in total: one with n numbers, one with n-1 numbers, ..., down to one with zero numbers.

But, with zero numbers, the XOR is zero, so Bob wins in that case.

But, probably, the game doesn't include the empty sequence, or perhaps it does, but I need to check.

Wait, the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty," so it includes the empty sequence.

So, total games: from n down to 0.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and she can choose which number to remove at each step.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

I need to find, for each test case, the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

Given that the sequence starts with p1 ones, p2 twos, p3 threes, and p4 fours.

First, I need to represent the sequence based on these counts.

Given that, I need to consider the XOR of the sequence at each step, after removing some numbers.

But considering that Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, we compute the XOR of the remaining numbers.

Wait, but in terms of XOR, removing a number is equivalent to XORing that number again, because XOR is its own inverse.

So, if I have the initial XOR of the entire sequence, and then I remove a number, it's like XORing that number again.

Wait, more precisely, if I have XOR of a set S, and I remove an element x, then the new XOR is XOR_S XOR x.

Because XOR is associative and commutative.

So, if I have XOR_S, and I remove x, the new XOR is XOR_S XOR x.

Now, Bob wins when the XOR is zero.

So, Eve wants to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

Wait, but Eve removes one number at each step, and after each removal, they play with the remaining numbers.

Wait, more carefully:

- Start with n numbers, compute XOR, see if it's zero.

- Eve removes one number, compute XOR of the remaining n-1 numbers, see if it's zero.

- Eve removes another number, compute XOR of the remaining n-2 numbers, see if it's zero.

- And so on, until there are no numbers left.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

So, Eve has control over which number to remove at each step.

I need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, i.e., the maximum number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, given that Eve chooses optimally which numbers to remove.

This seems a bit tricky.

First, let's consider the initial XOR of all n numbers.

Let's denote XOR_n as the XOR of all n numbers.

Then, when Eve removes one number, say x, the new XOR is XOR_n XOR x.

Because removing x is equivalent to XORing x again.

Wait, actually, no. If I have XOR of a set S, and I remove an element x, the new XOR is XOR_S XOR x.

Because XOR is associative and commutative.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

So, XOR of n numbers is XOR_n.

After removing x, the XOR of the remaining n-1 numbers is XOR_n XOR x.

Then, Eve removes another number y, and the XOR of the remaining n-2 numbers is (XOR_n XOR x) XOR y = XOR_n XOR x XOR y.

And so on.

So, the sequence of XORs is:

1. XOR_n

2. XOR_n XOR x1

3. XOR_n XOR x1 XOR x2

...

n. XOR_n XOR x1 XOR x2 XOR ... XOR xn

Where x1, x2, ..., xn are the numbers removed in that order.

Eve chooses which number to remove at each step.

She wants to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

Wait, but in practice, Eve doesn't choose the order of removal; she chooses which number to remove at each step.

But in this scenario, she can choose any number at each step.

Wait, but in reality, as she removes numbers, the set of available numbers changes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of subsets.

But it's getting complicated.

Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the properties of XOR.

XOR is associative and commutative, and XORing a set of numbers is equivalent to XORing them in any order.

Also, XORing a number with itself cancels out.

But in this problem, since we're dealing with removals, it's about the cumulative XOR up to each step.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the sequence of removals as choosing a permutation of the numbers, and then for each prefix of that permutation, compute the XOR of the numbers not in the prefix.

Wait, that might be too involved.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example:

1 1 1 0 → one 1, one 2, one 3, zero 4's.

So, the sequence is [1,2,3].

Compute XOR_n = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = (1 ^ 2 ^ 3) = (001 ^ 010 ^ 011) = 000.

So, XOR_n = 0.

So, initially, with n=3, XOR is 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining [2,3], XOR = 2 ^ 3 = 1 ^ 110 ^ 011 = 101 = 5 ≠ 0, so Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining [3], XOR = 3 ≠ 0, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR = 0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice.

But according to the first output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, the output is 1, which might correspond to only the initial game with n=3, where XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, say 1, [2,3], XOR=5≠0, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 2, [3], XOR=3≠0, Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, two times Bob wins, but the output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered.

But in the problem, it says "until the sequence of numbers is empty," so it includes the empty sequence.

Wait, perhaps in the first test case, Bob only wins once, because the problem counts the number of times Bob wins, but perhaps the empty sequence is not counted.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 1.

But according to my calculation, Bob wins twice: once with n=3 and once with n=0.

Maybe the empty sequence is not counted.

Wait, but the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty," so probably it includes the empty sequence.

Wait, in the first test case, with n=3, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, n=2, XOR≠0, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, n=1, XOR≠0, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last number, n=0, XOR=0, Bob wins.

But output is 1, meaning only one win for Bob.

So, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps Bob only wins when the sequence is non-empty and XOR=0.

But the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty," so perhaps the empty sequence is considered, but Bob doesn't win in that case.

Wait, need to read the problem again.

"Alice and Bob play with n numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems like they play with n numbers, then n-1, ..., down to 0 numbers.

But, perhaps when the sequence is empty, it's not considered a game.

Wait, the problem says "play with the sequence of numbers," so perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a valid game.

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, with n=3, XOR=0, Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, n=2, XOR=5≠0, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, n=1, XOR=3≠0, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last number, n=0, XOR=0, but perhaps not considered.

So, only one win for Bob, which matches the first output.

Okay, so perhaps the empty sequence is not considered a game.

So, in this case, Bob wins only once.

Similarly, in my earlier calculation, I thought Bob wins twice, but perhaps the empty sequence is not counted.

So, perhaps we shouldn't count the empty sequence.

Alright, so I need to consider the games from n down to 1.

So, total n games.

Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the remaining sequence has one less number.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Now, I need to find, for each test case, the maximum number of times Bob can win, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.

Given that, I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to the sum of p1 to p4, which can be up to 200 each, so up to 800.

But, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this without iterating through all possible removal sequences.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

Given that XOR is associative and commutative, the order of removal shouldn't matter in terms of the overall XOR.

Wait, but since Eve chooses which number to remove at each step, it does matter.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Given that the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and each doesn't exceed 4, perhaps I can represent the XOR in terms of the counts of these numbers.

Wait, more specifically, since XOR is linear, perhaps I can find a way to represent the XOR of the sequence based on the counts of each number.

Wait, but since the numbers are small, perhaps I can consider the XOR of the entire sequence based on the counts.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let me consider that the XOR of the sequence is the XOR of the counts of each number multiplied by that number.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, actually, since XOR is associative and commutative, the XOR of a sequence is just the XOR of all the elements, regardless of their order.

So, if I have multiple identical numbers, their XOR depends on how many times they appear.

Wait, specifically, if a number appears an even number of times, its contribution to the XOR is zero, because x XOR x = 0.

So, only the numbers that appear an odd number of times contribute to the overall XOR.

Wait, that's an important observation.

So, if a number x appears an even number of times, it doesn't affect the XOR; if it appears an odd number of times, it contributes x to the XOR.

So, the overall XOR is the XOR of all numbers that appear an odd number of times.

So, to compute the XOR of the sequence, I can collect all numbers that appear an odd number of times and XOR them together.

Now, in this problem, since the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and their counts are given, I can compute the effective XOR based on the parity of their counts.

So, for each number x in {1,2,3,4}, if p_x is odd, include x in the XOR; if even, ignore it.

So, initial XOR is the XOR of all x where p_x is odd.

Now, when Eve removes a number, say x, she can choose which x to remove.

If she removes x, then p_x decreases by one.

So, if p_x was odd, it becomes even, and vice versa.

Therefore, removing x changes the parity of p_x.

Hence, removing x changes whether x is included in the XOR or not.

Wait, more precisely, removing x changes the XOR from XOR_current to XOR_current XOR x.

Because if p_x was odd, it was included in XOR, and removing it makes p_x even, so it's no longer included, which is equivalent to XORing x again.

Similarly, if p_x was even, removing one makes it odd, so it's added to the XOR.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Initially, if p_x is odd, x is included in XOR.

When you remove one x, p_x becomes even, so x is no longer included in XOR.

Hence, the new XOR is XOR_current XOR x.

Similarly, if p_x was even, removing one x makes p_x odd, so x is included in XOR.

Hence, the new XOR is XOR_current XOR x.

So, in both cases, removing x toggles whether x is included in the XOR.

Hence, removing x is equivalent to XORing x to the current XOR.

So, removing x changes XOR to XOR XOR x.

So, the operation of removing x and computing the new XOR is equivalent to XORing x to the current XOR.

Now, Eve wants to choose which x to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

So, Eve can choose which x to remove at each step, and she wants to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero after the removal.

This seems like a game where Eve tries to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

Given that, I need to find a strategy for Eve to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using dynamic programming or by analyzing the parity of the counts.

But with t up to 10^4 and p_i up to 200, I need an efficient solution.

Let me consider the possible XOR values.

Since the numbers are 1,2,3,4, their XOR can be any combination of these numbers.

Let's compute all possible XOR values of subsets of {1,2,3,4}:

- XOR of empty set: 0

- XOR of {1}: 1

- XOR of {2}: 2

- XOR of {3}: 3

- XOR of {4}: 4

- XOR of {1,2}: 1 XOR 2 = 3

- XOR of {1,3}: 1 XOR 3 = 2

- XOR of {1,4}: 1 XOR 4 = 5

- XOR of {2,3}: 2 XOR 3 = 1

- XOR of {2,4}: 2 XOR 4 = 6

- XOR of {3,4}: 3 XOR 4 = 7

- XOR of {1,2,3}: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0

- XOR of {1,2,4}: 1 XOR 2 XOR 4 = 7

- XOR of {1,3,4}: 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6

- XOR of {2,3,4}: 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 5

- XOR of {1,2,3,4}: 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4

So, possible XOR values are: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Now, given the counts p1, p2, p3, p4, I can compute the effective XOR based on the parity of the counts.

Let me denote:

- c1 = p1 % 2

- c2 = p2 % 2

- c3 = p3 % 2

- c4 = p4 % 2

Then, the initial XOR is c1*1 XOR c2*2 XOR c3*3 XOR c4*4.

Wait, more precisely, it's the XOR of all numbers that have an odd count.

So, it's (c1*1) XOR (c2*2) XOR (c3*3) XOR (c4*4).

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the XOR changes by XORing the removed number.

So, the sequence of XORs is:

- Initial XOR: XOR0

- After removing x1: XOR1 = XOR0 XOR x1

- After removing x2: XOR2 = XOR1 XOR x2 = XOR0 XOR x1 XOR x2

- ...

- After removing x_k: XOR_k = XOR_{k-1} XOR x_k = XOR0 XOR x1 XOR x2 XOR ... XOR x_k

And so on, until all numbers are removed.

Eve wants to choose which x_k to remove at each step to maximize the number of times XOR_k == 0.

This seems like a cumulative XOR game.

I recall that in XOR games, the cumulative XOR can be analyzed using properties of linear algebra over GF(2).

But that might be too involved for this problem.

Let me consider the total number of games, which is n (the initial number of elements).

Eve removes one element at a time, and after each removal, they play with the remaining elements.

So, there are n steps where they play with n, n-1, ..., 1 elements.

The empty sequence is not considered, based on the first test case.

Wait, in the first test case, output is 1, which corresponds to the initial game with n=3 elements, XOR=0.

Then, after removing one element, n=2, XOR=5≠0.

Then, n=1, XOR=3≠0.

So, only one win for Bob.

Similarly, in the second test case, p = [1,0,1,2], which is one 1, zero 2's, one 3, and two 4's.

So, the sequence is [1,3,4,4].

XOR of all: 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2 ≠0.

Then, Eve removes one number.

Options:

- Remove 1: remaining [3,4,4], XOR = 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3 ≠0

- Remove 3: remaining [1,4,4], XOR = 1 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 0 = 1 ≠0

- Remove 4: remaining [1,3,4], XOR = 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6 ≠0

- Remove another 4: same as above.

So, no matter which number Eve removes, the XOR of the remaining three numbers is not zero.

Then, in the next step, Eve removes another number, and so on.

So, in this case, Bob only wins once, at the beginning, but the output is 1, which matches.

Wait, but according to the problem, the output for the second test case is 1, which matches.

In the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], which is two 1's, two 2's, two 3's, zero 4's.

Sequence
