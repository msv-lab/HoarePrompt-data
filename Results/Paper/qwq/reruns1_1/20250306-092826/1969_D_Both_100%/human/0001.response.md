Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n items in a shop, each with two prices: a_i for Alice to buy from the shop, and b_i for Bob to buy from Alice. Alice wants to choose a subset of items to buy, and then Bob will either take all of them for free if she buys less than k items, or take k items for free and pay for the rest.

Alice's profit is the difference between what Bob pays her and what she spends on buying the items. She wants to maximize this profit, while Bob wants to minimize it. I need to find out what Alice's profit will be if both act optimally.

First, I need to understand the rules clearly. If Alice buys fewer than k items, Bob takes all of them for free, so Alice's profit is negative the sum of a_i for the items she bought. That means she loses money equal to what she spent on buying those items, since Bob gets them for free.

If Alice buys m items where m >= k, Bob takes k items for free and pays b_i for each of the remaining (m - k) items. So, Alice's profit is the sum of b_i for the items Bob buys minus the sum of a_i for all items she bought.

Alice needs to choose which items to buy to maximize this profit, knowing that Bob will choose which k items to take for free to minimize Alice's profit.

I need to think about how Alice can make the best choice considering Bob's counter-choice.

Let me try to rephrase the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it.

Alice selects a subset S of items to buy from the shop. If |S| < k, Bob takes all of S for free, and Alice's profit is -sum(a_i for i in S). If |S| >= k, Bob chooses k items from S to take for free, and pays b_i for each of the remaining (|S| - k) items. Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S - T) - sum(a_i for i in S), where T is the set of k items Bob takes for free.

Alice wants to maximize this profit, and Bob, who wants to minimize Alice's profit, will choose T optimally to minimize it.

I need to find the optimal profit Alice can achieve given that Bob will act to minimize her profit.

Let me think about some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

n = 2, k = 0

a = [2, 1]

b = [1, 2]

If Alice buys no items, her profit is 0.

If she buys item 1, cost a1 = 2, Bob takes it for free since k = 0, so profit = -2.

If she buys item 2, cost a2 = 1, Bob takes it for free, profit = -1.

So, the best Alice can do is buy item 2, and her profit is -1.

Wait, but in the example output, it's 1. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement.

Ah, in the first test case:

2 0

2 1

1 2

Output: 1

Wait, according to the note: "In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2-nd item and sell it to Bob, so her profit is 2 - 1 = 1."

Wait, but k = 0, which means if Alice buys any items, Bob takes them for free.

But according to the note, Alice buys item 2, sells it to Bob for b2 = 2, and her cost is a2 = 1, so profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

But according to the problem description, if |S| < k, which in this case |S| >= k since k=0, so |S| >= 0, which is always true.

Wait, k=0 is a special case. If k=0, Bob takes 0 items for free, meaning he pays for all the items Alice bought.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

- if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free;

- otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought, and for the rest, he pays b_i.

So, in the case where k=0, "if Alice bought less than 0 items", which is impossible, so Bob pays for all items Alice bought.

Wait, but in reality, Alice can buy 0 items, but buying less than 0 items doesn't make sense.

So, if k=0, Bob takes 0 items for free, meaning he pays for all items Alice bought.

Therefore, Alice's profit is sum(b_i for i in S) - sum(a_i for i in S).

In the first test case, if Alice buys item 2, profit is 2 - 1 = 1.

If she buys both items, profit is (1 + 2) - (2 + 1) = 0.

If she buys only item 1, profit is 1 - 2 = -1.

If she buys nothing, profit is 0.

So, the maximum profit is 1.

Okay, I see. So, for k=0, Bob pays for all items Alice buys.

Now, let's consider another example.

Second test case:

4 1

1 2 1 4

3 3 2 3

According to the note: Alice buys items 1,2,3; Bob takes one for free, say item 1, and pays for items 2 and 3: 3 + 2 = 5; Alice's cost is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4; so profit is 5 - 4 = 1.

If Bob takes item 2 for free, then he pays for items 1 and 3: 3 + 2 = 5; profit still 1.

If Bob takes item 3 for free, he pays for items 1 and 2: 3 + 3 = 6; profit is 6 - 4 = 2.

Wait, but according to the note, the profit is 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the note, it says: "Bob could take 2-nd item for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2."

Wait, but in this case, if Bob takes item 3 for free, Alice's profit is 2, which is higher than 1.

But Alice wants to maximize her profit, so she would choose to have Bob take the item that minimizes her profit, but Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit, so he would choose to take the item that minimizes her profit.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

Alice chooses S, then Bob chooses T subset of S with |T|=k, and Alice's profit is sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

Alice wants to maximize this, Bob tries to minimize it.

So, for a given S, Bob will choose T to minimize Alice's profit.

Given S, Bob will choose T to minimize sum_{i in S - T} b_i.

Since Alice's profit is sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

To minimize Alice's profit, Bob wants to minimize sum_{i in S - T} b_i.

That means Bob wants to choose T such that the sum of b_i for S - T is as small as possible.

So, Bob will choose the k items from S with the highest b_i.

Because by taking the k items with the highest b_i for free, he minimizes the sum of b_i for the remaining (m - k) items.

Therefore, for a given S, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j, where T is the subset of S with the k largest b_i.

Which simplifies to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

So, it's sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Alice wants this to be as large as possible, Bob wants to minimize it by choosing T as the k items in S with the largest b_i.

Therefore, for a given S, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i, where T is the subset of S with the k largest b_i.

So, to maximize her profit, Alice needs to choose S such that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i is maximized.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider the profit Alice makes per item.

If Alice buys an item, she pays a_i and may sell it for b_i, but only if Bob doesn't take it for free.

If Bob takes it for free, Alice's profit for that item is -a_i.

If Bob pays for it, Alice's profit for that item is b_i - a_i.

Alice wants to select a set S of items to buy, and Bob will choose which k items to take for free from S, to minimize Alice's total profit.

Alice's total profit is sum over S - T of (b_i - a_i) - sum over T of a_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, Alice's profit is sum over S - T of b_i - sum over S of a_i.

Because she sells the items in S - T to Bob for b_i each, and she bought all items in S for a_i each.

So, her profit is sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

Bob chooses T subset of S with |T|=k to minimize this expression.

Given that, Alice wants to choose S to maximize the minimal possible profit given that Bob chooses T optimally.

This seems like a minimax problem.

Maybe I can model this as a optimization problem.

Let me try to think about the items in terms of their b_i and a_i.

Let me consider the difference b_i - a_i.

If b_i - a_i > 0, then Alice benefits from selling that item to Bob, after buying it.

If b_i - a_i < 0, then Alice loses money by buying and selling that item.

But, Bob can choose to take up to k items for free, to minimize Alice's profit.

Wait, more precisely, if Alice buys m items, and m < k, Bob takes all m items for free.

If m >= k, Bob takes k items for free.

So, in the case m < k, Alice's profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

In the case m >= k, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

Where T is the subset of S with k items that Bob chooses to take for free.

To minimize Alice's profit, Bob will choose T to minimize sum_{i in S - T} b_i.

That is, he will choose T to have the largest b_i's, because by taking the items with the largest b_i for free, he reduces the amount he has to pay for the remaining items.

Therefore, for a given S, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j, where T is the subset of S with the k largest b_i.

Which simplifies to sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Alice wants to maximize this, so she needs to choose S such that this expression is maximized, considering that Bob will choose T as the k items in S with the largest b_i.

This seems tricky.

Maybe I can think in terms of selecting S to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Where top_k(S) is the subset of S with the k largest b_i.

This is equivalent to sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Wait, no.

Wait, sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i = sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Hmm.

This seems messy.

Maybe I need to consider sorting the items in a certain way.

Let me consider sorting the items based on b_i in descending order.

If I sort the items by b_i from highest to lowest, then for any set S, the top k items in S would be the first k items in S according to this ordering.

Wait, not necessarily, because S is a subset of the items.

But if I fix S and sort the items in S by b_i descending, then the top k items would be the first k in this sorted list.

But I need to consider all possible subsets S, which is exponential, so that's not efficient.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Perhaps I can consider the items in a certain order and select those that give the best profit.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting items where b_i - a_i is positive, but considering that Bob will take the highest b_i items for free.

Wait, maybe I can consider the items where b_i - a_i is positive, and try to maximize the sum of (b_i - a_i) while minimizing the sum of the highest b_i's that Bob takes.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose Alice decides to buy a set S of m items.

If m < k, then Bob takes all m items for free, and Alice's profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

If m >= k, then Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i from S for free, and pays for the remaining (m - k) items.

So, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j, where T is the subset of S with the k highest b_i.

Alice wants to choose S to maximize this profit.

This seems like a minimax problem, where Alice wants to maximize the minimal profit given Bob's choice.

I need to find a way to optimize this efficiently.

Let me consider the case when m < k.

In this case, Alice's profit is -sum_{i in S} a_i.

To maximize this, she should choose S with the smallest possible sum of a_i.

But since m < k, and k could be as small as 0, but in this problem, k can be 0.

Wait, in the first example, k=0, which means Bob takes 0 items for free, so he pays for all items Alice buys.

So, in that case, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in S} a_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i).

To maximize this, she should choose the items with positive (b_i - a_i), and exclude those with negative (b_i - a_i).

Wait, but in the first example, item 1: b1 - a1 = 1 - 2 = -1, item 2: 2 - 1 = 1.

So, Alice should choose only item 2, getting profit 1.

That makes sense.

So, for k=0, it's straightforward: choose items where b_i - a_i > 0.

But for k > 0, it's more complicated.

Let me consider k > 0.

Alice needs to choose S such that sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j is maximized, where T is the subset of S with k items having the highest b_i.

I need to find a way to maximize this expression.

Let me try to rearrange the expression.

sum_{i in S - T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j = sum_{i in S} b_i - sum_{i in T} b_i - sum_{j in S} a_j.

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Maybe I can think about selecting items based on some combined score.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the items in a certain order and select the best ones.

Let me consider sorting the items based on some criteria.

Suppose I sort the items in decreasing order of b_i - a_i.

Then, Alice would want to select items with higher b_i - a_i, but Bob can take the items with the highest b_i for free.

Hmm.

Maybe I need to consider the difference b_i - a_i and the value of b_i.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of selecting items where b_i - a_i is maximized, but since Bob takes the k items with highest b_i for free, I need to account for that.

Let me consider that for the items that Alice sells to Bob (S - T), her profit per item is b_i - a_i.

But for the items in T, which Bob takes for free, her profit is -a_i.

Wait, no, for items in T, Bob takes them for free, so Alice doesn't get b_i from them, but she still paid a_i for them.

So, her profit for items in T is -a_i.

For items in S - T, her profit is b_i - a_i.

So, total profit is sum_{i in S - T} (b_i - a_i) + sum_{i in T} (-a_i).

Which is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} b_i.

Wait, that's the same expression as before.

I need to find a way to maximize this.

Let me consider that for a given S, Bob will choose T to be the k items in S with the highest b_i.

So, to maximize the profit, Alice needs to choose S such that the sum of (b_i - a_i) for S minus the sum of the top k b_i in S is maximized.

This is equivalent to sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

I need to maximize this expression over all possible subsets S.

This seems difficult to compute directly, especially since n can be up to 2e5.

I need a more efficient approach.

Maybe I can consider the items sorted by b_i in descending order.

Let's sort the items by b_i from highest to lowest.

Let's say the items are ordered as item1, item2, ..., itemn, with b1 >= b2 >= ... >= bn.

Then, for any subset S, the top k items in S are the first k items in S according to this ordering.

Wait, not necessarily, because S is a subset of the items, and the top k in S might not correspond to the first k in the sorted list if S doesn't include some of the highest b_i items.

But if I sort all items by b_i descending, then for any subset S, the top k items in S are the first k items in S according to this ordering.

Wait, no, not necessarily, because S might not include the first k items.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for any subset S of size m >= k, the sum of the top k b_i in S is the sum of the k largest b_i in S.

If I fix S, finding the sum of the top k b_i is straightforward if S is sorted by b_i.

But again, considering all possible subsets S is not efficient.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider including items with b_i - a_i > 0, and excluding those with b_i - a_i <= 0.

Wait, but Bob can take the highest b_i items for free, which might include items with high b_i but low b_i - a_i.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I can consider the items where b_i - a_i > b_i, meaning that even after Bob takes them for free, Alice still makes a profit.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no.

Wait, if b_i - a_i > b_i, then -a_i > 0, which implies a_i < 0, but a_i >= 1 as per the input constraints.

So, that's not possible.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for items where b_i - a_i > 0, Alice wants to include them and sell them to Bob, as long as Bob doesn't take them for free.

But Bob will take the highest b_i items for free, so he will take the items that have the highest b_i, which may include items with high b_i - a_i or not.

Alice needs to balance between including items with high b_i - a_i and ensuring that Bob doesn't take too many high b_i items for free.

This is tricky.

Maybe I can consider the following approach:

- Sort the items by b_i in descending order.

- Then, consider including items one by one, keeping track of the sum of b_i - a_i for the included items, minus the sum of the top k b_i included.

- Use a heap to keep track of the top k b_i in the current subset S.

Wait, but maintaining this for all possible subsets is still too expensive.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a given subset S, Alice's profit is sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

I can rewrite this as sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

I need to maximize this.

This seems similar to selecting a subset S to maximize sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Maybe I can consider the items in a certain order and select them greedily.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the items by some combined score.

Let me think about the items where b_i - a_i is high, but b_i is low.

Because if b_i is low, Bob won't prefer to take them for free, but if b_i - a_i is high, including them in S increases the sum of (b_i - a_i).

So, perhaps I can sort the items by b_i ascending, so that the items with lower b_i are preferred, because Bob is less likely to take them for free.

Wait, but Bob takes the k items with the highest b_i, so by including items with lower b_i, I reduce the sum of the top k b_i in S.

At the same time, I want to include items where b_i - a_i is positive.

This seems like a trade-off.

Maybe I can consider the items where b_i - a_i is positive and sort them by b_i ascending.

Then, select the items with the smallest b_i among those with positive b_i - a_i.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=3, k=1

a = [1,2,3]

b = [2,3,4]

So, b_i - a_i = [1,1,1]

If Alice chooses S={1,2,3}, Bob takes the item with highest b_i, which is item3, for free.

Alice's profit: (b1 + b2) - (a1 + a2 + a3) = (2 + 3) - (1 + 2 + 3) = 5 - 6 = -1.

If Alice chooses S={1,2}, Bob takes item2 for free.

Profit: b1 - (a1 + a2) = 2 - 3 = -1.

If S={1,3}, takes item3 for free.

Profit: b1 - (a1 + a3) = 2 - 4 = -2.

If S={2,3}, takes item3 for free.

Profit: b2 - (a2 + a3) = 3 - 5 = -2.

If S={1}, profit: -1.

S={2}, profit: -2.

S={3}, profit: -3.

So, the maximum profit is -1.

Alternatively, if k=0, it's sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i).

Choose items where b_i - a_i > 0.

In this case, all have b_i - a_i =1, so choose any non-empty subset, profit = sum_{i in S} 1.

Maximize it by choosing all items: profit = n.

But in the previous case, it's more complicated.

I need a general approach.

Let me try to think about the minimal sum of the top k b_i in S, given that Alice wants to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Wait, maybe I can consider including items where b_i - a_i is maximized, but excluding the k items with the highest b_i.

But that seems too vague.

Perhaps I can consider the following approach:

- Sort the items by b_i ascending.

- Include items in S until |S| >= k.

- For each possible S, calculate sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Wait, but this is still time-consuming.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i = sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

I need to maximize this.

Perhaps I can iterate over all possible choices of T (the k items Bob takes for free), and for each T, compute the best S that includes T.

But that's also too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that for a given S, the sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i = sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

I need to maximize this.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of selecting S to maximize sum_{i in S} (-a_i) and minimize sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Since b_i are positive, minimizing sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i means choosing items with smaller b_i.

So, perhaps I should sort the items by b_i ascending and select the ones with smallest b_i, but also considering b_i - a_i.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that Alice's profit can be expressed as sum_{i in S - T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

Because she sells items in S - T to Bob for b_i, after paying a_i for all items in S.

And Bob takes T for free, so Alice loses a_i for those items.

So, profit = sum_{i in S - T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

Bob chooses T to minimize this.

To minimize Alice's profit, Bob will choose T to minimize sum_{i in S - T} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in T} a_i.

Given that, Alice needs to choose S to maximize the minimal possible profit given Bob's choice of T.

This seems like a difficult optimization problem.

Maybe I can consider the dual problem or use some kind of greedy approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the items in a certain order and select them based on some combined score.

Let me consider defining c_i = b_i - a_i - b_i = -a_i.

Wait, that seems arbitrary.

Wait, no.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each item, if Alice includes it in S, she pays a_i and gets b_i if Bob doesn't take it for free.

If Bob takes it for free, she gets -a_i.

Bob will choose the k items with the highest b_i in S to take for free.

So, for items with higher b_i, there's a risk that Bob will take them for free, costing Alice a_i without getting b_i.

Items with lower b_i are less likely to be taken by Bob for free, but may have higher b_i - a_i.

Alice needs to balance between including items with high b_i - a_i and minimizing the sum of a_i for the items that Bob takes for free.

This is similar to selecting a subset S to maximize sum_{i in S} (b_i - a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

Which is sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

I need to maximize this.

This seems like a minimax problem, and I need to find a way to compute it efficiently.

Let me consider that for a given S, sum_{i in S} (-a_i) is straightforward, and sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i is the sum of the k largest b_i in S.

If I sort the items in S by b_i descending, the top_k(S) is the first k items in this sorted list.

I need to maximize sum_{i in S} (-a_i) - sum_{i in top_k(S)} b_i.

This seems similar to selecting S to maximize sum_{i in S} (-a_i - b_i) + sum_{i not in top_k(S)} b_i.

Wait, that
