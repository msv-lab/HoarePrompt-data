Alright, I have this problem to solve. It's about finding a sequence of non-negative integers that meets specific conditions related to subsequences and their sums. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

So, the problem states that I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence 'a' of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two main conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of 'a' that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there must be a subsequence of 'a' that sums up to v.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

The problem also mentions that a solution always exists given the constraints, which is reassuring.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence sum means. Given a sequence, I can select any subset of its elements without changing their order, and the sum of these selected elements is a subsequence sum.

So, the task is to create a sequence where:

- No combination of its elements sums to k.

- Every other integer from 1 to n (except k) can be obtained as a sum of some subsequence.

Additionally, the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9.

Given that t can be up to 1000 and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^7, efficiency might be a concern, but since the operations per test case seem manageable, I'll proceed.

Let me consider small values for n and k to get an intuition.

**Example 1:**

Input:

2 2

Output:

1

1

Explanation:

We need sums from 1 to 2, excluding 2. So, only 1 is needed. Hence, a sequence with a single element 1 suffices.

**Example 2:**

Input:

6 1

Output:

5

2 3 4 5 6

Explanation:

Here, k=1, so no subsequence should sum to 1. Since all elements are greater than 1, no single element or combination can sum to 1. And for v from 2 to 6, each v is present as a single element.

This suggests that if k is 1, and n is at least 2, a sequence with elements from 2 to n would work.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and the sequence should have at most 25 elements. So, providing a sequence from 2 to n isn't feasible for large n, as it could have up to 10^6 elements, but the sequence should be at most 25 elements.

Hence, there must be a smarter way to choose the sequence.

Let me think differently.

I need a sequence where certain sums are achievable and one specific sum is not achievable.

This sounds like a problem related to the subset sum problem, which is NP-complete in general. However, with the constraints here, especially the limit on the sequence length (at most 25), it might be manageable.

Given that the sequence can have up to 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9, the total sum of the sequence can be quite large, which is acceptable since n can be up to 10^6.

I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, are achievable using subsequences of 'a', and that no subsequence sums to k.

One approach could be to include elements that cover all sums except k. But how?

Let me consider the properties of subset sums.

If I have a set of elements, the subset sums form a set based on the combinations of these elements.

If the elements are distinct powers of 2, the subset sums can represent any number up to the sum of all elements, similar to binary representation.

For example, with elements [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any sum from 0 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one particular sum, k, while including all others from 1 to n.

So, perhaps I can use a set of elements that cover all sums from 1 to n except k.

But how to ensure that k cannot be formed?

One idea is to include elements that allow forming all sums except k, possibly by omitting or modifying the element that would contribute to k.

But this seems vague. Let me think of another strategy.

Another approach is to include elements that naturally cover all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust the sequence to exclude the possibility of forming k.

For instance, if I have a sequence that can form all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element that is necessary for forming k, but ensure that other sums are still achievable.

However, removing an element might affect multiple sums, not just k.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed by combining the elements differently.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider specific cases to find a pattern.

**Case 1: k = 1**

If k = 1, then I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, but all other sums from 2 to n are possible.

To prevent any subsequence from summing to 1, I can choose all elements to be greater than or equal to 2.

Then, any subsequence sum would be at least 2, so 1 cannot be formed, and sums from 2 to n can be formed by choosing appropriate elements.

For example, if n=6 and k=1, the sequence [2,3,4,5,6] can form sums 2,3,4,5,6, but not 1.

This seems to work for k=1.

**Case 2: k = n**

If k = n, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to n, but all other sums from 1 to n-1 are possible.

This seems more challenging because n is the maximum sum, so to prevent any subsequence from summing to n, I need to ensure that the total sum of the sequence is less than n or structure the elements in a way that no combination reaches exactly n.

But if the sequence elements sum to less than n, then it's impossible to form any sum greater than that, which might not cover all v from 1 to n-1.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and sequence elements can be up to 10^9, so the sum of the sequence can be much larger than n.

I need to find a way to structure the sequence so that no subsequence sums to k, even if the total sum is larger.

This seems tricky.

**Case 3: General k where 1 <= k <= n**

I need a general strategy that works for any k in the range [1, n].

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, I need an efficient way to cover all sums except k.

One possible approach is to use a combination of small and large elements to cover the required sums.

For example, include small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But this is still vague.

Let me consider the subset sum problem and its properties.

In the subset sum problem, determining whether a subset of a set of integers sums to a given value is NP-complete. However, with a small number of elements (up to 25), it's feasible to compute all possible subset sums.

Given that m <= 25, and each a_i can be up to 10^9, but n is up to 10^6, I need to ensure that all sums from 1 to n, except k, are achievable with the sequence.

One way to approach this is to select elements that together can generate all sums from 1 to n, except for k.

But how to ensure that k is excluded?

An idea: Start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, then modify it so that k cannot be formed.

For instance, if I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element that is necessary for forming k, but ensure that other sums can still be formed.

However, removing an element might affect multiple sums, not just k.

Another idea: Include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed by combining elements differently.

This seems too vague. I need a more concrete strategy.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix a sequence of m elements (m <= 25), and compute all possible subset sums. I need to make sure that k is not among these sums, and that all v from 1 to n, v != k, are present.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and m <= 25, the number of possible subset sums is 2^m, which for m=25 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

But generating all possible subset sums for each test case is not practical due to time constraints.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to choose the sequence 'a' such that the conditions are met without explicitly generating all subset sums.

Let me consider the binary representation approach.

If I choose elements as powers of 2, i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., up to 2^24 (since m <= 25), then the subset sums can represent any integer up to 2^25 - 1.

But I need to cover sums up to n <= 10^6, and exclude only k.

So, with powers of 2 up to 2^19 (524288), which is well beyond 10^6, I can cover all sums up to 10^6.

But I need to exclude k. How can I modify this approach to exclude k?

One idea is to include all powers of 2 up to 2^19, but exclude the specific combination that sums to k.

However, since the subset sums with powers of 2 are unique (each sum corresponds to a unique binary representation), removing k would require excluding the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k.

But this might not suffice, as other combinations might still sum to k.

Wait, actually, with powers of 2, each sum corresponds to a unique subset. So, if I exclude the subset that sums to k, but I need to provide a sequence where no subset sums to k.

In other words, I need to choose a sequence where k cannot be formed.

If I use powers of 2 up to a certain point, and exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, perhaps that would prevent k from being formed.

But I need to verify this.

Let me take an example.

Suppose n=10, k=5.

Binary representation of 5 is 101, which is 4 + 1.

If I include 1, 2, 4, but exclude 4, then I can't form 5, but I also can't form 4.

But I need to form all sums from 1 to 10 except 5.

This approach seems flawed.

Alternatively, maybe I can include elements that allow forming all sums except k by carefully choosing which powers of 2 to include.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I choose a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude the possibility of forming k.

One way to do this is to include elements that cover all sums except k by ensuring that any path to sum k is blocked.

This sounds similar to the concept of blocking a specific sum in the subset sum problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include elements that are mutually exclusive in certain ways to prevent k from being formed.

This is getting too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Given that for each test case, n and k are provided, and I need to output a sequence of at most 25 elements that satisfy the conditions.

Also, there are multiple possible solutions, so I need to find any one that works.

Looking back at the example provided:

Test case:

5

2 2

6 1

8 8

9 3

10 7

Corresponding outputs:

1

1

5

2 3 4 5 6

7

1 1 1 1 1 1 1

4

7 1 4 1

4

1 2 8 3

Looking at these examples:

1. For n=2, k=2: sequence [1] allows sum 1, but not 2.

2. For n=6, k=1: sequence [2,3,4,5,6] allows sums 2,3,4,5,6, but not 1.

3. For n=8, k=8: sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1] allows sums from 1 to 7, but not 8.

4. For n=9, k=3: sequence [7,1,4,1] allows sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

5. For n=10, k=7: sequence [1,2,8,3] allows sums from 1 to 10 except 7.

From these examples, I can see that there are different strategies used for different cases.

In the third example, using seven 1's allows sums from 1 to 7, but not 8, since all elements are 1, and the maximum sum is 7.

In the first example, using a single 1 allows sum 1, but not 2.

In the second example, using elements starting from 2 up to 6 allows sums from 2 to 6, none sum to 1.

In the fourth example, [7,1,4,1] allows sums:

- 1 (from 1)

- 2 (from 1+1)

- 4 (from 4)

- 5 (from 4+1)

- 7 (from 7)

- 8 (from 7+1)

- 11 (from 7+4)

- 12 (from 7+4+1)

- 1 (from 1)

- 4 (from 4)

- 5 (from 4+1)

- 7 (from 7)

- 8 (from 7+1)

- 11 (from 7+4)

- 12 (from 7+4+1)

Wait, but according to the problem, it should allow sums from 1 to 9 except 3.

But in this sequence, sum 3 is not directly obvious. Maybe it's missing.

Wait, 2 can be formed by 1+1, and 3 can be formed by 1+1+1, but in the sequence [7,1,4,1], the elements are ordered, and subsets must preserve the order.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "subsequence", which does not require the elements to be consecutive, but the order must be preserved.

So, for [7,1,4,1], possible subsequences and their sums:

- 7: 7

- 1: 1

- 4: 4

- 1: 1

- 7+1: 8

- 7+4: 11

- 7+1+4: 12

- 1+4: 5

- 1+4+1: 6

- 4+1: 5

- 7+4+1: 12

- 7+1+4+1: 13

- 1+1: 2

- 1+1: 2

So, sums possible: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13. Missing sums: 3,9,10.

But according to the problem, for n=9 and k=3, all sums from 1 to 9 except 3 should be possible. But in this sequence, 9 and 10 are also missing.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, perhaps the sequence provided in the sample output is incorrect. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the subsequence definition.

Wait, the problem says "subsequence", which means elements are picked in order, without changing the order.

So, for [7,1,4,1], possible subsequences:

- [7]: sum 7

- [7,1]: sum 8

- [7,1,4]: sum 12

- [7,1,4,1]: sum 13

- [1]: sum 1

- [1,4]: sum 5

- [1,4,1]: sum 6

- [4]: sum 4

- [4,1]: sum 5

- [1]: sum 1

So, sums: 1,4,5,6,7,8,12,13. Missing: 2,3,9,10.

But according to the problem, for n=9 and k=3, all sums from 1 to 9 except 3 should be possible. But in this sequence, sums 2,9,10 are missing.

This seems inconsistent with the problem's claim that a solution always exists.

Wait, perhaps the sample output has a typo or I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps "subsequence" here allows non-consecutive elements but in order, meaning that elements are picked in the order they appear, but not necessarily consecutively.

In that case, my earlier list seems correct.

But according to the sample output, for n=9 and k=3, the sequence [7,1,4,1] is provided, which seems insufficient because it doesn't allow sums of 2,9,10.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Let's try to find a different sequence for n=9 and k=3 that satisfies the conditions.

For n=9 and k=3, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 3, but all other sums from 1 to 9, except 3, are possible.

One possible sequence could be [1,2,4,9]. Let's check:

- Subsequences and their sums:

- 1: 1

- 1+2: 3 → not allowed

- 1+2+4: 7

- 1+2+4+9: 16

- 1+4: 5

- 1+4+9: 14

- 1+9: 10

- 2: 2

- 2+4: 6

- 2+4+9: 15

- 2+9: 11

- 4: 4

- 4+9: 13

- 9: 9

So, sums possible: 1,2,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,13,14,15,16. Missing: 3,8.

But I need all sums from 1 to 9 except 3. Here, 8 is missing. So, this sequence doesn't work.

Another attempt: [1,2,5,9].

- Subsequences and their sums:

- 1:1

- 1+2:3 → not allowed

- 1+2+5:8

- 1+2+5+9:17

- 1+5:6

- 1+5+9:15

- 1+9:10

- 2:2

- 2+5:7

- 2+5+9:16

- 2+9:11

- 5:5

- 5+9:14

- 9:9

Sums:1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,14,15,16,17. Missing:3,4,12,13.

Still missing 4.

Another attempt: [1,3,5,9].

- Subsequences and their sums:

- 1:1

- 1+3:4

- 1+3+5:9

- 1+3+5+9:18

- 1+5:6

- 1+5+9:15

- 1+9:10

- 3:3 → not allowed

- 3+5:8

- 3+5+9:17

- 3+9:12

- 5:5

- 5+9:14

- 9:9

Sums:1,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,17,18. Missing:2,7,11,13.

Still includes 3, which is not allowed.

This is getting tricky.

Wait, maybe I need to exclude elements that can form k.

Let me try [2,4,5,9].

- Subsequences and their sums:

- 2:2

- 2+4:6

- 2+4+5:11

- 2+4+5+9:20

- 2+5:7

- 2+5+9:16

- 2+9:11

- 4:4

- 4+5:9

- 4+5+9:18

- 4+9:13

- 5:5

- 5+9:14

- 9:9

Sums:2,4,5,6,7,9,11,13,14,16,18,20. Missing:1,3,8,10,12,15,17,19.

Missing 1,3,8,10, etc.

Need to include 1.

Try [1,4,5,9].

- Subsequences and their sums:

- 1:1

- 1+4:5

- 1+4+5:10

- 1+4+5+9:19

- 1+5:6

- 1+5+9:15

- 1+9:10

- 4:4

- 4+5:9

- 4+5+9:18

- 4+9:13

- 5:5

- 5+9:14

- 9:9

Sums:1,4,5,6,9,10,13,14,15,18,19. Missing:2,3,7,8,11,12,16,17.

Still missing some sums.

This trial and error approach isn't efficient. I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the general approach.

Given that m <= 25, and n <= 10^6, I need to choose m elements such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that 2^25 is over 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6, but I need to ensure that k is not among the subset sums.

One possible approach is to select elements that allow generating all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But how?

An idea: Start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

But what is the minimal set?

If I use the minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, that would be the set containing all powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to n.

For example, for n=10, I would use [1,2,4,3], since 1+2+4=7, and to reach 8,9,10, I need an additional element, say 3,
