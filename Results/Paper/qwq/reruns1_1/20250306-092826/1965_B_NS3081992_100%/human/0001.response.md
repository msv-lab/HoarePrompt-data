Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there must be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence where no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the values can be up to 10^9, it seems like there's flexibility in choosing the numbers.

Let me consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Take the first example from the input:

n = 2, k = 2

Possible sequence: [1]

- Subsequences:

- Empty subsequence: sum 0 (which is not in 1 to n)

- [1]: sum 1 (which is v=1, allowed)

- No subsequence sums to 2, which is k.

This works.

Second example:

n = 6, k = 1

Possible sequence: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

- Subsequences:

- [2]: sum 2

- [3]: sum 3

- [4]: sum 4

- [5]: sum 5

- [6]: sum 6

- [2,3]: sum 5 (already have 5)

- [2,4]: sum 6 (already have 6)

- And so on.

- No subsequence sums to 1, which is k.

This makes sense.

Third example:

n = 8, k = 8

Possible sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Subsequences can sum to any v from 1 to 7, but not to 8, since 1+1+1+1+1+1+1=7.

This works.

Fourth example:

n = 9, k = 3

Possible sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- Subsequences:

- [1]: sum 1

- [4]: sum 4

- [7]: sum 7

- [1,1]: sum 2

- [1,4]: sum 5

- [1,7]: sum 8

- [4,1]: sum 5 (already have 5)

- [4,7]: sum 11 (which is beyond n)

- [1,1,4]: sum 6

- [1,1,7]: sum 9

- [1,4,7]: sum 12

- [1,1,4,7]: sum 13

- And so on.

- No subsequence sums to 3.

This seems correct.

Fifth example:

n = 10, k = 7

Possible sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- Subsequences:

- [1]: 1

- [2]: 2

- [8]: 8

- [3]: 3

- [1,2]: 3 (already have 3)

- [1,8]: 9

- [1,3]: 4

- [2,8]: 10

- [2,3]: 5

- [8,3]: 11

- [1,2,8]: 11

- [1,2,3]: 6

- [1,8,3]: 12

- [2,8,3]: 13

- [1,2,8,3]: 14

- No subsequence sums to 7.

This works.

From these examples, I can see that the sequences provided satisfy the conditions. Now, I need to see if the given program correctly generates such sequences for any n and k within the constraints.

Looking at the program, it seems to be a Python script that reads input from stdin and writes output to stdout. The main function is func_15(), which is called if the script is run as the main program. func_15() iterates over the number of test cases and calls func_14() for each test case to generate the sequence.

So, the crucial part is func_14(). Let's look into it.

In func_14():

- It reads n and k from input using func_7(), which splits the input line into integers.

- It converts n to its binary representation using bin(n)[2:], which gives the binary string without the '0b' prefix.

- It determines the length l of this binary representation.

Then, there's a condition based on the value of k:

If k == 1:

- If n == 2, it returns '1\n2', which is a sequence with one element: 2.

- Otherwise, it sets ans = [2, 3], and then appends 2^i for i from 2 to l-1.

Else:

- It converts k to its binary representation using bin(k)[2:] and determines its length lk.

- It initializes ans as an empty list.

- Then, it appends 2^i for i from 0 to lk-2.

- It calculates the next element as k - 1 - sum(ans), and appends it to ans.

- Then appends k + 1 and 2*k + 1.

- Finally, appends 2^i for i from lk to l-1.

After constructing ans, it returns the length of ans followed by the elements of ans separated by spaces.

I need to verify if this approach correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's conditions for any n and k within the constraints.

Let's analyze the two branches separately.

First branch: k == 1

In this case, if n == 2, it simply returns [2], which is correct because:

- Subsequences:

- []: sum 0

- [2]: sum 2

- No subsequence sums to 1, which is k.

- And for v=2, it's present.

For n > 2, it sets ans = [2, 3], and then appends 2^i for i from 2 to l-1.

For example, if n=6, l=3 (since bin(6)='110'), so ans = [2,3,4].

- Subsequences:

- [2]: 2

- [3]: 3

- [4]: 4

- [2,3]: 5

- [2,4]: 6

- [3,4]: 7

- [2,3,4]: 9

- No subsequence sums to 1.

This seems correct.

Second branch: k > 1

This is more general. Let's see what it does.

It first gets the binary representation of k, determines its length lk.

Then, it initializes ans with 2^i for i from 0 to lk-2.

Then, appends (k - 1 - sum(ans)), then appends k + 1 and 2*k + 1, and finally appends 2^i for i from lk to l-1.

I need to understand why this construction works.

Let me take an example.

Take n=9, k=3.

So, n=9, bin(9)='1001', l=4.

k=3, bin(3)='11', lk=2.

So, ans starts with 2^0 = 1 (for i=0 to lk-2=0).

Then, appends (3 - 1 - sum([1])) = 3 - 1 -1 = 1.

So, ans = [1,1].

Then, appends k+1=4 and 2*k+1=7.

So, ans = [1,1,4,7].

This matches the fourth example.

Now, does this construction guarantee that no subsequence sums to k, but for all other v in 1 to n except k, there is a subsequence that sums to v?

I need to think about the properties of the constructed sequence.

First, the sequence includes powers of 2 up to a certain point, and some specific values based on k.

Powers of 2 allow us to represent any number in binary, but here it's modified based on k.

I need to ensure that with the constructed sequence, we can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

Also, there should be no subsequence that sums to k.

Looking back at the examples, it seems to work, but I need a general proof or at least an understanding of why this works.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.

Let me think differently.

I need a sequence where the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that all sums from 1 to s are achievable with a sequence is to have a sequence that is a "complete" set of coins in some sense, but excluding one specific sum.

But that seems too vague.

Another approach is to use the fact that with a set of numbers where each new number is not larger than the sum of the previous numbers plus one, we can generate all sums up to the total sum.

This is the standard greedy algorithm for generating subset sums.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can create a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

One way to exclude k is to remove or modify some elements so that k cannot be formed, but still, all other sums can be formed.

However, this might not be straightforward.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to construct the sequence in a specific way based on the binary representation of n and k.

But I'm not entirely sure about the correctness of this approach.

Let me consider another strategy.

Suppose I start with a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

One way to ensure that no subsequence sums to k is to make sure that k cannot be formed by any combination of the elements.

But ensuring that all other sums can be formed is tricky.

An alternative approach is to use the fact that with a set of numbers, the subset sums form a certain set, and by choosing the numbers carefully, I can control which sums are possible.

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the numbers can be up to 10^9, it's feasible to have a sequence with elements that are powers of 2, but adjusted to exclude k.

Wait a minute, in the provided program, it seems to include some powers of 2 and some specific values based on k.

Let me see if I can find a general pattern.

In the second example:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

- This sequence can generate sums from 2 to 6, excluding 1.

But actually, with this sequence, you can generate:

- 2

- 3

- 4

- 5

- 6

- 2+3=5 (already have 5)

- 2+4=6 (already have 6)

- 3+4=7

- 2+3+4=9

- And so on.

But the problem is that n=6, so we only care about sums from 1 to 6, excluding k=1.

But in this sequence, there is no 1, so no subsequence sums to 1.

But to get sum 1, I would need a 1 in the sequence, but that would allow sum 1, which is k.

So, in this case, since k=1, and n=6, the sequence [2,3,4,5,6] works because:

- No subsequence sums to 1.

- Subsequences can sum to 2,3,4,5,6.

Similarly, in the third example:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

- Subsequences can sum from 0 to 7, excluding 8.

This works.

In the fourth example:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

- Subsequences can sum to 1,4,7,8,9,11,12,14, etc., but not 3.

This works.

In the fifth example:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

- Subsequences can sum to 1,2,3,8,9,10,11,12,13,14, etc., but not 7.

This works.

So, the strategy seems to work for these cases.

But I need to generalize this.

One approach is to include numbers that allow generating all sums except k.

One way to do this is to include numbers that cover all sums except k, perhaps by including numbers that are just above k or adjusting the sequence to skip k.

But this is too vague.

Let me think about the properties required.

I need a set S of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:

- The subset sums of S do not include k.

- The subset sums of S include all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and k up to n, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, efficiency might be a concern, but since m is at most 25, and the operations are not heavy, it should be manageable.

Now, looking back at the provided program, it seems to construct S based on binary representations and powers of 2.

Powers of 2 are useful because they can represent any number uniquely in binary.

But in this problem, we need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps including powers of 2 up to a certain point and adjusting for k.

Wait, in the provided program, for k ==1, it handles it separately, which makes sense because k=1 is a special case.

For k >1, it includes 2^i for i from 0 to lk-2, then appends (k -1 - sum(ans)), then k+1, 2*k+1, and further powers of 2 up to l-1.

I need to verify if this construction works.

Let me take another example.

Let's say n=5, k=3.

So, n=5, bin(5)='101', l=3.

k=3, bin(3)='11', lk=2.

So, ans starts with 2^0 =1.

Then, appends (3-1 -1)=1.

Then appends k+1=4 and 2*k+1=7.

Then, since lk=2 and l=3, append 2^2=4.

So, ans = [1,1,4,7,4]

Wait, but 4 is already in the list. Maybe duplicates are allowed.

But in the earlier example, for n=9, k=3, it's [7,1,4,1], which is similar.

Now, with ans = [1,1,4,7,4], let's see the subset sums:

- [1]:1

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [4]:4

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [4,7]:11

- [4,4]:8

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,4]:9

- [1,7,4]:12

- [1,4,7,4]:13

- And so on.

So, sums are 1,2,4,5,7,8,9,11,12,13, etc.

It doesn't include 3, which is good.

And for v from 1 to 5 except 3, we have 1,2,4,5.

But v=6 is beyond n, so it's okay not to have it.

Wait, n=5, so we only need to cover v from 1 to 5 except 3.

In this case, the sequence [1,1,4,7,4] covers 1,2,4,5, which is sufficient.

But I have duplicates, which might not be necessary.

Perhaps the program appends 2^i up to l-1, but in this case, l=3, so 2^2=4 is appended, but it's already in the list.

Maybe it's okay to have duplicates, but it's inefficient.

But since m can be up to 25, and n up to 10^6, it's still acceptable.

Another example:

n=7, k=4

bin(7)='111', l=3

k=4, bin(4)='100', lk=3

So, ans starts with 2^0=1 and 2^1=2.

Then, appends (4-1 - (1+2))=4-1-3=0.

Then appends k+1=5 and 2*k+1=9.

Then, since lk=3 and l=3, no more powers of 2 are appended.

So, ans=[1,2,0,5,9]

Now, subset sums:

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [0]:0

- [5]:5

- [9]:9

- [1,2]:3

- [1,0]:1

- [1,5]:6

- [1,9]:10

- [2,0]:2

- [2,5]:7

- [2,9]:11

- [0,5]:5

- [0,9]:9

- [5,9]:14

- [1,2,0]:3

- [1,2,5]:8

- [1,2,9]:12

- [1,0,5]:6

- [1,0,9]:10

- [1,5,9]:15

- [2,0,5]:7

- [2,0,9]:11

- [2,5,9]:16

- [0,5,9]:14

- [1,2,0,5]:8

- [1,2,0,9]:12

- [1,2,5,9]:17

- And so on.

Now, for v from 1 to 7 except 4, we need to have subsets summing to 1,2,3,5,6,7.

Looking at the subset sums:

- 1: [1]

- 2: [2]

- 3: [1,2]

- 5: [5]

- 6: [1,5]

- 7: [2,5]

So, all required sums are covered, and no subset sums to 4.

This works.

Wait, but I see [1,2,0]:3, which is fine, but [1,2]:3 is also present.

And [1,2,0,5]:8, which is beyond n=7, but that's okay.

So, the construction seems to work.

Now, I need to see if this is a general approach.

Looking back at the code:

In the else branch (k >1):

- ans extends with 2^i for i in range(lk-1)

- then appends (k -1 - sum(ans))

- then appends (k+1, 2*k+1)

- then appends 2^i for i in range(lk, l)

I need to see why this works.

It seems that by including powers of 2 up to lk-1, it can generate all sums up to 2^(lk-1)-1.

Then, by appending (k -1 - sum(ans)), it adjusts to make sure that k cannot be formed.

Then, appending k+1 and 2*k+1 adds higher values to cover larger sums.

Finally, appending higher powers of 2 allows covering even larger sums up to n.

But I need to verify if this guarantees that all v from 1 to n except k can be formed.

Let me consider the binary representation.

Each power of 2 allows representing sums that correspond to the binary digits.

But with the adjustment for k, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that with at most 25 numbers, I can generate a large number of subset sums, up to 2^25-1, which is over 33 million, way beyond n=10^6.

So, it's possible to generate all required sums with 25 numbers.

But the challenge is to exclude k while including all others.

Another idea is to include numbers that are just enough to cover the required sums but exclude k.

Perhaps starting with minimal numbers and then adjusting to exclude k.

But this seems too vague.

Looking back at the provided program, it seems to work for the examples, but I need to be sure it works in general.

Let me consider edge cases.

Edge Case 1:

n=2, k=2

From the first example, the sequence is [1], which works.

Edge Case 2:

n=3, k=1

So, need to exclude sum=1, but include sums=2 and 3.

Possible sequence: [2,3]

- Subsequences:

- [2]:2

- [3]:3

- [2,3]:5

- No sum=1

This works.

Edge Case 3:

n=3, k=2

Need to exclude sum=2, but include sums=1 and 3.

Possible sequence: [1,3]

- Subsequences:

- [1]:1

- [3]:3

- [1,3]:4

- No sum=2

This works.

Edge Case 4:

n=4, k=3

Possible sequence: [1,4]

- Subsequences:

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1,4]:5

- No sum=3

But can I generate sum=2?

Wait, sum=2 is needed since v=2 !=k=3.

But with [1,4], sum=2 is not possible.

So, this sequence is invalid.

A better sequence might be [1,2,4], but sum=3 is [1,2], which is k=3,
