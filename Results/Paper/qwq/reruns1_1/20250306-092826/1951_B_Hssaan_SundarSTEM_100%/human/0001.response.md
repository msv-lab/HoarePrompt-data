Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in a specific position, and they're going to have a tournament. The tournament is a series of matches where the first match is between the cows in positions 1 and 2, and then each subsequent match is between the winner of the previous match and the next cow in line.

The key point is that in each match, the cow with the higher rating always wins. So, the tournament essentially simulates a process where the highest-rated cow among the first two will win that match, then face the next cow, and so on.

Now, I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets in the tournament. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow in the line, or I can choose not to do anything.

My goal is to figure out the maximum number of wins my cow can achieve by possibly swapping it with another cow.

First, I need to understand how the tournament progresses. Let's consider the initial setup without any swaps.

Suppose we have n cows in positions 1 to n, with their respective ratings a1 to an. The tournament starts with position 1 vs position 2. The winner of that match then faces position 3, and so on, until all cows have been included.

Since higher-rated cows always win, the tournament effectively finds the maximum rating among all cows, and that cow will be the final winner.

But my goal isn't to win the entire tournament; it's to maximize the number of wins for my cow, k.

So, I need to think about how to position my cow in the tournament sequence to maximize its wins.

Option 1: Do nothing, keep my cow in its original position.

Option 2: Swap my cow with another cow in the line.

I need to compare the number of wins in both scenarios and choose the maximum.

Let's first consider the "do nothing" scenario.

In this case, the tournament proceeds as is, and my cow k will participate in the matches according to its position.

I need to simulate the tournament to see how many wins cow k can get in this case.

Similarly, if I choose to swap my cow with another cow, say cow x, then the positions are adjusted, and I need to simulate the tournament again to see how many wins my cow can get in this new arrangement.

I need to try all possible swaps and find the one that gives the maximum wins for my cow.

However, since n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient solution, preferably O(n) per test case.

Let me think about the properties of the tournament.

The tournament is essentially a sequence of matches where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

So, starting from position 1 and 2, the higher-rated cow wins and becomes the current winner, then faces position 3, and so on.

My cow k is initially in position k.

If I do nothing, I can calculate how many wins cow k achieves in this sequence.

If I choose to swap my cow with another cow, say cow x, then cow x takes position k, and my cow takes position x.

Then, I need to calculate how many wins my cow achieves in this new sequence.

I need to find the swap that maximizes the wins for my cow.

But trying all possible swaps is too slow because n can be up to 10^5.

So, I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum possible wins for my cow, considering whether to swap or not.

Let me consider the initial sequence without any swaps.

I need to find out how many wins cow k can achieve in the default tournament sequence.

Similarly, if I swap my cow with another cow, I need to find out how many wins it can achieve in the new sequence.

I need to find the best possible scenario among all these options.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix my cow in a certain position, and see how many wins it can achieve from there.

The number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings that come after it in the sequence, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if my cow is in position p, then it will face the cows in positions p+1, p+2, ..., n, one by one, winning against each until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Similarly, in the initial sequence, my cow is in position k, and it will participate in the tournament according to the match sequence.

Wait, but the match sequence is not exactly sequential; it's a bit more involved.

Let me try to understand the match sequence more carefully.

The first match is between position 1 and 2.

The winner of the first match then faces position 3.

The winner of that faces position 4, and so on, until all cows have been included.

So, it's like a single elimination tournament where the current winner faces the next cow in line.

In this setup, the tournament can be visualized as a tree where each match is a node, and the winner advances to the next match.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, the cow with the highest rating among all will be the final winner.

Now, I need to see how many matches my cow can win in this tournament, potentially by swapping its position.

Let me consider the path my cow takes in the tournament tree.

If I can position my cow such that it faces as many lower-rated cows as possible before facing a higher-rated cow, I can maximize its wins.

So, perhaps I should try to swap my cow to a position where the subsequent cows have lower ratings.

Wait, but the tournament structure is such that the matches are between the current winner and the next cow in line.

So, if I place my cow early in the sequence, it can potentially win more matches before facing a higher-rated cow.

Alternatively, if I place it later, it might face higher-rated cows earlier, reducing its wins.

Wait, but the tournament proceeds by repeatedly matching the current winner against the next cow in line.

So, the order of the cows in the sequence determines the sequence of matches and thus the number of wins for my cow.

Given that, perhaps I can model the number of wins for my cow based on its position in the sequence.

Let me consider that.

If I place my cow in position p, then it will first face position p+1, then the winner of that faces position p+2, and so on.

The number of wins is the number of cows with lower ratings that come after position p until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, in other words, it's the number of cows with lower ratings to the right of position p until a higher-rated cow is encountered.

So, for a given position p, the number of wins for my cow is the number of cows with lower ratings contiguous to position p until a higher-rated cow is found.

Therefore, for each possible position p, I can calculate the number of wins for my cow if it were placed there.

Then, I can choose the position p that maximizes this number of wins.

Additionally, I have the option to do nothing, which corresponds to p = k.

So, I need to consider all possible positions p, including p = k, and choose the one that gives the maximum number of wins.

But since n can be up to 10^5 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me think about how to compute the number of wins for my cow if it is placed at position p.

Given that higher-rated cows always win, my cow will win against all cows with lower ratings until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows with lower ratings in positions p+1 to p + w -1, where w is the number of wins, and position p + w has a cow with a higher rating than my cow.

In other words, it's the length of the largest suffix starting at p where all cows have lower ratings than my cow.

So, for each possible p, I need to find the largest w such that for all i from p+1 to p+w, a_i < a_p, and a_{p+w+1} > a_p.

Wait, but in this case, a_p is the rating of my cow, since it's placed at position p.

So, I need to find, for each p, the length of the largest suffix starting at p where all cows have lower ratings than my cow's rating.

But actually, in the tournament, the matches are not simply based on consecutive positions; they are based on the current winner facing the next cow in line.

Wait, maybe I need to simulate the tournament process.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position of my cow to be p.

Then, in the tournament, the first match is between position 1 and 2.

The winner of that matches position 3, and so on, until all cows have been included.

I need to see in this sequence when my cow is reached and how many wins it can achieve from there.

But this seems complicated to model directly.

Maybe I need to consider the sequence of matches and see when my cow is involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the path my cow takes in the tournament bracket.

But given the time constraints, I need a more efficient approach.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the current winner is always the highest-rated cow among those that have been included so far.

So, as the tournament progresses, the current winner is the maximum rating seen so far.

Therefore, my cow can only win matches as long as it has the highest rating among the cows it has faced.

So, if I place my cow in a position where it has a higher rating than all the previous cows, it will win those matches.

Wait, but the tournament structure is such that it's a series of matches where the current winner faces the next cow.

So, perhaps I can model the number of wins as the number of cows with lower ratings that come after my cow's position until a higher-rated cow is encountered.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the sequence from left to right, keeping track of the maximum rating seen so far.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize current_winner with the higher of position 1 and 2.

Then, current_winner faces position 3, and so on.

At each step, the current_winner is the higher-rated cow between the previous current_winner and the next cow.

Wait, no. Actually, in each match, the winner is the cow with the higher rating.

So, the current_winner is always the maximum rating among the cows that have been included so far.

Therefore, in the tournament, the final winner is the cow with the highest rating.

Now, for my cow to win as many matches as possible, I need to position it such that it faces as many lower-rated cows as possible before facing a higher-rated cow.

So, if I place my cow at position p, then it will face the cows in positions p+1, p+2, ..., n, in sequence, winning against each until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins for my cow when placed at position p is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than my cow, plus one (for winning the match against position p+1), until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

If my cow is at position p, and its rating is R, then:

- It first faces position p+1.

- If position p+1 has a lower rating, my cow wins and proceeds to face position p+2.

- If position p+1 has a higher rating, my cow loses.

- This continues until my cow faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than R.

Similarly, if I choose to do nothing, p = k.

I need to maximize this number over all possible p.

But I can only choose to swap my cow with one other cow, or choose not to swap.

Wait, no. I can choose to swap my cow with another cow once, or choose not to swap.

So, I need to consider two scenarios:

1. Do nothing: keep my cow at position k.

2. Swap my cow with another cow x, placing my cow at position x and cow x at position k.

Then, in both cases, I need to calculate the number of wins for my cow and choose the maximum.

But since I can only perform one swap, I need to choose the best possible swap to maximize my cow's wins.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider precomputing some values.

Let me precompute, for each position p, the number of wins my cow would achieve if it were placed at position p.

Then, I can choose the position p that maximizes this number of wins.

Additionally, I need to consider the "do nothing" option, which corresponds to p = k.

So, I need to compute, for each p, the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than my cow's rating.

But there is a catch: the tournament proceeds in a specific sequence, so placing my cow at position p might not isolate it from earlier parts of the tournament.

Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Let me try to think about the tournament structure more carefully.

The tournament is a sequence of matches:

- Match 1: position 1 vs position 2.

- Match 2: winner of match 1 vs position 3.

- Match 3: winner of match 2 vs position 4.

- And so on, until all cows have been included.

So, the current winner is always the winner of the previous match, facing the next cow in line.

Now, I need to see where my cow is placed in this sequence.

If my cow is placed at position p, then it will be involved in the match when the current winner faces position p.

So, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to how many times it can win consecutively starting from position p.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the point in the tournament where my cow is introduced.

Let's think about it step by step.

Suppose I place my cow at position p.

Then, the tournament proceeds as follows:

- Match 1: position 1 vs position 2.

- Match 2: winner of match 1 vs position 3.

- ...

- Match p-1: winner of match p-2 vs position p-1.

- Match p: winner of match p-1 vs position p (my cow).

- Match p+1: winner of match p vs position p+1.

- And so on.

So, my cow enters the tournament in match p.

From there, it will win match p if it has a higher rating than the winner of match p-1.

Then, it will proceed to match p+1, where it faces position p+1.

It will win if its rating is higher than position p+1's rating, and so on.

So, the number of wins for my cow is equal to:

- The number of consecutive cows after position p that it can win against, starting from position p.

But wait, it's not exactly after position p; it's after match p-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the sequence of matches and see when my cow is introduced.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the current winner is always the maximum rating among the cows that have been included so far.

So, if my cow is placed at position p, then:

- Before match p, the current winner is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

- In match p, my cow faces this current winner.

- If my cow has a higher rating than the current winner, it wins and becomes the new current winner.

- Then, in match p+1, it faces position p+1.

- If it has a higher rating, it wins again, and so on.

- This continues until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Therefore, the number of wins for my cow when placed at position p is:

- If a_p > current_winner_up_to_p-1, then it wins the first match.

- Then, it continues to win against all position p+1, p+2, ..., p+w, as long as a_{p+i} < a_p.

- The number of wins is the number of such consecutive wins.

So, to maximize the number of wins for my cow, I need to choose p such that:

- a_p is greater than the current winner up to p-1.

- And then, a_p is greater than a_{p+1}, a_{p+2}, ..., a_{p+w}, until a_{p+w+1} > a_p.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p that have lower ratings than a_p, plus one if it wins against the current winner up to p-1.

But this seems tricky to compute for each p.

Is there a way to precompute the current winner up to each position?

Yes, I can precompute the maximum rating up to each position.

Let me define current_winner[p] as the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

Then, for each p, if a_p > current_winner[p], then my cow can win the match at position p.

Then, it can continue to win against all subsequent cows until it faces a cow with a rating greater than a_p.

So, for each p, I can compute:

- If a_p > current_winner[p], then the number of wins is 1 (for winning match p) plus the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a_p.

- Else, it loses immediately and gets 0 wins.

So, for each p, I can compute:

wins[p] = 0 if a_p <= current_winner[p]

Else, wins[p] = 1 + length of the longest suffix starting at p+1 where a_i < a_p

Then, I need to find the maximum wins[p] over all p.

Additionally, since I can only swap my cow with one other cow or choose not to swap, I need to consider the positions where my cow can be placed.

Wait, actually, in the problem, I can choose to swap my cow with another cow, which means that I can choose to place my cow at any position p, but only by swapping it with another cow.

However, since I can only perform one swap, I need to choose which cow to swap with, and thus which position to place my cow in.

Wait, no. If I choose to swap my cow with another cow, I can place my cow in any position, but only by swapping it with another cow.

But in terms of choosing where to place my cow, it's equivalent to choosing any position p, but I have to consider that I'm swapping my cow with the cow at position p.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting a position p to place my cow, and then adjusting the sequence accordingly.

But to simplify, perhaps I can consider that I can place my cow in any position p, and the rest of the cows rearrange accordingly.

But I need to make sure that I'm only performing one swap.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider two scenarios:

1. Do nothing: keep my cow at position k.

Compute the number of wins in this scenario.

2. Swap my cow with another cow x, placing my cow at position x and cow x at position k.

Compute the number of wins in this scenario.

Then, choose the maximum between these two.

But since I can choose any x, I need to find the best x that maximizes the number of wins.

But with n up to 10^5, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to find a way to compute the number of wins for my cow if it's placed at position p.

As I thought earlier, if I place my cow at position p, then:

- If a_p > current_winner[p], it wins match p.

- Then, it wins against all subsequent cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, I need to compute current_winner[p], which is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

Then, if a_p > current_winner[p], it can start winning.

Then, the number of wins is 1 (for winning match p) plus the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a_p.

So, for each p, I can precompute:

- current_winner[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1])

- Then, for each p, find the length of the suffix starting at p+1 where a_i < a_p.

Then, for positions where a_p > current_winner[p], wins[p] = 1 + length of suffix where a_i < a_p.

Else, wins[p] = 0.

Then, I need to find the maximum wins[p] over all p, and also consider that I can only choose to swap once.

Wait, but in reality, I can only choose one swap, meaning that I can only place my cow in one position p, by swapping it with the cow at position p.

So, I need to choose p such that the cow at position p is swapped with my cow at position k.

Therefore, in the new sequence, my cow is at position p, and the cow that was at position p is now at position k.

Then, I need to compute the number of wins for my cow at position p in this new sequence.

So, I need to compute wins[p] for the new sequence where my cow is at position p.

But doing this for all p is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that in the new sequence, the ratings are:

- a_new[p] = a[k]

- a_new[k] = a[p]

- a_new[i] = a[i] for i != p and i != k.

Then, for each p, I need to compute the number of wins for my cow at position p in this new sequence.

But this seems too time-consuming.

Perhaps I can fix my cow at position p and compute the number of wins accordingly.

Wait, maybe I can consider two cases:

1. Do nothing: keep my cow at position k.

Compute the number of wins in the original sequence for my cow.

2. Swap my cow with another cow x, placing my cow at position x.

Then, compute the number of wins for my cow at position x in the new sequence.

Then, choose the maximum between these two.

But again, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me try to compute the number of wins for my cow at position p in the new sequence.

In the new sequence:

- My cow is at position p: a_new[p] = a[k]

- The cow that was at position p is now at position k: a_new[k] = a[p]

- All other positions remain the same.

Now, I need to compute the number of wins for my cow at position p in this new sequence.

Following the earlier logic:

- Compute current_winner[p] in the new sequence.

- If a_new[p] > current_winner[p], then it wins match p.

- Then, it wins against all subsequent cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

So, I need to compute current_winner[p] in the new sequence, which is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1 in the new sequence.

But in the new sequence, only positions p and k are swapped.

So, to compute current_winner[p], I need to consider:

- If p < k, then positions 1 to p-1 are unchanged.

- If p > k, then positions 1 to k are unchanged, position p is now a[k], and positions k+1 to p-1 are unchanged.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to precompute the current_winner array for the original sequence, and then adjust it based on the swap.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that swapping my cow with another cow affects only positions p and k.

So, for p < k:

- Positions 1 to p-1 are unchanged.

- Position p is now a[k].

- Positions p+1 to k-1 are unchanged.

- Position k is now a[p].

- Positions k+1 to n are unchanged.

Similarly, for p > k:

- Positions 1 to k are unchanged.

- Position k is now a[p].

- Positions k+1 to p-1 are unchanged.

- Position p is now a[k].

- Positions p+1 to n are unchanged.

This seems too involved to compute efficiently for each p.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that in the original sequence, I can compute the number of wins for my cow if it's placed at position p, by calculating:

- If a[k] > current_winner[p], then it can start winning matches.

- Then, it can win against all subsequent cows until it faces a cow with a higher rating than a[k].

So, for each p, I need to check if a[k] > current_winner[p], and then count the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a[k].

Then, the maximum over all p would be the answer, considering that I can choose to swap with any cow.

But computing this for all p is O(n), which is acceptable since the sum of n over all test cases is 10^5.

So, perhaps this is a feasible approach.

Let me formalize this.

First, compute current_winner[p], which is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1 in the original sequence.

Then, for each p, if a[k] > current_winner[p], then my cow can start winning matches from p.

Then, find the length of the longest suffix starting at p+1 where a[i] < a[k].

So, for each p, wins[p] = 0 if a[k] <= current_winner[p], else 1 + length of suffix where a[i] < a[k].

Then, the answer is the maximum wins[p] over all p.

Additionally, in the "do nothing" scenario, p = k.

So, I need to consider only p = k and p = x for some x != k.

Wait, no. In the "do nothing" scenario, p = k.

In the "swap" scenario, I choose p != k, and swap my cow to p, and the cow at p to k.

So, I need to consider p = k (do nothing) and p != k (swap).

So, I need to consider p from 1 to n, including p = k.

Then, the answer is the maximum wins[p] over p from 1 to n.

But in the "swap" scenario, I'm only allowed to swap once, meaning that I can choose at most one p != k.

But in this approach, I'm considering all possible p, including p = k.

So, this seems acceptable.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, compute current_winner[p] for all p.

current_winner[1] = 0 (no previous cows)

current_winner[2] = max(a[1])

current_winner[3] = max(a[1], a[2])

...

current_winner[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1])

Then, for each p, if a[k] > current_winner[p], then wins[p] = 1 + length of suffix starting at p+1 where a[i] < a[k]

Else, wins[p] = 0

Then, answer is the maximum wins[p] over p from 1 to n.

But computing the length of the suffix for each p would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute the length of the suffix where a[i] < a[k] for each p efficiently.

I can precompute the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a[k].

Let me precompute an array suffix[p], which is the length of the longest suffix starting at p where a[i] < a[k].

I can compute this in O(n) time by iterating from p = n to p = 1.

Initialize suffix[n] = 0 if a[n] < a[k], else 0.

Wait, no.

Actually, suffix[p] = 1 + suffix[p+1] if a[p+1] < a[k], else 0.

So, I can compute suffix[p] for p from n-1 down to 1.

Then, for each p, wins[p] = 1 + suffix[p+1] if a[k] > current_winner[p], else 0.

Wait, but I need to make sure that in the new sequence, the current_winner[p] is adjusted for the swap.

Wait, no, in this approach, I'm considering placing my cow at position p by swapping it with the cow at position p.

So, in the new sequence, a_new[p] = a[k], and a_new[k] = a[p].

Therefore, when computing current_winner[p], I need to consider the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1 in the new sequence.

But in the new sequence, only positions p and k are swapped.

So, to compute current_winner[p] in the new sequence:

- If p < k, then positions 1 to p-1 are unchanged.

- If p > k, then positions 1 to k are unchanged, position p is now a[k], and positions k+1 to p-1 are unchanged.

Wait, this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to consider separate cases based on the relationship between p and k.

Let me try to split into two cases:

Case 1: p < k

In this case, in the new sequence:

- Positions 1 to p-1: unchanged.

- Position p: a[k]

- Positions p+1 to k-1: unchanged.

- Position k: a[p]

- Positions k+1 to n: unchanged.

So, current_winner[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1])

Then, to check if a[k] > current_winner[p]

If yes, then wins[p] = 1 + suffix[p+1], where suffix[p+1] is the number of consecutive cows after p with ratings less than a[k].

But in the new sequence, position k has a[p], which might affect the suffix.

Wait, no, in the suffix, we're only concerned with the cows after p, which are positions p+1 to n, with position k having a[p].

So, to compute suffix[p+1], I need to consider the ratings after p in the new sequence.

This is getting too tangled.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that in the new sequence, only positions p and k are swapped.

So, in the suffix starting at p+1, only position k has its rating changed if p != k.

So, perhaps I can precompute the suffix array for the original sequence, and then adjust it based on the swap.

But this still seems too involved.

Let me consider that the maximum number of wins for my cow is achieved when it is placed in a position where:

- It is greater than the current_winner up to that position.

- And it faces as many cows as possible with lower ratings afterward.

So, perhaps I can find the position p where:

- a[k] > current_winner[p]

- And the number of consecutive cows after p with a[i] < a[k] is maximized.

Then, the maximum number of wins is 1 plus that number.

Additionally, in the "do nothing" scenario, p = k, and I need to compute the number of wins accordingly.

But again, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider that in the original sequence, without any swaps, the number of wins for my cow at position k is:

- If a[k] > current_winner[k], then it can start winning matches.

- Then, it can win against all consecutive cows after k with a[i] < a[k].

So, wins[k] = 1 + suffix[k+1], if a[k] > current_winner[k]

Else, wins[k] = 0

Similarly, if I swap my cow with position p, then in the new sequence:

- a_new[p] = a[k]

- a_new[k] = a[p]

Then, the current_winner[p] in the new sequence is:

- If p < k, current_winner[p] = max(a[1] to a[p-1])

- If p > k, current_winner[p] = max(a[1] to a[k-1], a[k] if k < p, which is a[p] in the new sequence)

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that the number of wins for my cow at position p is:

- If a[k] > current_winner[p], then it can start winning matches.

- Then, it can win against all consecutive cows after p with a[i] < a[k].

So, wins[p] = 1 + suffix[p+1], where suffix[p+1] is the number of consecutive cows after p with a[i] < a[k], provided that a[k] > current_winner[p]

Else, wins[p] = 0

Then, the answer is the maximum wins[p] over all p.

But to compute this efficiently, I need to precompute current_winner[p] and suffix[p]

current_winner[p] can be computed in O(n) time by keeping a running maximum.

suffix[p] can be computed in O(n) time by iterating from the end.

Then, for each p, I can compute wins[p] in O(1) time.

But in the swap scenario, the current_winner[p] and suffix[p] need to be adjusted based on the swap.

This seems too time-consuming.

Perhaps I need to consider that I can only perform one swap, meaning that I can only choose one position p to place my cow.

So, I need to choose p such that:

- If p = k, then it's the "do nothing" scenario.

- If p != k, then I swap my cow with the cow at position p.

Then, in the new sequence, my cow is at position p, and the cow at position p is now at position k.

So, in this new sequence, I need to compute the number of wins for my cow at position p.

But in this new sequence, only positions p and k are swapped, so the current_winner[p] needs to account for this swap.

This seems too involved.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix my cow at position p, and I want to compute how many wins it can achieve.

To maximize the number of wins, I should place my cow as early as possible in the sequence, provided that it can beat the current winner up to that point.

So, perhaps I should look for the leftmost position p where a[k] > current_winner[p], and then count the number of consecutive cows after p with a[i] < a[k].

This might give me the maximum number of wins.

But I need to verify this.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

In the original sequence, my cow is at position 1.

current_winner[p] for p=1: 0 (since no previous cows)

a[k]=12 > 0, so it can start winning.

Then, it can win against position 2 (10 < 12), position 3 (14 > 12, so it loses after 1 win).

So, wins[1] = 1

Now, if I swap my cow with position 3, a_new = [14,10,12,11,8,3]

current_winner[1] = 0

a[k]=12 at position 3 in the new sequence.

So, p=3:

current_winner[3] = max(a[1], a[2]) = max(14,10)=14

a[k]=12 < 14, so wins[3]=0

Wait, but in the original solution, it's swapping position 1 and position 3.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the original solution, it's swapping position 1 and position k, which is position 1 and position 1, which is doing nothing.

Wait, in the first test case, k=1, so swapping position 1 and position 1 is doing nothing.

So, in the first test case, it's better to do nothing and get 1 win.

In the second test case, k=5, a=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

If I do nothing, my cow is at position 5, a[k]=12

current_winner[5] = max(a[1] to a[4]) = max(7,2,727,10)=727

12 < 727, so wins[5]=0

If I swap my cow with position 3, a_new=[7,2,12,10,727,13]

Then, p=3:

current_winner[3] = max(a[1],a[2])=7,2 => 7

a[k]=12 > 7, so wins[3]=1 + suffix[4]

suffix[4] is the number of consecutive cows after p=3 with a[i]<12, which is position 4:10<12, position 5:727>12, so suffix[4]=1

So, wins[3]=1 +1=2

Similarly, if I swap with position 4, p=4:

current_winner[4]=max(a[1],a[2],a[3])=max(7,2,10)=10

a[k]=12 >10, so wins[4]=1 + suffix[5]

suffix[5]=1 (position 5:727>12, so suffix[5]=0)

So, wins[4]=1 +0=1

So, the maximum is 2.

This seems correct.

So, in this approach, I can precompute current_winner[p] for all p, and suffix[p] for all p.

Then, for each p, if a[k] > current_winner[p], wins[p]=1 + suffix[p+1]

Else, wins[p]=0

Then, the answer is the maximum wins[p] over all p.

But in practice, computing current_winner[p] and suffix[p] for all p is O(n), which is acceptable.

But in the code provided, it seems to be doing something different.

Let me look at the code.

The code seems to be:

- Read t, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array s.

- Swap s[0] and s[k-1].

- Then, set h=s[0], and iterate through s[1:], counting how many consecutive cows have a[i]<h.

- Then, swap back s[0] and s[k-1].

- Then, find the position p where a[p]=h.

- Swap s[p] and s[k-1].

- Then, iterate through s, counting the number of cows with a[i]<h, starting from the first cow until a cow with a[i]>h is encountered.

- Finally, print the maximum of the two counts.

Wait, this seems to be considering only two scenarios:

1. Swapping position 1 and position k.

2. Swapping position p (where a[p]=h) and position k.

But in the problem, I can swap my cow with any position p, not just position 1 and position p where a[p]=h.

So, this seems limited.

In the first test case, it swaps position 1 and position k=1, which is doing nothing, and gets 1 win.

Then, it swaps position p (where a[p]=h=12) and position k=1, which is again doing nothing, and gets the same result.

So, in this case, it correctly outputs 1.

In the second test case, it swaps position 1 and position k=5, getting a_new=[12,2,727,10,7,13]

Then, h=12.

It counts the number of consecutive cows after position 1 with a[i]<12, which is position 2:2<12, position 3:727>12, so ans=1

Then, it swaps back s[0] and s[k-1], so s=[7,2,727,10,12,13]

Then, finds p where a[p]=12, which is position 5.

Then, swaps s[p] and s[k-1], which is swapping position 5 and position 5, doing nothing.

Then, iterates through s, counting the number of cows with a[i]<12 until a cow with a[i]>12 is encountered.

So, starting from position 1:7<12, count=1

Position 2:2<12, count=2

Position 3:727>12, stop.

So, ans1=2

Then, prints the maximum of ans=1 and ans1=2, which is 2.

Which is correct.

But in this approach, it's only considering two specific swaps:

1. Swapping position 1 and position k.

2. Swapping position p (where a[p]=h) and position k.

But according to the problem, I can swap my cow with any position p.

However, in this code, it seems to be considering only these two specific swaps.

Yet, in the example, it's getting the correct answer.

Is this approach generally correct?

Let me think.

In the first step, it swaps s[0] and s[k-1], making s[0]=a[k]

Then, it sets h=s[0]=a[k]

Then, it counts the number of consecutive cows after position 1 with a[i]<h.

This corresponds to the scenario where my cow is at position 1, and the rest of
