Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's this queue of n people, and Kirill comes in and stands at the end, making it n+1 people in total. But he doesn't like waiting, so he wants to bribe people to move up in the queue, aiming to be among the first m people.

Each person in the queue has two values: a_i and b_i. If Kirill wants to swap places with someone ahead of him (someone at position j, where j < i), he has to pay a_j coins to that person. Additionally, for everyone between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to each of them.

He can do this operation any number of times, and he wants to spend as little as possible to reach a position among the first m.

Okay, so I need to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position <= m.

Let me think about this.

First, Kirill starts at position n (since he's at the end, before the n-th person, I think? Wait, person number n is the last one, and Kirill is after that, so position n+1. But in the input, n is the number of people before Kirill, so his position is n+1.

But in the problem, it says "the n-th person", and Kirill is after that, so position n+1.

But in the code, it's handling n people, and Kirill is at position n.

I need to make sure I understand the indexing.

Let me assume that the positions are 1 to n, with Kirill initially at position n+1.

But in the code, it seems like Kirill is at position n.

Wait, in the input, it's n people in the queue, starting from person 1 to n, and Kirill is at position n+1.

But in the code, lista_A and lista_B are indexed from 0 to n-1, corresponding to people 1 to n.

So, Kirill is at position n.

He wants to be among the first m positions, so positions 1 to m.

He can perform swaps: choose any j < i, swap with j, paying a_j, and for each k between j and i, pay b_k.

He can do this any number of times.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach a position <= m.

Let me try to understand the approach in the given code.

The function func_1() reads n and m, then reads list a and list b, reverses them.

Wait, why reverse them?

Let me see.

After reversing, lista_A and lista_B are in reverse order.

So, position n becomes index 0, position n-1 becomes index 1, etc.

Then, it initializes soma_b = 0 and pref = 0.

Then, it loops for i in range(n - k):

Wait, n - k? But in the input, it's n and m, so maybe k is m?

Wait, in the code, it's (n, k) = map(int, input().split()), but in the problem, it's n and m.

Wait, in the problem, it's n and m, but in the code, it's n and k.

Probably, k is m.

Assuming k = m.

In the loop, for i in range(n - k):

If lista_A[i] < lista_B[i], then pref += soma_b + lista_A[i], and soma_b = 0.

Else, soma_b += lista_B[i].

Then, resultado is set to infinity, and another loop from i in range(n - k, n):

resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])

soma_b += lista_B[i]

Finally, print(resultado).

I need to understand what this is doing.

First, it's reversing the lists, so position n is now index 0, position n-1 is index 1, etc.

Then, it's iterating from i=0 to i=(n - k) -1.

So, i from 0 to n - k -1.

Which corresponds to positions n down to k+1.

Wait, k is m, so n - m.

Wait, but in the problem, m is the maximum allowable final position.

So, if he wants to be among the first m positions, positions 1 to m.

In the reversed list, position n is index 0, position n-1 is index 1, ..., position m is index n - m.

Wait, I need to think carefully about the indices.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2.

He wants to be in positions 1 or 2.

Initially, he is at position 5 (n+1=5).

But in the code, lista_A = [9,6,3,7] after reversing.

lista_B = [5,8,3,4]

Then, n - k = 4 - 2 = 2.

So, loop for i in range(2):

i=0: lista_A[0]=9 < lista_B[0]=5? 9 < 5? No, so soma_b += lista_B[0] = 5.

i=1: lista_A[1]=6 < lista_B[1]=8? 6 < 8? Yes, so pref += soma_b + lista_A[1] = 5 + 6 = 11, and soma_b = 0.

Then, resultado = infinity.

Loop from i=2 to i=3:

i=2: resultado = min(inf, pref + soma_b + lista_A[2]) = min(inf, 11 + 0 + 3) = 3.

Then, soma_b += lista_B[2] = 0 + 3 = 3.

i=3: resultado = min(3, 11 + 3 + 7) = min(3, 21) = 3.

Then, print(3).

But in the sample output, it's 14.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, the sample input has 4 test cases.

First test case:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

Output: 14

But according to the code, it's printing 3, but sample output is 14.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the code.

Or maybe I misread the positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to understand the logic better.

Let me try to think differently.

Kirill is at position n+1, and he wants to be in positions <= m.

He can perform operations where he chooses j < i, pays a_j, and for each k between j and i, pays b_k.

He can do this any number of times.

I need to find the minimal cost to reach a position <= m.

Let me think about how to model this.

One way is to think of this as a graph where positions are nodes, and there are edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i.

Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimal cost to go from position n+1 to any position <= m.

But with n up to 2e5, building a graph explicitly is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Maybe I can think in terms of prefix sums.

Let me think about what the cost would be if Kirill directly jumps to some position j <= m.

What's the cost for that?

If he goes directly from n+1 to j, he needs to pay a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to n.

But he can perform multiple operations, choosing to go through intermediate positions.

So, it's not just direct jumps.

He can perform multiple swaps to reach his desired position.

So, I need to find the minimal cost path from n+1 to any j <= m.

But building a graph is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Perhaps I can think of it as a dynamic programming problem.

Let dp[i] be the minimal cost to reach position i from n+1.

Then, dp[n+1] = 0.

And for each i from n+1 down to 1, I can consider all j < i and compute dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[i] + a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i).

But this is still O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Maybe I can find a way to compute the minimal cost without considering all possibilities.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Kirill decides to perform operations sequentially.

Each operation involves choosing j < i, paying a_j, and paying b_k for k from j+1 to i.

After the operation, he is at position j.

He can repeat this until he reaches a position <= m.

I need to minimize the total cost.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but I need a better way to model it.

Another way is to think about the total cost involved in moving from n+1 to some position <=m.

Each operation involves selecting a j < i and paying a_j plus the sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i.

I need to minimize the total cost.

Let me try to think about prefix sums.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b_k from k=1 to i.

Then, sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i is prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + (prefix_b[i] - prefix_b[j]).

Wait, but b_k is for k between j and i, which in terms of indices needs to be carefully considered.

Wait, in the reversed list, the indices are different.

I need to be careful with the indices.

Let me try to think in terms of original positions.

Let me define:

- positions 1 to n, with person 1 at position 1, ..., person n at position n.

- Kirill is at position n+1.

He wants to reach position <=m.

He can perform operations where he chooses j < i, pays a_j, and for each k from j+1 to i, pays b_k.

He can do this any number of times.

I need to find the minimal total cost to reach a position <=m.

Let me try to model this as a graph where nodes are positions, and edges from i to j (j < i) with cost a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i} b_k.

Then, the problem is to find the shortest path from n+1 to any node <=m.

But with n up to 2e5, a standard shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra would be too slow because it's O(n^2).

I need a smarter way.

Let me see if I can find a pattern or a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform operations in such a way that he can skip multiple positions at once.

Wait, actually, by choosing j < i, he can jump from i to j, paying a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i} b_k.

I need to find a sequence of such jumps to reach from n+1 to <=m with minimal total cost.

Let me try to think about what the minimal cost would be.

Suppose Kirill decides to go directly from n+1 to some j <=m.

The cost would be a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n+1} b_k.

But since b_k is for k between j and i, i.e., j < k < i.

Wait, in the problem statement, for each k such that j < k < i, pay b_k.

So, from i to j, pay a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

In terms of positions, position j < position i.

In the reversed list, lower indices correspond to higher positions.

Wait, maybe it's better not to reverse the list.

Let me try to think without reversing.

Let me define positions 1 to n, with person 1 at position 1, ..., person n at position n, and Kirill at position n+1.

He wants to reach position <=m.

He can perform operations where he chooses j < i, pays a_j, and for each k where j < k < i, pays b_k.

He can do this any number of times.

I need to find the minimal total cost to reach a position <=m.

Let me try to model this.

Let me consider that Kirill starts at position n+1.

He can choose any j < n+1, i.e., any j from 1 to n.

He pays a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n+1} b_k.

Wait, but in the problem, b_k is for k from j < k < i.

So, for k between j and i, which is j < k < i.

In this case, from i = n+1 to j, it's j < k < n+1, so sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k, because k < i = n+1.

Wait, positions are 1 to n, and i = n+1.

So, sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Because k < i = n+1.

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, from i to j, with j < i, and i = n+1, sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k = sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Yes.

So, the cost to swap from n+1 to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Similarly, if he is at some position i, and wants to swap to j < i, the cost is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Wait, but in this specific case, since he's moving from n+1 to j, it's sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Wait, but in general, if he's at position i and wants to go to j < i, the cost is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

In this case, i-1 = n, since i = n+1.

So, sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Yes.

So, the cost to go directly from n+1 to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k.

Similarly, if he chooses to go through intermediate positions.

But considering that, perhaps the minimal cost is the minimum over all j <=m of (a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{n} b_k).

But maybe there are better ways by going through intermediate positions.

Wait, but is that the case?

Let me see.

Suppose he goes from n+1 to j1, paying a_j1 + sum_{k=j1+1}^{n} b_k.

Then, from j1 to j2, paying a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{j1} b_k.

And so on, until he reaches some j <=m.

I need to see if there's a way to reduce the total cost by performing multiple operations.

Let me consider two operations:

First, from n+1 to j1, paying a_j1 + sum_{k=j1+1}^{n} b_k.

Then, from j1 to j2, paying a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{j1} b_k.

Total cost: a_j1 + sum_{k=j1+1}^{n} b_k + a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{j1} b_k.

Which is a_j1 + a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

Wait, sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

Because sum_{k=j1+1}^{n} b_k + sum_{k=j2+1}^{j1} b_k = sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

So, total cost: a_j1 + a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

Similarly, if he goes directly from n+1 to j2, the cost would be a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

Comparing the two:

- Direct: a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

- Indirect: a_j1 + a_j2 + sum_{k=j2+1}^{n} b_k.

The indirect way adds an extra a_j1, which is probably worse.

So, it seems that it's better to go directly to the final position, rather than going through intermediate positions.

Wait, but maybe there are cases where going through intermediate positions is better.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first sample input:

n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

He wants to be in positions 1 or 2.

Option 1: Go directly to position 1.

Cost: a1 + sum_{k=2 to 4} b_k = 7 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 7 + 16 = 23.

Option 2: Go directly to position 2.

Cost: a2 + sum_{k=3 to 4} b_k = 3 + 8 + 5 = 3 + 13 = 16.

Option 3: Go from n+1 to position 3, then to position 1 or 2.

From n+1 to position 3: a3 + sum_{k=4}^{4} b_k = 6 + 5 = 11.

Then, from position 3 to position 1: a1 + sum_{k=2}^{2} b_k = 7 + 3 = 10.

Total: 11 + 10 = 21.

Or from position 3 to position 2: a2 + sum_{k=3}^{3} b_k = 3 + 8 = 11.

Total: 11 + 11 = 22.

Which is worse than going directly to position 2 (16).

Another option: from n+1 to position 4, then to position 2.

From n+1 to position 4: a4 + sum_{k=5 to 4} b_k = a4 + 0 = 9.

Then, from position 4 to position 2: a2 + sum_{k=3}^{3} b_k = 3 + 8 = 11.

Total: 9 + 11 = 20.

Still worse than going directly to position 2 (16).

So, in this case, going directly to position 2 is better.

Wait, but the sample output is 14, not 16.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me check the sample input and output again.

Sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

Output: 14

But according to my earlier calculation, going directly to position 2 costs 3 + 8 + 5 = 16, but sample output is 14.

So, perhaps there is a better way.

Wait, maybe I missed something in the operations.

Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform multiple operations, and choose the sequence that minimizes the total cost.

Perhaps there is a way to overlap the sums and get a better total cost.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform operations sequentially, and try to find a pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a sliding window or using prefix sums in a smarter way.

Let me try to define prefix sums for b.

Let me define prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1 to i].

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

In this problem, from i to j, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

In the specific case where i = n+1, sum from k=j+1 to n.

So, sum from k=j+1 to n} b_k = prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j].

So, the cost to go from n+1 to j is a_j + (prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j]).

Similarly, if he is at position i and wants to go to j < i, the cost is a_j + (prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]).

Now, to find the minimal total cost to reach any position <=m, perhaps I can iterate from position n down to 1, keeping track of the minimal cost to reach position <=m.

Wait, maybe dynamic programming can be used here.

Let me define dp[j] as the minimal cost to reach position j from n+1.

Then, dp[j] = a_j + (prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j])

Because to go directly from n+1 to j, the cost is a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j].

Similarly, if he goes through some intermediate position i (j < i < n+1), then dp[j] = dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k.

Which is dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j].

But I need to minimize dp[j] over all possible i > j.

So, dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

But this is still O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[j] in O(n) time.

Let me see.

Let me rearrange the expression.

dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j])

= a_j - prefix_b[j] + min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, let's define temp = min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

Then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

So, if I can compute temp for each j, then dp[j] can be computed efficiently.

Now, temp is the minimum over i from j+1 to n of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

So, I can compute temp for each j by keeping a running minimum as I iterate j from n down to 1.

Yes, that seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Compute prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1 to i]

Then, initialize dp[n+1] = 0

Then, for j from n down to 1:

temp = dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j]  # since i starts from j+1

for i from j+1 to n:

temp = min(temp, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

then, dp[j] = a_j + (prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j]) + temp

Wait, no.

Wait, earlier I had dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

But I need to make sure of the exact expression.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust.

Let me re-express.

The direct cost from n+1 to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j]

If he goes through some i > j, then the cost is dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k = dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] = min( direct cost, min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) )

= min( a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) )

Now, factoring out a_j - prefix_b[j]:

dp[j] = min( a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1]) ) + a_j - prefix_b[j]

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Let me try to define:

dp[j] = a_j + min( prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of (dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]) )

Wait, still messy.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that dp[j] represents the minimal cost to reach position j from n+1.

Then, dp[j] can be computed as:

dp[j] = a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k  # direct jump

or

dp[j] = dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k  for some i > j

So, dp[j] = min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k )

Or, dp[j] = min( a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k ) )

Now, sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k + sum_{k=i to n} b_k

Wait, if i > j, then sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k + sum_{k=i to n} b_k

So, dp[j] = min( a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k ) )

Which is dp[j] = min( a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, min over i > j of (dp[i] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k ) )

Now, let's factor out a_j:

dp[j] = a_j + min( sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, min over i > j of (dp[i] + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k ) )

Now, sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k + sum_{k=i to n} b_k

So, dp[j] = a_j + min( sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, min over i > j of (dp[i] + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k ) )

= a_j + min( sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, min over i > j of (dp[i] + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k ) )

Now, let's define temp = min over i > j of (dp[i] + sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k )

Then, dp[j] = a_j + min( sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k, temp )

Now, sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k + sum_{k=i to n} b_k for any i > j.

But I'm not sure if this helps directly.

Let me consider computing dp[j] for j from n down to 1.

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0.

Then, dp[j] = a_j + sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k + min_over_i > j of ( dp[i] + sum_{k=i to n} b_k - sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k )

Wait, that seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that sum_{k=j+1 to i-1} b_k = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

And sum_{k=j+1 to n} b_k = prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] = min( a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] ) )

Now, dp[j] = a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j] if direct jump.

Or dp[j] = dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] for some i > j.

So, dp[j] = min( a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] + a_j ) )

Wait, I think I messed up the terms.

Let me try to rearrange.

dp[j] = min( a_j + prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + a_j + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] ) )

= a_j - prefix_b[j] + min( prefix_b[n], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) )

So, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min( prefix_b[n], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) )

Now, define temp = min( prefix_b[n], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) )

Then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

Now, temp can be precomputed by keeping a running minimum of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) for i from j+1 to n.

But dp[i] depends on positions higher than j, so perhaps I can compute dp[j] in descending order of j.

Let me try to implement this logic.

First, compute prefix_b[i] = sum of b[1 to i]

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0

Then, for j from n down to 1:

temp = dp[j+1] + prefix_b[j]

for i from j+1 to n:

temp = min(temp, dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1])

then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

But this is still O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to compute temp in O(1) time.

Let me see.

If I iterate j from n down to 1, and keep track of the minimum of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) for i > j.

I can maintain a variable that keeps the minimum value of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) as I iterate j downwards.

Yes, that seems possible.

Let me try to set it up.

Compute prefix_b[i] for i from 1 to n.

Initialize dp[n+1] = 0

Initialize min_val = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]  # since i starts from n+1, but n+1 is out of bounds for prefix_b.

Wait, prefix_b is defined for i from 1 to n.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the indices.

Let me define prefix_b[0] = 0

prefix_b[1] = b[1]

prefix_b[2] = b[1] + b[2]

...

prefix_b[n] = b[1] + ... + b[n]

Then, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

And sum from k=j+1 to n is prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j]

Now, for dp[j], it's a_j + min( sum from k=j+1 to n of b_k, min over i > j of ( dp[i] + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 of b_k ) )

Which is a_j + min( prefix_b[n] - prefix_b[j], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] ) )

= a_j - prefix_b[j] + min( prefix_b[n], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) )

So, define temp = min( prefix_b[n], min over i > j of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) )

Then, dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + temp

Now, I can compute temp by keeping a running minimum of dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] for i from j+1 to n.

But to optimize, I can maintain a variable that stores the minimum value of ( dp[i] + prefix_b[i-1] ) for i from j+1 to n.

As j decreases from n to 1, I can update this minimum value.

Wait, let's try to implement this.

Initialize min_val = dp[n+1] + prefix_b[n]

But dp[n+1] is 0, so min_val = 0 + prefix_b[n] = prefix_b[n]

Then, for j from n down to 1:

dp[j] = a_j - prefix_b[j] + min_val

Then, min_val = min( min_val, dp[j] + prefix_b[j] )

Wait, let's see.

At each step, after computing dp[j], I need to update min_val for lower j.

min_val should be the minimum of min_val and dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1]

Wait, no.

Wait, dp[j] + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 for i > j.

Wait, dp[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

But I need dp[j] + prefix_b[i-1]

Wait, perhaps I need to set min_val = min( min_val, dp[j] + prefix_b[j-1] )

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think again.

After computing dp[j], I need to consider dp[j] + sum from k=j+1 to i-1 for i > j.

sum from k=j+1 to i-1 = prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

So, dp[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j]

Now, to find min over i > j of ( dp[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] ), but since prefix_b[i-1] is increasing as i increases, the minimal value would be for the smallest i > j, which is i = j+1.

So, min over i > j of ( dp[j] + prefix_b[i-1] - prefix_b[j] ) = dp[j] + prefix_b[j] - prefix_b[j] = dp[j]

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, for i = j+1, sum from k=j+1 to i-1 is sum from k=j+1 to j} which is empty sum, so 0.

So, dp[j] + a_j + 0 = dp[j] + a_j

Wait, I'm getting tangled.

I need to find a better way.

Let me look at the code provided.

In the code, it reverses the lists, so position n becomes index 0, position n-1 becomes index 1, etc.

Then, it computes soma_b, which seems to accumulate sum of b_k.

And pref seems to accumulate some prefix sums.

But in the first test case, according to the code, it outputs 3, but the sample output is 14.

So, the code seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Let me look again.

In func_1():

Read n and k.

Read lista_A and lista_B, reverse them.

Initialize soma_b = 0 and pref = 0.

Then, loop for i in range(n - k):

if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:

pref += soma_b + lista_A[i]

soma_b = 0

else:

soma_b += lista_B[i]

Then, set resultado to infinity.

Loop for i in range(n - k, n):

resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])

soma_b += lista_B[i]

Print resultado.

In the first test case:

n=4, k=2

lista_A = [9,6,3,7]

lista_B = [5,8,3,4]

Loop for i in range(2):

i=0: 9 < 5? No, so soma_b += 5 → soma_b=5

i=1: 6 < 8? Yes, so pref += 5 + 6 → pref=11, soma_b=0

Then, resultado = infinity

Loop i=2 to i=3:

i=2: resultado = min(inf, 11 + 0 + 3) = 3

soma_b += 3 → soma_b=3

i=3: resultado = min(3, 11 + 3 +7)= min(3,21)=3

Print 3

But sample output is 14.

So, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**
