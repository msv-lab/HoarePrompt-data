Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand the specifics here.

So, the problem is: given a tree with n vertices, I need to find the maximum number x such that I can remove exactly k edges from the tree, and each remaining connected component has at least x vertices.

First, I need to understand what a tree is. A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges for n vertices. That means, in this problem, there are n-1 edges, connecting all n vertices without forming any cycles.

Now, the task is to remove exactly k edges, not less, not more, and after removal, the remaining graph should consist of some connected components, each having at least x vertices. I need to find the maximum possible x that allows this to happen.

Let's think about how removing edges affects the tree. Each time I remove an edge, I split the tree into two separate subtrees. So, removing one edge will result in two connected components. Removing a second edge will further split one of these components into two, and so on.

Therefore, removing k edges will result in k+1 connected components, since each removal increases the number of components by one, starting from one component (the whole tree).

Given that, I need to ensure that each of these k+1 components has at least x vertices.

My goal is to maximize x, so I need to find the largest possible x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges and have all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This sounds like a binary search problem. I can perform a binary search on x, from 1 to n, and for each x, check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

But wait, n can be up to 10^5, and t (the number of test cases) can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n across all test cases being up to 10^5. So, I need an efficient solution.

Binary search on x seems plausible. For each x, I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

How can I check this efficiently?

I need to think about the tree structure. Since it's a tree, I can perform tree traversals, like DFS or BFS, to analyze the sizes of subtrees.

Let me consider performing a DFS traversal to calculate the sizes of subtrees.

In DFS, I can compute the size of each subtree by summing up the sizes of its child subtrees plus one for the root itself.

Then, for a given x, I can decide which edges to remove: I can remove an edge if and only if both resulting subtrees have at least x vertices.

But I need to remove exactly k edges. So, I need to count how many such edges exist, and see if that count equals k.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward because removing one edge affects the possible edges that can be removed later.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that after removing k edges, there will be k+1 components, each with at least x vertices. So, the total number of vertices is n, which is the sum of the sizes of these k+1 components, each being at least x.

Therefore, (k+1)*x <= n.

So, x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

Wait, that's an upper bound for x, but it might not be achievable, because the tree's structure might not allow splitting into components of that size.

But it's a good starting point. So, x cannot be larger than floor(n / (k+1)), but it might be smaller.

So, perhaps I can set R = floor(n / (k+1)) + 1, and perform binary search between L = 1 and R.

Wait, but in the code provided, L is set to 1 and R to 100000 + 1, which is a larger upper bound.

But perhaps floor(n / (k+1)) is a tighter bound.

Let me think again.

If I have to split the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, then n >= (k+1)*x, so x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

But, in reality, it might not be possible to achieve this bound, depending on the tree's structure.

So, the actual maximum x could be less than floor(n / (k+1)).

Hence, setting R = floor(n / (k+1)) + 1 would be sufficient for binary search.

But in the code, R is set to 100000 + 1, which is larger but safe, since n <= 10^5.

So, binary search on x from 1 to 100001 seems acceptable.

Now, for each x in the binary search, I need to check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

To do this, I need to count the number of edges that can be removed without creating any component with fewer than x vertices.

Wait, more precisely, I need to count the number of edges whose removal would result in two components, both with at least x vertices.

Then, if the number of such edges is at least k, then it's possible to remove k edges, each ensuring that both resulting components have at least x vertices.

Moreover, after removing k such edges, there will be k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, provided that the total number of removable edges is at least k.

But I also need to ensure that after removing k edges, all remaining components have at least x vertices.

Wait, actually, it's a bit more nuanced.

Suppose I have a set of edges that can be removed (each removal results in two components, both with at least x vertices). If I remove k such edges, I need to make sure that no component becomes smaller than x.

But in a tree, removing edges in any order (as long as each removal results in two components with at least x vertices) should ensure that the final components have at least x vertices.

Is that correct?

Let me think with an example.

Take the first example in the problem:

n=5, k=1

Tree edges:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, the tree looks like:

1

| \

2 3 4

|

5

So, if I remove edge 1-3, I get two components: {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both with at least 2 vertices.

So, x=2 is achievable.

But x=3 is not achievable because if I remove edge 1-3, one component has 2 vertices, which is less than 3.

Hence, x=2 is the maximum.

In this case, floor(n / (k+1)) = floor(5 / 2) = 2, which matches.

Another example:

n=2, k=1

Only one edge: 1-2

If I remove it, I get two components: {1} and {2}, each with size 1.

Since x=1 is acceptable, but x=2 would require each component to have at least 2 vertices, which is not possible.

Hence, the answer is 1.

In this case, floor(n / (k+1)) = floor(2 / 2) = 1, which matches.

Another example:

n=6, k=1

Tree edges:

1-2

2-3

3-4

4-5

5-6

A straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6

If I remove edge 3-4, I get {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices.

So, x=3 is achievable.

Is x=4 achievable? No, because removing any edge would result in one component with fewer than 4 vertices.

Hence, x=3 is the maximum.

floor(n / (k+1)) = floor(6 / 2) = 3, which matches.

So, in these cases, floor(n / (k+1)) seems to be achievable.

But in the first example, it was achievable, but in the second example with n=2, k=1, it was also achievable.

Wait, in n=2, k=1, floor(2 / 2) = 1, which is achievable.

But in n=5, k=1, floor(5 / 2) = 2, which was achievable.

In n=6, k=1, floor(6 / 2) = 3, which was achievable.

So, perhaps in general, x = floor(n / (k+1)) is achievable.

But I need to confirm if this always holds.

Wait, consider n=3, k=1

floor(3 / 2) = 1

But if the tree is 1-2-3, removing edge 2-3 gives components {1,2} and {3}

{3} has only one vertex, which is >=1, so x=1 is achievable.

But x=2 is also achievable if I remove edge 1-2, resulting in components {1} and {2,3}, both with at least 2 vertices.

Wait, in this case, floor(3 / 2) = 1, but x=2 is also achievable.

Wait, but x=2 is achievable here.

Wait, in this case, x=2 is achievable, which is greater than floor(3 / 2)=1.

Hmm, so my previous assumption that x <= floor(n / (k+1)) is not tight.

In this case, x=2 > floor(3 / 2)=1.

So, perhaps floor(n / (k+1)) is not always the tightest bound.

Wait, but in this case, x=2 is achievable, but x=3 is not, since n=3, k=1, removing one edge will result in one component with 2 vertices and one with 1 vertex.

So, x=3 is not achievable.

Hence, the maximum x is 2, which is greater than floor(n / (k+1))=1.

So, floor(n / (k+1)) is not always the upper limit.

Hence, I need a better way to determine x.

Perhaps I need to consider the minimal size of components that can be separated by removing k edges.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal size of the largest possible x such that the tree can be split into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

I need to maximize x, such that by removing exactly k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To maximize x, I need to minimize the number of components, which is k+1, and maximize the size of each component.

But, in a tree, removing k edges results in k+1 components.

Each component must have at least x vertices, so the total number of vertices is n >= (k+1)*x.

Hence, x <= floor(n / (k+1)).

But in the n=3, k=1 example, floor(3 / 2)=1, but x=2 is achievable.

Wait, but x=2 is achievable in that case.

So, perhaps floor(n / (k+1)) is not always the tightest upper bound.

Wait, perhaps I need to use ceiling(n / (k+1)).

In the n=3, k=1 case, ceiling(3 / 2)=2, which matches x=2.

In n=5, k=1, ceiling(5 / 2)=3, but in that case, x=3 is not achievable, only x=2 is achievable.

So, x=3 is not achievable, but ceiling(3)=3.

Hence, ceiling(n / (k+1)) is too high in this case.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((n + k) / (k + 1)) or something similar.

Wait, maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for a given x, I need to find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

Then, I need to find the minimal numCuts such that after removing numCuts edges, all components have at least x vertices.

Then, I need numCuts to be exactly k.

But I need to maximize x such that this is possible.

This seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as partitioning the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices.

But I need to maximize x.

This sounds like a classic binary search problem on trees.

I can perform a binary search on x, and for each x, check if it's possible to partition the tree into k+1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing exactly k edges.

To check this, I can perform a DFS and calculate the sizes of subtrees.

In the DFS, for each node, I calculate the size of its subtree.

Then, for a given x, I can count the number of edges that can be removed such that both resulting components have at least x vertices.

Wait, more precisely, for each edge, if I remove it, I need to check if both resulting components have at least x vertices.

If I can find k such edges to remove, then it's possible for that x.

But I need to ensure that the edges I remove don't create components with fewer than x vertices in the process.

Wait, but in a tree, the order of removal doesn't matter because there are no cycles.

So, I can consider all possible edges that can be removed without creating components smaller than x, and if there are at least k such edges, then it's possible to remove k edges while maintaining the component sizes >= x.

Hence, for a given x, I can count the number of edges where both endpoints belong to different components of size >= x after removal.

Wait, more precisely, for each edge, if I remove it, the two resulting components have sizes >= x.

So, in the DFS, as I calculate the subtree sizes, for each edge from a parent to a child, I can check if the child's subtree has size >= x and the remaining tree (n - child's subtree size) >= x.

If both conditions are met, then this edge can be removed.

I collect all such edges and check if their count is >= k.

If it is, then for this x, it's possible to remove k edges.

Otherwise, it's not.

Hence, I can perform a binary search on x from 1 to n, and for each x, count the number of removable edges and see if it's >= k.

Then, take the maximum x for which this is possible.

This seems correct.

Now, looking at the provided code, it seems to implement this idea.

Let's analyze the code step by step.

First, there's a function `func_1()` which seems to handle multiple test cases.

It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, reads `n` and `k`, then reads the tree edges to build the adjacency list `adj`.

Then, it sets `L = 1` and `R = 100001` (which is 10^5 + 1, a safe upper bound).

It performs a binary search loop while `R - L > 1`.

In each iteration, it sets `x = (L + R) // 2`, and calls `dfs(1, 1)` to perform a DFS starting from node 1, with parent 1.

It seems there's a global variable `numCuts` that is reset before each DFS, and `dfs` function returns some value, but in the code provided, it's incomplete.

Wait, looking at the code:

def dfs(a, p):

global numCuts

vertices = 1

for b in adj[a]:

if b != p:

vertices += dfs(b, a)

if vertices >= x and a != p:

numCuts += 1

return 0

return vertices

This function calculates the subtree size for each node and counts the number of edges that can be removed such that the child's subtree has at least x vertices and the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Wait, in the code, it checks `if vertices >= x and a != p:` then `numCuts += 1` and returns 0.

But it seems to miss checking if the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Wait, in the condition `if vertices >= x and a != p:`, it increments `numCuts` and returns 0.

This corresponds to removing the edge between a and its parent p, provided that the child's subtree has at least x vertices, and the remaining tree (which would have n - vertices nodes) has at least x vertices.

But in the code, it doesn't explicitly check if n - vertices >= x.

Wait, perhaps it assumes that if the child's subtree has at least x vertices, and the total number of vertices is n, then the remaining tree has n - vertices vertices, which should be >= x.

Hence, it only checks if vertices >= x and a != p.

But to ensure both components have at least x vertices, we need to make sure that n - vertices >= x as well.

Hence, the condition should be `if vertices >= x and n - vertices >= x and a != p:`.

But in the provided code, it only checks `if vertices >= x and a != p:`.

This is incomplete because it doesn't ensure that the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Hence, the code might count edges where the remaining tree has fewer than x vertices, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the code is flawed in this aspect.

For example, consider n=4, k=1, x=2.

Tree: 1-2-3-4

If I set x=2, and consider removing edge 2-3.

The child's subtree {3,4} has 2 vertices >=2, and the remaining tree {1,2} has 2 vertices >=2.

So, it's okay.

But if x=3, removing any edge will result in one component with fewer than 3 vertices.

For example, remove 2-3: {3,4} has 2 < 3, or {1,2} has 2 < 3.

Hence, x=3 is not achievable.

But according to the code, it would check `if vertices >= x and a != p:`, so for x=3, it would still count edges where vertices >=3, but it doesn't ensure that n - vertices >=3.

Hence, it could incorrectly count edges where one component has >=3 and the other has <3.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
