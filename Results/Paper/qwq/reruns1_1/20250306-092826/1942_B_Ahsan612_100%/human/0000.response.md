Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. We have a permutation p of length n, where each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once. We're also given an array a of length n, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i.

First, I need to recall what MEX means. MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. For example, MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

So, for each position i in the permutation p, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

Our task is, given the array a, to reconstruct the permutation p.

The problem states that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't need to worry about invalid inputs.

Let's look at the example provided to understand better.

Input:

3

5

1 1 -2 1 2

5

1 1 1 1 1

3

-2 1 2

Output:

0 1 4 2 3

0 1 2 3 4

2 0 1

Looking at the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Corresponding p=[0,1,4,2,3]

Let's verify:

For i=1: MEX(0) is 1, so a_1=1-0=1

For i=2: MEX(0,1) is 2, a_2=2-1=1

For i=3: MEX(0,1,4) is 2, a_3=2-4=-2

For i=4: MEX(0,1,4,2) is 3, a_4=3-2=1

For i=5: MEX(0,1,4,2,3) is 5, a_5=5-3=2

Which matches the given a.

Similarly, for the second test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

p=[0,1,2,3,4]

For each i, MEX(0 to i-1) is i, so a_i=i - (i-1)=1, which matches.

Third test case:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

p=[2,0,1]

Check:

i=1: MEX(2)=0, a_1=0-2=-2

i=2: MEX(2,0)=1, a_2=1-0=1

i=3: MEX(2,0,1)=3, a_3=3-1=2

Again, matches.

So, the problem is to find p given a, using the relation a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

We need to construct p such that this relation holds for all i.

Constraints:

- t <= 10^4

- n <= 2*10^5 per test case

- Sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5

So, it's important that the solution is efficient, probably O(n) per test case.

Given that, let's think about how to approach this.

First, since p is a permutation from 0 to n-1, all values in p are distinct and within this range.

MEX of p_1 to p_i is the smallest non-negative integer not present in p_1 to p_i.

We need to find p such that a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i for each i.

Given that, perhaps we can find a way to compute MEX incrementally as we build p.

But it's not straightforward. Maybe it's better to think in reverse.

Let's consider building p from the end to the beginning.

Suppose we have p_n. Then a_n = MEX(p_1 to p_n) - p_n.

But MEX(p_1 to p_n) is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_n.

Since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the MEX of the entire permutation is n, because all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

Wait, but in the example, for n=5, a_5=5-3=2, which matches.

Similarly, in the second example, a_5=5-4=1.

So, MEX of p_1 to p_n is n, since all numbers from 0 to n-1 are present.

Similarly, MEX of p_1 to p_{n-1} would be n if p_n is n-1, or it could be the missing number in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe instead of thinking about MEX directly, I can keep track of which numbers have been used in p so far.

Let me think about iterating from the start.

Initialize an empty set to keep track of used numbers.

For each position i from 1 to n:

- Compute MEX of p_1 to p_i.

- Given a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i, so p_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - a_i.

But MEX(p_1 to p_i) is unknown here.

Alternatively, maybe express MEX in terms of p_i and a_i.

From a_i = MEX - p_i, so MEX = a_i + p_i.

So, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

But p_i is unknown, so this doesn't directly help.

Wait, but MEX is determined by p_1 to p_i, so perhaps I can find a way to determine p_i based on a_i and the previous a's.

This seems complicated.

Maybe it's better to consider the properties of MEX.

Let's think about the range of possible MEX values.

MEX of p_1 to p_i can be from 0 to i, because if p_1 to p_i are 0 to i-1, MEX is i.

Otherwise, it's the smallest missing number in that range.

Given that, MEX(p_1 to p_i) is at least 0 and at most i.

Given a_i = MEX - p_i, and p_i is between 0 and n-1, a_i can be from -n to n, which matches the constraints.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute p_i in terms of a_i and MEX.

Wait, from a_i = MEX - p_i, we have p_i = MEX - a_i.

If I can find MEX, I can find p_i.

But MEX depends on p_1 to p_i, which are unknown.

This seems circular.

Maybe I need to find a way to compute MEX incrementally.

Let me consider processing the array from left to right, keeping track of the used numbers and the current MEX.

Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers.

Initialize MEX to 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

- Find p_i = MEX - a_i.

- Add p_i to the used set.

- Update MEX to the smallest number not in the used set.

But updating MEX each time might be inefficient if done naively.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute MEX.

An efficient way to compute MEX is to keep a boolean array indicating used numbers and iterate to find the smallest unused number.

But for n up to 2e5, this might not be efficient enough if done for each i.

I need a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps processing from the end to the beginning could be more efficient.

Let's consider processing from i = n down to i = 1.

At position i, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

From the previous thoughts, MEX(p_1 to p_i) = a_i + p_i.

But MEX(p_1 to p_i) is also equal to MEX(p_1 to p_{i+1}) if p_{i+1} is not equal to MEX(p_1 to p_i).

Wait, maybe that's too convoluted.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have p_{n}, and I know that MEX(p_1 to p_n) is n, since p is a permutation from 0 to n-1.

So, a_n = n - p_n, so p_n = n - a_n.

Similarly, for p_{n-1}, MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) is either n-1 or some other value depending on p_n.

Wait, but p_n is known from above.

Actually, MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Given that p_n is already determined, and p_n is part of the permutation, maybe I can find MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1}) based on p_n.

This seems promising.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote MEX_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i).

We know that MEX_n = n, since p is a permutation from 0 to n-1.

From a_i = MEX_i - p_i, so p_i = MEX_i - a_i.

Our goal is to find p_i for all i.

Let's try to compute p_i starting from the end.

At i = n:

MEX_n = n

p_n = MEX_n - a_n = n - a_n

Then, for i = n-1:

MEX_{n-1} = MEX(p_1 to p_{n-1})

But p_n is already determined, and p_n was part of the full permutation.

Wait, MEX_{n-1} is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

Since p_n is known, and p_n is not in p_1 to p_{n-1}, MEX_{n-1} could be p_n if p_n is the smallest missing number in p_1 to p_{n-1}.

But p_n is already determined, so perhaps I can find MEX_{n-1} based on whether p_n is the smallest missing number.

This seems complicated.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

We know p=[0,1,4,2,3]

Let's see:

For i=5:

MEX_5 = 5 (since p_1 to p_5 are 0,1,4,2,3)

p_5 = 5 - 2 = 3 (since a_5=2)

Okay, matches.

For i=4:

MEX_4 = MEX(0,1,4,2) = 3

p_4 = 3 - 1 = 2

Okay.

For i=3:

MEX_3 = MEX(0,1,4) = 2

p_3 = 2 - (-2) = 4

Okay.

And so on.

So, it seems that MEX_i can be determined based on MEX_{i+1} and p_i.

Wait, perhaps I can maintain MEX as I go backwards.

Let's try.

Initialize MEX = n (for i=n)

Then, p_n = MEX - a_n

Then, for i from n-1 down to 1:

p_i = MEX - a_i

If p_i < MEX, then MEX remains the same, else MEX = p_i

Wait, no.

Actually, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

When we move from i+1 to i, we're removing p_{i+1} from the set.

So, MEX_i could be less than or equal to MEX_{i+1}.

Wait, maybe I can track the used numbers and find MEX accordingly.

But that might not be efficient.

Let me see the provided code and understand its logic.

The provided code does the following:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Read n.

- Read array a of length n.

- Initialize res (result permutation) as a list of n Nones.

- Initialize mex = n.

- Iterate from i = n-1 down to 0:

- Set res[i] = mex - a[i]

- If mex > mex - a[i], set mex = mex - a[i]

- Print the result permutation.

Let's see if this logic is correct.

Take the first test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Iterate from i=4 down to 0:

Initialize mex=5

i=4:

res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3

if 5 > 3, set mex=3

i=3:

res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2

if 3 > 2, set mex=2

i=2:

res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4

if 2 > 4, no change to mex=2

i=1:

res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1

if 2 > 1, set mex=1

i=0:

res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0

if 1 > 0, set mex=0

So, p=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the first test case.

Another test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Initialize mex=5

i=4:

res[4]=5-1=4, mex=5 (since 5 > 4)

i=3:

res[3]=5-1=4, but wait, previous mex was updated to 4, so mex=4

res[3]=4-1=3, mex=4 (4 > 3)

i=2:

res[2]=4-1=3, mex=4 (4 > 3)

Wait, no, previous mex was 4, and res[3]=3, which is less than 4, so mex=3

Then, for i=2:

res[2]=3-1=2, mex=3 (3 > 2)

i=1:

res[1]=2-1=1, mex=2 (2 > 1)

i=0:

res[0]=1-1=0, mex=1 (1 > 0)

So, p=[0,1,2,3,4], which matches the second test case.

Third test case:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

Initialize mex=3

i=2:

res[2]=3-2=1, mex=3 (3 > 1)

i=1:

res[1]=3-1=2, mex=3 (3 > 2)

i=0:

res[0]=3 - (-2)=5, but p_i should be between 0 and 2, so 5 is invalid.

Wait, but in the sample output, p=[2,0,1]

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the indexing.

In Python, lists are 0-based, so i=0 is the first element.

Wait, let's apply the algorithm to the third test case properly.

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

Initialize mex=3

i=2:

res[2]=3-2=1, mex=3 (3 > 1)

i=1:

res[1]=3-1=2, mex=3 (3 > 2)

i=0:

res[0]=3 - (-2)=5, but p_i should be between 0 and 2, which is invalid.

But in the sample output, p=[2,0,1]

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=3, a=[-2,1,2], output is [2,0,1]

Let's see:

i=2:

res[2]=3-2=1, mex=3 (3 > 1)

i=1:

res[1]=3-1=2, mex=3 (3 > 2)

i=0:

res[0]=3 - (-2)=5, which is invalid since p_i should be between 0 and 2.

But in the sample output, p=[2,0,1], which corresponds to:

a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2

a_2 = MEX(2,0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1

a_3 = MEX(2,0,1) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2

Which matches.

But according to the algorithm, res[0]=5, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the algorithm.

Looking back at the code:

mex = n

for i in range(len(ar)-1, -1, -1):

res[i] = mex - ar[i]

if mex > mex - ar[i]:

mex = mex - ar[i]

In the third test case:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

Initialize mex=3

i=2:

res[2]=3-2=1, mex=3 (since 3 > 1)

i=1:

res[1]=3-1=2, mex=3 (since 3 > 2)

i=0:

res[0]=3 - (-2)=5, which is invalid, but in the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm is incorrect, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe mex should be updated only if mex - a[i] < mex.

Wait, in the code, if mex > mex - a[i], then mex = mex - a[i]

Which is equivalent to if a[i] > 0, since mex - a[i] = mex - a[i]

Wait, a[i] can be negative, so need to be careful.

In the third test case, when i=0:

mex=3, a[0]=-2, so res[0]=3 - (-2)=5, which is invalid.

But in the sample output, p[0]=2.

So, perhaps the algorithm needs to ensure that p_i is within 0 to n-1.

But the problem states that the input is given in such a way that at least one valid p exists, so perhaps the algorithm ensures that p_i is within 0 to n-1.

But in this case, it seems to produce 5, which is invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps mex should be updated to the minimum of mex and mex - a[i].

Wait, in the code, it's:

if mex > mex - a[i]:

mex = mex - a[i]

Which is equivalent to:

if a[i] > 0:

mex = mex - a[i]

Which makes sense because if a_i = MEX_i - p_i, and p_i = mex - a[i], then to maintain mex as the MEX of p_1 to p_i, we need to adjust mex accordingly.

But in the third test case, it's producing p[0]=5, which is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that p_i must be between 0 and n-1, so if p_i = mex - a[i], and p_i must be >=0 and <=n-1.

So, perhaps mex - a[i] should be in [0, n-1].

Given that a_i = MEX_i - p_i, and MEX_i >=0 and MEX_i > p_i (since MEX_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i), so a_i can be positive or negative depending on MEX_i and p_i.

But in the third test case, p_i=5 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps the condition to update mex is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we iterate from the end to the beginning, and keep track of the used numbers.

Initialize a set used, and initialize mex = n

For each i from n-1 down to 0:

p_i = mex - a_i

Add p_i to used

Update mex to the smallest number not in used

But updating mex each time would be O(n) time, which is acceptable since n <= 2e5 and sum of n over all test cases is <=2e5.

But implementing this directly might be inefficient.

Alternatively, I can use a deque or some other structure to keep track of the available mex values.

But perhaps the provided code's logic is sufficient with some adjustments.

Looking back at the provided code:

mex = n

for i in range(len(ar)-1, -1, -1):

res[i] = mex - ar[i]

if mex > mex - ar[i]:

mex = mex - ar[i]

In the third test case, when i=0, res[0]=3 - (-2)=5, which is invalid.

But in the sample output, p[0]=2.

So, perhaps the condition should be different.

Wait, perhaps mex should be updated only if p_i < mex.

In the code, it's updating mex when mex > mex - a[i], which is equivalent to a_i > 0.

But in the third test case, a[0]=-2, so a_i < 0, so mex is not updated based on p_i.

Wait, but p_i=5, which is greater than mex=3, so perhaps mex should be updated to p_i in this case.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be if p_i < mex, then mex = p_i.

But in the third test case, p_i=5 > mex=3, so mex remains 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that mex is the smallest number not in used.

Wait, maybe I need to track the used numbers.

Let me try implementing this logic.

Initialize used as an empty set()

mex = n

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

p_i = mex - a[i]

used.add(p_i)

while mex in used:

mex +=1

This ensures that mex is the smallest non-negative integer not in used.

But this might be inefficient if mex increases a lot.

Given that p_i are distinct and between 0 and n-1, mex should not exceed n.

In the third test case, when i=0:

p_0=3 - (-2)=5, which is invalid since n=3.

But in the sample output, p_0=2.

So, perhaps the algorithm needs to set p_i to the current mex and update mex accordingly.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the way mex is updated.

Let me consider that when p_i < mex, then the new mex is p_i, because p_i is now used, and if p_i was the smallest missing number, the new mex would be p_i +1.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps a better approach is to iterate from the end to the beginning, keeping track of the used numbers and maintaining a deque or a list of available mex values.

But to keep it simple, perhaps the provided code's logic is correct, and I'm just misunderstanding the third test case.

Looking back at the third test case:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

According to the provided code:

mex=3

i=2:

res[2]=3-2=1, since 3 > 1, set mex=1

i=1:

res[1]=1-1=0, since 1 > 0, set mex=0

i=0:

res[0]=0 - (-2)=2, since 0 > 2 is False, mex remains 0

So, p=[2,0,1], which matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I had a mistake in calculating res[0].

So, res[0]=0 - (-2)=2, which is valid since 0 > 2 is False, so mex remains 0.

Thus, p=[2,0,1], which is correct.

I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, the provided code seems to be correct.

Let me see if this logic holds for other test cases.

First test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

mex=5

i=4:

res[4]=5-2=3, since 5 > 3, set mex=3

i=3:

res[3]=3-1=2, since 3 > 2, set mex=2

i=2:

res[2]=2 - (-2)=4, since 2 > 4 is False, mex remains 2

i=1:

res[1]=2-1=1, since 2 > 1, set mex=1

i=0:

res[0]=1-1=0, since 1 > 0, set mex=0

So, p=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the first test case.

Second test case:

n=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]

mex=5

i=4:

res[4]=5-1=4, since 5 > 4, set mex=4

i=3:

res[3]=4-1=3, since 4 > 3, set mex=3

i=2:

res[2]=3-1=2, since 3 > 2, set mex=2

i=1:

res[1]=2-1=1, since 2 > 1, set mex=1

i=0:

res[0]=1-1=0, since 1 > 0, set mex=0

So, p=[0,1,2,3,4], which matches the second test case.

Third test case:

n=3, a=[-2,1,2]

mex=3

i=2:

res[2]=3-2=1, since 3 > 1, set mex=1

i=1:

res[1]=1-1=0, since 1 > 0, set mex=0

i=0:

res[0]=0 - (-2)=2, since 0 > 2 is False, mex remains 0

So, p=[2,0,1], which matches the third test case.

Therefore, the provided code seems to be correct.

But why does this logic work?

Let's try to understand the logic behind the provided code.

We initialize mex to n, since for the entire permutation, MEX is n.

Then, we iterate from the end to the beginning.

For each position i, we set p_i = mex - a_i.

Then, if mex > p_i, we set mex = p_i.

Why does this make sense?

From a_i = MEX_i - p_i, we have p_i = MEX_i - a_i.

So, setting p_i = mex - a_i assumes that MEX_i = mex.

But MEX_i is the MEX of p_1 to p_i.

By iterating backwards, we're assuming that mex is the MEX of p_1 to p_i for each i.

When we set p_i = mex - a_i, we're effectively setting p_i based on the current mex.

Then, if mex > p_i, we update mex to p_i.

This makes sense because if p_i < mex, then the MEX of p_1 to p_i would be p_i, since p_i is now the smallest missing number in p_1 to p_i.

Wait, no.

Actually, if p_i < mex, then the MEX of p_1 to p_i is p_i, because p_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

Wait, no.

If p_i < mex, then p_i is not in p_{i+1} to p_n, but it is now in p_1 to p_i.

So, the MEX of p_1 to p_i is the smallest number not in p_1 to p_i.

If p_i is less than mex, then mex was higher before adding p_i, but now mex should be updated to p_i if p_i is smaller than the current mex.

Wait, perhaps it's better not to overthink it and accept that the provided code works based on the test cases.

Given that, I can conclude that the provided code is correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the given array `a`, where each element `a_i` is calculated as the MEX of the first `i` elements of `p` minus `p_i`. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**:
   - We start by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Constructing the Permutation**:
   - We initialize a result list `res` of size `n` to store the permutation.
   - We set `mex` to `n`, as the MEX of the entire permutation is `n`.
   - We iterate from the end of the array to the beginning:
     - Calculate `p_i` as `mex - a_i`.
     - Set `res[i]` to `p_i`.
     - If `mex > p_i`, update `mex` to `p_i`.

3. **Output the Permutation**:
   - Print the permutation for each test case.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > res[i]:
                mex = res[i]
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**:
  - Read the input values for the number of test cases and the array `a`.

- **Constructing the Permutation**:
  - Start with `mex` set to `n`, since the MEX of the full permutation is `n`.
  - Iterate backwards from `n-1` to `0`:
    - Calculate each `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - a_i`.
    - Update `mex` to `p_i` if `mex > p_i`.

- **Output**:
  - Print the constructed permutation for each test case.

This approach ensures that we correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the MEX operation properties.
