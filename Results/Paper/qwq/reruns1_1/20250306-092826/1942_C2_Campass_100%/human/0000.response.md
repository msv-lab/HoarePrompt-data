Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a regular polygon with n sides, and she's chosen x vertices. I need to choose up to y additional vertices such that when we draw non-intersecting diagonals using these chosen vertices, the number of triangular pieces of cake is maximized.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is. It's a polygon with all sides and angles equal. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise manner.

Bessie has already chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more. The total number of chosen vertices will be x plus the number I choose, but no more than y additional ones.

The goal is to maximize the number of triangular pieces that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between these chosen vertices.

I need to think about how choosing more vertices affects the number of triangles. Intuitively, the more vertices we have, the more triangles we can form, but there might be some constraints based on how these vertices are arranged.

Let me consider the properties of a regular polygon and the chosen vertices.

Since it's a regular polygon, the vertices are evenly spaced on a circle. The diagonals are non-intersecting inside the polygon, which means they don't cross each other.

I recall that in a polygon, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is related to the number of triangles in a triangulation. For a convex polygon with k sides, the number of triangles in a triangulation is k - 2.

But in this problem, we're not necessarily triangulating the entire polygon, just the subset of chosen vertices.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the chosen vertices as defining a sub-polygon, and then triangulating that.

But the chosen vertices might not form a convex subset, since the polygon is convex, but selecting arbitrary vertices might not preserve convexity.

Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, any subset of vertices will also form a convex polygon, because all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Wait, no. Actually, in a convex polygon, any three vertices form a convex triangle, but selecting four or more vertices might not form a convex polygon if they are not consecutive.

Wait, no, in a convex polygon, any subset of vertices forms a convex polygon because all points are on the boundary or inside the convex hull.

Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, any subset of vertices forms a convex polygon, yes.

So, if I select a set of vertices, they will form a convex polygon, and I can triangulate that polygon.

Given that, the number of triangles in a triangulation of a convex polygon with k vertices is k - 2.

So, if I have k chosen vertices, forming a convex k-gon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2.

So, to maximize the number of triangles, I need to maximize k, which is the number of chosen vertices.

Wait, but the problem allows me to choose up to y additional vertices, so I should choose as many as possible, up to y, to maximize k.

But, there might be some constraints based on the positions of the vertices.

Wait, no, in a convex polygon, choosing more vertices allows for more triangles.

Wait, but perhaps there are limitations due to the non-intersecting diagonals.

Wait, the problem specifies that the diagonals must be non-intersecting, not only in the polygon but also in the way they are drawn using the chosen vertices.

So, perhaps it's about how the chosen vertices are distributed around the polygon.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the n vertices of the polygon, and Bessie has chosen x of them.

I can choose up to y more vertices.

I need to select a subset of vertices, of size up to x + y, such that the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is maximized.

Given that, and considering that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in any triangulation is k - 2, where k is the number of vertices in the triangulation.

So, to maximize the number of triangles, I should maximize k, which is the number of chosen vertices.

Therefore, I should choose as many vertices as possible, up to x + y, but subject to some constraints.

Wait, but the constraint is that y is the maximum number of additional vertices I can choose, so k = x + y.

But in the problem statement, it says y <= n - x, so I can choose up to y additional vertices, but I might choose fewer.

But to maximize the number of triangles, I should choose as many as possible, up to y.

Wait, but maybe there are cases where choosing fewer vertices leads to more triangles.

Wait, no, since k - 2 increases with k, choosing more vertices always increases the number of triangles, given that the subset is convex, which it is in this case.

So, I should choose as many vertices as possible, up to x + y, but y is up to n - x, so effectively, k = x + y.

But in the problem, y can be up to n - x, but in the hard version, y can be up to n - x, which is up to n - x.

But n can be up to 10^9, which is a large number, and x can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, but the sum of x over all test cases is up to 2*10^5.

So, I need an efficient algorithm.

But, wait, in the problem, y is up to n - x, but in the hard version, y is up to n - x, which could be up to 10^9, but in the easy version, y is up to min(n - x, some value).

But in the hard version, y can be up to n - x, which is up to 10^9, but x is up to 2*10^5 per test case.

But, in the problem, y is up to n - x, but in the hard version, it's specified as y <= n - x, with n up to 10^9.

But in the constraints, it says y <= n - x, and n can be up to 10^9.

So, I need an efficient way to compute the maximum number of triangles, which is k - 2, where k is the number of chosen vertices, up to x + y.

But, perhaps it's not that straightforward.

Looking back at the example, in the first test case, n=8, x=4, y=2, and the chosen vertices are 1,6,2,5.

The output is 6.

If I choose 2 more vertices, making k=6, then k-2=4, but the output is 6, which is more than 4.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is not simply k - 2.

Wait, in a convex polygon with k vertices, any triangulation has exactly k - 2 triangles.

But in this problem, it seems that the number of triangles can be higher.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me look at the note in the example.

In test case 1, you can get 6 non-intersecting triangular pieces.

But according to k - 2, with k=6, it should be 4 triangles.

So perhaps there's something else going on.

Wait, maybe the entire polygon is being divided into triangles and other shapes, but only the triangular pieces are counted.

So, perhaps it's about the total number of triangular faces in a planar graph formed by the diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's not just a single triangulation, but multiple triangles formed by the diagonals.

Wait, but the problem says to draw non-intersecting diagonals, which implies a triangulation.

But in a triangulation of a convex polygon with k vertices, there are exactly k - 2 triangles.

But in the first test case, k=6, so k-2=4, but the output is 6.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, maybe the triangles can overlap or something.

Wait, no, non-intersecting diagonals mean that the triangles are disjoint except possibly at boundaries.

Wait, perhaps in this problem, the triangles can share sides, but the diagonals don't intersect inside the polygon.

Wait, but in a triangulation, the number of triangles is always k - 2 for a convex polygon with k vertices.

But in the first test case, it's giving 6 triangles, which is more than k - 2=4.

So, perhaps the problem is different from a standard triangulation.

Wait, maybe the triangles are formed by the chosen vertices and the polygon's edges, not necessarily by drawing diagonals between chosen vertices only.

Wait, the problem says: "the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices."

So, the diagonals are drawn between chosen vertices, and the triangles are formed by these diagonals and the polygon's edges.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of triangular faces in the planar graph formed by the chosen vertices and the polygon's edges.

Wait, maybe it's Euler's formula or something similar.

But that seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the polygon, and some vertices are chosen.

I need to draw non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces.

In the first test case, with n=8, x=4, y=2, chosen vertices are 1,6,2,5.

If I choose 2 more vertices, say 3 and 4, then I have vertices 1,2,3,4,5,6.

If I triangulate this, it should give me k - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 triangles, but the output is 6.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the triangles can be formed by choosing diagonals in a way that subdivides the polygon into more than k - 2 triangles.

But in a convex polygon, any triangulation gives exactly k - 2 triangles.

Wait, maybe in this problem, it's about the number of triangles that include the center of the polygon, or something like that.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of triangles formed by any three chosen vertices, but that doesn't make sense because some sets of three points might not form a triangle without drawing diagonals.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of triangles that are formed by the diagonals drawn.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of minimal cycles in the planar graph formed by the chosen diagonals and the polygon's edges.

But that seems too complicated.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the dual graph or something.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

3

8 4 2

1 6 2 5

7 3 1

6 4 3

4 2 2

1 3

Sample Output:

6

5

2

Wait, in the first test case, n=8, x=4, y=2, output=6

In the third test case, n=4, x=2, y=2, output=2

Wait, for n=4, x=2, y=2, so I can choose up to 2 additional vertices, making k=4.

So, k - 2 = 2, which matches the output.

In the second test case, n=7, x=3, y=1, output=5

If k=4, then k - 2=2, but output is 5.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe it's the number of triangles in a triangulation of the chosen vertices.

Wait, but in the first test case, k=6, k - 2=4, but output is 6.

So, perhaps it's not just k - 2.

Wait, maybe it's the number of triangles that include the center of the polygon.

But that seems arbitrary.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of triangles formed by choosing three chosen vertices such that no two are connected by a polygon edge.

Wait, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of triangles formed by the chosen diagonals.

Wait, maybe it's the number of triangular faces in the planar graph defined by the chosen diagonals and the polygon's edges.

But I need a way to compute that efficiently.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the set of chosen vertices.

Then, the number of triangles is determined by how these vertices are connected by diagonals.

To maximize the number of triangles, I need to maximize the number of triangular faces in the planar graph formed by the chosen diagonals and the polygon's edges.

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a formula based on the number of vertices and edges.

I recall that in planar graphs, Euler's formula relates the number of vertices, edges, and faces.

Euler's formula: v - e + f = 2, where v is the number of vertices, e is the number of edges, and f is the number of faces (including the outer face).

In this problem, the faces are triangular except possibly the outer face.

Wait, but the outer face might not be triangular.

So, if I have v chosen vertices, and e edges (which include the polygon's edges and the chosen diagonals), then the number of triangular faces f_triang can be determined from the total number of faces f.

Since all internal faces are triangles, and the outer face might not be.

Wait, perhaps I can express the number of triangular faces in terms of v and e.

Given that each triangular face has 3 edges, but each internal edge is shared by two faces, and boundary edges are shared by one face.

Wait, this is getting too involved.

Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that in a triangulation of a convex polygon with k vertices, there are exactly k - 2 triangles.

But in this problem, it seems that the number of triangles can be more than k - 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for multiple triangulations or overlapping triangles.

But the problem says "the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized."

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of triangles in a triangulation where some regions are not triangulated.

But according to the problem, only triangular pieces are counted, and other shapes are allowed but not counted.

So, perhaps it's about maximizing the number of triangles in a triangulation of the chosen vertices.

But again, in a convex polygon, any triangulation gives k - 2 triangles.

Unless the chosen vertices do not form a convex polygon.

Wait, but in a convex polygon, any subset of vertices forms a convex polygon.

Wait, but if the chosen vertices are not consecutive, the sub-polygon they form might have crossings or something.

Wait, no, in a convex polygon, any subset of vertices forms a convex polygon without crossings.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is always k - 2 for any subset of k vertices.

But in the first test case, k=6, so k - 2=4, but the output is 6.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the diagonals can be drawn in such a way that they create more triangles beyond the standard triangulation.

But in a convex polygon, any triangulation gives exactly k - 2 triangles.

Wait, maybe the problem allows for drawing diagonals that are not necessarily forming a triangulation.

Wait, the problem says: "the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices."

And "the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized."

Perhaps it's about maximizing the number of triangles formed by the chosen diagonals, even if not all regions are triangulated.

Wait, perhaps some regions are left untriangulated to maximize the number of triangular pieces.

Wait, but the problem says "the number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized."

So, perhaps it's about maximizing the number of triangles, even if not all regions are triangulated.

Wait, perhaps it's about choosing which diagonals to draw to maximize the number of triangular faces.

But in a convex polygon, choosing any subset of non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices will partition the polygon into polygons with three or more sides.

The number of triangles will be equal to the number of chosen diagonals plus the number of initial sides minus the number of chosen vertices plus 1.

Wait, that sounds familiar.

In planar graphs, the number of faces f is equal to e - v + 1, where e is the number of edges and v is the number of vertices.

In this case, the number of triangular faces can be determined based on the number of diagonals chosen.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me consider a small example.

Take n=4, x=2, y=2.

Chosen vertices are 1 and 3.

I can choose up to 2 more vertices, so I can choose vertices 2 and 4.

Then, the chosen vertices are 1,2,3,4.

Drawing non-intersecting diagonals, say diagonal between 1 and 3.

This divides the quadrilateral into two triangles: 1-2-3 and 1-3-4.

So, number of triangles is 2, which matches the sample output.

Now, if I don't choose any additional vertices, say only vertices 1 and 3.

Then, I can't draw any diagonals, so there are no triangular pieces.

But according to the problem, I can choose up to y=2 additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Hence, choosing 2 more vertices gives me 2 triangles, which is the maximum possible.

Another test case: n=7, x=3, y=1.

Chosen vertices are 6,4,3.

I can choose up to 1 additional vertex.

Suppose I choose vertex 5.

Then, chosen vertices are 3,4,5,6.

This is a quadrilateral, so triangulating it gives 2 triangles.

But the sample output is 5, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a different vertex.

If I choose vertex 2, then chosen vertices are 2,3,4,5,6.

With k=5, k - 2=3, but the output is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the polygon is convex, and the number of triangles is k - 2, but perhaps there are multiple ways to draw diagonals to get more triangles.

But in a convex polygon, any triangulation gives exactly k - 2 triangles.

I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to think in terms of adding vertices one by one and seeing how the number of triangles increases.

Each new vertex can potentially split existing triangles into smaller ones, increasing the total count.

But I need a systematic way to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

Wait, perhaps adding a vertex inside a polygon divides one polygon into smaller polygons, each of which can be triangulated.

But in this problem, since it's a convex polygon, all vertices are on the boundary.

Wait, no, in a convex polygon, all vertices are on the boundary.

So, perhaps adding a vertex splits one polygon into two or more polygons.

Wait, but in this problem, we're only choosing vertices from the existing n vertices, not adding new ones.

Wait, no, y is the number of additional vertices I can choose from the existing n vertices.

Wait, but in a convex polygon, all vertices are on the boundary, so adding more chosen vertices won't create internal vertices.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the arrangement of chosen vertices around the polygon and see how many triangles can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into sections, and I can draw diagonals within those sections.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the circular arrangement of the chosen vertices and compute the number of triangles based on the gaps between them.

Let's consider that the vertices are on a circle, and the chosen vertices are at certain positions.

The gaps between chosen vertices are the number of vertices not chosen between them.

If I have two chosen vertices with k vertices between them, perhaps that affects the number of triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of triangles by maximizing the number of chosen vertices, but there might be a way to choose vertices such that more triangles are formed.

But I need to think about how the number of triangles relates to the number of chosen vertices and the gaps between them.

Let me consider that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices plus the number of diagonals drawn in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the number of triangles to the number of chosen vertices and the way they are connected.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of adding vertices one by one and seeing how the number of triangles increases each time.

If I start with x chosen vertices and add one more vertex, how does the number of triangles change?

It depends on where the new vertex is placed relative to the existing chosen vertices.

If I add a vertex inside a large gap, it might split that gap and create more triangles.

So, perhaps I should prioritize adding vertices in the largest gaps to maximize the increase in the number of triangles.

This sounds like a greedy approach: always choose the vertex that maximizes the increase in the number of triangles.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into x sections, where each section has a certain number of vertices between them.

Let's say the gaps between chosen vertices are c1, c2, ..., cx, where ci is the number of vertices between the i-th and (i+1)-th chosen vertices (mod x, since it's circular).

Then, the total number of vertices is n = x + c1 + c2 + ... + cx.

Now, if I choose to add y more vertices, I need to decide which gaps to place them in.

Each time I add a vertex to a gap ci, it splits ci into two new gaps, say c and ci - c - 1, and increases the number of chosen vertices by 1.

I need to decide how to distribute y vertices into these gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

But how does adding a vertex to a gap affect the number of triangles?

In a convex polygon, adding a vertex to a gap splits that gap into two smaller gaps and increases the number of chosen vertices by 1.

Given that, the number of triangles increases by (new k) - 2, where new k = old k + 1.

But that would just be increasing by 1 each time, which seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each time I add a vertex, I can form more triangles based on how that vertex connects to the existing chosen vertices.

Wait, maybe each time I add a vertex to a gap, I can draw diagonals from that vertex to the chosen vertices on either side of the gap, thereby forming triangles.

Specifically, if I add a vertex to a gap of size ci, I can draw diagonals to the two chosen vertices at the ends of the gap, forming ci triangles.

Wait, no, in a convex polygon, adding a vertex to a gap of size ci (i.e., with ci vertices between the two chosen vertices), and choosing that new vertex, allows me to draw diagonals from that new vertex to the two chosen vertices at the ends of the gap, forming ci triangles.

Wait, actually, in a convex polygon, adding one vertex to a gap of size ci splits the gap into two smaller gaps, say c and ci - c - 1, and forms two new triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of ear clipping.

In computational geometry, ear clipping is a method for triangulating a polygon by iteratively removing "ears," which are triangular parts of the polygon.

In this context, perhaps I can think of adding vertices to maximize the number of ears that can be clipped.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First test case:

n=8, x=4, y=2, chosen vertices:1,6,2,5

Output:6

If I have k=6 chosen vertices, and k - 2=4, but output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that some triangles are formed by the arrangement of chosen vertices.

Wait, maybe it's not just k - 2.

Second test case:

n=7, x=3, y=1, chosen vertices:6,4,3

Output:5

If k=4, then k - 2=2, but output is 5.

Third test case:

n=4, x=2, y=2, chosen vertices:1,3

Output:2

Here, k=4, k - 2=2, matches the output.

So, in the first two test cases, output is higher than k - 2, but in the third, it matches.

So, perhaps there's something else going on.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the sum of (ci // 2) over all gaps ci, plus k - 2.

Wait, let's try that.

In the first test case, n=8, x=4, y=2, chosen vertices:1,6,2,5

Let's sort the chosen vertices:1,2,5,6

The gaps are:

Between 1 and 2: 0 vertices

Between 2 and 5: 2 vertices (3 and 4)

Between 5 and 6: 0 vertices

Between 6 and 1: 1 vertex (7 and 8, but 8 is wrapped around)

Wait, in a circular arrangement, between 6 and 1, there are n - (6 - 1) = 8 - 5 = 3 vertices:7,8,1, but since 1 is chosen, it's actually 2 vertices between 6 and 1:7 and 8.

Wait, no.

In a circular arrangement, the gap between 6 and 1 is n - (6 - 1) = 8 - 5 = 3, but since vertex 1 is chosen, it's actually 2 vertices in between:7 and 8.

Wait, to be precise, the gap between two chosen vertices is the number of vertices between them minus 1.

Wait, no.

In a circular arrangement with chosen vertices a and b, the gap between them is the number of vertices between them along the polygon, not including a and b.

So, between 1 and 2: there are no vertices in between.

Between 2 and 5: vertices 3 and 4, so ci=2

Between 5 and 6: no vertices in between.

Between 6 and 1: vertices 7 and 8, so ci=2

So, gaps are:0,2,0,2

Now, if I add y=2 vertices, I can choose to place them in the gaps.

I can choose to place one in the gap between 2 and 5, and one in the gap between 6 and 1.

Each gap of size ci can have up to ci vertices added.

So, for ci=2, I can add up to 2 vertices.

If I add one vertex to each of the gaps with ci=2, then for each such gap, adding one vertex increases the number of triangles by ci // 2 * 2 + ci % 2.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps for each gap, the number of triangles that can be formed is ci, and by adding vertices, I can increase it.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles per gap is ci, and by adding vertices, I can split ci into smaller gaps and get more triangles.

Wait, perhaps the number of triangles is the sum of ci for all gaps.

But in the first test case, sum of ci is 0+2+0+2=4, which plus k - 2=6 - 2=4, totals 8, but the output is 6.

Hmm.

Maybe it's the sum of floor(ci / 2) over all gaps, plus k - 2.

In the first test case, floor(0/2)+floor(2/2)+floor(0/2)+floor(2/2)=0+1+0+1=2, plus k - 2=4, totals 6, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, n=7, x=3, y=1, chosen vertices:6,4,3

Sorted:3,4,6

Gaps: between 3 and 4:0, between 4 and 6:1 (vertex 5), between 6 and 3:2 (vertices 7 and 1)

So, ci:0,1,2

Sum of floor(ci / 2):0+0+1=1, plus k - 2=3 - 2=1, totals 2, but sample output is 5.

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor((ci + 1)/2) over all gaps, plus k - 2.

In the first test case: floor((0+1)/2)+floor((2+1)/2)+floor((0+1)/2)+floor((2+1)/2)=0+1+0+1=2, plus k - 2=4, totals 6.

In the second test case: floor((0+1)/2)+floor((1+1)/2)+floor((2+1)/2)=0+1+1=2, plus k - 2=3 - 2=1, totals 3, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of ci, plus k - 2.

In the first test case: 0+2+0+2=4, plus 4=8, but sample output is 6.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor(ci / 2) * 2 + ci % 2, which is essentially ci, but that's the same as sum of ci.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor(ci / 2), plus k - 2.

In the first test case: floor(0/2)+floor(2/2)+floor(0/2)+floor(2/2)=0+1+0+1=2, plus k - 2=4, totals 6.

In the second test case: floor(0/2)+floor(1/2)+floor(2/2)=0+0+1=1, plus k - 2=3 - 2=1, totals 2, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor((ci + 1)/2), plus k - 2.

In the second test case: floor((0+1)/2)+floor((1+1)/2)+floor((2+1)/2)=0+1+1=2, plus k - 2=1, totals 3, still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's sum of ci, plus k - 2.

In the first test case: 0+2+0+2=4, plus 4=8, but sample output is 6.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor(ci / 2), multiplied by 2, plus k - 2.

In the first test case: (0+1+0+1)*2 + 4=4 + 4=8, not matching.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor(ci / 2), plus floor((k - 2)/2).

Wait, in the first test case: sum of floor(ci / 2)=2, plus floor((4)/2)=2, totals 4, not matching.

No.

This isn't working.

I need another approach.

Let me consider that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles that can be formed by choosing a subset of vertices is related to the number of chosen vertices and the way they are connected.

But perhaps I can look at it in terms of the number of triangles per gap.

Each gap of size ci can contribute a certain number of triangles based on how many vertices are added to it.

If I have a gap of size ci, and I add m vertices to it, then I can form m + 1 triangles in that gap.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, if I have a gap of size ci, and I add m vertices to it, then I split the gap into m + 1 smaller gaps, each of size floor(ci / (m + 1)) or ceil(ci / (m + 1)).

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a graph where the chosen vertices are nodes, and the gaps between them determine the number of triangles that can be formed.

Wait, perhaps I can think of each gap as a chain of vertices, and adding vertices to the gap allows me to triangulate that chain.

In other words, for each gap of size ci, if I add m vertices to it, I can form m + floor((ci + 1)/2) triangles or something like that.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I fix the set of chosen vertices, including the ones chosen by Bessie and the ones I choose.

Then, the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices plus the number of added vertices minus the number of gaps minus something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of triangles is equal to the sum over all gaps of floor((ci + 1)/2).

Wait, in the first test case, sum of floor((0+1)/2) + floor((2+1)/2) + floor((0+1)/2) + floor((2+1)/2)=0+1+0+1=2, plus k - 2=4, totals 6, which matches.

In the second test case, sum is 0+1+1=2, plus k - 2=1, totals 3, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor((ci + 1)/2) plus k - 2, multiplied by something.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor(ci / 2), plus k - 2.

In the first test case: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1=2 + 4=6.

In the second test case: 0 + 0 + 1=1 + 1=2, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when ci is odd, I can get an extra triangle.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of floor((ci + 1)/2), plus k - 2.

In the first test case: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1=2 + 4=6.

In the second test case: 0 + 1 + 1=2 + 1=3, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of ci, plus k - 2.

In the first test case: 0 + 2 + 0 + 2=4 + 4=8, not matching.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of ci // 2 * 2 + ci % 2, plus k - 2.

In the first test case: (0//2)*2 + 0%2 + (2//2)*2 + 2%2 + (0//2)*2 + 0%2 + (2//2)*2 + 2%2=0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0=2, plus 4=6.

In the second test case: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0=2, plus 1=3, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each gap, the number of triangles is ci + 1.

In the first test case: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1=2, plus k - 2=4, totals 6.

In the second test case: 0 + 1 + 0 + 1=2, plus k - 2=1, totals 3, but sample is 5.

No.

This isn't working.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the polygon with chosen vertices, and I can add up to y more vertices.

I need to maximize the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals between chosen vertices.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where the chosen vertices are nodes, and the gaps between them determine the number of triangles I can get by adding vertices in those gaps.

Wait, perhaps I can treat each gap as a separate problem, where for a gap of size ci, adding m vertices to it allows me to form a certain number of triangles.

If I can compute, for each gap, the maximum number of triangles I can get by adding vertices to it, then sum them up along with the base k - 2, I might get the total number of triangles.

So, for each gap, if I have ci vertices in the gap and I add m vertices to it, how many triangles do I get?

Well, adding m vertices to a gap of ci vertices divides the gap into m + 1 smaller gaps.

Each of these smaller gaps can form a certain number of triangles.

Wait, perhaps for each gap, the number of triangles is equal to the number of added vertices plus the floor of (ci + 1)/2).

Wait, in the first test case, for ci=2, adding one vertex to each gap of 2 would give me m=1 per gap, so for each gap: m + floor((ci - m)/2).

Wait, this seems too convoluted.

Let me consider that for each gap, the maximum number of triangles I can get is ci + m, where m is the number of added vertices in that gap.

But I'm not sure.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem is equivalent to maximizing the number of triangles in a triangulation of the polygon where the only vertices used are the chosen ones.

In that case, the number of triangles would be equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

But in the first test case, that would be k - 2=6 - 2=4, but the sample output is 6.

So, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that some triangles might be formed outside the main polygon.

But in a convex polygon, all triangles are inside.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that adding a vertex to a gap splits that gap and allows for more triangles.

Wait, perhaps for each added vertex, I can get an additional triangle.

So, if I have k chosen vertices, and I add y vertices, perhaps the number of triangles is k - 2 + y.

But in the first test case, k=6, y=2, k - 2 + y=6, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, k=4, y=1, k - 2 + y=3, but the sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's k - 2 + sum of floor(ci / 2).

In the first test case: k - 2=4, sum of floor(ci / 2)=2, totals 6.

Second test case: k - 2=1, sum of floor(ci / 2)=1, totals 2, but sample output is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's k - 2 + sum of ci.

First test case:4 + 4=8, not matching.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's k - 2 + sum of floor((ci + 1)/2).

First test case:4 + 2=6.

Second test case:1 + 2=3, but sample is 5.

No.

This isn't working.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each gap, I can add up to ci vertices, and each added vertex increases the number of triangles by a certain amount.

Perhaps I can model this as each gap contributing a certain number of triangles based on how many vertices I add to it.

Let me consider that for a gap of size ci, adding m vertices to it allows me to form m + floor((ci + 1)/2) triangles.

In the first test case, for ci=2, adding m=1 vertex:1 + floor(3/2)=1 + 1=2 triangles per gap.

With two such gaps, total from gaps:4, plus k - 2=4, totals 8, but sample output is 6.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's the sum over all gaps of floor((ci + 2*m + 1)/2).

This seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the total number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices plus the number of added vertices minus 2.

In the first test case, k=6, y=2, total chosen vertices=8, triangles=8 - 2=6, matches the sample.

In the second test case, k=4, y=1, total chosen vertices=5, triangles=5 - 2=3, but sample output is 5.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of chosen vertices plus the sum of floor(ci / 2) minus 2.

First test case: k=6, sum floor(ci / 2)=2, total=6 + 2 - 2=6.

Second test case: k=4, sum floor(ci / 2)=1, total=4 + 1 - 2=3, but sample is 5.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of chosen vertices plus the sum of floor((ci + 1)/2) minus 2.

First test case:6 + 2 - 2=6.

Second test case:4 + 2 - 2=4, but sample is 5.

No.

This isn't working.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for each added vertex in a gap, I can get a certain number of triangles.

Perhaps for each gap, the number of triangles is equal to the number of added vertices in that gap plus floor((ci + 1)/2).

Then, the total number of triangles would be sum over all gaps of (m_i + floor((ci + 1)/2)), where m_i is the number of added vertices in gap i.

Plus, there might be some base number like k - 2.

Wait, in the first test case, with m1=1, m2=1, sum(m_i)=2, sum floor((ci + 1)/2)=2, total=4, plus k - 2=4, totals 8, but sample is 6.

No.

Wait, perhaps it's sum of m_i + floor((ci +
