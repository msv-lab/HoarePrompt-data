Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, I need to buy k tickets for my employees over n days, where each day the price per ticket is given by a_i. There are some constraints:

1. I can't buy more than m tickets per day.

2. If I buy x tickets on day i, then from day i+1 onwards, the price per ticket increases by x.

My goal is to minimize the total cost of buying exactly k tickets.

First, I need to understand the problem fully. Let's consider an example to grasp what's happening.

Take the first example from the input:

4 2 3

8 6 4 2

So, n=4 days, m=2 tickets per day, k=3 tickets to buy.

Prices per ticket each day: 8, 6, 4, 2.

According to the note, one optimal way is:

- Buy 0 on day 1: prices become [6,4,2]

- Buy 0 on day 2: prices become [4,2]

- Buy 1 on day 3: cost = 4, prices become [3]

- Buy 2 on day 4: cost = 6

Total cost = 4 + 6 = 10.

Another way could be:

- Buy 2 on day 1: cost = 16, prices become [10,8,6]

- Buy 1 on day 2: cost = 10

Total cost = 16 + 10 = 26, which is worse.

So, delaying purchases can be beneficial because it might lead to lower prices in the future.

Wait, but in the second test case:

4 2 8

8 6 4 2

Here, k=8, m=2, so I have to buy 2 tickets each day for 4 days.

Total cost = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64.

No other way because I have to buy 2 each day.

In the third test case:

5 100 1

10000 1 100 10 1000

Sort the list: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000

Buy 1 ticket on the day with price 1: cost = 1

Total cost = 1

In the fourth test case:

6 3 9

5 5 5 5 5 5

Sort the list: 5,5,5,5,5,5

Buy 3 on the first three days: 3*5 + 3*8 + 3*11 = 15 + 24 + 33 = 72

Wait, how did they get 72?

Wait, let's calculate:

- Day 1: buy 3 tickets, cost = 3*5 = 15, prices increase by 3 for next days: [8,8,8,8,8]

- Day 2: buy 3 tickets, cost = 3*8 = 24, prices increase by another 3: [11,11,11,11]

- Day 3: buy 3 tickets, cost = 3*11 = 33

Total = 15 + 24 + 33 = 72

Okay, that makes sense.

So, from these examples, it seems that buying tickets on the days with the lowest original prices is beneficial, but I have to consider the constraints on the number of tickets I can buy per day and the increasing prices in future days.

Let me think about an approach.

First, I need to minimize the total cost. Since the prices increase by the number of tickets bought on previous days, I need to strategize when to buy the tickets.

If I buy more tickets earlier, the prices for future days increase more, which might not be desirable if there are cheaper days ahead.

On the other hand, if I delay buying tickets, the prices might increase due to previous purchases.

I need to find a balance.

Let me consider sorting the days by their original prices in ascending order.

Why? Because I want to buy tickets on the cheapest days first, but I have to consider the constraints.

Wait, but the prices increase over time based on previous purchases.

Wait, maybe sorting the days by their original prices makes sense because I can buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the constraints.

Let me think about that.

If I sort the days by their original prices, and then try to buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days, considering the daily limits, it might lead to a minimal total cost.

But I need to account for the price increases due to previous purchases.

Let's see.

Suppose I sort the days in ascending order of a_i.

Then, I can iterate through the sorted days and buy as many tickets as possible on each day, up to the daily limit m, and accumulate the cost, taking into account the price increases from previous purchases.

Wait, but the price increase is cumulative based on all previous purchases.

So, if I buy x tickets on day i, then for all subsequent days, the price increases by x.

So, the total cost for buying tickets on a particular day is (a_i + total_previous_tickets_bought) * number_of_tickets_bought_on_that_day.

So, if I sort the days by a_i + total_previous_tickets_bought, but total_previous_tickets_bought depends on the order in which I buy tickets.

This seems like a tricky dependency.

Maybe I need to use a priority queue or some greedy approach.

Let me consider a greedy strategy.

Suppose I always buy tickets on the day with the current lowest price, considering the accumulated price increases.

But since the price increases are cumulative based on previous purchases, the effective price for each day increases over time as I buy more tickets on previous days.

This seems complex to manage in real-time.

Alternatively, since the price for day i is a_i plus the total number of tickets bought on previous days, I can precompute the total number of tickets bought on previous days when considering day i.

Wait, but it's not that straightforward because the total number of tickets bought on previous days depends on the order in which I choose to buy tickets.

This seems like a problem that can be solved using a priority queue where I always pick the day with the current lowest price, updated for the total tickets bought so far.

But with n up to 3e5 and t up to 1e4, I need an efficient solution.

Wait, but the sum of n over all test cases is 3e5, so it should be fine.

Let me think about implementing a priority queue for each test case.

But priority queues might be too slow for 3e5 elements in total.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider sorting the days by their original a_i in ascending order.

Then, I can iterate through the sorted list and buy as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days first, up to the daily limit m, and keep track of the total number of tickets bought and the accumulated price increase.

Wait, let's see.

Initialize total_cost = 0

Initialize total_tickets_bought = 0

Sort the days by a_i in ascending order.

Then, for each day in the sorted order:

available_to_buy = min(m, k - total_tickets_bought)

cost = (a_i + total_tickets_bought) * available_to_buy

total_cost += cost

total_tickets_bought += available_to_buy

if total_tickets_bought == k:

break

Return total_cost

Let's test this approach with the first example:

n=4, m=2, k=3

a = [8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

total_cost = 0

total_tickets_bought = 0

Day with a_i=2:

available_to_buy = min(2,3-0)=2

cost = (2 + 0)*2 = 4

total_cost += 4 => total_cost=4

total_tickets_bought +=2 => total_tickets_bought=2

Day with a_i=4:

available_to_buy = min(2,3-2)=1

cost = (4 + 2)*1 = 6

total_cost += 6 => total_cost=10

total_tickets_bought +=1 => total_tickets_bought=3

Stop since total_tickets_bought == k

Total cost = 10, which matches the first example.

Good.

Let's check the second example:

n=4, m=2, k=8

a=[8,6,4,2]

Sort a: [2,4,6,8]

total_cost = 0

total_tickets_bought = 0

Day with a_i=2:

available_to_buy = min(2,8-0)=2

cost = (2 + 0)*2 = 4

total_cost +=4 => total_cost=4

total_tickets_bought +=2 => total_tickets_bought=2

Day with a_i=4:

available_to_buy = min(2,8-2)=2

cost = (4 + 2)*2 = 12

total_cost +=12 => total_cost=16

total_tickets_bought +=2 => total_tickets_bought=4

Day with a_i=6:

available_to_buy = min(2,8-4)=2

cost = (6 + 4)*2 = 20

total_cost +=20 => total_cost=36

total_tickets_bought +=2 => total_tickets_bought=6

Day with a_i=8:

available_to_buy = min(2,8-6)=2

cost = (8 + 6)*2 = 28

total_cost +=28 => total_cost=64

total_tickets_bought +=2 => total_tickets_bought=8

Stop.

Total cost = 64, which matches the second example.

Good.

Third example:

n=5, m=100, k=1

a=[10000,1,100,10,1000]

Sort a: [1,10,100,1000,10000]

total_cost = 0

total_tickets_bought = 0

Day with a_i=1:

available_to_buy = min(100,1-0)=1

cost = (1 + 0)*1 = 1

total_cost +=1 => total_cost=1

total_tickets_bought +=1 => total_tickets_bought=1

Stop.

Total cost =1, which matches the third example.

Good.

Fourth example:

n=6, m=3, k=9

a=[5,5,5,5,5,5]

Sort a: [5,5,5,5,5,5]

total_cost = 0

total_tickets_bought = 0

Day with a_i=5:

available_to_buy = min(3,9-0)=3

cost = (5 + 0)*3 = 15

total_cost +=15 => total_cost=15

total_tickets_bought +=3 => total_tickets_bought=3

Day with a_i=5:

available_to_buy = min(3,9-3)=3

cost = (5 + 3)*3 = 24

total_cost +=24 => total_cost=39

total_tickets_bought +=3 => total_tickets_bought=6

Day with a_i=5:

available_to_buy = min(3,9-6)=3

cost = (5 + 6)*3 = 33

total_cost +=33 => total_cost=72

total_tickets_bought +=3 => total_tickets_bought=9

Stop.

Total cost =72, which matches the fourth example.

Great, so this approach seems to work.

Let me see if there are any edge cases where this might fail.

Consider n=1, m=1, k=1

a=[1000]

Sort a:[1000]

Buy 1 ticket on day 1: cost = (1000 + 0)*1 = 1000

Total cost =1000

Seems correct.

Another case: n=3, m=1, k=3

a=[1,2,3]

Sort a:[1,2,3]

Day 1: buy 1 ticket, cost=(1+0)*1=1, total_tickets=1

Day 2: buy 1 ticket, cost=(2+1)*1=3, total_tickets=2

Day 3: buy 1 ticket, cost=(3+2)*1=5, total_cost=1+3+5=9

Is this the minimal cost?

Alternative approach: buy all 3 on day 1: cost=(1+0)*3=3

But then day 2 prices increase by 3: a2=2+3=5

Day 3 prices: a3=3+3=6

But I already bought all tickets on day 1, so total cost=3

This is better than the previous approach's total cost of 9.

Wait, but according to my earlier strategy, I would have done:

Sort a:[1,2,3]

Buy 1 on day 1: cost=1, total_tickets=1

Buy 1 on day 2: cost=(2+1)*1=3, total_tickets=2

Buy 1 on day 3: cost=(3+2)*1=5, total_cost=1+3+5=9

But buying all on day 1: cost=3, which is better.

So, my earlier approach doesn't work here.

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, I can buy up to m=1 per day, so buying all 3 on day 1 is not possible because m=1.

Wait, m=1, k=3, n=3.

So, I have to buy one ticket each day.

In this case, my earlier approach is correct: total_cost=1 + 3 + 5=9

There is no way to buy more than one ticket per day because m=1.

So, in this case, my approach is correct.

Earlier, I mistakenly considered buying all on day 1, but m=1 prevents that.

Hence, my approach still holds.

Another edge case: n=2, m=2, k=3

a=[1,2]

Sort a:[1,2]

But k=3 and m=2, so:

Day 1: buy 2 tickets, cost=(1+0)*2=2, total_tickets=2

Day 2: buy 1 ticket, cost=(2+2)*1=4, total_cost=2+4=6

Is there a better way?

Alternative:

Buy 1 on day 1: cost=(1+0)*1=1, total_tickets=1

Buy 2 on day 2: cost=(2+1)*2=6, total_cost=1+6=7

Or buy 2 on day 1: cost=2, and 1 on day 2: cost=4, total_cost=6

So, still 6 is the minimal.

Another way:

Buy 1 on day 1: cost=1

Buy 1 on day 2: cost=(2+1)*1=3

Buy 1 on day 2: cost=(2+1+1)*1=4

Total_cost=1+3+4=8, which is worse.

So, minimal is 6.

Hence, my approach seems correct.

Let me consider another edge case: n=1, m=100, k=100

a=[1]

Sort a:[1]

Buy 100 tickets on day 1: cost=(1+0)*100=100

Total cost=100

Seems correct.

Another case: n=5, m=100, k=1

a=[100,200,300,400,500]

Sort a:[100,200,300,400,500]

Buy 1 ticket on day with a_i=100: cost=(100+0)*1=100

Total cost=100

Which is obviously minimal.

Seems correct.

Hence, I conclude that sorting the days by their original prices in ascending order and then buying as many tickets as possible on the cheapest days first, up to the daily limit m, while accounting for the price increases due to previous purchases, leads to the minimal total cost.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

The program is:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

l.sort()

t = 0

s = 0

c = 0

for i in range(n):

s = min(m, k)

c += s * (l[i] + t)

t += s

k -= s

print(int(c))



Let's analyze this step by step.

- It reads the number of test cases t.

- For each test case, it reads n, m, k.

- Reads the list l of n integers.

- Sorts the list l in ascending order.

- Initializes t=0, s=0, c=0.

- Iterates through each day in the sorted list:

s = min(m, k)

c += s * (l[i] + t)

t += s

k -= s

- Finally, prints the total cost c.

This seems to match the approach I thought of.

- Sorting the days by a_i in ascending order.

- For each day, buy as many tickets as possible, up to m or the remaining k.

- Update the total cost by adding s * (a_i + t), where t is the total tickets bought so far.

- Update t by adding s.

- Decrease k by s.

- Stop when k becomes zero.

This seems correct.

Hence, I conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The program is correct.}}
