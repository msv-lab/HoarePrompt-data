Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they're considered the same. I need to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle that's different from the original one.

First, I need to understand what it means to cut the rectangle. He can either cut parallel to the length or parallel to the width. So, if he cuts parallel to the length, he's dividing the width, and vice versa.

Let's consider an example. Take a 2x6 rectangle. If he cuts parallel to the length (let's say cutting the width), he can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles. Then, he can arrange these two 2x3 rectangles to form a new rectangle. He can place them side by side to make a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6. So, in this case, he can form a new rectangle.

Another example is a 2x1 rectangle. If he cuts it parallel to the length, he gets two 1x1 squares. From two 1x1 squares, the only way to arrange them is to make a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1 rectangle. So, no new rectangle can be formed here.

From these examples, it seems that if he can cut the rectangle in such a way that the two pieces can be rearranged into a different rectangle, then the answer is "Yes". Otherwise, "No".

Now, I need to generalize this. Let's think about the conditions under which a new rectangle can be formed.

First, for a rectangle of size a x b, if either a or b is even, then it can be cut into two equal parts. If a is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of (a/2) x b. Similarly, if b is even, he can cut it into two rectangles of a x (b/2).

Then, he tries to arrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle can be formed by placing the two pieces side by side or one on top of the other.

Let's consider the case when a is even. He cuts it into two (a/2) x b rectangles. Now, he can place them side by side to get a rectangle of (a/2 + a/2) x b, which is a x b, the same as the original. Or, he can place them one on top of the other to get a rectangle of a/2 x 2b. If 2b is different from a, then this is a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the first arrangement, he gets the original rectangle back. So, the second arrangement gives him a rectangle of a/2 x 2b. Is this different from the original a x b?

Let's see: a/2 x 2b compared to a x b. Simplifying a/2 x 2b gives a x b, which is the same as the original. So, no difference.

Wait, that can't be right. If a=2 and b=6, then a/2=1 and 2b=12, so 1x12 is different from 2x6. But earlier, I thought about cutting 2x6 into two 1x6 pieces and placing them to get 2x6 back or 1x12, which is different.

So, in that case, it's possible to get a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the example with 2x1, cutting into two 1x1 and arranging them gives 1x2 or 2x1, which is the same as the original 2x1. So, no new rectangle.

So, perhaps the condition is that after cutting, the two pieces can be arranged into a rectangle that is not congruent to the original rectangle.

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose a is even. Then, cutting into two (a/2) x b rectangles. Arranging them side by side gives (a/2 + a/2) x b = a x b, which is the original. Arranging them one on top of the other gives a/2 x 2b. For this to be different from the original, a/2 x 2b should not be congruent to a x b.

Two rectangles are congruent if their dimensions are the same or if one is a 90-degree rotation of the other. So, a/2 x 2b is congruent to a x b if a/2 = b and 2b = a, or if a/2 = a and 2b = b, but the latter is impossible unless a=b=0, which is not the case.

So, a/2 x 2b is congruent to a x b if a/2 = b and 2b = a. From a/2 = b and 2b = a, we have a = 2b and 2b = a, which is consistent. So, if a = 2b, then a/2 x 2b = b x a, which is the same as the original a x b rectangle.

Therefore, in this specific case where a = 2b, arranging the two (a/2) x b pieces into a a/2 x 2b rectangle gives the same as the original.

Similarly, if b is even, cutting into two a x (b/2) rectangles, arranging them side by side gives a x b, the original, and arranging them one on top of the other gives 2a x (b/2). Again, for this to be different from the original, 2a x (b/2) should not be congruent to a x b.

Similarly, 2a x (b/2) is congruent to a x b if 2a = b and b/2 = a, which again gives b = 2a and b/2 = a, which is consistent.

So, if b = 2a, then 2a x (b/2) = 2a x a, which is the same as the original a x b rectangle.

Therefore, in general, if a is even and a ≠ 2b, then arranging the two (a/2) x b pieces into a a/2 x 2b rectangle gives a new rectangle different from the original.

Similarly, if b is even and b ≠ 2a, then arranging the two a x (b/2) pieces into a 2a x (b/2) rectangle gives a new rectangle different from the original.

If a is even and a = 2b, or if b is even and b = 2a, then the new arrangement gives the same rectangle as the original.

If both a and b are odd, then neither a nor b can be cut into two equal integer parts, so it's impossible to form a new rectangle.

Wait, but the problem says that he can cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides. So, if a is odd, he can still cut it into two rectangles, but their widths would be fractions, but the problem specifies integer sides, so perhaps in that case, it's not possible.

Wait, no, if a is odd, say a=3, he can't cut it into two equal integer-sided rectangles, because 3/2 is not integer. So, in that case, cutting parallel to the length would result in one piece of size floor(a/2)=1 and ceil(a/2)=2, so 1x b and 2x b, which are both integer sides.

Wait, but the problem specifies that the cut must result in two rectangles with integer sides. So, if a is odd, cutting parallel to the length would give one rectangle of floor(a/2) x b and ceil(a/2) x b, which are both integer-sided rectangles.

Similarly for b odd.

So, in the case where a is odd, say a=3, b=2, cutting parallel to the length gives two rectangles of 1x2 and 2x2.

Then, he can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle. For example, placing the 1x2 on top of the 2x2 would give a 3x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

Alternatively, placing them side by side, the 1x2 and 2x2, would give a 2x3 rectangle, which is the same as 3x2.

So, in this case, no new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, if a=3 and b=4, cutting parallel to the length gives 1x4 and 2x4. Arranging them side by side gives 3x4, the original, or one on top of the other gives 2x6, which is different from the original 3x4.

Wait, but 2x6 is different from 3x4, and they are not rotations of each other. So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but a=3, b=4, a is odd, but since b is even, cutting parallel to the width would give two 3x2 rectangles. Arranging them side by side gives 3x4, the original, or one on top of the other gives 6x2, which is different from 3x4.

So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

So, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, and that a != 2b and b != 2a.

Wait, but in the earlier example, a=2, b=6, a=2 and b=6, a=2b, which is 2=2*1, but wait, a=2, b=6, a=2*1, but a=2 and b=6, so a != 2b because 2 != 12. Wait, no, a=2, b=6, 2 != 2*6=12.

Wait, in the earlier example, a=2, b=6, cutting into two 1x6 pieces, arranging them to get 2x6 or 1x12. Since 1x12 is different from 2x6, it's a new rectangle.

Wait, but in the note, it says that 6x4 and 4x6 are considered the same because they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

So, in this case, 2x6 and 1x12 are different because neither 2=1 nor 6=12.

Similarly, 3x4 and 2x6 are different because neither 3=2 nor 4=6.

Wait, but 3x4 and 4x3 are considered the same because they are rotations of each other.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. So, 6x4 and 4x6 are considered the same.

But in the example with a=2, b=6, cutting into two 1x6 pieces and arranging them to get 1x12, which is different from 2x6, so it's a new rectangle.

Similarly, in a=3, b=4, cutting into two 3x2 pieces and arranging them to get 6x2, which is different from 3x4, so it's a new rectangle.

Wait, but in a=3, b=4, a=3 and b=4, a != 2b (3 != 8) and b != 2a (4 != 6), so it should be possible to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, in a=2, b=6, a=2 and b=6, a != 2b (2 != 12) and b != 2a (6 != 4), so it's possible to form a new rectangle.

Wait, but in a=2, b=6, b=3a, which is different from 2a.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that a != b and a != 2b and b != 2a.

Wait, but in a=2, b=4, a=2, b=4, a=2 and b=4, a=2 and b=4, a=2=2*1, b=4=2*2, so a=2 and b=4, a=2*1 and b=2*2, which is a=2 and b=4, a=2 and b=4, which is a=2 and b=4, which is a=2 and b=4.

Wait, in this case, a=2 and b=4, a=2 and b=4, a=2 and b=4, which is a=2 and b=4, which is a=2 and b=4.

Wait, in this case, a=2, b=4, cutting parallel to the length gives two 1x4 pieces. Arranging them side by side gives 2x4, the original, or one on top of the other gives 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the width gives two 2x2 pieces. Arranging them side by side gives 4x2, which is the same as 2x4, or one on top of the other gives 2x4, which is the same as the original.

So, only when cutting parallel to the length, he can get a new rectangle.

Similarly, in a=3, b=6, cutting parallel to the length gives two 1.5x6 pieces, but since sides must be integers, he can't cut into non-integer sides. Wait, but a=3 is odd, so cutting parallel to the length gives 1x6 and 2x6.

Wait, but earlier I thought that if a is odd, cutting parallel to the length gives floor(a/2)x b and ceil(a/2)x b, which are both integer-sided rectangles.

Wait, in a=3, b=6, cutting parallel to the length gives 1x6 and 2x6. Arranging these two pieces, side by side gives 3x6, the original, or one on top of the other gives 2x9, which is different from 3x6.

So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Similarly, in a=3, b=4, cutting parallel to the width gives two 3x2 pieces. Arranging them side by side gives 3x4, the original, or one on top of the other gives 6x2, which is different from 3x4.

So, again, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in a=3, b=2, cutting parallel to the width gives two 3x1 pieces. Arranging them side by side gives 3x2, the original, or one on top of the other gives 6x1, which is different from 3x2.

So, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in a=3, b=2, no new rectangle can be formed, but according to this, it seems that a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in the example with a=3, b=2, cutting into two 1x2 and 2x2 pieces, arranging them to get 3x2 or 2x3, but 2x3 is the same as 3x2, so no new rectangle.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, arranging them one on top of the other gives 2x3, which is the same as 3x2.

So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when arranging the two pieces, the only new rectangle that can be formed is by placing them in a way that their sides are combined appropriately.

Let me think carefully.

Suppose we have two rectangles of size c x d and e x f. To form a new rectangle, we can place them side by side or one on top of the other.

If we place them side by side, the new rectangle would have dimensions (c + e) x max(d, f), assuming d and f are the same, but in general, they might not be.

Wait, but in our case, the two pieces are from cutting the original rectangle, so they have one dimension the same as the original.

Wait, more carefully: if we cut the original a x b rectangle into two smaller rectangles, say c x d and e x f, with c + e = a and d = b, or c = a and d + f = b.

Then, to form a new rectangle, we can place these two pieces side by side or one on top of the other.

If we place them side by side, we can have (c + e) x d, which is a x d, but d = b, so it's a x b, the original.

Or, we can place them one on top of the other, which would be c x (d + f), but d and f are both b, so it's c x (b + f), but f is also b, so it's c x 2b.

Wait, no, if we cut parallel to the length, say cutting a into c and e, then both pieces have dimensions c x b and e x b.

Then, placing them side by side gives (c + e) x b = a x b, the original.

Placing them one on top of the other gives c x 2b.

Similarly, if we cut parallel to the width, cutting b into d and f, then both pieces have dimensions a x d and a x f.

Placing them side by side gives a x (d + f) = a x b, the original.

Placing them one on top of the other gives 2a x d.

So, the possible new rectangles are c x 2b or 2a x d.

And we need to check if these new dimensions are different from the original a x b, considering that a x b and b x a are the same.

So, for c x 2b to be different from a x b, we need c x 2b != a x b and c x 2b != b x a.

Similarly for 2a x d.

Wait, but c is a/2 if cutting parallel to the length and a is even.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the possible new rectangles based on how the pieces are arranged.

Let's consider the two possible ways to cut the rectangle:

1. Cutting parallel to the length: divide a into c and e, so pieces are c x b and e x b.

Then, arranging them side by side gives (c + e) x b = a x b, the original.

Arranging them one on top of the other gives c x 2b.

Similarly, if c = a/2, then c x 2b = (a/2) x 2b = a x b, which is the original.

But earlier, in the example with a=2, b=6, c=1, so 1 x 12, which is different from 2 x 6.

Wait, but in that case, 1 x 12 is different from 2 x 6, and they are not rotations of each other.

Similarly, in a=3, b=2, cutting parallel to the length gives c=1, e=2, so arranging them one on top of the other gives 1 x 4 and 2 x 4, which when placed one on top of the other give 2 x 4, which is the same as 4 x 2, which is different from 3 x 2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in a=3, b=2, no new rectangle can be formed, but according to this, it seems that a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that when arranging the two pieces to form a new rectangle, the new rectangle's area is the same as the original, but its dimensions are different.

So, the new rectangle must have dimensions p x q, where p * q = a * b, and p != a or p != b, considering rotations.

Wait, but p could be equal to a or b, but q would be different.

Wait, no, if p = a and q = b, it's the same as the original.

If p = b and q = a, it's the same as the original, considering rotations.

So, to have a different rectangle, p and q must be different from a and b.

So, p != a and p != b, and q != a and q != b.

Wait, but in the example with a=2, b=6, cutting into two 1x6 pieces, arranging them one on top of the other gives 1x12, which is p=1, q=12.

Here, p=1 !=2 and 1 !=6, and q=12 !=2 and 12 !=6, so it's a different rectangle.

Similarly, in a=3, b=2, cutting into two 1x2 and 2x2 pieces, arranging them one on top of the other gives 2x3, which is p=2 and q=3, which is the same as the original 3x2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 2x3 is the same as 3x2, but according to the problem, they are considered the same.

So, in this case, no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but according to the earlier reasoning, arranging the two pieces gives 2x3, which is the same as the original 3x2.

So, no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but according to the earlier thought, arranging the two pieces gives 2x3, which is the same as 3x2.

So, in this case, no new rectangle is formed.

Similarly, in a=3, b=4, cutting into two 1x4 and 2x4 pieces, arranging them one on top of the other gives 2x8, which is p=2 and q=8.

Now, compare to the original a=3 and b=4.

Here, p=2 !=3 and 2 !=4, and q=8 !=3 and 8 !=4, so it's a different rectangle.

Hence, in this case, a new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in a=3, b=2, no new rectangle can be formed, but in a=3, b=4, a new rectangle can be formed.

So, perhaps the general condition is that if at least one of a or b is even, and the resulting new dimensions are different from the original dimensions, then a new rectangle can be formed.

But, in a=3, b=2, even though a is odd, b is even, but in that case, no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, but in a=3, b=2, b is even, so cutting parallel to the width gives two 3x1 pieces.

Arranging them side by side gives 3x2, the original.

Arranging them one on top of the other gives 6x1, which is p=6 and q=1.

Compare to original a=3 and b=2: p=6 !=3 and 6 !=2, q=1 !=3 and 1 !=2, so it's a different rectangle.

But according to the earlier thought, it seems that a new rectangle can be formed.

But in the initial thought, I thought that in a=3, b=2, no new rectangle can be formed.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong.

Let me check again.

In a=3, b=2:

- Cutting parallel to the length: a is odd, so cutting into 1x2 and 2x2.

- Arranging them side by side: 3x2, original.

- Arranging them one on top of the other: 2x3, which is the same as 3x2, so no
