Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that can only jump right or down to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). For each path it takes, we can construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells along the path in order. The task is to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths and also count how many paths yield this string.

First, I need to understand what a path looks like. Since the grasshopper can only move right or down, each path from (1,1) to (2,N) will consist of exactly (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, making a total of N steps. Wait, no. Let's think carefully. Starting at (1,1), to reach (2,N), the grasshopper needs to make (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, but the down move can be at any position in the path.

For example, if N=3, possible paths are:

1. Right, Right, Down

2. Right, Down, Right

3. Down, Right, Right

Each path corresponds to a sequence of cells, and thus a binary string.

So, for N=3, if the grid is:

0 0 0

0 0 0

Then all paths would give the string "000", and there are 3 paths.

Another example from the first test case:

2

00

00

Output:

000

2

So, for N=2, there are two possible paths:

1. Right, Down: cells (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2), string "000"

2. Down, Right: cells (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2), string "000"

Both paths give the same string "000", so the lexicographically smallest is "000" and there are 2 paths that give this string.

In the second test case:

4

1101

1100

Output:

11000

1

Possible paths:

1. R, R, R, D: "11010"

2. R, R, D, R: "11000"

3. R, D, R, R: "11000"

4. D, R, R, R: "11000"

Among these, "11000" is lexicographically smaller than "11010".

So, the lexicographically smallest string is "11000", and only one path gives this string.

Wait, but according to the output, there is only one path that yields "11000", but looking at the paths above, it seems that paths 2, 3, and 4 all give "11000". Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, no. For N=4, the paths are:

1. R, R, R, D: cells (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4), string a11 a12 a13 a14 a24

But a24 is not present in the grid, wait, no, the grid is 2x4, so a24 exists.

Wait, no, in the second test case, the grid is:

1 1 0 1

1 1 0 0

So, path R, R, R, D: cells (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4), string "11010"

Path R, R, D, R: cells (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string "11000"

Path R, D, R, R: cells (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string "11000"

Path D, R, R, R: cells (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string "11000"

So, indeed, only one path gives "11000", which is path R, R, D, R. Wait, no, actually, all paths except the first one give "11000". But according to the output, there is only one path that yields "11000". Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: "the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the path without changing their order."

For N=4, the string should have length 5.

Wait, in the second test case, the output is "11000" and 1, but according to my earlier analysis, multiple paths give "11000". So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the path D, R, R, R also gives "11000", but in the example, it's said that only one path yields "11000". So maybe I need to double-check which paths actually give "11000".

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the number of paths that give "11000". Let's re-examine.

For N=4:

- Path R, R, R, D: "11010"

- Path R, R, D, R: "11000"

- Path R, D, R, R: "11000"

- Path D, R, R, R: "11000"

So, three paths give "11000". But the output says only one path yields "11000". So maybe I'm misunderstanding how the string is constructed.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the path includes the starting cell and all cells visited along the path, including the final cell.

Wait, for path R, R, D, R:

Cells: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string: a11, a12, a13, a23, a24 = 1,1,0,0,0 → "11000"

Similarly, path D, R, R, R:

Cells: (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string: a11, a21, a22, a23, a24 = 1,1,1,0,0 → "11100"

Wait, now I see, in this path, the string is "11100", which is different from "11000". So only the path R, R, D, R gives "11000". Wait, no, path R, D, R, R also gives "11000":

Cells: (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string: a11, a12, a22, a23, a24 = 1,1,1,0,0 → "11100"

Wait, that's different from "11000". So only path R, R, D, R gives "11000". The other paths give "11100", which is lexicographically larger than "11000". So indeed, only one path yields the lexicographically smallest string "11000".

Okay, now I understand. So, the lexicographically smallest string is "11000", and only one path gives this string.

Moving on to the third test case:

8

00100111

11101101

Output:

001001101

4

So, for N=8, the grid is:

0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1

1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1

The lexicographically smallest string is "001001101", and there are 4 paths that yield this string.

I need to figure out how to compute this efficiently, especially since N can be up to 2*10^5 and the total sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 2*10^5, which means I need an O(N) solution per test case.

Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by choosing any path from (1,1) to (2,N).

A path consists of a sequence of moves right (R) and down (D), and the string is constructed by concatenating the values of the cells in the order they are visited.

Since the grasshopper starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), each path will consist of (N-1) right moves and 1 down move, making a total of N steps, and the string will have length N+1 (including the starting cell and the final cell).

Wait, no. Wait, for N=2, as in the first test case, the string has length 3, which is N+1=3.

Yes, so in general, the string will have length N+1.

I need to choose a path that minimizes the string lexicographically.

To minimize the string lexicographically, I need to choose the path where the earliest elements in the string are as small as possible.

That is, I should prefer a path where the first element is as small as possible, then the second element is as small as possible, and so on.

Given that the grasshopper can only move right or down, the path can be represented by the position where the down move occurs.

Specifically, the down move can be at any step from the first to the Nth step.

Wait, more precisely, since the grasshopper starts at (1,1), each right move keeps it in the first row, and a down move moves it to the second row, after which all remaining moves must be right moves in the second row.

Therefore, the position of the down move determines the path.

So, the down move can be at any step from the first to the Nth step.

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the down move can be at any point where the grasshopper is in the first row.

So, the grasshopper starts at (1,1). It can move right to (1,2), then to (1,3), and so on, up to (1,N), and at any point, it can choose to move down to the second row and then proceed right to (2,N).

Therefore, the down move can be at any step from the first to the Nth step, but the position in the grid where the down move occurs depends on the column.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the column where the down move occurs.

That is, the grasshopper can decide to move down at column k, where 1 <= k <= N, and then proceed right to column N in the second row.

So, for each k from 1 to N, there is a path where the grasshopper moves right to column k in the first row, then moves down to row 2, column k, and then moves right to column N in the second row.

Therefore, there are N possible paths, each corresponding to a different column k where the down move occurs.

So, for N=2, there are two paths:

1. Down at column 1: path (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2), string a11 a21 a22

2. Right to column 2 in row 1, then down: path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2), string a11 a12 a22

In the first test case, both paths give "000".

In the second test case, for N=4:

- Down at column 1: path (1,1) -> (2,1) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string a11 a21 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0 → "11100"

- Down at column 2: path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (2,2) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string a11 a12 a22 a23 a24 = 1 1 1 0 0 → "11100"

- Down at column 3: path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (2,3) -> (2,4), string a11 a12 a13 a23 a24 = 1 1 0 0 0 → "11000"

- Down at column 4: path (1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,3) -> (1,4) -> (2,4), string a11 a12 a13 a14 a24 = 1 1 0 1 0 → "11010"

Among these, "11000" is the lexicographically smallest.

Now, to find the lexicographically smallest string, I need to consider all possible paths (i.e., all possible down move columns k), construct the strings, and find the smallest one.

But since N can be up to 2*10^5, and there are N possible paths, constructing each string would be too slow.

Therefore, I need a smarter way to find the minimal string without constructing all possible strings.

Let me think about how the strings are constructed.

For a down move at column k, the string is:

a11, a12, ..., a1k, a2k, a2(k+1), ..., a2N

So, it's the prefix of the first row up to column k, followed by the suffix of the second row starting from column k.

To find the lexicographically smallest such string, I need to choose k such that the resulting string is smallest.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through the columns and find the point where switching from the first row to the second row gives the smallest possible string.

One way to approach this is to precompute for each column k, the string that would be formed if we choose to down at column k, and then find the minimal one among these.

But again, this would be too slow for large N.

I need a way to find the minimal string in linear time.

Let me consider that the string for down at column k is:

a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N

I need to choose k such that this sequence is lexicographically smallest.

To find the minimal string, I can think of it as finding the point k where the sequence a11 to a1k followed by a2k to a2N is smallest.

One idea is to iterate through the columns and keep track of the point where switching to the second row gives a better (smaller) string.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with k=1, i.e., down at the first column.

- The string would be a11, a21, a22, ..., a2N.

- Now, consider k=2: a11, a12, a22, a23, ..., a2N.

- Compare this with the previous string.

- Generally, for each k, the string is a11 to a1k, then a2k to a2N.

To find the minimal string, I can find the k that minimizes this sequence.

To do this efficiently, I can find the position where the first difference between the two possible strings is minimal.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to iterate through the columns and find the first position where switching to the second row gives a smaller character, considering the rest of the string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by finding the position where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that point.

But it's not that straightforward, because even if a1k > a2k, switching at k might not give the smallest string if there are earlier positions where a1j != a2j.

I need a way to find the position where the sequences differ, and choose the path that gives the smaller character at that position.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, and find the first position where a1k != a2k, and choose to switch at that column if a2k < a1k.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just that position.

Wait, maybe I can find the position where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that k.

But I need to make sure that the prefix up to k-1 is the same for both paths.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the path where the first difference between a1 and a2 is minimized.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the string for each k is:

a11 to a1k, then a2k to a2N.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, construct the string up to a1k, then append a2k to a2N.

But constructing each string is too slow for large N.

Instead, I can precompute the suffixes of the second row, and then for each k, the string is a11 to a1k followed by a2k to a2N.

To find the minimal such string, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal sequence.

But I need to do this efficiently, without comparing full strings each time.

An optimization is to iterate through the columns and find the k where the string a11 to a1k a2k to a2N is minimal.

To do this, I can find the k where a1k < a2k, or where a1k == a2k, but switching gives a smaller rest of the string.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k where a1k != a2k, and a2k < a1k.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string, not just that position.

Maybe I can iterate through the columns, comparing a1k with a2k, and find the first position where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that k.

But I need to ensure that up to that k-1, a1j == a2j for all j < k.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the path where the sequences a1 and a2 differ the least, favoring smaller characters.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of the longest common prefix.

Let me define L as the length of the longest common prefix of a1 and a2.

That is, the largest L such that a11 a12 ... a1L == a21 a22 ... a2L.

Then, the minimal string would be a11 a12 ... a1L a2L a2(L+1) ... a2N, if a2(L+1) < a1(L+1), else a11 a12 ... a1(L+1) a2(L+1) a2(L+2) ... a2N, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal string by choosing the path where the sequences a1 and a2 differ the least, and favoring smaller characters.

Wait, maybe I can iterate through the columns and find the point where switching to the second row gives the smallest possible string.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define:

- For k from 1 to N, the string S_k = a11 a12 ... a1k a2k a2(k+1) ... a2N

I need to find the minimal S_k among all k.

To find the minimal S_k, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k.

But again, constructing S_k for each k is too slow for large N.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that S_k = prefix of a1 up to k, followed by suffix of a2 starting at k.

So, S_k = a1[1..k] + a2[k..N]

To find the minimal S_k, I can iterate through k, and for each k, compare S_k with the current minimal S.

But I need to do this efficiently, without comparing full strings each time.

An optimization could be to iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k by comparing the sequences up to the point where they differ.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where a1k < a2k, or where a1k == a2k but a2k to a2N is smaller than a1(k+1) to a1N.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is the one where the sequence a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lexicographically smallest.

To find this, I can iterate through the columns, and find the first position where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that k.

But I need to ensure that up to k-1, a1j == a2j.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal k where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that k.

Wait, no, because if a1k > a2k, but a2k to a2N is larger than a1(k+1) to a1N, it might not be the minimal choice.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is the one where the sequence a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lexicographically smallest.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compute S_k, and keep track of the minimal one.

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal S_k in O(N) time.

One idea is to iterate through the columns, and keep track of the point where switching to a2 gives a smaller sequence.

To do this, I can find the position where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is smaller than a1k to a1N.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is lexicographically smaller than a1k to a1N.

But comparing a2k to a2N with a1k to a1N for each k is still O(N^2).

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is the one where the sequence a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is smallest.

I can think of it as merging two sequences: a1 and a2, where I can switch from a1 to a2 at any point.

I need to find the switch point k that gives the smallest merged sequence.

This resembles finding the minimal suffix in a string.

Wait, perhaps I can concatenate a1 and a2 with a special separator, and find the minimal suffix.

But I need to consider that the switch point is between a1k and a2k.

Wait, maybe I can consider the string a1[1..k] concatenated with a2[k..N], and find the minimal such string among all k.

To do this efficiently, I can compute the suffix array for the string a1 + a2, with some modifications.

But suffix arrays are too slow to compute for each test case, especially since N can be up to 2*10^5 and there can be up to 10^4 test cases.

I need a simpler approach.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is achieved when a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lex smallest.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k.

But again, this is too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a1 and a2 differ, and choose to switch at that position if a2 is smaller there.

Wait, more precisely, I can iterate through the columns, and find the first position where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that k.

But I need to make sure that up to k-1, a1j == a2j.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a1 and a2 differ for the first time, and choose to switch at that position if a2k < a1k.

If a1 and a2 are equal up to some point, and then differ, I should switch at the first position where a2k < a1k.

This seems reasonable.

Let me formalize this.

Find the minimal k where a1j == a2j for all j < k, and a1k > a2k.

Then, choose to switch at that k.

If no such k exists, then the minimal string is a1[1..N] a2[N].

Wait, but a2[N] is already included in a1[1..N] a2[N], but I need to make sure that I'm choosing the correct path.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal k where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is smaller than a1k to a1N.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize k = 1.

Compare a11 and a21.

If a11 > a21, then switch at k=1.

Otherwise, if a11 < a21, don't switch until a later k where a1k > a2k.

If a11 == a21, proceed to k=2.

Continue this until I find the first k where a1k != a2k, and choose to switch if a2k < a1k.

Wait, but I need to consider the rest of the string as well.

This seems similar to finding the minimal suffix.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is minimal.

To do this, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compare a1[1..k] a2[k..N] with the current minimal.

But again, this is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is achieved when a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lex smallest.

I can iterate through k, and keep track of the minimal S_k.

But I need to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and keep track of the minimal a2k to a2N, and compare it with a1k to a1N.

But I need to do this efficiently.

Let me consider precomputing the suffix minimums for a2.

That is, for each position k, the minimal character in a2 from k to N.

Similarly for a1.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string, not just individual characters.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that for two strings S and T, S is lex smaller than T if at the first position where they differ, S has a smaller character.

So, for S_k = a1[1..k] a2[k..N], and S_m = a1[1..m] a2[m..N], to compare S_k and S_m, I need to find the first position where they differ.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k that minimizes S_k by iterating through k and keeping track of the minimal S_k.

But I need to optimize this.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is achieved when a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lex smallest.

I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k.

But again, this is too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is achieved when a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lex smallest.

To find this efficiently, I can find the position where a1 and a2 differ, and choose to switch at the position where a2k is smaller than a1k.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is smaller than a1k to a1N.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and find the first position where a1k > a2k, and choose to switch at that k.

Then, the minimal S_k would be a1[1..k] a2[k..N].

But I need to make sure that up to k-1, a1j == a2j.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and find the position where a1k != a2k, and choose to switch at the first such k where a2k < a1k.

If a1k == a2k, I can continue to the next k.

If a1k > a2k, I should switch at that k.

If a1k < a2k, I should continue, because switching would only make the string larger.

So, in other words, I should find the first k where a1k > a2k, and switch at that k.

If no such k exists, then the minimal string is a1[1..N] a2[N].

Wait, but in the second test case, a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100.

They differ at position 3, where a13=0 and a23=0, same, and at position 4, a14=1 and a24=0.

So, a14 > a24, so I should switch at k=4.

But in that case, S_4 = a1[1..4] a2[4..4] = "1101" "0" = "11010"

But in the example, the minimal string is "11000", which corresponds to S_3 = "110" "00" = "11000"

Wait, so my idea is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose to switch at the first k where a1k > a2k, but also consider that switching at an earlier k might give a smaller string.

In this case, switching at k=3 gives "11000", which is smaller than switching at k=4 giving "11010".

But according to my previous idea, I should switch at k=4, but that gives a larger string.

So, my idea is flawed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that I should choose the smallest possible a11, then a12, and so on, but as soon as a1k > a2k, I should switch to a2k.

But in the second test case, a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100.

At k=1: a11=1, a21=1 → equal

At k=2: a12=1, a22=1 → equal

At k=3: a13=0, a23=0 → equal

At k=4: a14=1, a24=0 → a14 > a24 → switch at k=4

But switching at k=4 gives "11010", which is larger than switching at k=3 giving "11000".

So, in this case, my idea fails.

Hence, I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that I should switch at the k where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is smaller than a1k to a1N.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k by comparing the sequences up to the point where they differ.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the longest common prefix between a1 and a2.

Let me define L as the longest common prefix length between a1 and a2.

That is, L is the largest integer such that a1[1..L] == a2[1..L].

Then, the minimal S_k would be a1[1..L] a2[L..N], if a2(L+1) < a1(L+1), else a1[1..L+1] a2[L+1..N], and so on.

Wait, but in the second test case, a1 = 1101, a2 = 1100, L=3, since a1[1..3]=110, a2[1..3]=110.

Then, a14=1, a24=0, so a24 < a14, so the minimal S_k is a1[1..3] a2[3..4]="11000".

This matches the example.

So, in general, I can find the longest common prefix L between a1 and a2, and then choose to switch at the first position where a2 differs and is smaller than a1.

Wait, but in this case, L=3, and a24 < a14, so switching at k=4 would give "11010", but according to the example, switching at k=3 gives "11000", which is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose to switch at k=3, even though a13 == a23.

Wait, but a13=0 and a23=0, equal, and a24=0 < a14=1, so switching at k=3 gives "11000", which is smaller than "11010".

So, perhaps I need to choose to switch at k=L if a2(L+1) < a1(L+1).

In this case, L=3, a24=0 < a14=1, so switch at k=3.

Hence, the minimal S_k is a1[1..L] a2[L..N].

Wait, but a1[1..L] a2[L..N] would be a1[1..3] a2[3..4]="110" "00"="11000".

Yes, that matches.

So, generalizing, find the longest common prefix L between a1 and a2.

If a2(L+1) < a1(L+1), then the minimal S_k is a1[1..L] a2[L..N].

Else, the minimal S_k is a1[1..L+1] a2[L+1..N].

But in the second test case, L=3, a24=0 < a14=1, so minimal S_k is a1[1..3] a2[3..4]="11000".

This seems correct.

In the first test case, a1=00, a2=00, L=2, a23=0 < a13=0 is false, so minimal S_k is a1[1..2] a2[2..2]="000".

In the third test case, a1=00100111, a2=11101101.

Let's find L.

Compare a1 and a2:

a1: 00100111

a2: 11101101

They differ at the first position, so L=0.

Since a21=1 < a11=0 is false (0 < 1 is true), wait, no, 0 < 1 is true, but in this case, a21=1 > a11=0, but according to the condition above, if a2(L+1) < a1(L+1), then switch at L.

But in this case, L=0, a21=1 > a11=0, so a21 < a11 is false, so minimal S_k is a1[1..1] a2[1..N]="0" + "11101101"="011101101", but in the example, the output is "001001101", which corresponds to switching at some other k.

Wait, perhaps my generalization is incorrect.

Let me think again.

In the third test case, a1=00100111, a2=11101101.

If I choose k=1: S1 = a11 + a21 to a2N = "0" + "11101101" = "011101101"

k=2: "00" + "101101" = "00101101"

k=3: "001" + "101101" = "001101101"

k=4: "0010" + "01101" = "001001101"

k=5: "00100" + "1101" = "001001101"

k=6: "001001" + "101" = "001001101"

k=7: "0010011" + "01" = "001001101"

k=8: "00100111" + "1" = "001001111"

Among these, "001001101" is the smallest, which corresponds to k=4, k=5, k=6, k=7.

So, the minimal S_k is "001001101".

But according to my earlier generalization, L=0, since a1 and a2 differ at the first position.

Then, since a21=1 < a11=0 is false (1 < 0 is false), so minimal S_k would be a1[1..1] a2[1..N]="011101101", which is larger than "001001101".

So, my generalization is incorrect.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is the smallest among all possible S_k.

To find this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k.

But again, this is too slow for large N.

I need a way to find the minimal S_k in linear time.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal a2k to a2N, and compare it with a1k to a1N.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just suffixes.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, find the first position where a1[1..k] a2[k..N] differs from a1[1..m] a2[m..N] for some m, and choose the one with the smallest such difference.

This seems too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is achieved when a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lex smallest.

To find this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k by comparing the sequences up to the point where they differ.

To optimize this, I can precompute for each k, the comparison between a1[1..k] a2[k..N] and a1[1..k-1] a2[k-1..N], and choose the smallest one.

But this still seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can find the position where switching from a1 to a2 gives the smallest possible string.

To do this, I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and for each k, compare a1k with a2k.

If a2k < a1k, then switching at k gives a smaller string than not switching.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire string, not just that position.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first position where a1k > a2k, and switch at that k.

But as we've seen, this doesn't always give the minimal string.

Let me consider that I should choose to switch at the k where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is smaller than a1k to a1N.

But again, this is too slow to compute for each k.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal S_k is achieved when a1[1..k] a2[k..N] is lex smallest.

To find this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through k from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal S_k by comparing the sequences up to the point where they differ.

Wait, perhaps I can find the k where a1k != a2k, and a2k < a1k, and choose to switch at that k.

But in the third test case, a1 and a2 differ at position 1, and a21=1 > a11=0, so I shouldn't switch at k=1.

Then, I need to find the next position where a1k != a2k, and a2k < a1k.

In the third test case, a1 and a2 differ at position 1, and a21 > a11, so I should not switch at k=1.

Then, continue to k=2: a12=0, a22=1, a22 > a12, so still not switch.

k=3: a13=1, a23=1, equal, continue.

k=4: a14=0, a24=0, equal, continue.

k=5: a15=0, a25=1, a25 > a15, do not switch.

k=6: a16=1, a26=1, equal, continue.

k=7: a17=1, a27=0, a27 < a17, so switch at k=7: S7 = a1[1..7] a2[7..8] = "0010011" "01" = "001001101"

Similarly, S4 = a1[1..4] a2[4..8] = "0010" "01101" = "001001101", which is the same as S7.

So, in this case, switching at k=4,5,6,7 gives the same minimal string.

Hence, perhaps I should choose to switch at the earliest possible k where a2k < a1k, considering the entire string.

Wait, but in this case, switching at k=7 gives "001001101", which is the same as switching at k=4.

So, perhaps I can choose to switch at k=4.

But how do I determine this efficiently?

Let me consider that I should find the minimal k where a1k > a2k, and a2k to a2N is smaller than a1k to a1N.

But this is still too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that
