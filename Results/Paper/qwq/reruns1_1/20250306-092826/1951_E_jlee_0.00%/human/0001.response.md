Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings where none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of substrings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], right?

My task is to find at least one such partition where none of the substrings is a palindrome. If such a partition exists, I should print "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should print "NO".

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

First test case:

Input:

sinktheyacht

Output:

YES

1

sinktheyacht

So, the entire string "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so partitioning it into a single substring satisfies the condition.

Second test case:

Input:

lllllllll

Output:

NO

Here, every possible substring of "lllllllll" is a palindrome because all characters are 'l'. So, there's no way to partition this string into substrings that are not palindromes.

Third test case:

Input:

uwuowouwu

Output:

YES

3

uw uow ouwu

In this case, the string can be partitioned into three substrings: "uw", "uow", and "ouwu", none of which are palindromes.

Alright, so I need to devise a way to determine whether such a partition exists for any given string.

Let's think about when a partition into non-palindrome substrings is possible.

First, if the entire string is not a palindrome, then partitioning it into a single substring satisfies the condition. So, in that case, the answer is "YES" with k=1.

But if the entire string is a palindrome, then I need to see if I can partition it into smaller substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

However, if every possible substring is a palindrome, then it's impossible to have such a partition. For example, in the second test case, "lllllllll", every substring is just a sequence of 'l's, which is a palindrome.

So, the key is to check if the entire string is a palindrome. If it's not, return "YES" with k=1 and the string itself.

If it is a palindrome, then I need to see if there's a way to split it into smaller substrings, none of which are palindromes.

But splitting a palindrome into smaller substrings doesn't guarantee that the substrings aren't palindromes. For example, "abba" is a palindrome, and if I split it into "a" and "bba", "a" is a palindrome, so that's not allowed. If I split it into "ab" and "ba", both are not palindromes, so that works.

Wait, but "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes, but they are mirrors of each other.

Wait, no, "ab" is not a palindrome because it doesn't read the same forwards and backwards.

Wait, actually, "ab" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is also not a palindrome. So, in this case, splitting "abba" into "ab" and "ba" is a valid partition.

So, in some cases, even if the entire string is a palindrome, I can split it into non-palindrome substrings.

But in the second test case, "lllllllll", any split would result in substrings that are all 'l's, which are palindromes. So, in that case, it's impossible.

So, I need a way to determine whether a string that is a palindrome can be split into non-palindrome substrings.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. So, for a string to be a palindrome, its first character must be equal to its last character, the second character must be equal to the second-to-last, and so on.

So, if a string is a palindrome, and I try to split it into two parts, say, s = t + u, then t and u must be such that t is not a palindrome and u is not a palindrome.

But since s is a palindrome, if t is not a palindrome, then u might still be a palindrome, or vice versa.

Wait, no, in the example "abba" split into "ab" and "ba", both are not palindromes.

Another example: "racecar".

If I split it into "rac" and "ecar", is "rac" a palindrome? "rac" is not a palindrome because "rac" backwards is "car", which is different.

Similarly, "ecar" is not a palindrome because "ecar" backwards is "race", which is different.

So, in this case, splitting "racecar" into "rac" and "ecar" gives me two non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but "racecar" is a palindrome, and I was able to split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, for any palindrome of length greater than 1, I can always split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

But wait, what about "aaa"? Let's say s = "aaa".

If I split it into "a" and "aa", "a" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aa" and "a", both are palindromes.

If I split it into "a", "a", "a", all are palindromes.

So, in this case, it's impossible to have a partition where none of the substrings is a palindrome.

Wait, but "aaa" is a palindrome, and any way I split it, I get palindromes.

So, when is it possible to split a palindrome into non-palindrome substrings?

Maybe when the palindrome is longer than a certain length.

Wait, in "abba", I could split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "racecar", I could split it into "rac" and "ecar", both not palindromes.

In "aaa", any split results in palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromes where all characters are the same, it's impossible to split into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome, and splitting it into "a" and "a", both are palindromes.

So, in general, for a palindrome consisting of repeated identical characters, any split will result in palindromes.

But for palindromes with different characters, it seems possible to split them into non-palindrome substrings.

So, perhaps, the condition is that if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, then it's impossible to have such a partition.

Otherwise, if the string is not a palindrome, or it's a palindrome with different characters, it's possible.

Wait, but in "abba", which is a palindrome with different characters, I can split it into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes.

In "racecar", which is a palindrome with different characters, I can split it into "rac" and "ecar", which are not palindromes.

In "aaa", which is a palindrome with all identical characters, any split results in palindromes.

So, perhaps, the general rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, then partitioning it into a single substring works.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, then it's impossible to have such a partition.

- Otherwise, it's possible to split it into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "abba", which is a palindrome, I can split it into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindirms.

In "aaa", which is a palindrome, any split results in palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromes where all characters are the same, it's impossible, otherwise, it's possible.

But wait, what about "abcba"? This is a palindrome with different characters.

If I split it into "abc" and "cba", "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "cba" is "abc" reversed, which is not the same as "cba" forwards.

Wait, "cba" forwards is "cba", backwards is "abc", which is different, so "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, splitting "abcba" into "abc" and "cba" works.

Another example: "abccba". This is a palindrome.

If I split it into "abc" and "cba", both are not palindromes.

So, it seems that for any palindrome that is not composed of all identical characters, I can split it into two parts that are not palindromes.

But, is there a general way to do this split?

Let me consider splitting the palindrome into two halves.

If the string is of even length, say 2k, then splitting it into the first k characters and the last k characters.

But in a palindrome, the first k characters are the reverse of the last k characters.

So, unless k=1, the two parts are not the same, but they are reverses of each other, which may or may not make them palindromes.

Wait, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba". "ab" backwards is "ba", which is different from "ab", so "ab" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "cba". "abc" backwards is "cba", which is different from "abc", so "abc" is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "abc" is not a palindrome because "abc" backwards is "cba", which is different from "abc".

Similarly, "cba" is not a palindrome because "cba" backwards is "abc", which is different from "cba".

So, in general, for any non-empty string that is not a palindrome, its reverse is different from itself.

But in our case, since the original string is a palindrome, splitting it into two parts that are reverses of each other, and neither part is a palindrome.

So, if the original string is a palindrome and not composed of all identical characters, then splitting it into two parts that are reverses of each other should give me two non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "abba", "ab" and "ba" are both not palindromes.

In "abcba", "abc" and "cba" are both not palindromes.

In "a", which is a palindrome, but it's a single character, which is a palindrome.

In "aa", which is a palindrome, splitting it into "a" and "a", both are palindromes.

In "aaa", which is a palindrome, any split results in palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromes composed of repeated identical characters, any split results in palindromes.

For palindromes with different characters, splitting them into two parts that are reverses of each other gives me two non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "abba", "ab" and "ba" are reverses of each other and both are not palindromes.

In "abcba", "abc" and "cba" are reverses of each other and both are not palindromes.

So, seems like a general approach is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, return "YES" with k=1 and the string itself.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, return "NO".

- Otherwise, split the string into two parts: the first half and the second half.

- Since the string is a palindrome, the first half is the reverse of the second half.

- Since the string is not composed of all identical characters, at least one character is different, so the first half and the second half are not palindromes.

- Therefore, return "YES" with k=2 and the two halves.

Wait, but in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "cba" works.

In "a", which is a palindrome, and all characters are the same, so "NO".

In "aa", which is a palindrome with all identical characters, splitting into "a" and "a", both are palindromes.

In "ab", which is not a palindrome, so "YES" with k=1 and "ab".

In "bbb", which is a palindrome with all identical characters, so "NO".

In "abcdedcba", which is a palindrome with different characters, splitting into "abcde" and "dcba" works, as neither is a palindrome.

Wait, but "abcde" backwards is "edcba", which is different from "abcde", so "abcde" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, "dcba" backwards is "abcd", which is different from "dcba", so "dcba" is not a palindrome.

So, this seems to work.

But wait, what about "abccba"?

Splitting into "abc" and "cba".

"abc" backwards is "cba", which is different from "abc", so "abc" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, "cba" backwards is "abc", which is different from "cba", so "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, this seems to be a general approach.

But is there any exception to this?

Let's consider "aabaa".

This is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aab" and "aba", is "aab" a palindrome? "aab" backwards is "baa", which is different from "aab", so "aab" is not a palindrome.

"aba" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting into "aab" and "aba", one of them is a palindrome.

So, this doesn't work.

Wait, but "aabaa" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "a" and "abaa", "a" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aa" and "baa", "aa" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aab" and "aa", "aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, it seems challenging to find a split where neither substring is a palindrome.

Wait, but "aabaa" is a palindrome, and it's composed of different characters ('a's and 'b's), but in this case, every possible split includes at least one palindrome.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, since "aabaa" is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, I should be able to split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But in practice, it seems tricky.

Wait, maybe my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, for a palindrome that is not composed of all identical characters, I can always split it into two non-palindrome substrings by choosing splits where the substrings are not palindromes.

But in "aabaa", no matter how I split it, it seems that at least one substring is a palindrome.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that in a palindrome, if I can find a split where neither substring is a palindrome, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

So, for "aabaa", is there any way to split it into substrings where none is a palindrome?

Wait, what if I split it into "a", "a", "b", "a", "a"? But "a" is a palindrome, "b" is a palindrome, so that doesn't work.

What if I split it into "aa", "ba", "a"? "aa" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

What if I split it into "aab", "aa"? "aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

What if I split it into "a", "aba", "a"? "a" is a palindrome, "aba" is a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to have a partition where none of the substrings is a palindrome.

But according to my earlier logic, since "aabaa" is a palindrome and not composed of all identical characters, I thought I could split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But in practice, it's not working.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Maybe there are palindromes, even with different characters, that cannot be split into non-palindrome substrings.

Alternatively, maybe I need to split it into more than two parts.

In "aabaa", if I split it into "aab", "a", "a", "a", but "a" is a palindrome.

So, still doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps some palindromes cannot be partitioned into non-palindrome substrings, even if they have different characters.

So, maybe my earlier approach is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, the key is to check if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, then "NO", otherwise "YES".

But in "aabaa", which is a palindrome with different characters, but it seems impossible to partition it into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, but in "abba", which is a palindrome with different characters, I can split it into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

So, why does it work for "abba" but not for "aabaa"?

Wait, maybe because "abba" has an even length, and "aabaa" has an odd length.

Wait, but "aabaa" has length 5, which is odd, and "abba" has length 4, which is even.

But in "abcba", which has length 5, I can split it into "abc" and "cba", both not palindromes.

Similarly, in "abcdedcba", which has length 9, I can split it into "abcde" and "dcba", both not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for palindromes with different characters, I can always split them into two non-palindrome substrings, regardless of their length.

But in "aabaa", which has different characters, I can't seem to find such a split.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me check again.

"aabaa" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aab" and "aa", "aab" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "a" and "abaa", "a" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aa" and "baa", "aa" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "aab" and "a", "aab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

If I split it into "a", "a", "b", "a", "a", all are palindromes.

Wait, but maybe I can split it into "aab" and "aa", and accept that "aa" is a palindrome, but the problem requires that none of the substrings is a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

But according to my earlier logic, since "aabaa" is a palindrome and not composed of all identical characters, I thought I could split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But in practice, it's not working.

So, perhaps my earlier approach is incorrect.

Maybe there's a different way to determine whether a partition exists.

Let me consider that for any string, if it's not a palindrome, then partitioning it into a single substring works.

If it is a palindrome, then I need to see if I can split it into smaller substrings that are not palindromes.

But in some cases, like "aabaa", it's impossible to do so.

So, perhaps I need to find a way to determine whether a palindrome can be split into non-palindrome substrings.

One approach could be to check if there exists at least one split where neither substring is a palindrome.

So, for a palindrome s of length n, I can try splitting it into substrings of lengths i and n-i, for i from 1 to n-1, and check if neither substring is a palindrome.

If I find at least one such split, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "aabaa", no such split exists.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through possible split points and check for each split if both parts are not palindromes.

But this could be time-consuming for large strings, especially since the constraints allow strings up to 10^6 characters.

So, I need a more efficient way to determine this.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome and consists of repeating a single character, like "aaa", then any split will result in substrings that are palindromes.

If a string is a palindrome and has at least two different characters, then perhaps I can always split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But in "aabaa", which has different characters, it's impossible.

So, maybe there's another condition.

Wait, perhaps if the center character is different from the others, it affects the possibility.

In "aabaa", the center character is 'b', which is different from 'a'.

But still, it's impossible to split into non-palindrome substrings.

Wait, maybe the key is whether the palindrome has a center character that's different, causing the splits to include palindromic substrings.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that for a palindrome, if there exists a split where neither substring is a palindrome, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

And to check efficiently, maybe I can check if the string has any substring that is not a palindrome.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can check if the string has at least two different characters.

If it's a palindrome and has at least two different characters, then it's possible to split it into non-palindrome substrings.

But in "aabaa", which has different characters, it's still impossible.

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, in "abba", which has different characters, it's possible.

In "aabaa", which has different characters, it's impossible.

So, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that for a palindrome, if it's possible to split it into two non-palindrome substrings, then "YES", otherwise "NO".

To check this efficiently, perhaps I can precompute the palindromic substrings or use some properties of palindromes.

But given the time constraints, I need something O(n) or O(1) per string.

Wait, perhaps I can check if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, then "NO", else "YES".

But in "aabaa", which has different characters, it's still "NO".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps if the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, and it's not composed of all identical characters, then "YES", else "NO".

But in "aabaa", which is a palindrome with different characters and length greater than 1, it's "NO".

So, that doesn't work.

Wait, maybe I need to check if there exists any substring that is not a palindrome.

If there exists at least one substring that is not a palindrome, then "YES", else "NO".

But in "aabaa", there are substrings like "aab" which are not palindromes, but when splitting, I can't avoid having palindromic substrings in any partition.

Wait, perhaps I need to check if the string can be partitioned into substrings where each substring has at least two different characters and is not a palindrome.

But that seems too restrictive.

Wait, perhaps the key is to ensure that in the partition, no substring is a palindrome.

So, for a palindrome, if I can split it into two non-palindrome substrings, then "YES", else "NO".

In "abba", I can split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

In "aabaa", I can't find such a split.

So, perhaps I need to see if the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than 1, and it's possible to split it into two non-palindrome substrings.

But how do I determine this efficiently?

Let me consider that for a palindrome s, if s is not composed of all identical characters, then I can split it into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

But in "aabaa", which is not composed of all identical characters, it's impossible.

So, perhaps I need a different condition.

Wait, maybe if the string is a palindrome and its length is greater than the number of unique characters, then "YES", else "NO".

In "aabaa", length is 5, unique characters are 'a' and 'b', so 2 unique characters.

5 > 2, but it's "NO".

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps if the string is a palindrome and has more than one unique character, and its length is greater than twice the number of unique characters, then "YES".

In "abba", length is 4, unique characters are 'a' and 'b', 4 > 2*2=4, which is not true.

Wait, 4 > 4 is false.

So, that doesn't work.

In "aabaa", length is 5, unique characters are 2, 5 > 4, which is true, but it's "NO".

So, still doesn't hold.

I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps, for a palindrome, if I can find a split where at least one of the substrings is not a palindrome, and the other is also not a palindrome, then "YES".

But in practice, for some palindromes like "aabaa", it's impossible.

So, maybe I need to accept that some palindromes, even with different characters, can't be split into non-palindrome substrings.

Therefore, my initial approach might not be sufficient.

Let me consider implementing the following logic:

- If the string is not a palindrome, return "YES" with k=1 and the string itself.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, return "NO".

- Else, try to split the string into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- To check if a split is valid, ensure that neither part is a palindrome.

- If such a split exists, return "YES" with k=2 and the two parts.

- If no such split exists, return "NO".

This seems reasonable, but I need to handle the case where even though the string is a palindrome with different characters, splitting it doesn't yield two non-palindrome substrings.

To implement this, I need a fast way to check if a substring is a palindrome.

Given the constraints (sum of |s| <= 10^6), I need an O(n) or O(1) per string solution.

Checking if a string is a palindrome can be done in O(n) time.

But for each test case, I need to do this efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute palindromic substrings using Manacher's algorithm, but that might be overkill.

Wait, but in this problem, I only need to check if the entire string is a palindrome, and then if I split it, check if the parts are palindromes.

So, for each string, I can:

- Check if it's a palindrome.

- If not, return "YES" with k=1 and the string.

- If it is a palindrome:

- Check if all characters are the same.

- If yes, return "NO".

- Else, try to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

- To do this, iterate through possible split points and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If such a split is found, return "YES" with k=2 and the two parts.

- If no such split is found, return "NO".

But in the case of "aabaa", it's a palindrome with different characters, but no split exists where both parts are not palindromes.

So, in that case, it should return "NO".

But with this approach, I might incorrectly return "YES" for "aabaa" if I don't properly check.

Wait, no. If I implement it correctly, it should return "NO" for "aabaa" because no split exists where both parts are not palindromes.

Let me simulate this for "aabaa".

- Check if "aabaa" is a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: no, 'a' and 'b'.

- Try to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

- Split at position 1: "a" and "abaa". "a" is a palindrome.

- Split at position 2: "aa" and "baa". "aa" is a palindrome.

- Split at position 3: "aab" and "aa". "aab" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome.

- Split at position 4: "aaba" and "a". "aaba" is not a palindrome, but "a" is a palindrome.

- No split exists where both parts are not palindromes.

- Therefore, return "NO".

So, this approach seems correct.

Let's test it with "abba".

- Check if "abba" is a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: no, 'a', 'b'.

- Try to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

- Split at position 1: "a" and "bba". "a" is a palindrome.

- Split at position 2: "ab" and "ba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

- This is a valid split.

- Therefore, return "YES" with k=2 and ["ab", "ba"].

Perfect.

Another test case: "aaa".

- Check if "aaa" is a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: yes.

- Therefore, return "NO".

Correct.

Another test case: "abcba".

- Check if "abcba" is a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: no.

- Try to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

- Split at position 1: "a" and "bcba". "a" is a palindrome.

- Split at position 2: "ab" and "cba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

- Valid split.

- Therefore, return "YES" with k=2 and ["ab", "cba"].

Correct.

Another test case: "a".

- Check if "a" is a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: yes.

- Therefore, return "NO".

Correct.

Another test case: "ab".

- Check if "ab" is a palindrome: no.

- Therefore, return "YES" with k=1 and "ab".

Correct.

So, this approach seems to work for the examples.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and sum of |s| <= 10^6, I need an O(n) per string solution.

First, I need a fast way to check if a string is a palindrome.

I can do this by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center.

Second, if the string is a palindrome, I need to check if all characters are the same.

I can do this by checking if the set of characters has only one unique character.

Third, if the string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, I need to find a split where neither part is a palindrome.

To do this, I can iterate through possible split points from 1 to n-1 and check if both parts are not palindromes.

To optimize, I can precompute whether prefixes and suffixes are palindromes.

Wait, but checking each possible split point would take O(n) per split, leading to O(n^2) in total, which is too slow for n=10^6.

Wait, but sum of |s| over all test cases is <=10^6, so overall time should be O(10^6).

But if for each string I iterate through all possible split points, it would be O(n^2), which is not acceptable.

So, I need a smarter way to find if there exists at least one split where neither part is a palindrome.

Wait, perhaps I can find the smallest prefix that is not a palindrome, and check if the corresponding suffix is not a palindrome.

Similarly, find the smallest suffix that is not a palindrome, and check if the corresponding prefix is not a palindrome.

This way, I can reduce the number of splits I need to check.

Let me think about this.

For a palindrome s, if I can find a prefix t that is not a palindrome, and the suffix u = s[len(t):] is not a palindrome, then splitting s into t and u is a valid partition.

Similarly, find a suffix u that is not a palindrome, and the prefix t = s[:len(u)] is not a palindrome.

This way, I only need to find one such split.

To implement this efficiently, I can:

- Find the smallest prefix t that is not a palindrome.

- Check if the corresponding suffix u is not a palindrome.

- If yes, return "YES" with k=2 and [t, u].

- If not, find the smallest suffix u that is not a palindrome.

- Check if the corresponding prefix t is not a palindrome.

- If yes, return "YES" with k=2 and [t, u].

- If neither of these splits works, return "NO".

This should be more efficient, as I only need to find the smallest non-palindrome prefix and suffix, which can be done in linear time.

Let me see.

To find the smallest non-palindrome prefix:

- Start from prefix of length 1 and increase until I find a prefix that is not a palindrome.

Similarly, for the smallest non-palindrome suffix.

Then, check if the corresponding suffix and prefix are also not palindromes.

This seems efficient.

Let's test this approach with "abba".

- Smallest non-palindrome prefix: "a" is a palindrome, "ab" is not a palindrome.

- Corresponding suffix: "ba" is not a palindrome.

- So, split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

- Return "YES" with k=2 and ["ab", "ba"].

Correct.

For "aabaa":

- Smallest non-palindrome prefix: "a" is a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome, "aab" is not a palindrome.

- Corresponding suffix: "aa" is a palindrome.

- So, this split is invalid.

- Smallest non-palindrome suffix: "a" is a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome, "baa" is not a palindrome.

- Corresponding prefix: "aab" is not a palindrome.

- But "baa" is not a palindrome, and "aab" is not a palindrome.

- Wait, but "baa" is not a palindrome? Wait, "baa" backwards is "aab", which is different from "baa", so "baa" is not a palindrome.

- Similarly, "aab" is not a palindrome.

- So, splitting into "aab" and "aa", but "aa" is a palindrome.

- Wait, no, in this case, the corresponding prefix for the smallest non-palindrome suffix is "aab", which is not a palindrome, and "baa" is not a palindrome.

- So, this should be a valid split.

- But earlier, I thought it was impossible, but according to this, it's possible.

Wait, but in "aabaa", splitting into "aab" and "aa", "aab" is not a palindrome, but "aa" is a palindrome.

So, this split is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that both the prefix and suffix are not palindromes.

So, in this case, although "aab" is not a palindrome and "baa" is not a palindrome, the corresponding split would be "aab" and "aa", where "aa" is a palindrome.

So, this split is invalid.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me clarify.

- Smallest non-palindrome prefix: "ab" (since "a" is a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome, "aab" is not a palindrome).

- Wait, "aab" is not a palindrome.

- Corresponding suffix: "aa" (which is a palindrome).

- So, this split is invalid.

- Smallest non-palindrome suffix: "baa" (since "a" is a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome, "baa" is not a palindrome).

- Corresponding prefix: "aab" (which is not a palindrome).

- So, splitting into "aab" and "aa".

- But "aa" is a palindrome, so this split is invalid.

- Therefore, no valid split exists.

- Hence, return "NO".

So, in this case, even though there exists a prefix and suffix that are not palindromes, the corresponding split includes a palindrome, so it's invalid.

Hence, the approach should be:

- Find the smallest non-palindrome prefix t.

- Let u be the suffix starting from len(t) to the end.

- If u is not a palindrome, then return "YES" with [t, u].

- Similarly, find the smallest non-palindrome suffix u.

- Let t be the prefix up to len(u).

- If t is not a palindrome, then return "YES" with [t, u].

- If neither of these splits works, return "NO".

In "aabaa", neither split works, so return "NO".

This seems correct.

Let me try with "abba".

- Smallest non-palindrome prefix: "ab" (since "a" is a palindrome).

- Corresponding suffix: "ba" (which is not a palindrome).

- So, split into "ab" and "ba", both not palindromes.

- Return "YES" with ["ab", "ba"].

Correct.

Another test case: "aaa".

- Check if it's a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: yes.

- Return "NO".

Correct.

Another test case: "abcba".

- Check if it's a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: no.

- Find smallest non-palindrome prefix: "a" is a palindrome, "ab" is not a palindrome.

- Corresponding suffix: "cba" is not a palindrome.

- So, split into "ab" and "cba", both not palindromes.

- Return "YES" with ["ab", "cba"].

Correct.

Another test case: "a".

- Check if it's a palindrome: yes.

- Check if all characters are the same: yes.

- Return "NO".

Correct.

Another test case: "ab".

- Check if it's a palindrome: no.

- Return "YES" with ["ab"].

Correct.

Seems like this approach works.

Now, to implement this efficiently, I need functions to:

1. Check if a string is a palindrome.

2. Find the smallest non-palindrome prefix.

3. Find the smallest non-palindrome suffix.

Each of these should be O(n).

Given that sum of |s| <=10^6, this should be efficient enough.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- For each test case:

- Read the string s.

- Check if s is a palindrome.

- If not, print "YES", 1, s.

- Else:

- Check if all characters in s are the same.

- If yes, print "NO".

- Else:

- Find the smallest non-palindrome prefix t.

- Let u be s[len(t):].

- If u is not a palindrome, print "YES", 2, t, u.

- Else:

- Find the smallest non-palindrome suffix u.

- Let t be s[:len(u)].

- If t is not a palindrome, print "YES", 2, t, u.

- Else:

- Print "NO".

This should cover all cases.

Now, to implement this in code.

I need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Also, need to read inputs efficiently.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and sum of |s| <=10^6, I should read all inputs at once and process them.

In Python, reading inputs efficiently is important to avoid TLE.

I can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read() and split it into tokens.

Then, process the tokens for each test case.

Now, implement the functions:

- is_palindrome(s): return True if s is a palindrome, else False.

- all_same_chars(s): return True if all characters in s are the same, else False.

- smallest_non_palindrome_prefix(s): find the smallest prefix that is not a palindrome.

- smallest_non_palindrome_suffix(s): find the smallest suffix that is not a palindrome.

Implementing is_palindrome is straightforward.

For all_same_chars, I can check if the set of characters has only one unique character.

For smallest_non_palindrome_prefix, I can iterate from prefix length 1 to n, and return the smallest prefix that is not a palindrome.

Similarly for smallest_non_palindrome_suffix, iterate from suffix length 1 to n, and return the smallest suffix that is not a palindrome.

But this would take O(n^2) time in total, which might be too slow for n=10^6.

Wait, but since sum of |s| is <=10^6, and t is up to 10^4, with individual |s| up to 10^6, but overall sum is 10^6, it should be acceptable.

But to optimize, perhaps I can find a way to find the smallest non-palindrome prefix and suffix in O(n) time.

Wait, but checking each prefix and suffix individually is O(n), and for each string, it's acceptable.

Let me proceed with this implementation.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

- Single character: "a" -> palindrome, all characters same -> "NO".

- Two characters, same: "aa" -> palindrome, all characters same -> "NO".

- Two characters, different: "ab" -> not palindrome -> "YES", 1, "ab".

- Palindrome with different characters, length 3: "aba" -> palindrome, not all same characters.

- Find smallest non-palindrome prefix: "a" is palindrome, "ab" is not palindrome.

- Corresponding suffix: "a" is palindrome.

- So, this split is invalid.

- Find smallest non-palindrome suffix: "a" is palindrome, "ba" is not palindrome.

- Corresponding prefix: "ab" is not palindrome.

- So, split into "ab" and "a", but "a" is palindrome -> invalid.

- Therefore, "NO".

Wait, but "aba" should be "NO" according to this.

But in the example "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's "YES" with a partition of 3 substrings.

Wait, so my approach only considers splitting into two parts.

But according to the problem, I can partition into any number of parts, as long as each part is not a palindrome.

So, in "aba", I can split it into "a", "b", "a", but all are palindromes.

Or, "ab", "a" -> "ab" is not palindrome, "a" is palindrome.

Not acceptable.

So, for "aba", it's "NO".

But for "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome with different characters, it's "YES" with a partition of 3 substrings.

So, my approach only considers splitting into two parts, but according to the problem, I can split into more than two parts.

So, perhaps, in "aba", even if I split it into three parts, I can't avoid having palindromic substrings.

But in "uwuowouwu", I can split it into three parts where none are palindromes.

So, my earlier approach only considers splitting into two parts, but I need to consider splitting into more than two parts.

Therefore, my approach is incomplete.

I need to find a way to determine if the palindrome can be split into multiple non-palindrome substrings.

This seems more complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should stick to splitting into two parts, and assume that if splitting into two parts doesn't work, then splitting into more parts won't help.

But that might not be true.

Wait, in "uwuowouwu", which is a palindrome, I can split it into "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

"uw" is not a palindrome, "uow" is not a palindrome, "ouwu" is not a palindrome
