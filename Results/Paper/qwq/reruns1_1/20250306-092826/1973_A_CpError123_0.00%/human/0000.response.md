Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. There are three friends playing chess together. In each game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points, the loser gets 0, and in case of a draw, both get 1 point each. After all the games, their scores are p1, p2, and p3, with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3. I need to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened, or determine if the scores are invalid.

First, I need to understand the scoring system. Each game can result in either a win or a draw. In a win, the winner gets 2 points, and the loser gets 0. In a draw, both players get 1 point each. So, each game contributes either 2 points in total (win) or 2 points in total (draw). Wait, that's interesting. Whether it's a win or a draw, each game always adds 2 points to the total points pool.

Let me verify that. In a win, winner gets 2, loser gets 0: total 2 points. In a draw, each gets 1: total 2 points. So, for n games played, the total points should always be 2n, regardless of the number of wins or draws.

Given that, the sum of p1 + p2 + p3 should be even, because it's equal to 2n, where n is the total number of games played. If the sum is odd, that would be impossible, so the answer should be -1 in that case.

Looking back at the sample input, one of the test cases is 0 0 0, which should correspond to 0 games played, since total points are 0, which is equal to 2*0. So, that makes sense.

Another test case is 0 1 1. The sum is 2, which is even, so n should be 1 game played. In this game, if it was a draw, both players would get 1 point each. So, two players have 1 point each, and the third has 0. That matches the scores. So, in this case, the number of draws is 1.

Wait, but in this game, only one game was played, and it was a draw between two players, leaving the third player with 0 points. So, the number of draws is 1.

Another test case is 1 1 1. The sum is 3, which is odd. So, this should be invalid, and the answer is -1, which matches the sample output.

Next is 1 1 2. Sum is 4, which is even, so n=2 games were played. Now, how can we achieve scores of 1,1,2?

Let's think about possible game scenarios.

Possible pairs: Let's call the players A, B, and C, with p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

So, possible games:

Game 1: A vs B -> draw: A=1, B=1, C=0

Game 2: A vs C -> C wins: A=1, B=1, C=2

This matches the scores with one draw and one win.

Alternatively:

Game 1: B vs C -> C wins: A=0, B=0, C=2

Game 2: A vs B -> draw: A=1, B=1, C=2

Again, one draw and one win.

In both cases, there's only one draw.

But the sample output for this case is 2. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps multiple draws can be achieved.

Let me think again.

If two games are played, both ending in draws involving different pairs.

For example:

Game 1: A vs B -> draw: A=1, B=1, C=0

Game 2: A vs C -> draw: A=2, B=1, C=1

But in this case, scores would be A=2, B=1, C=1, which matches p1=1, p2=1, p3=2 if we reorder them.

But in this scenario, there are two draws.

So, it's possible to have two draws and achieve the scores p1=1, p2=1, p3=2.

Hence, the maximum number of draws is 2, which matches the sample output.

So, my earlier thought process was incomplete.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of draws while achieving the given scores.

Another test case is 3 3 3. Sum is 9, which is odd. So, invalid, answer is -1.

Next is 3 4 5. Sum is 12, which is even, so n=6 games were played.

I need to see if it's possible to achieve these scores with some number of draws.

Let's think about it.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total, same as a win.

But in a draw, both players get 1 point each, whereas in a win, one gets 2 and the other gets 0.

So, to maximize draws, I need to have as many draws as possible, but still achieve the given scores.

I need to find the maximum number of draws possible.

I need a general approach to solve this.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

Let's denote:

- Let n be the total number of games played. Then, total points = 2n.

- Let d be the number of draws. Then, the number of wins is n - d.

- In each draw, two players each get 1 point, so total points from draws: 2d.

- In each win, one player gets 2 points, and the other gets 0, so total points from wins: 2(n - d).

- Therefore, total points: 2d + 2(n - d) = 2n, which matches the total points.

But I need to distribute these points among three players.

Let me think about the maximum number of draws.

To maximize draws, I need to have as many draws as possible, but still achieve the given scores.

I need to ensure that the points are distributed correctly.

Let me consider the highest score, p3.

In order to achieve p3, the player with p3 must have gained those points through a combination of wins and draws.

Similarly for p2 and p1.

I need to find a way to allocate the wins and draws among the players to achieve the given scores.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe I can look at the differences in scores.

Given that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, I can try to find how much p3 exceeds p2 and p1.

Wait, in the sample input where p1=1, p2=1, p3=2, the answer is 2 draws.

In another sample input where p1=0, p2=1, p3=1, the answer is 1 draw.

I need to find a general formula.

Let me consider the total points: p1 + p2 + p3 = 2n.

Also, the maximum possible score for a player is 2n, if they win all their games.

But in our case, p3 is the highest score.

I need to ensure that p3 ≤ 2n.

But since p3 is less than or equal to 2n, and p1 + p2 + p3 = 2n, I need to make sure that p3 ≤ 2n.

But since p3 is part of the sum, it's already less than or equal to 2n.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the possible pairings and games.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I should look for a formula that directly calculates the maximum number of draws based on p1, p2, p3.

Looking back at the sample input and outputs:

- 0 0 0 → 0 draws

- 0 1 1 → 1 draw

- 1 1 2 → 2 draws

- 3 3 3 → invalid (-1)

- 3 4 5 → 6 draws

- 1 1 10 → 2 draws

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, in the first case, no games were played, so no draws.

In the second case, one draw.

In the third case, two draws.

In the fourth case, invalid.

In the fifth case, six draws.

In the sixth case, two draws.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can calculate the maximum number of draws for any given p1, p2, p3.

Let me try to find a general approach.

First, check if the total points are even: if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 == 0, then proceed; else, invalid (-1).

Then, calculate the total number of games: n = (p1 + p2 + p3) / 2.

Now, to maximize the number of draws, I need to maximize d, the number of draws.

Each draw contributes 2 points to the total points (1 point to each player involved in the draw).

Each win contributes 2 points to the total points (2 to the winner, 0 to the loser).

So, to maximize d, I need to have as many draws as possible.

But I need to ensure that the points are distributed according to p1, p2, p3.

This seems complex.

Maybe I can think in terms of the minimal number of wins needed to achieve the scores.

The more wins, the fewer draws.

So, to maximize draws, minimize wins.

Each win increases one player's score by 2, and the other's by 0.

Each draw increases both players' scores by 1.

So, to minimize wins, I need to maximize draws, which means maximizing the number of times two players share 1 point each.

But I need to ensure that the individual scores are achieved.

This seems like a system of equations.

Let me define:

Let’s denote the players as A, B, and C, with scores p1, p2, p3 respectively, where p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

Let’s denote:

- d_ab: number of draws between A and B

- d_ac: number of draws between A and C

- d_bc: number of draws between B and C

- w_ab: number of wins for A over B

- w_ac: number of wins for A over C

- w_bc: number of wins for B over C

Then, the total points for each player can be expressed as:

A: d_ab + d_ac + 2*(w_ab + w_ac)

B: d_ab + d_bc + 2*(w_bc) - 2*(w_ab)

C: d_ac + d_bc + 2*(w_ac) - 2*(w_bc)

Wait, that might not be accurate.

Let me think again.

For each draw between A and B: A gets 1, B gets 1

For each win for A over B: A gets 2, B gets 0

Similarly for other pairs.

So, total points for A:

points_from_A = d_ab + d_ac + 2*(w_ab + w_ac)

Similarly for B:

points_from_B = d_ab + d_bc + 2*(w_bc) + 0*(losses)

Wait, but in w_ab, A wins against B, so B loses.

So, in w_ab, A gets 2, B gets 0.

Similarly, in w_ac, A gets 2, C gets 0.

In w_bc, B gets 2, C gets 0.

And in draws:

d_ab: A and B each get 1

d_ac: A and C each get 1

d_bc: B and C each get 1

So, total points:

pA = d_ab + d_ac + 2*(w_ab + w_ac)

pB = d_ab + d_bc + 2*(w_bc + w_ba)

Wait, but w_ba is not defined. Actually, w_ba would be the number of times B wins against A, which is the same as w_ab = 0 if only one direction is considered.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define:

- w_ab: number of times A wins against B

- w_ba: number of times B wins against A

But to simplify, perhaps it's better to consider that w_ab and w_ba are separate variables.

But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the number of wins for each player is the number of times they win against others.

But this seems messy.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the total number of draws d = d_ab + d_ac + d_bc

And the total number of wins w = w_ab + w_ac + w_bc + w_ba + w_ca + w_cb

Wait, but in our case, since each game is between two players, and each game results in either a win or a draw, I need to account for all possible pairwise games.

This seems too complicated for the time being.

Perhaps I can look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider the total points and the individual scores.

Given that total points is 2n, and n is the number of games played.

I need to maximize the number of draws, which means minimizing the number of wins.

Each win contributes 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, while a draw contributes 1 point to each player.

So, to maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of wins.

Given that, the minimal number of wins is determined by the differences in the scores.

Specifically, the differences between the players' scores impose constraints on the number of wins.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have p1, p2, p3 with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

The total points are p1 + p2 + p3 = 2n.

To maximize draws, I need to maximize the number of draws d, which is equal to the total points minus twice the number of wins: d = 2n - 2w.

But w is the number of wins.

Wait, actually, since each win contributes 2 points to the winner, and each draw contributes 2 points in total, the total points are: 2w + 2d = 2n ⇒ w + d = n.

So, d = n - w.

To maximize d, I need to minimize w.

So, the minimal number of wins w_min is determined by the maximal possible draws.

But I need to find w_min such that the scores can be achieved.

The minimal number of wins is determined by the differences in the scores.

Specifically, the differences between the players' scores must be accounted for by the wins.

Each win can create a difference of 2 points between the winner and the loser.

So, to achieve the score differences, I need a certain number of wins.

Let me consider the differences:

Let’s define the differences:

delta_1 = p2 - p1

delta_2 = p3 - p2

delta_3 = p3 - p1

But since p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, these differences are non-negative.

Now, to achieve these differences, I need to have enough wins to account for them.

Each win can increase the difference between two players by 2 points.

Draws do not change the difference between players' scores, since both players gain 1 point each.

Wait, actually, in a draw between two players, their difference remains the same.

So, to maximize draws, I need to minimize the number of wins, which means minimizing the number of times differences are increased by 2.

But I need to cover the existing differences with wins.

So, the minimal number of wins needed is the maximum difference divided by 2, rounded up.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have p1, p2, p3 with p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3.

To achieve p3, the highest score, I need to see how many wins are necessary.

But I need to consider the interplay between all players.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I can look for a formula that directly calculates the maximum number of draws.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- For p1=0, p2=0, p3=0: sum=0, n=0, draws=0

- For p1=0, p2=1, p3=1: sum=2, n=1, draws=1

- For p1=0, p2=2, p3=3: sum=5, which is odd → invalid (-1)

Wait, but in the given code, the test cases include (0,2,3), but according to p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, it should be valid only if the sum is even.

Wait, in the problem statement, the test case is (0,1,1), (0,2,3), (3,3,3), (3,4,5), (1,1,10), and (0,0,6).

Wait, in the provided program, the test cases are: [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]

And the outputs are: 0,1,-1,2,-1,2,6

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, for (0,2,3), sum is 5, which is odd, so invalid (-1), which matches.

For (3,3,3), sum is 9, which is odd, invalid (-1).

For (3,4,5), sum is 12, which is even, and the output is 6.

Let me see: n = 6 games.

Is it possible to have 6 draws in 6 games? If all 6 games are draws, then each draw contributes 2 points (1 to each player involved).

But in 6 draws, if we have certain pairings, we need to see if we can achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Wait, but 6 draws would contribute a total of 12 points, which matches the sum.

But how can we distribute these points to get p1=3, p2=4, p3=5?

Let’s say:

- Suppose A and B draw 3 times: A gets 3 points, B gets 3 points

- A and C draw 0 times

- B and C draw 3 times: B gets 3 more points, C gets 3 points

Total: A=3, B=6, C=3, which is not matching p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

Alternatively, different distribution:

- A and B draw once: A=1, B=1

- A and C draw twice: A=3, C=3

- B and C draw three times: B=6, C=6

Which gives A=3, B=6, C=6, which doesn't match.

Alternatively:

- A and B draw twice: A=2, B=2

- A and C draw once: A=3, C=1

- B and C draw three times: B=5, C=4

Which gives A=3, B=5, C=4, which matches p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, in this case, we have 6 draws, which matches the output of 6.

Another test case: (1,1,10), sum=12, which is even, n=6.

Is it possible to have 6 draws and achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10?

Wait, in the earlier case, with 6 draws, we achieved p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

So, perhaps 6 draws can be achieved in this scenario.

But p1=1, p2=1, p3=10: sum=12.

Is this possible?

Let’s see:

- Suppose A and B draw once: A=1, B=1

- A and C draw zero times

- B and C draw five times: B=6, C=6

Total: A=1, B=7, C=6, which doesn't match.

Alternatively:

- A and B draw twice: A=2, B=2

- A and C draw zero times

- B and C draw four times: B=6, C=6

Total: A=2, B=8, C=6, not matching.

Another way:

- A and B draw once: A=1, B=1

- A and C draw zero times

- B and C draw five times: B=6, C=6

Total: A=1, B=7, C=6, not matching.

Another way:

- A and B draw zero times

- A and C draw once: A=1, C=1

- B and C draw five times: B=10, C=6

Total: A=1, B=10, C=7, which doesn't match p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

Wait, p1=1, p2=1, p3=10: sum=12, n=6.

Is there a way to achieve this?

Wait, perhaps with some wins involved.

Let’s try:

- Suppose A and B draw once: A=1, B=1

- A and C have some games:

- Suppose A wins against C once: A=3, C=0

- B and C draw five times: B=11, C=5

Total: A=3, B=11, C=5, not matching.

Alternatively:

- A and B draw once: A=1, B=1

- A and C draw zero times

- B and C have five games:

- Suppose B wins once against C: B=3, C=0

- B and C draw four times: B=7, C=4

Total: A=1, B=8, C=4, not matching.

Another attempt:

- A and B draw once: A=1, B=1

- A and C draw zero times

- B and C draw four times: B=5, C=5

- B wins once against C: B=7, C=5

Total: A=1, B=7, C=5, not matching.

Another attempt:

- A and B draw twice: A=2, B=2

- A and C draw zero times

- B and C draw four times: B=6, C=6

Total: A=2, B=8, C=6, not matching.

Seems tricky to achieve p1=1, p2=1, p3=10.

But according to the sample output, the answer is 2 draws.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the maximum number of draws is calculated based on some formula.

Looking back at the provided program:

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):

resultats = []

for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:

total_points = p1 + p2 + p3

if total_points % 2 != 0:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

total_matchs = total_points // 2

if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:

resultats.append(-1)

continue

egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)

if egalites < 0:

resultats.append(-1)

else:

resultats.append(egalites // 2)

return resultats

Looking at this code, it seems to follow a specific formula to calculate the number of draws.

First, it checks if the total points are even. If not, it's invalid (-1).

Then, it calculates the total number of matches (games) as total_matchs = total_points // 2.

Then, it checks if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs, in which case it's invalid (-1).

Then, it calculates egalites (draws) as total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1), and if egalites < 0, invalid (-1), else egalites // 2.

Wait, this seems to be a specific formula, but where does it come from?

Let me try to understand this formula.

Given p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3, and total_points = p1 + p2 + p3 = 2n.

Then, egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1).

Let me plug in the values for one of the test cases.

Take p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

total_points = 12, n=6.

egalites = 12 - 2*(5-4) - 2*(5-3) = 12 - 2*1 - 2*2 = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6.

Then, egalites // 2 = 3, but in the sample output, it's 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, in the sample input, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, the output is 6, but according to this formula, it would be 6 // 2 = 3.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample output.

Looking back, the sample input is:

7

0 0 0

0 1 1

0 2 3

3 3 3

3 4 5

1 1 10

0 0 6

And the output is:

0

1

-1

-1

6

2

0

Wait, in the case of p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, the output is 6.

But according to this formula, egalites = 12 - 2*(1) - 2*(2) = 6, then egalites // 2 = 3, which doesn't match the sample output of 6.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula in the provided code.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, checking the sample output again:

0

1

-1

-1

6

2

0

Wait, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, it's 6.

But according to the formula in the code, it would be 3.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the formula.

Wait, in the code, egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)

But in the test case, p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, total_points=12

egalites = 12 - 2*(5-4) - 2*(5-3) = 12 - 2*1 - 2*2 = 12 - 2 - 4 = 6

Then, egalites // 2 = 3, but sample output is 6.

So, the code seems to be wrong in this case.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different.

Maybe egalites should be egalites = (total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)) // 2

But in the code, it's egalites // 2, so in this case, 6 // 2 = 3, but sample output is 6.

So, the code doesn't match the sample output for this case.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that in the case where p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, and the output is 6, which is equal to n, the total number of games.

So, in this case, all games are draws.

Wait, but earlier I tried to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with 6 draws, but couldn't.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Let me try again.

Suppose all 6 games are draws, but arranged in such a way to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5.

But earlier attempts didn't yield the correct scores.

Alternatively, maybe some games are wins and some are draws.

Wait, but the goal is to maximize the number of draws.

So, perhaps the maximum number of draws is 6, meaning all games are draws, but as shown earlier, it's not possible to achieve p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with all draws.

So, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the code.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)

Then, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5:

egalites = 12 - 2*(1) - 2*(2) = 6, then 6 // 2 = 3.

But the sample output is 6, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)

But perhaps it should be divided differently.

Wait, perhaps egalites = (total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1)) / 2

But in the code, it's egalites // 2.

In Python, // is integer division.

So, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, egalites = 6, egalites // 2 = 3, but sample output is 6.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the minimal number of wins.

Each win creates a difference of 2 points between two players.

So, to achieve the differences between p3 and p2, and p3 and p1, I need a certain number of wins.

Let’s define:

w = (p3 - p2 + p3 - p1) / 2

Then, the number of draws is total_matchs - w.

But need to ensure that w is an integer and non-negative.

Wait, let's try this formula.

For p1=3, p2=4, p3=5:

w = (5-4 + 5-3)/2 = (1 + 2)/2 = 1.5

Which is not an integer, so invalid.

But the sample output is 6, which suggests it's valid.

So, perhaps this approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps w = (p3 - p2) + (p3 - p1)

Then, egalites = total_matchs - w

But need to ensure w is non-negative and <= total_matchs.

Wait, in the previous case, w = (5-4) + (5-3) = 1 + 2 = 3

Then, egalites = 6 - 3 = 3, which matches the earlier formula's result, but not the sample output.

So, perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of draws is indeed 3 for this case, but the sample output says 6.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion between the number of draws and some other value.

Alternatively, perhaps the "egalites" in the code is not the number of draws, but something else.

Wait, in French, "égales" means "equal", perhaps referring to draws.

But according to the code, for p1=3, p2=4, p3=5, it would compute egalites = 6, then egalites // 2 = 3, but sample output is 6.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is egalites = total_points - 2*(p3 - p2) - 2*(p3 - p1), then egalites is the number of draws.

But in this case, egalites = 6, which matches the sample output of 6.

Wait, but according to earlier reasoning, that doesn't make sense because achieving p1=3, p2=4, p3=5 with 6 draws isn't possible.

Wait, perhaps there is confusion in the formula.

Let me think differently.

Let’s consider that in a draw, two players each get 1 point, so for d draws, the total points contributed by draws
