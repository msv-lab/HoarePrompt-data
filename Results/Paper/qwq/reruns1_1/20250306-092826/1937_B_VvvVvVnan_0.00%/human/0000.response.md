Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's a 2xN grid filled with zeros and ones, and there's a grasshopper starting at the top-left cell (1,1) that needs to reach the bottom-right cell (2,N). It can only move one cell right or downwards. For each path it takes, we construct a binary string by collecting the numbers in the cells of the path in order, and we need to find the lexicographically smallest such string and the number of paths that produce this string.

First, I need to understand what a lexicographically smallest string is. It's the smallest string when comparing them as sequences. So, for example, between "001" and "010", "001" is smaller because the first two characters are the same, and the third one is smaller in the first string.

Okay, so my goal is to find the path that gives me the smallest possible string in this lex order, and then count how many such paths there are.

Let's think about how the grasshopper can move. From any cell, it can either move right or down, provided it doesn't go out of the grid. So, from (1,1), it can go to (1,2) or (2,1). From (1,2), it can go to (1,3) or (2,2), and so on. Similarly, from (2,j), it can only move to (2,j+1) since below that is out of the grid.

Wait, no. The grid is 2 rows by N columns, so from any cell (1,j), it can move to (1,j+1) or (2,j), and from (2,j), it can move to (2,j+1).

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the path starts at (1,1) and ends at (2,N), and at each step, it can either move right or down, with the constraint that it doesn't go out of the grid.

Now, to find the lexicographically smallest path, I need to choose the path that gives the smallest sequence of cells' values.

One way to approach this is to consider that lex smallest means that at the first position where two strings differ, the smaller one has the smaller character. So, I need to minimize the first characters as much as possible.

Let me try to think of an example.

Suppose N=3, and the grid is:

Row1: 0 1 0

Row2: 1 0 1

So, possible paths are:

1. Right, Right, Down: cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) -> "0101"

2. Right, Down, Right: cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) -> "0101"

3. Down, Right, Right: cells (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) -> "0101"

In this case, all paths give the same string "0101", so that's the smallest, and the count is 3.

Another example:

N=2

Row1: 0 0

Row2: 0 0

Possible paths:

1. Right, Right, Down: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) -> "000"

2. Right, Down, Right: (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3) -> "000"

3. Down, Right, Right: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) -> "000"

All paths give "000", so the smallest is "000" and count is 3.

Wait, but in the first test case of the sample input, for N=2 with all zeros, the output is "000" and count=2. Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, for N=2, the grid is 2x2, so the cells are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2).

Paths:

1. Right, Down: (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2) -> "000"

2. Down, Right: (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2) -> "000"

So, only two paths, both giving "000". So, count is 2.

Got it.

So, in general, for N, number of paths is N+1 choose 1, which is N+1, but in the first case, it's 3 choose 1=3, but in the second case, it's 2+1=3, but sample input says count=2 for N=2. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, for N=2, paths are:

1. Right, Down: (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)

2. Down, Right: (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)

So, only two paths.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, in a 2xN grid, from (1,1) to (2,N), with moves only right or down.

Each path consists of exactly N-1 right moves and 1 down move, totaling N moves.

Wait, no.

Wait, to go from (1,1) to (2,N), you need to make exactly one down move and N-1 right moves.

So, the total number of paths is the number of ways to arrange one down move in N moves, which is N.

Wait, but in N moves, you can have the down move at any of the N steps.

Wait, but in the first example, N=2, paths are:

1. Right, Down: (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)

2. Down, Right: (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)

So, count is 2, which matches N=2.

In the second example, N=4, paths are:

1. Right, Right, Right, Down: (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(1,4)->(2,4)

2. Right, Right, Down, Right: (1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(2,4)

3. Right, Down, Right, Right: (1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4)

4. Down, Right, Right, Right: (1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3)->(2,4)

So, 4 paths for N=4.

But in the sample input, for N=2, count=2, which matches.

So, in general, for N, number of paths is N.

Wait, but in the first test case, N=2, count=2, matches.

Second test case, N=4, count=1.

Wait, but according to this, it should be 4 paths, but in the sample input, it's saying count=1 for N=4.

Wait, no, sample input for N=4 is:

1101

1100

And the output is:

11000

1

So, only one path gives the lex smallest string.

So, in general, the number of paths that give the lex smallest string can be less than the total number of paths.

So, I need a way to find the lex smallest path and then count how many paths give that string.

How to approach this?

One way is to simulate the path selection process, always choosing the smallest possible character at each step.

Wait, but the path is not just about choosing the smallest character at each step, because the sequence matters.

I need to choose the path that results in the smallest sequence when concatenating the cells' values in order.

So, perhaps I can think of it as building the string step by step, choosing at each step the move that gives the smallest possible next character.

But I need to be careful because the choice at one step affects the future choices.

Let me try to think of an algorithm.

At each step, I have the current position (row, column), and I can choose to move right or down (if possible).

I need to choose the move that leads to the path with the smallest possible string.

To do this, I can think greedily: always choose the move that allows me to have the smallest possible character at the current step.

Wait, but I need to consider the entire sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of dynamic programming, where I keep track of the current position and the current string built so far, and find the minimal string.

But that might be too slow, considering the constraints (N up to 2*10^5 per test case, and T up to 10^4 test cases, with total N across all test cases up to 2*10^5).

So, I need an efficient algorithm, probably O(N) per test case.

Let me think differently.

Since the grid has only two rows, it's a lot simpler.

Let me try to model the possible paths.

Each path can be represented by the column where the down move is made.

Since you have to make exactly one down move, and it can be at any column from 1 to N.

Wait, no. Wait, in a 2xN grid, from (1,1) to (2,N), you have to make exactly one down move and N-1 right moves.

The down move can be at any step from 1 to N.

Wait, more precisely, in the sequence of N moves, exactly one of them is down, and the rest are right.

So, the down move can be at any position in the sequence.

But in terms of positions, the down move can be from any (1,j) to (2,j), for j from 1 to N.

Then, the path is: right moves from (1,1) to (1,j), then down to (2,j), then right moves to (2,N).

So, the string is: a11, a12, ..., a1(j), a2(j), a2(j+1), ..., a2(N).

So, the string is: s = a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N.

I need to choose j from 1 to N, and find the s that is lex smallest among all possible s for different j.

Then, count how many j give this smallest s.

Wait, but it's not exactly j from 1 to N, because the moves are sequences of rights and downs.

Wait, actually, for each j from 1 to N, there corresponds a unique path: right to (1,j), down to (2,j), right to (2,N).

So, indeed, there are N such paths, each corresponding to a choice of j from 1 to N.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to consider all possible j from 1 to N, construct the string s for each j, and find the lex smallest one, and count how many j give that s.

But constructing each s and comparing them would be too slow for N up to 2*10^5.

I need a smarter way.

Let me think about how to compare the strings for different j.

Let me denote s_j as the string for a particular j.

s_j = a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the minimal s_j among all j, and count how many j achieve this minimal s_j.

To do this efficiently, I need a way to find the minimal s_j without constructing all of them explicitly.

Let me consider that all s_j share some prefix.

For example, if a11 < a21, then for j=1, s1 = a11 a21 a22 ... a2N.

If a11 == a21, then s1 and s2 will have the same first character.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, trying to find the point where the paths diverge.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as merging the two rows in a way that minimizes the string.

Wait, perhaps I can use a pointer approach.

Let me initialize two pointers, one for each row, starting at column 1.

I'll always choose the smallest available character from the current positions.

If the characters are different, I choose the smaller one.

If they are the same, I need to look ahead to see which path gives the smaller sequence.

This seems similar to merging two sorted arrays, but with lex comparison.

Wait, but the rows are not necessarily sorted.

Wait, perhaps I can find the earliest column where the two rows differ, and choose the path accordingly.

Wait, no, it's not that simple.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me consider that at each step, I have a current position in row 1 or row 2, and I can choose to move right or down.

I need to choose the sequence that gives the smallest lex string.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming, where dp[j] represents the smallest string achievable up to column j.

But I need to be careful with the state.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through the columns from left to right, keeping track of the current minimal string and the possible choices.

Wait, here's an idea.

I can iterate through the columns from 1 to N, and at each column, decide whether to switch rows or not, always choosing the option that gives the smallest possible next character.

To do this, at each column j, I have the option to be in row 1 or row 2.

If I'm in row 1 at column j, I can either:

- Move right to column j+1 in row 1.

- Move down to row 2 at column j, and then must move right to column j+1 in row 2.

Similarly, if I'm in row 2 at column j, I can only move right to column j+1 in row 2.

Wait, but since I have to reach (2,N), I have to end in row 2.

So, I can model this as a DP where I keep track of the current row and the string built so far.

But again, this might be too slow for large N.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal s_j is determined by the point where the down move is made.

I need to choose j such that s_j is minimized.

To minimize s_j, I need to choose j where the sequence a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N is smallest.

To find the minimal s_j, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and for each j, compare s_j with the current minimal s.

But again, this is O(N^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal s_j in O(N) time.

Let me think about the strings s_j.

Let me consider that s_j = prefix up to j in row 1, followed by suffix from j in row 2.

So, s_j = a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the minimal such s_j.

To do this efficiently, I can think of the two rows as strings, and find the minimal merge that follows the grid's movement rules.

Wait, perhaps I can find the point j where switching from row 1 to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal j such that a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N is minimized.

To do this, I can iterate j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s_j.

But I need to optimize this.

An optimized way is to find the j where the sequence a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N is lex smallest.

To do this, I can find the j where a1j is as small as possible, considering the future characters.

Wait, perhaps I can find the j where a1j a2j ... a2N is smallest.

Wait, but I have to consider the prefix a11 to a1j as well.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that the minimal s_j is determined by the first position where s_j differs among all s_k.

I need to find the j that gives the smallest possible s_j in lex order.

To do this, I can iterate through the columns, trying to find the point where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal s_j by finding the minimal possible a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N.

To optimize this, I can precompute the suffix minimums for row 2.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the lex minimal string by choosing the smallest possible character at each step, considering the possible moves.

Let me try to simulate this.

Start at (1,1).

Option 1: move right to (1,2), then continue.

Option 2: move down to (2,1), then move right to (2,2), and continue.

I need to choose the path that gives the smallest lex string.

So, at each step, I need to choose the move that allows the smallest possible next character.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a graph where each node is a position in the grid, and edges are right or down moves, and I need to find the path that gives the smallest lex sequence.

But with N up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way.

Let me consider that in a 2xN grid, the paths are determined by the column where the down move is made.

So, for each j from 1 to N, the path is:

- From (1,1) to (1,j): right moves.

- Down from (1,j) to (2,j).

- From (2,j) to (2,N): right moves.

So, s_j = a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N.

I need to find the minimal s_j among all j.

To find the minimal s_j, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s_j.

But constructing s_j for each j is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the j where a1j is smallest, considering the rest of the string.

Wait, more carefully:

Let me iterate through the columns from left to right, and try to find the j where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible extension.

To do this, I can find the j where a1j is smaller than a2j, or vice versa, but I need to consider the entire suffix.

Wait, perhaps I can find the first column where a1j != a2j, and choose accordingly.

But it's more nuanced than that, because even if a1j == a2j, the future characters might differ.

So, perhaps I need to find the first position where the two rows differ, and choose the row with the smaller character.

But since I have to follow the path constraints, I need to choose the j where switching to row 2 gives the smallest possible s_j.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal s_j by finding the minimal possible merge of the two rows.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal string among all possible interleavings, given the movement constraints.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix j, and look at s_j.

I can think of s_j as the concatenation of prefix of row 1 up to j, and suffix of row 2 from j onward.

So, s_j = row1[1..j] + row2[j..N].

To find the minimal s_j, I need to find the j that minimizes row1[1..j] + row2[j..N].

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal such string.

But again, constructing the string for each j is too slow.

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation row1[1..j] + row2[j..N].

Wait, perhaps I can reverse iterate.

Let me consider that the string s_j = row1[1..j] + row2[j..N].

I can precompute the prefix strings of row1 and the suffix strings of row2.

Then, for each j, s_j = prefix_row1[j] + suffix_row2[j].

Now, to find the minimal s_j, I need to find the j that gives the smallest concatenation of prefix_row1[j] and suffix_row2[j].

But even this seems inefficient for large N.

Wait, perhaps I can find the j where row1[1..j] is smallest compared to row2[j..N].

Wait, maybe I can find the j where row1[j] is smallest, considering the suffix of row2.

This is still not clear.

Let me think about the suffixes.

If I can find the j where row1[1..j] + row2[j..N] is smallest, perhaps I can find the minimal such concatenation by comparing the possible s_j strings in a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the j where row1[j] is smaller than row2[j], or vice versa, but considering the entire strings.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimal s_j by finding the minimal possible row1[1..j] + row2[j..N].

To optimize this, perhaps I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal s_j.

But I need a way to compare the s_j strings efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffix minimums for row2, and prefix strings for row1.

Then, for each j, I can compare the prefix_row1[j] + suffix_row2[j], and keep track of the minimal one.

But comparing strings for each j is still O(N^2).

I need a way to find the minimal concatenation in linear time.

Wait, perhaps I can concatenate row1 and row2 with a special separator, and find the minimal suffix.

Wait, that might not directly apply here.

Let me consider that the minimal s_j corresponds to the minimal possible merge of row1 and row2, given the movement constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal string among all possible merges.

But I need to consider the specific way the paths are constructed.

Let me try to think of it in terms of choosing the down move at the optimal column j.

I need to choose j such that the string up to j in row1 and from j in row2 is minimal.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and for each j, compare s_j with the current minimal s, and keep track of the minimal s and the count of j that give this s.

But again, this is O(N^2).

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal s_j is determined by the first position where s_j differs among the possible s_j.

So, I can iterate through the columns, and find the point where switching rows gives the smallest possible extension.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and keep track of the possible s_j, and find the minimal one.

But I need to optimize this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and keep track of the minimal possible s_j up to the current column.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize s_min as a very large string, and count as 0.

For each j from 1 to N:

s_j = row1[1..j] + row2[j..N]

if s_j < s_min:

s_min = s_j

count = 1

elif s_j == s_min:

count +=1

But again, this is too slow for large N.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and keep track of the current minimal s_j incrementally.

Let me try to build the minimal s_j step by step.

Start with an empty string.

At each step, decide whether to take the current character from row1 or row2, considering the movement constraints.

But since the grasshopper can only move right or down, and must end at (2,N), I need to model the possible moves.

Wait, perhaps I can use a two-pointer approach, where I keep track of the current position in row1 and row2, and choose the smallest available character at each step.

But I have to follow the path constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming, where dp[j] represents the minimal string from column 1 to j.

But I need to define it properly.

Wait, perhaps I can define dp[j][0] as the minimal string from (1,1) to (1,j), and dp[j][1] as the minimal string from (1,1) to (2,j).

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the column j, and try to find the minimal s_j.

I can precompute the prefix of row1 up to j, and the suffix of row2 from j onward.

Then, s_j = prefix_row1[j] + suffix_row2[j].

To find the minimal s_j, I need to find the j that gives the smallest such concatenation.

To optimize this, perhaps I can find the minimal concatenation by finding the minimal possible prefix_row1[j] + suffix_row2[j].

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal j such that prefix_row1[j] + suffix_row2[j] is minimized.

To do this efficiently, I can iterate through j from 1 to N, and keep track of the minimal concatenation.

But I still need a way to compare the concatenations efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the suffixes of row2 in a way that allows fast comparisons.

Let me try to think about the strings.

Suppose I have row1: a11 a12 ... a1N

row2: a21 a22 ... a2N

For each j from 1 to N, s_j = a11 a12 ... a1j a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N

I need to find the minimal s_j.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can iterate through j, and keep track of the minimal s_j seen so far.

But I need a way to compare the s_j strings without constructing them fully each time.

Wait, perhaps I can compare the s_j strings position by position.

Let me try to iterate through the columns, and at each column, decide whether to switch rows or not, based on which choice gives the smallest next character.

This way, I can build the minimal s_j incrementally.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize current string s = ""

Initialize current position at (1,1)

While current column <= N:

If current row is 1:

Option 1: move right to (1, current_column + 1)

Option 2: move down to (2, current_column), then must move right to (2, current_column + 1)

Choose the option that gives the smallest next character.

If current row is 2:

Must move right to (2, current_column + 1)

Append the current cell's value to s

Proceed to the next position.

But in this case, since I have to reach (2,N), I need to ensure that I eventually move down to row 2.

This seems similar to choosing the path that gives the smallest s.

But I need to implement this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and at each column, decide whether to stay in row 1 or switch to row 2, based on which choice gives the smallest possible extension.

Let me try to formalize this.

Initialize s = ""

Initialize current row = 1

For column from 1 to N:

if current row == 1:

if a1j <= a2j:

append a1j to s

current row remains 1

else:

append a2j to s

current row switches to 2

else: # current row == 2

append a2j to s

But this might not be correct, because switching to row 2 locks the path to row 2 for the remaining columns.

Wait, perhaps I need to look ahead to decide whether to switch rows or not.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I iterate through the columns, and at each column, I decide whether to switch to row 2 at that column or not.

I need to choose the switch point that gives the smallest s_j.

To find this efficiently, perhaps I can find the column j where a1j is smaller than a2j, or vice versa, considering the future characters.

Wait, perhaps I can find the column j where a1j != a2j, and choose the row with the smaller character at that column.

But I need to consider the entire string, not just that column.

Let me consider that the minimal s_j is determined by the first position where s_j differs among the possible s_j.

So, I need to find the j that minimizes the lex order of s_j.

To do this, perhaps I can iterate through the columns, and find the first position where the rows differ, and choose the row with the smaller character.

But I need to consider the entire string.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in string algorithms, to find the minimal rotation of a string, we can use suffix arrays.

But here, it's not exactly a rotation.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the two rows as a circular string, and find the minimal substring.

But that might not apply directly.

Let me think about the properties of the minimal s_j.

Suppose I have s_j = row1[1..j] + row2[j..N]

Similarly, s_{j+1} = row1[1..j+1] + row2[j+1..N]

I need to compare s_j and s_{j+1} to see which one is smaller.

To do this efficiently, perhaps I can compare s_j and s_{j+1} by looking at their differences.

Let me consider that s_j and s_{j+1} share the prefix row1[1..j], and differ in the remaining parts.

Wait, no, s_j has row1[1..j] and row2[j..N], while s_{j+1} has row1[1..j+1] and row2[j+1..N].

So, their common prefix is row1[1..j], but s_j has a2j a2(j+1) ... a2N, while s_{j+1} has a1(j+1) a2(j+1) ... a2N.

Wait, perhaps I can compare s_j and s_{j+1} by looking at a1j and a1(j+1).

But it's not straightforward.

Let me try to think of an example.

Suppose N=3

row1: 0 1 0

row2: 1 0 1

Then,

s1 = 0 1 0 1

s2 = 0 1 0 1

s3 = 0 1 1

Wait, s1 = 0 1 0 1

s2 = 0 1 0 1

s3 = 0 1 1

Wait, s3 is smaller than s1 and s2.

Wait, but in this case, s3 is "011", while s1
