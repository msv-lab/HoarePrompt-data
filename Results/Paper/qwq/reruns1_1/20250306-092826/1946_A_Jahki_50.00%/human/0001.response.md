Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase its median. An operation is defined as choosing an element in the array and increasing it by 1.

First, I need to understand what a median is. The median is the middle element in a sorted version of the array. For an array of length n, the median is at position ceil(n/2) when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

For example, if n is 5, the median is at position 3 (since ceil(5/2) is 3). If n is 4, the median is at position 2 (ceil(4/2) is 2).

My goal is to increase the median value by performing the least number of operations. Each operation allows me to pick any element in the array and increment it by 1.

I need to think about how increasing elements affects the median.

Let me consider a simple example.

Suppose the array is [1, 2, 3]. The median is 2. If I want to increase the median, I need to make it greater than 2, say 3.

I can do this by increasing the second element from 2 to 3. So, the array becomes [1, 3, 3], and the median is now 3, which is greater than the original median of 2. That took one operation.

Another example: [1, 2, 2, 4]. Here, n=4, so median is at position 2 in the sorted array. The median is 2. To increase the median, I need to make it greater than 2, say 3.

I can increase one of the 2's to 3. So, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 4], sorted as [1, 2, 3, 4]. The median is now 2.5, but since we take the floor, it's still 2. Wait, no, according to the problem, the median is the element at position ceil(n/2), which is position 2. So, in [1, 2, 3, 4], the median is 2.

Wait, but in the problem description, for n=4, the median is at position 2, which is 3 in the sorted array [2,3,8,9]. Wait, in that example, n=4, ceil(4/2)=2, so the median is the 2nd element in the sorted array.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that for n=4, ceil(4/2)=2, so the median is the 2nd element in the sorted array.

Wait, in the first example, n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, so median is the 2nd element in the sorted array.

Wait, but in Python, list indices start at 0, so for n=3, position ceil(3/2)=2, but in Python, that's index 1.

Wait, no, in Python, lists are zero-indexed. So, for n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, which corresponds to index 1 in the list.

I need to be careful about the indexing.

Let me confirm:

- For n=3, positions are 1, 2, 3. Median is at position 2 (ceil(3/2)=2).

- For n=4, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4. Median is at position 2 (ceil(4/2)=2).

Wait, but in the problem description, for n=4, the median is at position 2, which is the second element in the sorted array.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=3, array=[2,2,8], sorted=[2,2,8], median is 2 (position 2).

After one operation, increase the first element to 3, so array becomes [3,2,8], sorted [2,3,8], median is 3.

So, median increased from 2 to 3 in one operation.

In the fourth test case, n=5, array=[5,5,5,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,5], median is 5.

To increase the median, need to make it greater than 5, say 6.

One way is to increase three elements to 6. For example, increase the first three elements to 6, so array becomes [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

So, it took three operations.

But the problem asks for the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

So, I need to find the minimal number of operations to make the median larger than its original value.

I need to think about how to achieve this efficiently.

One approach is to sort the array and then focus on the median position.

Let me think about it step by step.

First, I need to find the current median.

Then, I need to find the smallest possible median that is larger than the current median.

Since I can only increase elements, not decrease them, the new median will be at least the current median plus one.

So, target median is current median plus one.

Now, I need to make sure that the median in the sorted array is at least current median + 1.

Given that I can only increase elements, I need to find the minimal number of operations to achieve this.

I need to focus on the elements around the median position.

Let me consider the sorted array.

Let's sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Letâ€™s denote the sorted array as b.

So, b = sorted(a)

Let m = ceil(n/2) - 1 (since Python uses 0-based indexing)

Current median is b[m]

I need to make sure that b[m] >= current median + 1

But I can only increase elements, not decrease them.

So, I need to increase some elements in such a way that b[m] is increased.

But since the array is sorted, increasing an element can affect the order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the sorted array.

Suppose I have the sorted array b.

I need to make b[m] >= current median + 1.

But I can only increase elements in a, which would correspond to increasing elements in b.

Since b is sorted, increasing an element in a can cause a shift in b.

This seems a bit tricky.

Maybe I need to consider how much to increase each element to achieve the desired median.

Wait, perhaps I can fix the target median value and calculate how much each element needs to be increased to reach that target, considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sort the array and then focus on the median position.

Let me consider that.

First, sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Find the current median value.

Set the target median value to current median + 1.

Then, in the sorted array, set the median element to the target value, and make sure that all elements before it are less than or equal to it, and all elements after it are greater than or equal to it.

But since I can only increase elements, not decrease them, I need to make sure that the elements before the median don't become larger than the median.

Wait, but since I can only increase elements, I need to find the minimal operations to make b[m] >= target.

But I need to consider that increasing b[m] might require increasing other elements to maintain the sorted order.

Wait, no, since I can increase any element, even those not in the sorted order, but after sorting, it affects the positions.

This seems complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the sorted array b.

I need to make b[m] >= current median + 1.

To do this, I can directly increase b[m] to the target value, which is current median + 1.

The number of operations needed is (target - b[m]).

But wait, b[m] is already in its position in the sorted array.

If I increase b[m], I might need to adjust other elements to maintain the sorted order.

Wait, but since I can increase any element in a, which corresponds to increasing any element in b, but after increasing, I have to sort again.

This is getting messy.

Maybe I need to consider that the minimal number of operations is determined by the difference between the target median and the current median, considering the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array and then focus on the median position, and calculate how much I need to increase that position to make it larger than the current median.

But I need to make sure that the new median is indeed larger.

Wait, perhaps I can set the target median to current median + 1, and calculate the difference between target and current median.

That would be the minimal number of operations needed.

But in some cases, I might need to increase more elements to maintain the sorted order.

Wait, no, since I can increase any elements, not necessarily just the median.

Wait, perhaps I can select elements to increase in such a way that the median is increased with minimal operations.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have the sorted array b.

I need to make b[m] >= current median + 1.

I can choose to increase b[m] directly, which would require (current median + 1 - b[m]) operations.

But perhaps I can choose to increase other elements to shift the median.

Wait, for example, in the first test case, n=3, a=[2,2,8], sorted [2,2,8], median is 2.

To make median >2, say 3, I can increase the second element to 3, so array becomes [2,3,8], sorted [2,3,8], median is 3.

That took one operation.

Alternatively, I could have increased the first element to 3, making [3,2,8], sorted [2,3,8], median is 3.

Same number of operations.

So, in this case, increasing any one element that is less than or equal to the current median can help increase the median.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,5], median is 5.

To make median >5, say 6, I need to increase the third element to 6, making [4,5,6,5,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,6], median is 5, which is not enough.

I need to increase more elements.

If I increase the third and fourth elements to 6, making [4,5,6,6,5], sorted [4,5,5,6,6], median is 5, still not enough.

I need to increase the third element to 6 and others as needed.

Wait, in that test case, it says to increase each of the numbers at positions 1,2,3 by 1, making [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

That took three operations.

So, in this case, I had to increase three elements to make the median 6.

But why couldn't I just increase fewer elements?

If I only increase the third element to 6, the array becomes [5,5,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,6,6], median is 5, which is not enough.

If I increase the third and fourth elements to 6, array becomes [5,5,6,6,5], sorted [5,5,5,6,6], median is 5, still not enough.

Only when I increase the first three elements to 6, I get [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

So, in this case, I had to increase three elements.

Is there a general pattern here?

It seems that to increase the median, I need to focus on the elements from the median position to the end of the array.

Wait, but in the above case, I had to increase elements before the median position.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase the elements from the median position onwards to ensure the median increases.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=3, I only needed to increase one element to increase the median.

In the fourth test case, n=5, I had to increase three elements.

Is there a way to generalize this?

Let me think about the sorted array.

Suppose I have the sorted array b.

I need to make b[m] >= current median + 1.

To do this, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= current median + 1.

Because the median is the ceil(n/2)th element in the sorted array.

So, to make the median >= current median + 1, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= current median + 1.

Therefore, the minimal number of operations is determined by how many elements are currently less than current median + 1, and how much I need to increase them to reach current median + 1.

So, in other words, I need to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >= current median + 1.

I can identify how many elements are already >= current median + 1, and how many are less than current median + 1.

For the elements that are less than current median + 1, I need to increase them to current median + 1, just enough so that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= current median + 1.

So, the number of elements that need to be increased is ceil(n/2) minus the number of elements that are already >= current median + 1.

And the total operations are the sum of (current median + 1 - b[i]) for each element that needs to be increased.

Wait, but I need to choose which elements to increase.

Wait, more precisely, I need to select the smallest elements that are less than current median + 1 and increase them to current median + 1, just enough so that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= current median + 1.

Wait, but it's more efficient to consider the sorted array and focus on the elements from position m onwards.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the array, find the current median, set the target median to current median + 1, and then calculate how much I need to increase the elements from position m onwards to make at least ceil(n/2) elements >= target median.

Wait, but I can choose to increase any elements, not just the ones from position m onwards.

But to minimize operations, it's optimal to increase the elements that are closest to the target median.

Wait, actually, to minimize the number of operations, I should identify how many elements are below the target median and how much to increase them to reach the target median.

So, here's a plan:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Find the current median value, which is b[m], where m = ceil(n/2) - 1 (0-based indexing).

3. Set the target median to current median + 1.

4. Count how many elements in the sorted array are less than the target median.

5. For each element that is less than the target median, calculate the difference between the target median and the element, and sum these differences to get the total operations needed.

But wait, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= target median.

So, I need to find how many elements are currently < target median, and then calculate the total operations to increase these elements to target median, but only up to the point where ceil(n/2) elements are >= target median.

So, if k = ceil(n/2), and there are already p elements >= target median, then I need to increase k - p elements to reach target median.

If p >= k, then I don't need to do anything, but since I need to increase the median, which is only possible if I increase some elements, I need to make sure that the median actually increases.

Wait, but according to the problem, I need to increase the median, which means making it strictly larger than its current value.

So, if I have p elements already >= target median, and k - p elements need to be increased to target median.

The total operations are the sum over the differences for the first (k - p) elements that are less than target median.

Wait, perhaps it's better to sort the array, identify the elements that need to be increased to target median, and sum up the differences.

Let me try to formalize this.

Algorithm:

1. Read the number of test cases, t.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n, the length of the array.

b. Read the array a.

c. Sort the array a in non-decreasing order.

d. Calculate m = ceil(n/2) - 1 (0-based indexing).

e. Current median is a[m].

f. Set target median to current median + 1.

g. Initialize operations counter to 0.

h. Count how many elements are less than target median.

i. For each of these elements, calculate the difference between target median and the element, and add it to operations.

j. Output the total operations.

Wait, but I need to make sure that I only need to increase enough elements to have at least ceil(n/2) elements >= target median.

So, in step h, I need to find the elements that need to be increased, which are the elements in positions from m downwards that are less than target median.

Wait, actually, since I need at least ceil(n/2) elements to be >= target median, I should focus on the last ceil(n/2) elements in the sorted array and ensure they are >= target median.

Wait, no. The median is determined by the ceil(n/2)th element.

Wait, in a sorted array, to make the ceil(n/2)th element >= target median, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= target median.

So, I need to find the smallest ceil(n/2) elements and make sure they are >= target median.

Wait, no, I need to make sure that the ceil(n/2)th element is >= target median, which implies that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= target median.

So, to minimize operations, I should focus on increasing the smallest elements up to the ceil(n/2)th element to reach the target median.

Therefore, I need to look at the first ceil(n/2) elements in the sorted array and calculate how much to increase each of them to make them >= target median.

So, in code:

- Sort the array.

- Find m = ceil(n/2) - 1 (0-based).

- Current median is a[m].

- Target median is current median + 1.

- For each of the first ceil(n/2) elements (a[0] to a[m]), if a[i] < target median, add (target median - a[i]) to operations.

- Output the total operations.

Let me verify this with the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=3, a=[2,2,8]

sorted a=[2,2,8]

m=ceil(3/2)-1=1

current median=a[1]=2

target median=3

First ceil(3/2)=2 elements: a[0]=2 and a[1]=2

Both are <3, so operations=(3-2)+(3-2)=1+1=2

But in the explanation, they only used 1 operation to make [3,2,8], which sorted is [2,3,8], median=3.

So, according to my algorithm, it's giving 2 operations, but in reality, 1 operation suffices.

So, my algorithm is overcounting.

What's wrong here?

Ah, I see. My algorithm is considering that I need to make the first ceil(n/2) elements >= target median, but in reality, I only need to make sure that the ceil(n/2)th element is >= target median, and the others before it can be less.

Wait, but in the sorted array, to make the median >= target median, I need to make sure that at least ceil(n/2) elements are >= target median.

But in practice, when I increase an element, it can affect the sorted order.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after increasing some elements, the sorted order changes.

This is getting complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the sorted array b.

I need to make b[m] >= current median + 1.

To do this, I can increase b[m] directly to current median + 1, which costs (current median + 1 - b[m]) operations.

But in the first test case, b=[2,2,8], m=1, b[m]=2, target=3, so operations=1.

Which matches the first test case.

Wait, but according to my earlier algorithm, I was summing over the first ceil(n/2) elements that are less than target median.

In that case, for n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, so sum (3-2) + (3-2) = 2 operations.

But in reality, only one operation is needed.

So, my earlier algorithm is incorrect.

So, perhaps I need to only consider the median position.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5], sorted [4,5,5,5,5], m=2, b[m]=5, target=6.

According to the sample explanation, it took three operations to make [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median=6.

So, increasing b[m] from 5 to 6 would require 1 operation, but in reality, it took three operations.

So, my initial thought is incomplete.

Wait, in this case, to make the median 6, I need to make sure that at least ceil(5/2)=3 elements are >=6.

In the original sorted array [4,5,5,5,5], I have zero elements >=6.

So, I need to increase 3 elements to be >=6.

Each of these increases requires (6 - current value).

So, the minimal operations would be to choose the three smallest elements to increase to 6.

But in this case, the three smallest are 4,5,5.

So, operations=(6-4)+(6-5)+(6-5)=2+1+1=4.

But according to the sample explanation, it took three operations.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, they increased three elements to 6, but their operations sum is 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the sample explanation, they increased the first three elements to 6, which are originally 5,5,5.

So, operations=(6-5)+(6-5)+(6-5)=1+1+1=3.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought the sorted array is [4,5,5,5,5], so the three smallest are 4,5,5.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the elements to increase carefully.

Wait, if I increase the first three elements to 6, which are originally 5,5,5, that's three operations, resulting in [6,6,6,4,5], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median=6.

Alternatively, if I increase the fourth and fifth elements to 6, which are originally 5 and 5, that's two operations, making [5,5,5,6,6], sorted [5,5,5,6,6], median=5, which is not enough.

So, in that case, I need to increase at least three elements to make the median 6.

Hence, the minimal number of operations is three.

But according to my earlier approach, summing (6-4)+(6-5)+(6-5)=2+1+1=4, which is more than necessary.

So, perhaps my approach is not optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to select the smallest ceil(n/2) elements and increase them to the target median.

In this case, the smallest ceil(5/2)=3 elements are 4,5,5.

I need to increase them to
