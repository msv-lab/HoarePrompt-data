Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, and I need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase its median. An operation is defined as choosing an element in the array and increasing it by 1.

First, I need to understand what a median is. The median is the middle element in a sorted version of the array. For an array of length n, the median is at position ceil(n/2) when the array is sorted. For example, if n is 5, the median is the 3rd element in the sorted array. If n is 4, it's the 2nd element.

My goal is to increase the median value by performing the least number of operations. Each operation allows me to pick any element and increment it by 1.

Let me think about how increasing elements affects the median.

1. **Identify the current median**: I need to sort the array and find the median based on its position.

2. **Determine the target median**: I need the median to be greater than its current value. So, the target median is the smallest value greater than the current median that can be achieved with the fewest operations.

3. **Calculate the operations needed**: Figure out how much to increase the median and other elements to achieve this target.

Wait, but I need to think carefully. Just increasing the median element might not be sufficient because changing an element could affect the sorting order.

Let's consider an example from the problem:

Input:

3

2 2 8

Current sorted array: [2, 2, 8], median is 2 (at position ceil(3/2)=2).

To increase the median, I need it to be greater than 2, say 3.

So, I need to make sure that the element at position 2 in the sorted array is at least 3.

One way is to increase the first 2 to 3, so array becomes [2, 3, 8], sorted [2, 3, 8], median is 3.

That took one operation.

Another example:

Input:

4

7 3 3 1

Sorted: [1, 3, 3, 7], median is 3 (at position ceil(4/2)=2).

To increase the median above 3, say to 4.

I need to make sure that the second element in the sorted array is at least 4.

Option 1: Increase one of the 3's to 4.

Array becomes [1, 3, 4, 7], sorted [1, 3, 4, 7], median is 3.5, but since we take the floor division for index, it's still the second element, which is 3. Wait, the problem says to take ceil(n/2), which for n=4 is 2, so median is the 2nd element.

Wait, but in the example, it's said that the median is 3, which matches.

But if I increase one 3 to 4, the sorted array is [1, 3, 4, 7], median is still 3.

So, I need to increase both 3's to 4.

Array becomes [1, 4, 4, 7], sorted [1, 4, 4, 7], median is 4.

That took two operations.

So, in this case, it took two operations to increase the median from 3 to 4.

Another example:

Input:

1

1000000000

Median is 1000000000.

To increase it, I need to make it at least 1000000001.

So, increase the only element by 1.

That's one operation.

Another example:

Input:

5

5 5 5 4 5

Sorted: [4, 5, 5, 5, 5], median is 5.

To increase it, I need it to be greater than 5, say 6.

So, I need to make sure that the 3rd element in the sorted array is at least 6.

To do that, I need to increase the 4th and 5th elements to 6, but that might not be necessary.

Wait, I can just increase the 3rd element to 6, but in this sorted array, the 3rd element is already 5.

So, to make it 6, I need to increase it by 1.

But if I increase one of the 5's to 6, the sorted array becomes [4, 5, 5, 5, 6], median is still 5.

So, I need to increase another one.

Let's increase two 5's to 6.

Array becomes [4, 5, 5, 6, 6], sorted [4, 5, 5, 6, 6], median is 5.

Still 5.

So, I need to increase the 3rd element again.

Wait, it's still 5.

I need to make sure that after sorting, the 3rd element is greater than 5.

So, I need to increase the 3rd element to 6, but in this case, since there are multiple 5's, I need to increase enough elements to ensure that the 3rd element is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to increase all elements from the 3rd position onwards to 6.

So, increase the 3rd, 4th, and 5th elements by 1.

Array becomes [4, 5, 6, 6, 6], sorted [4, 5, 6, 6, 6], median is 6.

That took three operations.

Which matches the example's output.

Another example:

Input:

6

2 1 2 3 1 4

Sorted: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4], median is 2 (at position ceil(6/2)=3).

To increase it above 2, say to 3.

So, I need the 3rd element in the sorted array to be at least 3.

To achieve this, I can increase the two 2's to 3.

Array becomes [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4], sorted [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4], median is 3.

That took two operations.

Which matches the example.

Another example:

Input:

2

1 2

Sorted: [1, 2], median is 1 (at position ceil(2/2)=1).

To increase it above 1, to 2.

So, make sure the first element is at least 2.

Just increase the 1 to 2.

Array becomes [2, 2], sorted [2, 2], median is 2.

That's one operation.

But the example output is 1, but in the explanation, it's said to be 1 operation.

Wait, but in the sample input, it's given as 2, which might be a different test case.

Wait, in the sample input, for the second test case:

4

7 3 3 1

Which we already discussed, output is 2.

And for:

1

1000000000

Output is 1.

And for:

5

5 5 5 4 5

Output is 3.

And so on.

So, from these examples, it seems that to increase the median, I need to focus on the elements that affect the median position in the sorted array.

Approach:

1. **Sort the array**: To easily find the median and understand the positions.

2. **Identify the median position**: Which is ceil(n/2). In Python, since lists are zero-indexed, the position is floor(n/2) if n is odd, or n//2 if considering zero-based indexing.

3. **Determine the current median**: The value at the median position in the sorted array.

4. **Set the target median**: The smallest value greater than the current median.

5. **Calculate the operations needed**: To make sure that the element at the median position is at least target median.

But wait, in some cases, just increasing the median element might not be sufficient because other elements could shift during sorting.

Wait, actually, since we're dealing with the sorted array, and we need to ensure that the element at the median position is increased, we need to make sure that enough elements are increased to achieve that.

Wait, more carefully:

- Sort the array.

- Identify the median position, say k = ceil(n/2) - 1 (zero-based indexing).

- The current median is sorted[k].

- To increase the median, we need sorted[k] to be increased.

- But since the array is sorted, increasing sorted[k] directly might not be possible without increasing some other elements that are smaller than it.

- Wait, no. Since we can choose any element to increase, we can directly choose to increase sorted[k].

- But if we increase sorted[k], it might not stay in the same position if there are other elements equal to it.

- Actually, to ensure that the median increases, we need to make sure that the k-th element in the sorted array is increased.

- However, if there are multiple elements equal to the median, we might need to increase more than one element to push the k-th element up.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler than that.

Since we can choose any element to increase, and we can perform multiple operations on the same element, the minimal number of operations to increase the median would be to focus on the elements from the median position to the end.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of making the median as large as possible with minimal operations.

But the problem is to increase the median by any amount, minimal operations required.

So, the minimal increase would be to make the median one unit larger.

So, target median = current median + 1.

Then, to achieve this, I need to make sure that the element at the median position in the sorted array is at least current median + 1.

To do this, I can look at the current value at that position and see how much I need to increase it to reach the target.

But, if I increase that element, it might change the sorting order.

Wait, no. Since I can choose to increase any elements, I can choose to increase the elements from the median position onwards to ensure that the median is increased.

Wait, perhaps I should sort the array and then focus on the median position.

Let me try to formalize this.

Algorithm:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Find the current median value, which is sorted[k], where k = ceil(n/2) - 1 (zero-based).

3. Set the target median to current median + 1.

4. To achieve this, I need to make sure that the element at position k in the sorted array is at least target median.

5. Since I can choose any elements to increase, I should focus on increasing the elements from position k onwards to ensure that the k-th element is at least target median.

6. The minimal operations would be the sum of (target median - current value) for each element from position k onwards that is less than target median.

Wait, but since I can choose to increase any elements, I can choose to increase only the necessary elements to reach the target median.

Wait, actually, since I can increase any elements, I can choose to increase only the elements from position k onwards to make sure that the k-th element is at least target median.

But to minimize operations, I should only increase the elements that are less than the target median, starting from the k-th element.

Wait, perhaps it's simply the sum of (target median - current value) for each element from position k onwards that is less than target median.

But I need to make sure that the k-th element is at least target median.

Wait, but in some cases, increasing the k-th element might require increasing other elements as well if they are equal.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that at least (n - k) elements are at least target median.

So, I need to make sure that the last (n - k) elements are at least target median.

Wait, but k is ceil(n/2) - 1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of elements that need to be at least the target median.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that at least (k + 1) elements are at least the target median.

Wait, let's think again.

In a sorted array, to make the k-th element at least target median, I need to make sure that at least (k + 1) elements are at least target median.

Because the k-th element is the smallest among the last (n - k) elements.

So, to make the k-th element at least target median, I need to make sure that at least (k + 1) elements are at least target median.

But since I can choose which elements to increase, I can choose to increase the necessary elements to achieve this.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler to sort the array and then calculate how much to increase the k-th element and beyond to make sure that the k-th element is at least target median.

Let me try with an example.

Take the first example:

n=3, a=[2,2,8]

sorted: [2,2,8], k=1 (ceil(3/2)=2, zero-based index 1)

current median = 2

target median = 3

I need to make sure that the 2nd element in the sorted array is at least 3.

So, I can increase the first 2 to 3.

New array: [3,2,8], sorted [2,3,8], median is 3.

Operations: 1.

Another example:

n=4, a=[7,3,3,1]

sorted: [1,3,3,7], k=1 (ceil(4/2)=2, zero-based index 1)

current median = 3

target median = 4

Need to make sure that the 2nd element in the sorted array is at least 4.

So, I need at least two elements to be at least 4.

Current elements: [1,3,3,7]

I need to make two elements at least 4.

The smallest two elements are 1 and 3.

I can increase 1 to 4 and 3 to 4.

New array: [4,4,3,7], sorted [3,4,4,7], median is 4.

Operations: 3 (1 to 4: +3, 3 to 4: +1, total 4, but in the example, it's 2 operations, so maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, in the example, it's said that with two operations, you can make it [4,3,3,7], sorted [3,3,4,7], median is 3.5, but since we take floor, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that the k-th element is at least target median.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that all elements from k onwards are at least target median.

Wait, no, that might be too much.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that the k-th element is at least target median, and the elements before it can be anything.

But in the sorted array, the k-th element is the median.

So, to make the k-th element at least target median, I need to make sure that it is increased by enough operations.

But in reality, since the array is sorted, increasing an element could affect the sorting order.

This seems tricky.

Maybe a better approach is to sort the array and then focus on the k-th element.

Calculate how much to increase it to make it at least current median + 1.

Then, consider that increasing that element might require increasing other elements to maintain the sorting order.

Wait, but since we can choose to increase any elements, we don't need to maintain the sorting order while performing operations; the sorting is only for finding the median.

So, perhaps the minimal operations are simply the difference between the target median and the current k-th element.

But in some cases, as shown earlier, that might not be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to make sure that the k-th element is at least target median, and if there are duplicates, I need to increase enough elements to push the k-th element up.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

Given program:

def func():

num = int(input())

for i in range(0, num):

num2 = int(input())

case = input()

op = 0

if num2 > 10000:

print(1)

print(16668)

break

else:

a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]

b = sorted(a)

if num2 % 2 == 0:

ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1

else:

ma = int(num2 / 2)

median = b[ma]

new_median = median

while new_median <= median:

b[ma] += 1

op += 1

b = sorted(b)

new_median = b[ma]

print(op)

So, this program does the following:

1. Read the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and the array a.

b. If n > 10000, it prints 1 and 16668 and breaks.

c. Otherwise, it sorts the array.

d. Finds the median position ma.

e. Gets the current median.

f. Enters a loop where it keeps increasing the ma-th element and sorting until the new median is greater than the original median.

g. Counts the number of operations needed.

Wait, but this seems inefficient, especially for large n, as it sorts the array in each iteration.

But since n is up to 10^5 and t is up to 10^4, but the total sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, it might be acceptable performance-wise in Python, but it's not optimal.

But the problem is to determine if this program is correct, not to optimize it.

So, is this program correct?

Let's see.

In the first test case:

n=3, a=[2,2,8]

sorted: [2,2,8], ma=1 (since n=3, ceil(3/2)=2, zero-based index 1), median=2

Loop:

- b = [2,2,8], ma=1, b[1]=2

- Increase b[1] to 3, op=1

- Sort b: [2,3,8], new_median=3

- Since 3 > 2, exit loop

- Output: 1

Which matches the sample output.

Second test case:

n=4, a=[7,3,3,1]

sorted: [1,3,3,7], ma=1 (ceil(4/2)=2, zero-based index 1), median=3

Loop:

- b=[1,3,3,7], ma=1, b[1]=3

- Increase b[1] to 4, op=1

- Sort b: [1,4,3,7], which is [1,3,4,7], new_median=3

- 3 <= 3, continue

- Increase b[1] to 4, op=2

- Sort b: [1,4,4,7], new_median=4

- 4 > 3, exit loop

- Output: 2

Which matches the sample output.

Third test case:

n=1, a=[1000000000]

sorted: [1000000000], ma=0, median=1000000000

Loop:

- b=[1000000000], ma=0, b[0]=1000000000

- Increase b[0] to 1000000001, op=1

- Sort b: [1000000001], new_median=1000000001

- 1000000001 > 1000000000, exit loop

- Output: 1

Which should match the sample output.

Fourth test case:

n=5, a=[5,5,5,4,5]

sorted: [4,5,5,5,5], ma=2, median=5

Loop:

- b=[4,5,5,5,5], ma=2, b[2]=5

- Increase b[2] to 6, op=1

- Sort b: [4,5,5,5,6], new_median=5

- 5 <= 5, continue

- Increase b[2] to 7, op=2

- Sort b: [4,5,5,6,7], new_median=5

- 5 <= 5, continue

- Increase b[2] to 8, op=3

- Sort b: [4,5,5,7,8], new_median=5

- 5 <= 5, continue

- This doesn't seem right. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the sample input, the output is 3 for this case.

In the program, it seems to keep increasing the ma-th element until the new median is greater than the original median.

In this case, even after increasing b[2] to 6, the sorted array is [4,5,5,5,6], new_median=5, which is not greater than original median=5.

So, it continues.

Then, increase b[2] to 7: [4,5,5,6,7], new_median=5

Still not greater.

Then, increase b[2] to 8: [4,5,5,7,8], new_median=5

Still not greater.

This suggests that the program would keep increasing b[2] until the new median is greater than 5.

But in reality, to make the median greater than 5, we need to make sure that the 3rd element in the sorted array is greater than 5.

So, in this case, no matter how much we increase b[2], as long as there are elements less than or equal to 5 in the first two positions, the median remains 5.

Wait, but in this sorted array, b=[4,5,5,5,5], to make the 3rd element greater than 5, we need to make sure that at least the 3rd element is greater than 5.

But in this case, even if we increase b[2] to 6, the sorted array becomes [4,5,5,5,6], median is still 5.

So, to make the median greater than 5, we need to make sure that the 3rd element is greater than 5.

Which means, we need to make sure that at least three elements are greater than 5.

Current elements: [4,5,5,5,5]

To make at least three elements greater than 5, we need to increase some elements.

Option: Increase the third, fourth, and fifth elements by 1.

b becomes [4,5,6,6,6], sorted [4,5,6,6,6], median is 6.

That took three operations.

Which matches the sample output.

So, the program seems to correctly handle this case, as it keeps increasing the ma-th element until the median increases, which in this case takes three operations.

Another test case:

n=6, a=[2,1,2,3,1,4]

sorted: [1,1,2,2,3,4], ma=2 (ceil(6/2)=3, zero-based index 2), median=2

Loop:

- b=[1,1,2,2,3,4], ma=2, b[2]=2

- Increase b[2] to 3, op=1

- Sort b: [1,1,2,3,3,4], new_median=2

- 2 <= 2, continue

- Increase b[2] to 4, op=2

- Sort b: [1,1,2,3,4,4], new_median=2

- 2 <= 2, continue

- Increase b[2] to 5, op=3

- Sort b: [1,1,2,3,4,5], new_median=2

- 2 <= 2, continue

- This doesn't seem right. According to the sample output, it should be 2 operations.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, in the sample input, for this test case, the output is 2.

But according to the program, it seems to require more operations.

Wait, perhaps the program is incorrect for this case.

Wait, let's see.

In the program, it keeps
