Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b times the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's denote gcd(a, b) as g. Then, b * g divides a + b. Since g divides both a and b, g divides a + b. So, b * g divides a + b implies that b divides (a + b)/g. But (a + b)/g = (a/g + b/g), and since g divides both a and b, a/g and b/g are integers. So, b divides (a/g + b/g). But b/g is an integer, so b divides a/g + b/g implies b divides a/g.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's try to rephrase the condition. We have that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b). Let's write a and b in terms of their gcd. Let g = gcd(a, b). Then, we can write a = g * a' and b = g * b', where a' and b' are coprime integers (since g is the greatest common divisor).

Substituting into the condition:

a + b = g * a' + g * b' = g(a' + b')

And b * gcd(a, b) = g * b' * g = g^2 * b'

So, the condition is that g(a' + b') is divisible by g^2 * b'. Simplifying, this means that a' + b' is divisible by g * b'.

But a' and b' are coprime, since g is the gcd. So, a' and b' share no common factors other than 1.

Hmm. Maybe I can think about this differently. Let's consider the ratio a/b. Since a and b are positive integers, a/b is a positive rational number. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the condition a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * gcd(a, b)). That might give me some insight.

Alternatively, maybe I can fix b and see what constraints this imposes on a.

Let's fix b, and then find how many a satisfy the condition for that b.

So, for a fixed b, I need a + b to be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

But gcd(a, b) depends on a, which is what we're trying to find. That seems tricky.

Maybe I can iterate over possible values of gcd(a, b). Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, d divides both a and b, so d divides b. Therefore, d is a divisor of b.

So, for a fixed b, d can be any divisor of b.

Given that, for each b, I can iterate over all possible d that divide b, and for each d, find the number of a in 1 to n such that gcd(a, b) = d and a + b is divisible by b * d.

Wait, but if gcd(a, b) = d, then a must be a multiple of d. So, a = k * d for some integer k, where k is in the range from ceil(1/d) to floor(n/d).

But since a >=1, k >=1, and k <= floor(n/d).

Also, since gcd(a, b) = d, and a = k * d, b = m * d for some integers k and m with gcd(k, m) = 1.

Wait, no. If a = k * d and b = m * d, then gcd(a, b) = d * gcd(k, m). So, for gcd(a, b) = d, we need gcd(k, m) = 1.

But this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me try to summarize where I am. For each b from 1 to m, I need to find the number of a from 1 to n such that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

This seems computationally intensive if I try to iterate over each pair (a, b), especially since n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this, probably with some mathematical insights that can reduce the computation time.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern or formula.

Take the first example in the problem: n=1, m=1.

Possible pair: (1,1)

Check if 1 + 1 is divisible by 1 * gcd(1,1) = 1 * 1 = 1. Since 2 is divisible by 1, it's valid.

So, there's 1 valid pair, which matches the sample output.

Second sample: n=2, m=3.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3)

Let's check each:

(1,1): 1+1=2, divisible by 1*1=1 → yes

(1,2): 1+2=3, divisible by 2*1=2 → 3 mod 2 =1 → no

(1,3): 1+3=4, divisible by 3*1=3 → 4 mod 3 =1 → no

(2,1): 2+1=3, divisible by 1*1=1 → yes

(2,2): 2+2=4, divisible by 2*2=4 → yes

(2,3): 2+3=5, divisible by 3*1=3 → 5 mod 3 =2 → no

So, valid pairs are (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) → 3 pairs, matching the sample output.

Another sample: n=3, m=5.

Possible pairs: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5)

Checking each:

(1,1): 2 divisible by 1 → yes

(1,2): 3 divisible by 2 → no

(1,3): 4 divisible by 3 → no

(1,4): 5 divisible by 4 → no

(1,5): 6 divisible by 5 → no

(2,1): 3 divisible by 1 → yes

(2,2): 4 divisible by 4 → yes

(2,3): 5 divisible by 3 → no

(2,4): 6 divisible by 4 → no

(2,5): 7 divisible by 5 → no

(3,1): 4 divisible by 1 → yes

(3,2): 5 divisible by 2 → no

(3,3): 6 divisible by 3 → yes

(3,4): 7 divisible by 4 → no

(3,5): 8 divisible by 5 → no

Valid pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3) → 5 pairs, but the sample output is 4. Wait, the sample output for n=3, m=5 is 4, but I counted 5. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's check again.

(1,1): yes

(2,1): yes

(2,2): yes

(3,1): yes

(3,3): yes

But sample output is 4. Hmm, maybe I misread the sample output. Wait, no, the sample output for n=3, m=5 is 4, but according to my count, there are 5 valid pairs. Maybe I made a mistake in the counting.

Wait, let's see the fourth sample: n=10, m=8, output=14.

If I count manually, it would take too much time. Maybe my manual counting is incorrect. Perhaps I missed something in understanding the condition.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe there's a mathematical formula or pattern that can be exploited here.

Let me consider that a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * gcd(a, b)). Since gcd(a, b) divides b, b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of b. So, a + b being divisible by b * gcd(a, b) implies that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

But this seems too vague. Maybe I can look at the ratio (a + b)/(b * gcd(a, b)) and see when this is an integer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of b and gcd(a, b), and for each pair (b, d), where d divides b, find the number of a such that gcd(a, b) = d and a + b is divisible by b * d.

Given that gcd(a, b) = d, we can write a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.

Then, a + b = d(a' + b'), and b * gcd(a, b) = b * d = d * b'.

So, the condition is that d(a' + b') is divisible by d * b', which simplifies to a' + b' divisible by b'.

But a' and b' are coprime, since gcd(a', b') = 1.

So, a' + b' divisible by b' implies that a' ≡ -b' mod b'. But since a' and b' are positive integers, and b' divides a' + b', this means that a' is congruent to -b' mod b', which is just 0, since -b' ≡ 0 mod b'.

Wait, that would mean a' is a multiple of b', but since gcd(a', b') = 1, the only way this can happen is if b' = 1.

Because if b' >1, and a' is a multiple of b', then gcd(a', b') would be at least b', which contradicts gcd(a', b')=1.

Therefore, b' must be 1.

So, b' = 1, which means b = d * b' = d * 1 = d.

Therefore, b = d, where d = gcd(a, b).

So, b must be equal to gcd(a, b).

But gcd(a, b) divides b, so this means that gcd(a, b) = b, which implies that b divides a.

Therefore, the condition a + b divisible by b * gcd(a, b) simplifies to b divides a.

Wait, is that correct?

Let me verify.

If b divides a, then a = k * b for some integer k >=1.

Then, gcd(a, b) = gcd(k * b, b) = b.

So, b * gcd(a, b) = b * b = b^2.

And a + b = k * b + b = (k + 1) * b.

So, (k + 1) * b must be divisible by b^2, which means that (k + 1) is divisible by b.

Therefore, b divides (k + 1).

But since a = k * b and a <= n, we have k <= floor(n / b).

Also, k >=1 since a >=1.

So, for each b from 1 to m, we need to find the number of k from 1 to floor(n / b) such that b divides (k + 1).

Wait, that seems more manageable.

So, for each b from 1 to m, the number of a is equal to the number of k from 1 to floor(n / b) such that b divides (k + 1).

Let me rephrase that: for each b, find the number of k in 1 to floor(n / b) where k ≡ -1 mod b.

This is equivalent to finding the number of integers k in 1 to floor(n / b) such that k ≡ (b - 1) mod b.

This is a standard arithmetic sequence problem.

The number of such k is equal to the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence starting from k=1 (if 1 ≡ (b - 1) mod b), with common difference b, up to floor(n / b).

Let me define s = floor(n / b).

We need to find the number of k in 1 to s such that k ≡ (b - 1) mod b.

This is equal to floor((s - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, provided that (b - 1) <= s.

Wait, more precisely, the number of k in 1 to s where k ≡ (b - 1) mod b is equal to floor((s - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if (b - 1) <= s, else 0.

Alternatively, we can use the formula for the number of solutions to k ≡ c mod m in the range 1 to s, which is floor((s - c)/m) + 1, if c <= s, else 0.

In this case, c = b - 1, m = b.

So, for each b from 1 to m, the number of a is floor((floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if (b - 1) <= floor(n / b), else 0.

This seems a bit messy, but it's computable.

However, given that t can be up to 10^4 and n and m up to 2*10^6, with the sum of n and m over all test cases up to 2*10^6, we need an efficient way to compute this.

Let's see if we can optimize this.

First, iterate over b from 1 to m.

For each b, compute s = floor(n / b).

Then, the number of k in 1 to s where k ≡ (b - 1) mod b is floor((s - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if (b - 1) <= s, else 0.

So, total number of pairs is sum over b from 1 to m of floor((floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if (b - 1) <= floor(n / b), else 0.

This seems feasible, but let's see if we can optimize it further.

Notice that floor(n / b) is the number of a <= n where b divides a.

But in this problem, it's floor(n / b) minus some adjustment.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to compute this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can iterate over possible values of b and compute the number of a for each b.

Given that, and considering the constraints, perhaps we can precompute floor(n / b) for all b from 1 to m and then apply the formula above.

But this still seems O(m) per test case, which might be too slow for t=10^4 and m=2*10^6.

Wait, but the sum of m over all test cases is up to 2*10^6, so overall time complexity would be O(2*10^6), which is acceptable.

So, perhaps this approach is feasible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to optimize this further by finding patterns or formulas that allow us to compute the total number of pairs without iterating over each b.

Let me think about that.

Let's consider that for each b, the number of a is floor((floor(n / b) - (b - 1)) / b) + 1.

This seems complicated to sum directly.

Maybe I can look for a mathematical formula or find a way to group terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of s = floor(n / b), and for each s, find the range of b where floor(n / b) = s, and compute the number of a for those b.

This might be similar to divisor sum techniques in number theory.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible values of s, find the range of b where floor(n / b) = s, and then for each such b, compute the number of a.

But this seems more complicated than necessary.

Given time constraints, perhaps the initial approach is sufficient.

Now, looking at the provided code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

count = 2

ans = n

while count <= m:

countmins = int(count - 1)

g = int(n / count)

if g < countmins:

break

g -= countmins

ans += int(g / count) + 1

count += 1

print(int(ans))

I need to determine if this code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

Looking at the code, it seems to be attempting to compute the total number of valid pairs for each test case.

Let's try to map the code to the logic I derived earlier.

First, it reads the number of test cases t.

Then, for each test case, it reads n and m.

It initializes count = 2 and ans = n.

Wait, why ans = n? In my earlier reasoning, I didn't have anything like that.

Then, it enters a while loop that runs as long as count <= m.

Inside the loop:

- countmins = count - 1

- g = n / count

- if g < countmins, break

- g -= countmins

- ans += int(g / count) + 1

- count += 1

Finally, it prints ans.

This seems different from what I derived earlier.

In my earlier approach, for each b from 1 to m, compute s = floor(n / b), then compute floor((s - (b - 1)) / b) + 1, if (b - 1) <= s, else 0.

But in the code, it's iterating count from 2 to m, computing g = floor(n / count), then adjusting g by subtracting count - 1, and then adding floor(g / count) + 1 to ans.

This seems like a different way of computing the total number of pairs.

Perhaps the code is optimizing the computation by grouping b's with the same floor(n / b) value.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me try to see if this code matches the mathematical formula I derived.

Wait, perhaps the code is using a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that ans is initialized to n, which might account for b=1.

For b=1, floor(n / 1) = n, and we need to find the number of k from 1 to n where k ≡ 0 mod 1, which is all k since any k is divisible by 1. So, for b=1, the number of a is floor((n - 0)/1) + 1 = n - 0)/1 + 1 = n + 1.

But since a ranges from 1 to n, the number of a is n.

So, ans is initialized to n, which accounts for b=1.

Then, the loop starts from count=2 to m.

For each count (which is b), it computes g = floor(n / count).

Then, countmins = count -1.

If g < countmins, it breaks.

Else, g -= countmins, and ans += floor(g / count) + 1.

Wait, let's see.

floor(g / count) + 1 = floor((floor(n / count) - (count -1)) / count) + 1.

This seems similar to the formula I derived earlier: floor((s - (b -1)) / b) +1, where s = floor(n / b).

So, it seems that the code is implementing the formula I derived, but starting from b=2, since b=1 is handled separately by initializing ans to n.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, for each b from 1 to m, I need to add floor((floor(n / b) - (b -1)) / b) +1 to the answer, if (b -1) <= floor(n / b).

In the code, it initializes ans to n (which corresponds to b=1), then starts a loop from count=2 to m, and adds floor((floor(n / count) - (count -1)) / count) +1 to ans, as long as floor(n / count) >= count -1.

So, it seems to be implementing the formula correctly, with an early exit condition when floor(n / count) < count -1.

This makes sense because if floor(n / count) < count -1, then floor((floor(n / count) - (count -1)) / count) +1 would be floor(negative number / count) +1, which is invalid.

Wait, but in the code, it breaks when g < countmins, which is when floor(n / count) < count -1.

Instead, according to my earlier formula, it should add floor((floor(n / count) - (count -1)) / count) +1 only if floor(n / count) >= count -1.

So, the code seems to be correctly implementing this condition by breaking when floor(n / count) < count -1.

Therefore, the code appears to be correctly implementing the formula I derived.

Let me test this with the sample input.

Sample Input:

6

1 1

2 3

3 5

10 8

100 1233

1000000 1145141

Sample Output:

Let's take n=1, m=1.

ans = n =1

count=2 > m=1, so loop doesn't run.

Print ans=1, which matches the sample.

Next, n=2, m=3.

count=2 <=3

g = floor(2/2)=1

countmins=1

g=1 >=1

g -=1 => g=0

ans += floor(0/2)+1 =0+1=1

ans now 2+1=3

count=3 <=3

g=floor(2/3)=0

0 < 2, so break

ans=3, matches the sample.

Next, n=3, m=5

ans=3 (for b=1)

count=2 <=5

g=floor(3/2)=1

countmins=1

g=1 >=1

g -=1 =>g=0

ans +=0/2 +1 =0+1=1

ans=3+1=4

count=3 <=5

g=floor(3/3)=1

ans=
