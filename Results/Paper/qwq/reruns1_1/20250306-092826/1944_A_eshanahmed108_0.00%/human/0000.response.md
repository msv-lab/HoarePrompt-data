Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge. That means it's a complete graph with n nodes, and the number of bridges is n*(n-1)/2. Everule lives on island 1 and likes to visit other islands using these bridges. Dominater can destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach. I need to find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, given that Dominater acts optimally.

First, I need to understand the setup. With n islands and all pairs connected, Everule can reach any island from island 1 through some path of bridges. Dominater wants to restrict this by destroying up to k bridges.

My goal is to figure out, after Dominater destroys some bridges, what's the smallest number of islands Everule can still reach from island 1.

Let me think about graph theory here. This is essentially a connected graph, and Dominater is removing edges to try to disconnect it as much as possible, specifically to minimize the size of the connected component containing node 1.

I need to find the smallest possible size of the connected component containing node 1 after removing up to k edges.

Hmm. In graph theory, removing edges to disconnect components is a common problem. I recall that in a complete graph, to disconnect a specific node from the rest, you need to remove all edges connected to it.

Wait, but here, Dominater can remove up to k edges, and I need to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach.

Let me consider the number of edges connected to island 1. In a complete graph with n islands, island 1 is connected to n-1 other islands.

If Dominater removes all edges connected to island 1, Everule can't reach any other island, so only island 1 is reachable. But Dominater can only remove up to k edges.

So, if k >= n-1, Dominater can remove all edges connected to island 1, and Everule can only stay on island 1.

But if k < n-1, then some edges remain, and Everule can reach those directly connected islands, and through them, possibly more islands.

Wait, but in a complete graph, even if some direct edges are removed, there might still be paths through other islands.

Wait no, in a complete graph, if island 1 is connected to island 2 and island 2 is connected to island 3, and so on, then even if some direct edges are removed, there might still be multiple paths to reach other islands.

But I need to consider the worst-case scenario for Everule, meaning Dominater tries to maximize the disconnection.

I think the key is to maximize the number of bridges removed that are connected to island 1, because that directly reduces the islands Everule can reach directly.

But Dominater can also remove bridges between other islands, which might not directly affect Everule's reach but could间接影响.

Wait, actually, if Dominater removes bridges between other islands, as long as connections from island 1 are maintained, Everule can still reach those islands through other paths.

So, perhaps the most effective way for Dominater to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach is to remove bridges directly connected to island 1.

Because removing those directly reduces the islands Everule can reach directly.

But in a complete graph, even if some direct connections are removed, Everule might still reach those islands through other islands.

Wait, is that always true?

Let me think about a small example.

Take n=4, k=1.

So, total bridges: 6.

If Dominater removes one bridge, say between island 1 and island 2.

Then, Everule can still reach island 2 through island 3 or island 4.

So, in this case, Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but according to the sample input, with n=4 and k=1, the output is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Okay, that makes sense.

But in the second sample input, with n=2 and k=1, the output is 1.

So, when n=2, islands 1 and 2 are connected by one bridge.

If Dominater removes that bridge, Everule can't reach island 2, so only island 1 is reachable.

So, in that case, removing the single bridge disconnects island 2.

But in the n=4 case, removing one bridge doesn't disconnect any island completely, because there are multiple paths.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

If k < n-1, Everule can still reach all islands, because the graph remains connected through multiple paths.

And if k >= n-1, Dominater can remove all connections from island 1 to others, isolating island 1.

Wait, but in the sample input, when n=5 and k=3, the output is 5.

But n-1=4, and k=3 < 4, so Everule can still reach all islands.

Yes, that matches.

And when n=5 and k=10, which is more than n-1=4, the output is 1, meaning only island 1 is reachable.

Wait, but n=5 has only n-1=4 bridges connected to island 1.

But k=10 is more than 4, but in reality, there are only 10 bridges in total for n=5.

Wait, n=5 has 5*4/2=10 bridges.

So, k=10 means all bridges are removed.

Hence, only island 1 is reachable.

Similarly, in n=4 and k=4, which is more than n-1=3, but total bridges are 6.

Wait, in the sample input, n=4 and k=4 is not present.

But if k=4 for n=4, which has 6 bridges, Dominater can remove 4 bridges.

But n-1=3, so Dominater can remove all 3 bridges connected to island 1, and still remove one more bridge.

But even if all 3 bridges from island 1 are removed, Everule is isolated.

But if Dominater removes one more bridge, say between island 2 and island 3, that doesn't affect Everule's reach, because Everule can't reach them anyway.

So, in that case, Everule can only reach island 1.

But, wait, in n=4 and k=3, which is n-1=3, Dominater can remove all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating Everule.

So, in that case, Everule can only reach island 1.

But according to the sample input, for n=4 and k=1, output is 4, meaning Everule can reach all islands.

For n=4 and k=3, which is n-1=3, should output be 1 or 4?

Wait, in the sample input, n=4 and k=1 gives 4, n=5 and k=3 gives 5, which seems inconsistent with my earlier thought.

Wait, no, in n=5 and k=3, output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

Wait, but n=5, n-1=4, and k=3 < 4, so Everule can still reach all islands.

Similarly, in n=4 and k=3, which is k = n-1, perhaps it's the threshold.

Wait, for n=4, n-1=3, and k=3, Dominater can remove all 3 bridges connected to island 1, isolating it.

Hence, output should be 1.

But in the sample input, n=4 and k=1 gives 4, n=4 and k=3 should give 1.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=4 and k=1 gives 4, n=5 and k=3 gives 5.

Wait, but in n=5 and k=10, which is all bridges removed, output is 1.

Wait, perhaps I misread the sample input.

Let me check the sample input again.

Input:

6

2 0

2 1

4 1

5 10

5 3

4 4

Output:

2

1

4

1

5

1

So, for n=2, k=0: output 2

n=2, k=1: output 1

n=4, k=1: output 4

n=5, k=10: output 1

n=5, k=3: output 5

n=4, k=4: output 1

Okay, so for n=4 and k=1, output is 4, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

For n=4 and k=4, output is 1, meaning only island 1 is reachable.

Similarly, for n=5 and k=3, output is 5, meaning Everule can still reach all islands.

For n=5 and k=10, output is 1, meaning only island 1 is reachable.

So, it seems that as long as k < n-1, Everule can reach all islands, and when k >= n-1, only island 1 is reachable.

Wait, but in n=5 and k=3, n-1=4, k=3 < 4, so output is 5.

And in n=5 and k=10, which is k >= n-1=4, output is 1.

Yes, that matches.

So, the general rule seems to be:

If k < n-1, Everule can reach all n islands.

If k >= n-1, Dominater can isolate island 1, so Everule can only reach island 1.

Wait, but in n=4 and k=4, n-1=3, k=4 >=3, so output is 1.

Similarly, in n=4 and k=1, k=1 <3, output is 4.

So, the condition seems to be if k >= n-1, output is 1, else output is n.

But wait, in n=5 and k=3, k=3 <4, output is 5.

In n=5 and k=10, k=10 >=4, output is 1.

So, yes, it's consistent.

Hence, the logic is:

If k >= n-1, output is 1.

Else, output is n.

Wait, but in the sample input, n=5 and k=3, k=3 <4, output is 5.

n=5 and k=10, k=10 >=4, output is 1.

n=4 and k=1, k=1 <3, output is 4.

n=4 and k=4, k=4 >=3, output is 1.

n=2 and k=0, k=0 <1, output is 2.

n=2 and k=1, k=1 >=1, output is 1.

So, in all cases, if k >= n-1, output is 1, else output is n.

Hence, the condition is if k >= n-1, output 1, else output n.

So, the program should check if k >= n-1, then print 1, else print n.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Wait, but according to my reasoning, it should be:

if k >= n-1:

print(1)

else:

print(n)

But in the provided program, it's:

print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

Which is equivalent to:

if n - k <=1:

print(n)

else:

print(1)

Wait, is that the same as my condition?

Let me see.

n - k <=1

is equivalent to k >= n -1.

Wait, no.

Wait, n - k <=1

=> -k <=1 -n

=> k >= n -1

Yes, so n - k <=1 is equivalent to k >= n -1.

Hence, the program is implementing the correct logic.

So, the program is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: True

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit given that Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges in a complete graph of `n` islands.

### Approach

1. **Initial Setup**: We start with `n` islands where every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
2. **Objective**: Dominater aims to minimize the number of islands Everule can reach by destroying up to `k` bridges.
3. **Key Insight**:
   - If Dominater destroys all bridges connected to island 1 (which is `n-1` bridges), Everule can only stay on island 1.
   - If `k` is less than `n-1`, Dominater cannot isolate island 1 completely, and Everule can still reach multiple islands through various paths.
4. **Condition**:
   - If `k >= n-1`, Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, leaving Everule only on island 1.
   - If `k < n-1`, Everule can still reach all islands.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print(n if n - k <=1 else 1)

```

### Explanation

- **Input Parsing**: Read the number of test cases `t`.
- **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case:
  - Read the values of `n` (number of islands) and `k` (maximum bridges Dominater can destroy).
  - Determine the result based on the condition:
    - If `n - k <= 1`, print `1` (Dominater can isolate island 1).
    - Else, print `n` (Everule can reach all islands).
  
This approach ensures that we correctly handle the bridge destruction to minimize the islands Everule can visit, based on the optimal strategy of disconnecting island 1 from others.
