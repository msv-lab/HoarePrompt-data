Alright, I have this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to think about what information I can get from these queries. Each query gives me a comparison between (p_a OR p_b) and (p_c OR p_d). Since the permutation is fixed, p_a, p_b, p_c, p_d are fixed but unknown to me.

My goal is to find the pair with the maximum XOR. XOR is maximized when the bits of the two numbers are as different as possible. So, probably, I need to find the two numbers that differ the most in their bit patterns.

But how can I use the OR operation to gather information about the values of p_i?

One idea is to try to find the maximum value in the permutation, because the maximum XOR might involve the maximum and minimum values or something like that.

Wait, actually, in binary numbers, the maximum XOR between two numbers occurs when one number is the bitwise complement of the other. But since we're dealing with numbers from 0 to n-1, which might not include complements, I need to think differently.

Maybe I should consider the bits one by one, starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, and try to determine the values of p_i bit by bit.

But that seems complicated. Let's see what the provided program does and try to understand its logic.

Looking at the program:

1. It reads the number of test cases t.

2. For each test case:

a. Reads n.

b. Initializes mak to 0.

c. For i from 1 to n-1:

i. Asks a query: ? mak mak i i

ii. Depending on the response, updates mak to i if p_mak OR p_mak < p_i OR p_i

d. Sets mak2 to the final value of mak.

e. Initializes pans as an empty list.

f. For i from 0 to n-1:

i. Asks a query: ? mak mak2 i mak2

ii. If the response is '<', sets mak to i and sets pans to [i]

iii. If the response is '=', appends i to pans

g. Sets mak to 0.

h. For i from 1 to len(pans)-1:

i. Asks a query: ? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]

ii. If the response is '>', sets mak to i

i. Prints: ! mak2 pans[mak]

So, let's try to understand this step by step.

First loop:

- It's trying to find the index mak that has the maximum p_i OR p_i, which is just p_i since p_i OR p_i is p_i.

- So, it's finding the index with the maximum p_i.

Second part:

- It sets mak2 to this maximum index.

- Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, it compares (p_mak OR p_mak2) with (p_i OR p_mak2).

- If p_mak OR p_mak2 < p_i OR p_mak2, it updates mak to i and sets pans to [i]

- If p_mak OR p_mak2 == p_i OR p_mak2, it appends i to pans

- So, it's collecting indices i where p_i OR p_mak2 is either equal to or greater than p_mak OR p_mak2.

- Then, among these pans, it finds the one with the maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

- Finally, it prints mak2 and the index with the maximum p_pans OR p_pans among pans.

Wait, is this aimed at finding the pair with maximum XOR?

I need to think about the properties of OR and XOR.

Given that p_i are unique integers from 0 to n-1, and we need to maximize p_i XOR p_j.

I recall that for two numbers, their XOR is maximized when their bits are as different as possible.

But how does OR help in determining this?

Let me think differently. Maybe the approach is to find the two numbers that are farthest apart in terms of their binary representations.

But I need to see if the provided queries can help in achieving that.

Looking back at the provided program:

- First, it finds the index mak with the maximum p_i.

- Then, it compares p_mak OR p_mak2 with p_i OR p_mak2 for each i.

- Wait, mak and mak2 are both the same index initially, since mak2 is set to mak.

Wait, no. Let's see:

- mak is initialized to 0.

- Then, for i from 1 to n-1, it compares p_mak OR p_mak with p_i OR p_i.

- If p_mak OR p_mak < p_i OR p_i, it sets mak to i.

- Since p_mak OR p_mak is p_mak, and p_i OR p_i is p_i, it's just finding the maximum p_i.

- So, mak is set to the index with the maximum p_i.

- Then, mak2 is set to mak.

- Then, for each i from 0 to n-1, it compares p_mak OR p_mak2 with p_i OR p_mak2.

- But mak and mak2 are the same index, so p_mak OR p_mak2 is p_mak OR p_mak, which is p_mak.

- So, it's comparing p_mak with p_i OR p_mak2.

- If p_mak < p_i OR p_mak2, it sets mak to i and sets pans to [i]

- Else if p_mak == p_i OR p_mak2, it appends i to pans.

- Then, among these pans, it finds the one with the maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

- Finally, it prints mak2 and this index.

This seems convoluted. I need to see if this approach can lead to finding the pair with maximum XOR.

Let me consider a small example.

Suppose n=4, and p = [0,3,1,2]

So, p in binary:

0 - 000

3 - 011

1 - 001

2 - 010

The maximum XOR would be between 1 and 2, which is 3.

Wait, no: 1 XOR 2 is 3, 0 XOR 3 is 3, 0 XOR 2 is 2, 0 XOR 1 is 1, 3 XOR 1 is 2, 3 XOR 2 is 1.

So, maximum XOR is 3, achieved by (0,3) and (1,2).

In the example provided in the problem, the program outputs ! 3 2, which is correct.

Let's see how the program arrives at this.

First loop:

- mak starts at 0.

- Compare p_0 OR p_0 (=0) with p_1 OR p_1 (=3). Since 0 < 3, set mak to 1.

- Then compare p_1 OR p_1 (=3) with p_2 OR p_2 (=1). 3 > 1, so mak remains 1.

- Then compare p_1 OR p_1 (=3) with p_3 OR p_3 (=2). 3 > 2, so mak remains 1.

- So, mak = 1, which is p_1 = 3, the maximum p_i.

- Set mak2 = 1.

- Now, for each i from 0 to 3:

- Compare p_mak OR p_mak2 = p_1 OR p_1 = 3 with p_i OR p_mak2 = p_i OR 3.

- For i=0: p_0 OR p_1 = 0 OR 3 = 3. So, 3 == 3, append 0 to pans.

- For i=1: p_1 OR p_1 = 3 OR 3 = 3. So, 3 == 3, append 1 to pans.

- For i=2: p_2 OR p_1 = 1 OR 3 = 3. So, 3 == 3, append 2 to pans.

- For i=3: p_3 OR p_1 = 2 OR 3 = 3. So, 3 == 3, append 3 to pans.

- So, pans = [0,1,2,3]

- Now, find among pans the one with maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

- p_0 OR p_0 = 0

- p_1 OR p_1 = 3

- p_2 OR p_2 = 1

- p_3 OR p_3 = 2

- So, maximum is p_1 OR p_1 = 3.

- So, mak = 1

- Print ! 1 1, but in the example, it prints !3 2. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the example, it prints !3 2 after some queries. Maybe there's something wrong in my simulation.

Wait, in the example interaction:

- n=4

- ? 0 2 3 1 -> < (meaning p_0 OR p_2 = 0 OR 1 =1 < p_3 OR p_1 = 2 OR 3 =3)

- ? 1 1 2 3 -> = (p_1 OR p_1 =3 == p_2 OR p_3 =3)

- ? 1 2 0 3 -> > (p_1 OR p_2 =3 OR 1=3 > p_0 OR p_3 =0 OR 2=2)

- !3 2

So, perhaps the program is different from what I thought.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the code again carefully.

Looking back at the code:

- First loop: find mak as index with maximum p_i.

- Then set mak2 = mak.

- Then, for each i, ask ? mak mak2 i mak2, which is ? mak mak i mak.

- In the example, n=4, mak=1 (p_1=3), mak2=1.

- So, for i=0: ?1 1 0 1 -> p1 OR p1 =3, p0 OR p1 =0 OR 3=3 -> =

- for i=1: ?1 1 1 1 -> p1 OR p1 =3, p1 OR p1=3 -> =

- for i=2: ?1 1 2 1 -> p1 OR p1=3, p2 OR p1=1 OR 3=3 -> =

- for i=3: ?1 1 3 1 -> p1 OR p1=3, p3 OR p1=2 OR 3=3 -> =

- So, pans=[0,1,2,3]

- Then, find among pans the one with maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

- So, p0 OR p0=0, p1 OR p1=3, p2 OR p2=1, p3 OR p3=2 -> maximum is p1 OR p1=3.

- So, mak=1

- Print !1 1

But in the example, it prints !3 2. So perhaps there's something wrong in my simulation or understanding.

Wait, maybe the program is different. Let's check the code again.

Wait, in the code, after setting mak2 = mak, it does:

for i in range(n):

print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)

Which, with mak=1 and mak2=1, would be ?1 1 i 1 for each i.

But in the example interaction, it shows ?0 2 3 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I misread the code.

Wait, the code has:

print('?', mak, mak, i, i)

Wait, no, in the first loop:

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', mak, mak, i, i)

But in the example interaction, it shows ?0 2 3 1, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the code I have.

Wait, the code provided is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

mak = 0

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', mak, mak, i, i)

sys.stdout.flush()

if str(input()) == '<':

mak = i

mak2 = mak

pans = []

for i in range(n):

print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)

sys.stdout.flush()

s = str(input())

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

mak = 0

for i in range(1, len(pans)):

print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])

sys.stdout.flush()

if str(input()) == '>':

mak = i

print('!', mak2, pans[mak])

sys.stdout.flush()

Wait, but in the example interaction, it shows:

?0 2 3 1

?1 1 2 3

?1 2 0 3

!3 2

This doesn't match the queries generated by the code above.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in transcribing the code.

Alternatively, maybe the code is different from what I think.

Wait, perhaps the second query is ?1 1 2 3, which corresponds to ?mak mak c d.

Wait, but according to the code, in the second loop, it's ?mak mak2 i mak2, which with mak=1 and mak2=1 and i varying, should be ?1 1 i 1.

But in the example interaction, it's ?1 1 2 3.

Wait, perhaps in the example, mak=1 and mak2=2, or something.

Wait, maybe I need to trace the execution step by step.

Let's try with n=4 and p=[0,3,1,2].

First loop:

mak=0

for i=1 to 3:

?0 0 1 1 -> p0 OR p0 =0 < p1 OR p1=3 -> '<' -> mak=1

?1 1 2 2 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p2 OR p2=1 -> '>'

?1 1 3 3 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p3 OR p3=2 -> '>'

So, mak=1

Set mak2=1

Then, for i=0 to 3:

?1 1 0 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p0 OR p1=0 OR 3=3 -> '=' -> pans=[0]

?1 1 1 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p1 OR p1=3 -> '=' -> pans=[0,1]

?1 1 2 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p2 OR p1=1 OR 3=3 -> '=' -> pans=[0,1,2]

?1 1 3 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p3 OR p1=2 OR 3=3 -> '=' -> pans=[0,1,2,3]

Then, among pans=[0,1,2,3], find the one with maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

?0 0 1 1 -> p0 OR p0=0 < p1 OR p1=3 -> '>' -> mak=1

?1 1 2 2 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p2 OR p2=1 -> '>'

?1 1 3 3 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p3 OR p3=2 -> '>'

So, mak=1

Then, print !1 1

But in the example, it prints !3 2. So perhaps there's a mistake in my simulation or in the code.

Wait, maybe the code is different. Let's check the code again.

Wait, in the code, the second loop is:

for i in range(n):

print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)

sys.stdout.flush()

s = str(input())

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

Given that mak=1 and mak2=1, so it's ?1 1 i 1 for each i.

From the example, p1 OR p1=3, and p_i OR p1:

p0 OR p1=0 OR 3=3 -> '='

p1 OR p1=3 == p1 OR p1=3 -> '='

p2 OR p1=1 OR 3=3 == p1 OR p1=3 -> '='

p3 OR p1=2 OR 3=3 == p1 OR p1=3 -> '='

So, pans=[0,1,2,3]

Then, find among pans the one with maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

?0 0 1 1 -> p0 OR p0=0 < p1 OR p1=3 -> '>' -> mak=1

?1 1 2 2 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p2 OR p2=1 -> '>'

?1 1 3 3 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p3 OR p3=2 -> '>'

So, mak=1

Then, print !1 1

But in the example, it prints !3 2. So perhaps there's a discrepancy.

Wait, maybe the code is different from what I think. Let's check again.

Looking back at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

mak = 0

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', mak, mak, i, i)

sys.stdout.flush()

if str(input()) == '<':

mak = i

mak2 = mak

pans = []

for i in range(n):

print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)

sys.stdout.flush()

s = str(input())

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

mak = 0

for i in range(1, len(pans)):

print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])

sys.stdout.flush()

if str(input()) == '>':

mak = i

print('!', mak2, pans[mak])

sys.stdout.flush()

Wait, but in the example, it prints !3 2, which corresponds to i=3 and j=2.

But according to my simulation, it should print !1 1.

Perhaps there's a mistake in my simulation.

Wait, maybe I misread the code.

Looking again:

After setting mak2 = mak, which is 1.

Then, for i in range(n):

print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)

So, ?1 1 i 1

Then, if '<', set mak = i and pans = [i]

elif '=', append i to pans

So, for i=0:

?1 1 0 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p0 OR p1=0 OR 3=3 -> '>' (not '<' or '=')

Wait, but in the code, it only checks for '<' or '=', but what if it's '>'?

Wait, in the code, it only has:

if s == '<':

mak = i

pans = [i]

elif s == '=':

pans.append(i)

So, if s == '>', it does nothing.

In my earlier simulation, for i=0:

?1 1 0 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p0 OR p1=3 -> '>' -> do nothing

for i=1:

?1 1 1 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p1 OR p1=3 -> '=' -> pans.append(1)

for i=2:

?1 1 2 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p2 OR p1=3 -> '=' -> pans.append(2)

for i=3:

?1 1 3 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p3 OR p1=3 -> '=' -> pans.append(3)

So, pans=[1,2,3]

Then, find among pans the one with maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

?1 1 2 2 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p2 OR p2=1 -> '>' -> mak=2

?2 2 3 3 -> p2 OR p2=1 < p3 OR p3=2 -> '<' -> no change

So, mak=2

Then, print !1 2

But in the example, it's !3 2.

Hmm, discrepancy again.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the simulation.

Looking back at the example interaction:

Input:

2

4

<

=

>

2

Output:

?0 2 3 1

<

?1 1 2 3

=

?1 2 0 3

>

!3 2

!0 1

Wait, perhaps the code is different from what I thought.

Wait, maybe the code is not matching the simulation.

Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, but my simulation has errors.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let's consider that the goal is to find two numbers with maximum XOR.

I recall that for two numbers, their XOR is maximized when their binary representations differ as much as possible.

So, to maximize p_i XOR p_j, we need p_i and p_j to have as many differing bits as possible, starting from the most significant bit.

Perhaps, I can determine the highest bit where p_i and p_j differ, and so on, for each bit position.

But that seems complicated with the given query model.

Looking back at the provided program, maybe it's trying to find the two maximum values in the permutation, assuming that they will have a high XOR.

But in the example, p= [0,3,1,2], and the maximum XOR is achieved by (0,3) or (1,2), both giving 3.

The program seems to be finding the maximum p_i, which is 3, and then finding another p_j such that p_j OR p_mak is maximized.

But in this case, p_j OR 3 is maximized, which for p_j=2 is 3, and for p_j=1 is 3, and for p_j=0 is 3.

So, it seems that all p_j OR 3 are equal to 3.

Then, among these, it selects the one with the maximum p_j OR p_j, which is p_j=1 OR 1=1, p_j=2 OR 2=2, p_j=0 OR 0=0.

So, the maximum is p_j=2 OR 2=2.

Hence, it selects j=2, and i=mak2=3.

So, it prints !3 2.

Wait, but p_3=2 and p_2=1, and 2 XOR 1=3, which is correct.

Alternatively, p_0=0 and p_3=2, 0 XOR 2=2, which is less.

Similarly, p_1=3 and p_2=1, 3 XOR 1=2.

Wait, no, 3 XOR 1 is 2, but in the earlier simulation, pans included 0,1,2,3, and among them, p_3 OR p_3=2, p_1 OR p_1=3, p_2 OR p_2=2, p_0 OR p_0=0.

Wait, no, in the first loop, mak=1 (p_1=3), then mak2=1.

Then, for i in range(n):

?1 1 i 1

So, for i=0:

?1 1 0 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p0 OR p1=0 OR 3=3 -> '>' -> do nothing

for i=1:

?1 1 1 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p1 OR p1=3 -> '=' -> pans.append(1)

for i=2:

?1 1 2 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p2 OR p1=1 OR 3=3 -> '=' -> pans.append(2)

for i=3:

?1 1 3 1 -> p1 OR p1=3 == p3 OR p1=2 OR 3=3 -> '=' -> pans.append(3)

So, pans=[1,2,3]

Then, among pans, find the one with maximum p_pans OR p_pans.

?1 1 2 2 -> p1 OR p1=3 > p2 OR p2=1 -> '>' -> mak=2

?2 2 3 3 -> p2 OR p2=1 < p3 OR p3=2 -> '<' -> no change

So, mak=2

Then, print !1 2, but in the example, it's !3 2.

Wait, perhaps mak2 is being used differently.

Looking back at the code:

mak2 = mak

...

print('!', mak2, pans[mak])

So, mak2=1, and pans[mak]=2, so it should print !1 2, but in the example, it's !3 2.

There's inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps mak2 is being updated somewhere else.

Wait, no, mak2 is set only once to mak after the first loop.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in the example.

Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, and the example is just a sample interaction with specific queries.

Perhaps, in general, the code is correct.

Let me think about the overall approach.

First, it finds the index mak with the maximum p_i.

Then, it collects indices i where p_mak OR p_mak2 == p_i OR p_mak2.

Then, among these, it selects the one with the maximum p_i OR p_i.

Finally, it prints mak2 and this index.

Is this guaranteed to find a pair with maximum XOR?

Not sure.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, p=[0,1,2]

Binary:

0 - 00

1 - 01

2 - 10

Maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, which is 3.

Let's see what the program does.

First loop:

mak=0

for i=1
