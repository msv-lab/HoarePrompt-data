Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 5x3=15 cells per screen. There are two types of application icons: some are 1x1 and others are 2x2. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up a square of four cells. Each cell can be occupied by only one icon, obviously.

The task is to figure out the minimum number of screens needed to fit all the icons, given the numbers of each type of application.

First, I need to understand how to maximize the usage of each screen to minimize the total number of screens used. Since the 2x2 icons take up more space, I should prioritize placing them first.

Let me think about the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns, so:

Row 1: Cells 1, 2, 3

Row 2: Cells 4, 5, 6

Row 3: Cells 7, 8, 9

Row 4: Cells 10, 11, 12

Row 5: Cells 13, 14, 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four consecutive cells in a square. For example, cells 1,2,4,5 or cells 2,3,5,6, etc. But given the grid's dimensions, not all combinations are possible. I need to see how many 2x2 icons can fit into a single screen.

Looking at the grid, in a 5x3 grid, how many non-overlapping 2x2 squares can we place?

Let's see:

- In row 1 and 2, we can place one 2x2 square covering cells 1,2,4,5.

- Then in row 3 and 4, another 2x2 square covering cells 7,8,10,11.

- And in row 4 and 5, another one covering cells 10,11,13,14.

Wait, but rows 4 and 5 overlap with the previous 2x2 square. So, perhaps it's better to place them without overlapping.

Actually, in a 5x3 grid, the maximum number of non-overlapping 2x2 squares we can place is two per screen. For example:

- First 2x2: cells 1,2,4,5

- Second 2x2: cells 7,8,10,11

That uses up 8 cells, leaving 7 cells free for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, another arrangement might allow for more 2x2 squares, but I don't think so in this grid size.

Wait, let's try another arrangement:

- First 2x2: cells 2,3,5,6

- Second 2x2: cells 5,6,8,9

- Third 2x2: cells 8,9,11,12

- Fourth 2x2: cells 11,12,14,15

But wait, these overlapping arrangements aren't possible because the squares overlap. Each square must be non-overlapping.

So, in reality, only two 2x2 squares can fit into a single 5x3 screen without overlapping.

Each 2x2 square takes 4 cells, so two of them take 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if we place only one 2x2 square, it takes 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Or, if we place no 2x2 squares, all 15 cells can be used for 1x1 icons.

Now, the goal is to minimize the number of screens used, given the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

To minimize screens, we should maximize the use of each screen, meaning prioritize placing as many 2x2 icons as possible, since they take more space.

But, we also need to consider how the 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining cells.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let y be the number of 2x2 icons, and x be the number of 1x1 icons.

Each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons, since 2*4 + 7*1 = 8 + 7 = 15 cells.

Alternatively, if we place only one 2x2 icon, we can place up to eleven 1x1 icons, since 1*4 + 11*1 = 4 + 11 = 15 cells.

Or, if we place no 2x2 icons, we can place up to fifteen 1x1 icons per screen.

So, to minimize the number of screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons placed, but also ensure that the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons.

Wait, but each screen can only hold up to two 2x2 icons, as per the earlier analysis.

So, for each screen, the possible combinations are:

- Two 2x2 icons and seven 1x1 icons

- One 2x2 icon and eleven 1x1 icons

- No 2x2 icons and fifteen 1x1 icons

Our aim is to distribute y 2x2 icons and x 1x1 icons across screens, minimizing the number of screens used, while respecting the above constraints.

To minimize screens, we should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, which is two per screen.

So, an initial approach could be to calculate the number of screens needed based on the number of 2x2 icons.

Let z be the number of screens needed.

Then, since each screen can hold up to two 2x2 icons, the minimum z based on y would be ceil(y / 2).

But, we also need to ensure that the remaining cells can accommodate the x 1x1 icons.

Each screen provides:

- If it has two 2x2 icons: 15 - 8 = 7 cells for 1x1 icons

- If it has one 2x2 icon: 15 - 4 = 11 cells for 1x1 icons

- If it has no 2x2 icons: 15 cells for 1x1 icons

So, for z screens, if we place two 2x2 icons on as many screens as possible, the remaining screens can have one or zero 2x2 icons.

Wait, maybe it's better to place two 2x2 icons on as many screens as possible, then place one 2x2 icon on another screen if y is odd, and then use the remaining screens only for 1x1 icons.

But, we need to make sure that the total number of 1x1 icons can be accommodated in the remaining cells of these screens.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let z = ceil(y / 2), which is the minimum number of screens needed to place all y 2x2 icons.

Then, the total number of cells available for 1x1 icons in these z screens is:

- For floors(y / 2) screens: two 2x2 icons each, leaving 7 cells per screen

- For the remaining screen if y is odd: one 2x2 icon, leaving 11 cells

So, total available cells for 1x1 icons is:

If y is even:

z = y / 2

available = z * 7

If y is odd:

z = (y + 1) / 2

available = (z - 1) * 7 + 11

Now, we need to check if available >= x.

If yes, then z screens are sufficient.

If not, we need to add more screens to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.

The remaining 1x1 icons would be x - available.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - available) / 15).

Therefore, total screens needed z_total = z + ceil((x - available) / 15)

But, we need to be careful when available < x.

Let me try to implement this logic step by step.

First, calculate z = ceil(y / 2)

Then, calculate available cells for 1x1 icons based on z and y.

If y is even:

available = z * 7

If y is odd:

available = (z - 1) * 7 + 11

Then, if available >= x, then z screens are sufficient.

Else, need to add ceil((x - available) / 15) more screens.

So, z_total = z + ceil((x - available) / 15)

Now, let's see if this matches the given code.

Looking at the provided code:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

z = (y + 1) // 2

m = 15 * z - y * 4

if m < x:

z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15

print(z)

So, in the code:

z = (y + 1) // 2 which is ceil(y / 2)

Then, m = 15 * z - y * 4

Wait, 15 * z is the total cells in z screens.

y * 4 is the total cells occupied by y 2x2 icons.

So, m = total cells in z screens minus cells occupied by y 2x2 icons.

Which should be the available cells for 1x1 icons.

But in my earlier calculation, for z screens:

If y is even:

available = z * 7

If y is odd:

available = (z - 1) * 7 + 11

But in the code, m = 15 * z - y * 4

Let's see if this matches.

If y is even:

y = 2k

z = k

m = 15 * k - 2k * 4 = 15k - 8k = 7k

Which matches available = z * 7 = k * 7

If y is odd:

y = 2k + 1

z = k + 1

m = 15 * (k + 1) - (2k + 1) * 4 = 15k + 15 - 8k - 4 = 7k + 11

Which matches available = (z - 1) * 7 + 11 = k * 7 + 11

So, m correctly calculates the available cells for 1x1 icons.

Then, if m < x, meaning available cells are less than required x 1x1 icons.

So, need to add more screens.

The code does:

z = z + (x - m + 14) // 15

Wait, that's equivalent to ceil((x - m) / 15)

Because (x - m + 14) // 15 is the same as ceil((x - m) / 15)

Since ceil division can be implemented as (num + den - 1) // den

So, (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15 = ceil((x - m) / 15)

But in the code, it's (x - m + 14) // 15, which seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, no, in Python, for non-negative numbers, ceil(a/b) can be written as (a + b - 1) // b

So, ceil((x - m)/15) = (x - m + 14) // 15

Assuming x - m >= 0, which it should be since m < x.

So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the code correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed.

Hence, the program is correct.
