Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Farmer John has a permutation p of numbers from 0 to n-1, and he gives Bessie an array a, where each a_i is calculated as the MEX of the first i elements of p minus p_i. My job is to reconstruct the permutation p from the array a.

First, I need to understand what MEX means. MEX stands for Minimum EXcluded number, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the given array. For example, MEX of [1,2,3] is 0 because 0 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the array. MEX of [3,1,0] is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is missing.

So, for each position i in the permutation p, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i. I need to find p given a.

The problem says that there is at least one valid p for the given a, so I don't have to worry about invalid inputs.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since p is a permutation, each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once in p. Also, MEX of the first i elements of p will be a number from 0 to i, because as we add more elements, the MEX can only increase or stay the same.

Let me consider the first element p_1. The MEX of p_1 alone is the smallest non-negative integer not equal to p_1. So, if p_1 is 0, MEX is 1; if p_1 is 1, MEX is 0; if p_1 is 2, MEX is 0, and so on.

Wait, no. Actually, MEX of a single element is 0 if 0 is not in the array, otherwise it's the smallest missing integer.

Wait, in the example, MEX(0) is 1, because 0 is present, so the smallest missing is 1. MEX(0,1) is 2, since 0 and 1 are present, so next is 2. But in the problem, a_i = MEX(p_1 to p_i) - p_i.

In the first test case, a = [1,1,-2,1,2], and p = [0,1,4,2,3].

Let's verify:

For i=1: MEX(0) = 1, a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1

For i=2: MEX(0,1) = 2, a_2 = 2 - 1 = 1

For i=3: MEX(0,1,4) = 2, a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2

For i=4: MEX(0,1,4,2) = 3, a_4 = 3 - 2 = 1

For i=5: MEX(0,1,4,2,3) = 5, a_5 = 5 - 3 = 2

Wait, but in the example, a_5 is 2, which matches 5 - 3 = 2.

So, the MEX is increasing as we add more elements, and sometimes it stays the same.

I need to find p from a.

Let me think about how to reconstruct p.

I can iterate through the array a and try to determine p_i based on a_i and the MEX up to that point.

Let me denote mex_i as MEX of p_1 to p_i.

From the definition, a_i = mex_i - p_i, so p_i = mex_i - a_i.

But I don't know mex_i directly; I need to find it based on previous p's.

Wait, but mex_i is the MEX of p_1 to p_i, which depends on the p's up to i.

This seems recursive.

Maybe I can keep track of the MEX as I build p.

Let me try to build p step by step.

Initialize an empty list for p.

Initialize a set to keep track of used numbers, since p is a permutation.

Initialize mex as 0.

For each i from 1 to n:

- Calculate p_i = mex - a_i

- Add p_i to p

- If p_i == mex:

- mex += 1

- Mark p_i as used

Wait, but in the first test case:

a = [1,1,-2,1,2]

p = [0,1,4,2,3]

For i=1:

a_1 = 1

p_1 = mex - a_1 = 0 - 1 = -1, but p_1 is 0.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Maybe my approach is wrong.

Let me think differently.

From a_i = mex_i - p_i, so p_i = mex_i - a_i.

But I need to find mex_i.

Wait, in the first step, for i=1, p_1 is some number, and mex_1 is the MEX of p_1.

If p_1 = 0, then mex_1 = 1.

If p_1 = 1, then mex_1 = 0.

If p_1 = 2, then mex_1 = 0, etc.

So, for i=1, a_1 = mex_1 - p_1.

Similarly, for i=2, a_2 = mex_2 - p_2, and mex_2 is the MEX of p_1 and p_2.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can keep track of the available numbers and the MEX.

Let me consider that MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in p_1 to p_i.

So, as I build p, I can keep track of which numbers have been used.

Let me try to simulate the first test case.

Given a = [1,1,-2,1,2], n=5.

I need to find p = [0,1,4,2,3].

Let's see:

For i=1:

a_1 = 1

p_1 = ?

mex_1 = MEX(p_1) = smallest non-negative integer not in [p_1]

So, if p_1 = 0, mex_1 = 1

If p_1 = 1, mex_1 = 0

If p_1 = 2, mex_1 = 0

Wait, but in the example, p_1 = 0, mex_1 = 1, a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1

So, p_1 = mex_1 - a_1 = 1 - 1 = 0

Wait, that works.

For i=2:

a_2 = 1

p_2 = mex_2 - a_2

mex_2 = MEX(p_1, p_2) = MEX(0,1) = 2

So, p_2 = 2 - 1 = 1

Yes, matches the example.

For i=3:

a_3 = -2

p_3 = mex_3 - a_3

mex_3 = MEX(0,1,4) = 2

p_3 = 2 - (-2) = 4

Yes, matches the example.

For i=4:

a_4 = 1

p_4 = mex_4 - a_4

mex_4 = MEX(0,1,4,2) = 3

p_4 = 3 - 1 = 2

Yes.

For i=5:

a_5 = 2

p_5 = mex_5 - a_5

mex_5 = MEX(0,1,4,2,3) = 5

p_5 = 5 - 2 = 3

Yes.

So, in general, p_i = mex_i - a_i

And mex_i is the MEX of p_1 to p_i.

But I need to find p_i, and mex_i depends on p_i.

This seems circular.

How can I break this circular dependency?

Maybe I can iterate through the array and keep track of the MEX as I go.

Let me try to maintain a set of used numbers and keep track of the MEX.

Initialize used = set()

mex = 0

For each i from 1 to n:

Find p_i such that a_i = mex - p_i

So, p_i = mex - a_i

Add p_i to used

While mex in used:

mex += 1

This seems to work.

Let's test it with the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=5

a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize:

used = {}

mex=0

i=1:

p1 = 0 - 1 = -1

But p1 should be 0, as in the example.

Wait, this doesn't match.

Maybe I need to adjust.

Wait, perhaps I need to handle negative a_i differently.

Wait, in the first test case, a1=1, and p1=0.

So, p1 = mex - a1 => 0 = 0 - 1 => doesn't match.

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that mex_i is the MEX of p1 to pi.

I can iterate through the array and keep track of the used numbers.

At each step, calculate p_i = mex_i - a_i

Then, add p_i to the used set.

Then, update mex_i to be the smallest non-negative integer not in used.

Wait, but mex_i depends on p1 to pi, so I need to find a way to determine mex_i based on the used set up to i-1 and the current p_i.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the second test case.

n=5

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

p=[0,1,2,3,4]

Check:

a1 = MEX(0) - 0 =1 -0=1

a2 = MEX(0,1) -1=2-1=1

a3 = MEX(0,1,2)-2=3-2=1

a4 = MEX(0,1,2,3)-3=4-3=1

a5 = MEX(0,1,2,3,4)-4=5-4=1

Yes, matches the array a.

So, in this case, p is [0,1,2,3,4], and a is [1,1,1,1,1]

Now, third test case:

n=3

a=[-2,1,2]

p=[2,0,1]

Check:

a1 = MEX(2) -2 =0-2=-2

a2 = MEX(2,0)-0=1-0=1

a3 = MEX(2,0,1)-1=3-1=2

Yes, matches.

So, in this case, p1=2, p2=0, p3=1

Now, from the above examples, it seems that p_i = mex_i - a_i

And mex_i is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1 to pi.

But how to compute mex_i without knowing pi?

Maybe I can iterate through the array and for each position, compute p_i based on the current mex, and then update the mex accordingly.

Let me try to implement this step by step.

Initialize:

used = set()

mex = 0

For each i from 1 to n:

p_i = mex - a_i

used.add(p_i)

while mex in used:

mex +=1

This seems straightforward.

Let's test it with the first test case.

Test case 1:

n=5

a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize:

used={}

mex=0

i=1:

p1=0 -1= -1

But in the example, p1=0

Wait, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps MEX starts at 0, but in the first step, MEX is 1 when p1=0.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the initial mex.

Wait, in the first step, MEX of p1 is the smallest non-negative integer not in p1.

If p1=0, then MEX is 1.

If p1=1, MEX is 0.

If p1=2, MEX is 0.

But in the example, p1=0, MEX=1.

So, a1=1, which is MEX - p1 =1 -0=1.

So, p1 = MEX - a1 =1 -1=0

Yes, that works.

Wait, maybe my initial approach is correct.

Let me try again.

Initialize:

used={}

mex=0

i=1:

p1=mex - a1=0 -1=-1

But in the example, p1=0.

This doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the initial mex.

Wait, perhaps mex should be initialized to 0, but in the first step, MEX is actually determined by the first p1.

Wait, maybe I need to find p1 such that a1 = MEX(p1) - p1.

So, MEX(p1) is the smallest non-negative integer not equal to p1.

If p1=0, MEX=1

If p1=1, MEX=0

If p1=2, MEX=0

So, a1 can be 1 - p1.

Wait, but in the first test case, a1=1, so 1 = MEX(p1) - p1.

If p1=0, MEX=1, a1=1-0=1, which matches.

If p1=1, MEX=0, a1=0-1=-1, which doesn't match a1=1.

If p1=2, MEX=0, a1=0-2=-2, doesn't match.

So, p1 must be 0.

Similarly, for p2:

a2=1

p2=mex2 - a2

mex2 = MEX(p1,p2)

But p2=mex2 -1

But I don't know mex2 yet.

Wait, maybe I need to iterate and keep track of used numbers.

Let me try to implement the approach I thought earlier.

Initialize:

used={}

mex=0

For i=1 to n:

p_i = mex - a_i

used.add(p_i)

while mex in used:

mex +=1

Let's see for test case 1:

n=5

a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize:

used={}

mex=0

i=1:

p1=0 -1=-1

But p1 should be 0, as in the example.

Hmm, maybe this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that p_i is within 0 to n-1.

In the first test case, p1=0, p2=1, p3=4, p4=2, p5=3, all within 0 to 4.

But according to my approach, p1=-1, which is invalid.

So, my approach is flawed.

I need to adjust it.

Maybe I need to consider that p_i must be within 0 to n-1, and ensure that it's not already used.

Let me try to adjust the approach.

Initialize:

used=[False]*n

mex=0

For i=1 to n:

if a_i >0:

p_i = mex

used[p_i]=True

while used[mex]:

mex +=1

else:

p_i = mex - a_i

if p_i <0 or p_i >=n or used[p_i]:

# invalid, but the problem says there is at least one valid p

else:

used[p_i]=True

while used[mex]:

mex +=1

This seems more careful.

Let's test it with the first test case.

n=5

a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize:

used=[False]*5

mex=0

i=1:

a1=1 >0

p1=mex=0

used[0]=True

mex=1 (since 0 is used)

i=2:

a2=1 >0

p2=mex=1

used[1]=True

mex=2 (since 1 is used)

i=3:

a3=-2 <=0

p3=mex - a3 =2 - (-2)=4

used[4]=True

mex=2 (since 2 is not used yet)

Wait, but in the example, p3=4, which matches.

i=4:

a4=1 >0

p4=mex=2

used[2]=True

mex=3 (since 2 is used)

i=5:

a5=2 >0

p5=mex=3

used[3]=True

mex=4

So, p=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the example.

Great, this seems to work.

Let me test it with the second test case.

n=5

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Initialize:

used=[False]*5

mex=0

i=1:

a1=1 >0

p1=0

used[0]=True

mex=1

i=2:

a2=1 >0

p2=1

used[1]=True

mex=2

i=3:

a3=1 >0

p3=2

used[2]=True

mex=3

i=4:

a4=1 >0

p4=3

used[3]=True

mex=4

i=5:

a5=1 >0

p5=4

used[4]=True

mex=5

So, p=[0,1,2,3,4], which matches the second test case.

Now, third test case:

n=3

a=[-2,1,2]

Initialize:

used=[False]*3

mex=0

i=1:

a1=-2 <=0

p1=mex - a1 =0 - (-2)=2

used[2]=True

mex=0 (since 0 is not used yet)

i=2:

a2=1 >0

p2=mex=0

used[0]=True

mex=1

i=3:

a3=2 >0

p3=mex=1

used[1]=True

mex=2

So, p=[2,0,1], which matches the third test case.

Perfect.

So, the approach is:

- Initialize a used array of size n with all False.

- Initialize mex=0.

- For each position i from 1 to n:

- If a_i >0, then p_i = mex, and set used[p_i]=True, then increment mex until mex is not used.

- Else (a_i <=0), then p_i = mex - a_i, check if p_i is within 0 to n-1 and not used, set used[p_i]=True, then increment mex until mex is not used.

- Output p.

This seems to work.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

n = int(input())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

mex = []

minn = 0

used = {}

for i in range(n):

if arr[i] > 0:

mex.append(minn)

used[minn] = True

while minn in used:

minn += 1

else:

mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))

used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True

for itm in mex:

print(itm, end=' ')

print()

Let's analyze this.

- It reads t test cases, and for each, calls func_1.

- In func_1:

- Reads n and arr.

- Initializes mex as an empty list, minn=0, used as an empty dict.

- Loops through i from 0 to n-1:

- If arr[i] >0:

- appends minn to mex

- sets used[minn]=True

- increments minn while minn is in used

- else:

- appends abs(arr[i] - minn) to mex

- sets used[abs(arr[i] - minn)]=True

- Finally, prints the mex list.

Wait, but according to my earlier approach, I need to construct p, not mex.

In the problem, p is the permutation to be found, and mex is an intermediate value.

But in this code, it's constructing mex, not p.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion.

Looking back, the problem asks to output p, not mex.

But in the code, it's outputting mex.

Wait, that's incorrect.

The code is outputting mex, but we need to output p.

So, this is a mistake.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, and mex is actually p.

Let me check with the first test case.

In the first test case, p should be [0,1,4,2,3], but according to the code, it's outputting mex, which is being built in the loop.

Wait, in the code, mex is being built as follows:

- For arr[i] >0, mex.append(minn), and used[minn]=True, then increment minn until minn is not used.

- For arr[i] <=0, mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn)), and used[abs(arr[i] - minn)]=True.

Wait, this doesn't seem to match the correct approach.

In my earlier approach, for arr[i]>0, p_i = minn, and then used[p_i]=True, then increment mex until mex is not used.

For arr[i]<=0, p_i = minn - arr[i], and used[p_i]=True, then increment mex until mex is not used.

But in the code, it's appending minn to mex when arr[i]>0, and appending abs(arr[i]-minn) when arr[i]<=0.

Wait, perhaps mex in the code is actually p.

Let me check with the first test case.

n=5

a=[1,1,-2,1,2]

Initialize:

mex=[]

minn=0

used={}

i=0:

arr[0]=1 >0

mex.append(0)

used[0]=True

while 0 in used: minn=1

i=1:

arr[1]=1 >0

mex.append(1)

used[1]=True

while 1 in used: minn=2

i=2:

arr[2]=-2 <=0

mex.append(abs(-2 - 2)=4)

used[4]=True

while 2 in used: minn=3 (but 2 is not used, minn remains 2)

i=3:

arr[3]=1 >0

mex.append(2)

used[2]=True

while 2 in used: minn=3

i=4:

arr[4]=2 >0

mex.append(3)

used[3]=True

while 3 in used: minn=4

So, mex=[0,1,4,2,3], which matches the example p.

Wait, so actually, in the code, mex is being built as p.

But it's printing mex, which is p.

So, perhaps it's correct, but the variable name is misleading.

Let me verify.

In the code, mex is actually p.

So, in the loop:

- if arr[i]>0:

p_i = minn

used[p_i]=True

increment minn until minn is not used.

- else:

p_i = abs(arr[i] - minn)

used[p_i]=True

increment minn until minn is not used.

Wait, but abs(arr[i] - minn) may not be equal to minn - arr[i], since arr[i] can be negative.

In the first approach, for arr[i]<=0, p_i = minn - arr[i]

But in the code, it's p_i = abs(arr[i] - minn)

Wait, that's different.

In the first test case, for i=2, arr[2]=-2 <=0

p2 = abs(-2 - 2) = 4

Which matches the example.

But in general, minn - arr[i] would be minn - (negative number) = minn + positive number, which could be large.

While abs(arr[i] - minn) is taking the absolute difference.

Wait, but in the first approach, p_i = minn - arr[i], and in the code, p_i = abs(arr[i] - minn)

These are different unless arr[i] <=0 and minn >= arr[i]

Wait, no, abs(arr[i] - minn) is not necessarily equal to minn - arr[i]

For example, if arr[i]=1 and minn=0, abs(1-0)=1, but minn - arr[i]=0-1=-1

Which are different.

So, the code is using abs(arr[i] - minn), which may not be correct.

But in the first test case, it worked because arr[i]=-2 and minn=2, so abs(-2-2)=4, which is correct.

In the second test case:

n=5

a=[1,1,1,1,1]

Initialize:

mex=[]

minn=0

used={}

i=0:

arr[0]=1>0

mex.append(0)

used[0]=True

while 0 in used: minn=1

i=1:

arr[1]=1>0

mex.append(1)

used[1]=True

while 1 in used: minn=2

i=2:

arr[2]=1>0

mex.append(2)

used[2]=True

while 2 in used: minn=3

i=3:

arr[3]=1>0

mex.append(3)

used[3]=True

while 3 in used: minn=4

i=4:

arr[4]=1>0

mex.append(4)

used[4]=True

while 4 in used: minn=5

So, mex=[0,1,2,3,4], which matches the second test case.

In the third test case:

n=3

a=[-2,1,2]

Initialize:

mex=[]

minn=0

used={}

i=0:

arr[0]=-2<=0

mex.append(abs(-2 - 0)=2)

used[2]=True

while minn=0 in used? No, minn remains 0

i=1:

arr[1]=1>0

mex.append(0)

used[0]=True

while 0 in used: minn=1

i=2:

arr[2]=2>0

mex.append(1)

used[1]=True

while 1 in used: minn=2

So, mex=[2,0,1], which matches the third test case.

So, even though the code uses abs(arr[i] - minn), it seems to work for the given test cases.

But is this correct in general?

Let me consider a different test case.

Suppose n=2

a=[1, -1]

According to the problem, a_i = MEX(p1 to pi) - p_i

Let's find p.

Suppose p=[0,1]

Then:

a1 = MEX(0)=1 -0=1

a2 = MEX(0,1)=2 -1=1

But a=[1,-1], so doesn't match.

Another p=[1,0]

a1 = MEX(1)=0 -1=-1

a2 = MEX(1,0)=2 -0=2

But a=[-1,2], which matches a=[1,-1] only if a=[-1,2], but given a=[1,-1]

Wait, the problem says that for the given a, there is at least one valid p.

So, for a=[1,-1], is there a p?

Wait, with p=[0,1], a=[1,1]

With p=[1,0], a=[-1,2]

So, for a=[1,-1], no valid p exists, but the problem says that inputs are valid and have at least one p.

So, perhaps a=[1,-1] is not a valid input according to the problem.

Hence, in the code, using abs(arr[i] - minn) works for valid a's.

But is it correct in general?

In the correct approach, for arr[i]<=0, p_i = minn - arr[i]

In the code, p_i = abs(arr[i] - minn)

But abs(arr[i] - minn) is equal to minn - arr[i] when arr[i] <= minn.

Since arr[i] can be negative (as low as -n), and minn starts from 0 and increases, minn - arr[i] would be minn + absolute value of arr[i], which is positive.

But in the code, it's using abs(arr[i] - minn), which is same as minn - arr[i] if arr[i] <= minn.

But in the case where arr[i] > minn, abs(arr[i] - minn) = arr[i] - minn, which may not be equal to minn - arr[i].

Wait, but according to the problem constraints, a_i >= -n.

And p_i >=0 and <=n-1.

Wait, but in the code, when arr[i]<=0, p_i = abs(arr[i] - minn)

But minn starts from 0 and increases, so if arr[i]<=0, arr[i] <= minn for minn >=0.

Hence, abs(arr[i] - minn) = minn - arr[i], which is what the correct approach suggests.

Therefore, in this case, abs(arr[i] - minn) is equal to minn - arr[i].

Hence, the code is correct.

So, in the code, when arr[i]>0, p_i = minn, and used[p_i]=True, then minn is incremented until it's not used.

When arr[i]<=0, p_i = minn - arr[i], and used[p_i]=True, then minn is incremented until it's not used.

And since minn - arr[i] is equal to abs(arr[i] - minn) when arr[i]<=0 and minn>=0, the code is correct.

Hence, the code correctly implements the logic to reconstruct p from a.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1 based on a given array `a`, where each element `a_i` is calculated as the MEX of the first `i` elements of the permutation minus the `i`-th element of the permutation.

## Approach
1. **Understanding MEX**: MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - We maintain a variable `minn` to track the current MEX value.
   - We use a dictionary `used` to keep track of the numbers already used in the permutation.
   - For each element in the array `a`:
     - If `a_i` is greater than 0, the corresponding permutation value `p_i` is set to the current `minn`, and `minn` is incremented until it finds a value not used yet.
     - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, `p_i` is set to `abs(a_i - minn)`, ensuring it's a valid unused value, and then `minn` is adjusted accordingly.

## Solution Code
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0

## Explanation
- **Initialization**: 
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read `n` and the array `a`.
- **Permutation Construction**:
  - For each `a_i` in `a`:
    - If `a_i` > 0, append the current `minn` to the permutation list `mex`, mark it as used, and increment `minn` until it finds a unused value.
    - If `a_i` <= 0, calculate `p_i` as `abs(a_i - minn)`, mark it as used, and adjust `minn` accordingly.
- **Output**:
  - Print the constructed permutation for each test case.

This approach ensures that the permutation is correctly reconstructed based on the given array `a` and the MEX operations.
