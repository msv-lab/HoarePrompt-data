Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Polycarp has two favorite integers, x and y, and he has an array of numbers. He considers a pair of indices <i, j> beautiful if two conditions are met: first, the sum of a_i and a_j is divisible by x, and second, the difference between a_i and a_j is divisible by y. I need to find out how many such beautiful pairs exist in the array for each test case.

First, I need to understand what it means for a sum or difference to be divisible by something. If a sum a_i + a_j is divisible by x, that means (a_i + a_j) % x == 0. Similarly, if the difference a_i - a_j is divisible by y, then (a_i - a_j) % y == 0.

I need to find pairs where both these conditions are true simultaneously. This sounds like I have to look for pairs where both (a_i + a_j) is divisible by x and (a_i - a_j) is divisible by y.

Let me think about how to approach this efficiently, especially since the array can be quite large, up to 2*10^5 elements, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases. But it's guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5, which is good because that means overall time complexity should be O(N), where N is the total number of elements across all test cases.

Brute force approach would be to check every possible pair <i, j> for each test case, but that would be O(N^2), which is too slow given the constraints.

I need a smarter way to count the pairs without checking every possible pair. Maybe I can use some properties of modular arithmetic here.

Let me consider the conditions again:

1. (a_i + a_j) % x == 0

2. (a_i - a_j) % y == 0

I can rewrite these conditions in terms of congruences:

1. a_i + a_j ≡ 0 mod x

2. a_i - a_j ≡ 0 mod y

From the first condition, a_j ≡ -a_i mod x

From the second condition, a_j ≡ a_i mod y

So, for a pair <i, j> to be beautiful, a_j must be congruent to -a_i modulo x and to a_i modulo y.

This seems tricky because a_j has to satisfy two different congruence conditions based on a_i.

Maybe I can combine these two conditions using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here, especially since x and y may not be coprime.

Let me think differently. Perhaps I can look for values of a_j that satisfy both congruences simultaneously for a given a_i.

So, for a given a_i, I need to find a_j such that:

a_j ≡ -a_i mod x

and

a_j ≡ a_i mod y

This is a system of congruences, and if x and y are coprime, there would be a unique solution modulo x*y. But since x and y may not be coprime, I need to be careful.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a way to iterate through the array once per test case and keep track of some frequency counts to quickly find how many a_j's satisfy the conditions for each a_i.

Let me consider the frequency of certain remainders in the array.

If I can precompute the frequency of certain properties of the elements modulo x and y, maybe I can use that to count the number of valid pairs.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can use the concept of counting frequency of (a % x, a % y) tuples.

Let me think about that.

For each element a in the array, I can compute its remainders when divided by x and y, i.e., (a % x, a % y).

If I have two elements a_i and a_j, then for them to form a beautiful pair, we need:

a_j ≡ -a_i mod x

and

a_j ≡ a_i mod y

Which means that the pair (a_j % x, a_j % y) should be equal to ((-a_i % x), (a_i % y)).

So, for each a_i, I can compute its required (target) pair for a_j as ((-a_i % x), (a_i % y)).

Then, if I have a frequency map that counts how many times each (a % x, a % y) pair appears in the array, I can look up the frequency of the target pair for each a_i and add it to the count of beautiful pairs.

However, I need to be careful because pairs are unordered, so I would be counting each pair twice in this approach. But since the problem likely considers pairs as unordered, I need to make sure to handle this correctly.

Wait, no. According to the problem, pairs are ordered with i < j, so I think in my approach, if I process the array in order and keep a frequency map of the elements seen so far, I can avoid double-counting.

Let me try to outline this approach step by step.

For each test case:

1. Read n, x, y, and the array a.

2. Initialize a frequency map freq to keep track of the frequency of (a % x, a % y) pairs seen so far.

3. Initialize a counter count to 0.

4. Iterate through the array from left to right:

a. For each a_i, calculate its required target pair for a_j: target = ((-a_i % x), (a_i % y))

b. Look up the frequency of this target pair in the freq map and add it to count.

c. Update the freq map with the current a_i's (a_i % x, a_i % y) pair.

5. After processing all elements, output the count.

This way, I ensure that each pair is only counted once, as I'm always looking for a_j that come after a_i in the array.

Let me verify this approach with the first example in the problem statement.

Example 1:

n = 6, x = 5, y = 2

a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]

Let's list all possible pairs <i, j> with i < j:

<1,2>: a1=1, a2=2 => 1+2=3 not divisible by 5, 1-2=-1 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<1,3>: a1=1, a3=7 => 1+7=8 not divisible by 5, 1-7=-6 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<1,4>: a1=1, a4=4 => 1+4=5 divisible by 5, 1-4=-3 not divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<1,5>: a1=1, a5=9 => 1+9=10 divisible by 5, 1-9=-8 divisible by 2 => beautiful

<1,6>: a1=1, a6=6 => 1+6=7 not divisible by 5, 1-6=-5 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<2,3>: a2=2, a3=7 => 2+7=9 not divisible by 5, 2-7=-5 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<2,4>: a2=2, a4=4 => 2+4=6 not divisible by 5, 2-4=-2 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<2,5>: a2=2, a5=9 => 2+9=11 not divisible by 5, 2-9=-7 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<2,6>: a2=2, a6=6 => 2+6=8 not divisible by 5, 2-6=-4 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<3,4>: a3=7, a4=4 => 7+4=11 not divisible by 5, 7-4=3 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<3,5>: a3=7, a5=9 => 7+9=16 not divisible by 5, 7-9=-2 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<3,6>: a3=7, a6=6 => 7+6=13 not divisible by 5, 7-6=1 not divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<4,5>: a4=4, a5=9 => 4+9=13 not divisible by 5, 4-9=-5 divisible by 2 => not beautiful

<4,6>: a4=4, a6=6 => 4+6=10 divisible by 5, 4-6=-2 divisible by 2 => beautiful

<5,6>: a5=9, a6=6 => 9+6=15 divisible by 5, 9-6=3 not divisible by 2 => not beautiful

So, only two beautiful pairs: <1,5> and <4,6>.

Now, let's see if my proposed approach would correctly count these.

Initialize freq as empty.

Iterate through the array:

a1=1

target = ((-1 % 5), (1 % 2)) = (4, 1)

freq: {(1 % 5, 1 % 2)} = {(1, 1)} -> frequency of (4,1) is 0, so count remains 0

freq: {(1,1):1}

a2=2

target = ((-2 % 5), (2 % 2)) = (3, 0)

freq: {(1,1):1} -> frequency of (3,0) is 0, so count remains 0

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1}

a3=7

target = ((-7 % 5), (7 % 2)) = ((-7+10)%5, 1) = (3,1)

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1} -> frequency of (3,1) is 0, so count remains 0

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1} because 7%5=2, 7%2=1

Wait, 7%5 is 2, not 7. Wait no, 7 divided by 5 is 1 with remainder 2, so 7%5=2.

Wait, (-7 % 5): -7 + 10 = 3, since -7 + 5 = -2, -2 +5=3, so (-7 % 5)=3

And 7%2=1, so target is (3,1)

But in freq, there's no (3,1), so count remains 0

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1}

a4=4

target = ((-4 % 5), (4 % 2)) = (1, 0)

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1} -> frequency of (1,0) is 0, so count remains 0

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1}

Wait, 4%5=4, 4%2=0, so (4,0)

a5=9

target = ((-9 % 5), (9 % 2)) = ((-9 +10)%5, 1) = (1%5,1) = (1,1)

freq: {(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1} -> frequency of (1,1) is 1, so count becomes 1

freq: {(1,1):2, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1}

a6=6

target = ((-6 % 5), (6 % 2)) = ((-6 +10)%5, 0) = (4%5,0) = (4,0)

freq: {(1,1):2, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1} -> frequency of (4,0) is 1, so count becomes 2

freq: {(1,1):2, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):2}

So, total count is 2, which matches the expected output.

Great, this seems to work for this example.

Let me check another example to be sure.

Take the second example:

n=7, x=9, y=5

a=[1,10,15,3,8,12,15]

Let's list all possible pairs and see which ones are beautiful.

<1,2>: 1+10=11 not divisible by 9, 1-10=-9 divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<1,3>: 1+15=16 not divisible by 9, 1-15=-14 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<1,4>: 1+3=4 not divisible by 9, 1-3=-2 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<1,5>: 1+8=9 divisible by 9, 1-8=-7 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<1,6>: 1+12=13 not divisible by 9, 1-12=-11 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<1,7>: 1+15=16 not divisible by 9, 1-15=-14 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<2,3>: 10+15=25 not divisible by 9, 10-15=-5 divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<2,4>: 10+3=13 not divisible by 9, 10-3=7 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<2,5>: 10+8=18 divisible by 9, 10-8=2 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<2,6>: 10+12=22 not divisible by 9, 10-12=-2 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<2,7>: 10+15=25 not divisible by 9, 10-15=-5 divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<3,4>: 15+3=18 divisible by 9, 15-3=12 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<3,5>: 15+8=23 not divisible by 9, 15-8=7 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<3,6>: 15+12=27 divisible by 9, 15-12=3 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<3,7>: 15+15=30 not divisible by 9, 15-15=0 divisible by 5 => beautiful?

Wait, 0 is divisible by any y, since 0 divided by anything is 0, which is an integer.

So, <3,7> is beautiful.

<4,5>: 3+8=11 not divisible by 9, 3-8=-5 divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<4,6>: 3+12=15 not divisible by 9, 3-12=-9 divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<4,7>: 3+15=18 divisible by 9, 3-15=-12 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<5,6>: 8+12=20 not divisible by 9, 8-12=-4 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<5,7>: 8+15=23 not divisible by 9, 8-15=-7 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

<6,7>: 12+15=27 divisible by 9, 12-15=-3 not divisible by 5 => not beautiful

Wait, according to this, only <3,7> is a beautiful pair, but according to the sample output, it's 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, in the sample output for the second test case, it's 0, but according to my analysis, <3,7> seems to be a beautiful pair. Let's check the conditions again.

For <3,7>:

a3=15, a7=15

sum: 15+15=30, 30 % 9 = 3, which is not 0, so not divisible by 9.

difference: 15-15=0, which is divisible by 5.

Wait, sum is not divisible by 9, so it's not a beautiful pair. I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, no beautiful pairs in this test case, which matches the sample output of 0.

Phew, that was a close one.

So, my approach seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and t up to 10^4, but the sum of n across all test cases is up to 2*10^5, I need an overall time complexity of O(N), where N is the total number of elements.

Using a frequency map (dictionary) to keep track of the (a % x, a % y) pairs should work, as looking up and updating the frequency map can be done in amortized O(1) time.

I need to make sure that the frequency map uses hashable types for keys, like tuples of integers.

Also, since a_i can be up to 10^9 and x and y up to 10^9, I need to make sure that the remainders are calculated correctly.

In Python, the remainder operation a % b always returns a non-negative integer less than b, which is what I want.

I should also consider that x or y could be 1, which would make a_i % x or a_i % y always 0, but that's fine.

Edge cases to consider:

- x=1, y=1: every pair would be beautiful, since any sum and difference are divisible by 1.

- x=1, y=some value: sums are always divisible by 1, so only need to check if differences are divisible by y.

- x=some value, y=1: differences are always divisible by 1, so only need to check if sums are divisible by x.

- Arrays with all identical elements: need to check if pairs satisfy the conditions based on the duplicates.

- Arrays with n=2: the smallest possible array, just one pair to check.

- Arrays with n=2*10^5: need to ensure efficiency.

I should also make sure that the frequency map doesn't count pairs where i=j, since i < j is required.

But in my approach, since I process each a_i and look for pairs where j > i, this isn't an issue.

Now, looking at the provided program, let's see if it implements this correctly.

The program defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_2 seems to read the input, parse the test cases, and call func_1 to process them.

func_1 takes a list of test cases, each containing n, x, y, and the array a.

Inside func_1, for each test case, it initializes a frequency map (freq) as a dictionary, and a counter (count) set to 0.

Then, it iterates through the array a.

For each a in a:

- It calculates rx = (-a % x + x) % x, which is the positive equivalent of -a % x.

- It calculates ry = a % y.

- It checks if (rx, ry) is in freq, and if so, adds the frequency to count.

- Then, it calculates the current_pair as (a % x, a % y).

- If current_pair is already in freq, it increments its frequency by 1; otherwise, sets it to 1.

This seems to match my approach.

Wait, but in my approach, I need to look for pairs where a_j satisfies:

a_j ≡ -a_i % x and a_j ≡ a_i % y.

So, for a given a_i, the target a_j is such that:

- a_j % x == (-a_i % x)

- a_j % y == (a_i % y)

Therefore, in the frequency map, I should be looking for the frequency of (rx, ry), where rx = (-a_i % x), ry = (a_i % y).

In the code, it calculates rx = (-a % x + x) % x, which is equivalent to (-a % x), ensuring it's positive.

ry = a % y.

Then, it checks if (rx, ry) is in freq and adds the frequency to count.

After that, it updates freq with the current_pair, which is (a % x, a % y).

This seems correct.

So, for each a_i, it looks for the number of previous a_j (with j < i) that satisfy the conditions for a_j based on a_i.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I suggested processing the array from left to right, and for each a_i, looking for a_j that come after a_i.

But in this code, it's processing from start to end, and for each a_i, looking for a_j that have already been processed, which would be j < i.

But according to the problem, pairs are defined with i < j, meaning j comes after i in the array.

This seems like a discrepancy.

Wait, but in the code, it's looking for a_j that have already been processed, which would be j < i, but the problem wants i < j.

Is this a mistake?

Wait, no. Actually, in the code, for each a_i, it's looking for a_j that have already been processed, meaning j < i, but since the problem considers pairs with i < j, this would mean that for each j, the a_j is being processed, and it's looking for a_i that are before it.

Wait, I think I need to think more carefully.

In the code:

- For each a in a (processing from i=0 to n-1):

- Calculate rx = (-a % x)

- Calculate ry = a % y

- Look for frequency of (rx, ry) in freq, which represents the number of a_j with j < i that satisfy the conditions for pairing with a_i.

- Then, it adds the current a's (a % x, a % y) to the freq map.

But according to the problem, pairs are <i,j> with i < j, meaning j comes after i in the array.

In this approach, when processing a_i, it's looking for a_j with j < i, which would be incorrect because those would be j < i, but we need j > i.

Wait, I think there's a confusion here.

Let me try to re-express this.

In the code:

- For each element a_i (i from 0 to n-1):

- Compute target for a_j: rx = (-a_i % x), ry = (a_i % y)

- Look for frequency of (rx, ry) in freq, which counts how many a_j with j < i have (a_j % x, a_j % y) == (rx, ry)

- Add that frequency to the count

- Then, add the current a_i's (a_i % x, a_i % y) to freq

This means that for each a_i, it's counting the number of a_j with j < i that can form a beautiful pair with a_i.

But according to the problem, pairs are <i,j> with i < j, meaning j > i.

So, it seems like the code is counting pairs where j < i, which is incorrect.

This is a mistake in the implementation.

To fix this, we need to ensure that for each a_i, we're looking for a_j with j > i.

One way to do this is to process the array in reverse, keeping track of the frequency of (a_j % x, a_j % y) for j > i.

So, process from i=n-1 downto 0:

- For each a_i, compute the target (rx, ry) for a_j

- Look for frequency of (rx, ry) in freq, which represents a_j with j > i

- Add that frequency to count

- Then, add the current a_i's (a_i % x, a_i % y) to freq

This way, when processing a_i, freq contains a_j with j > i.

Alternatively, we can process the array from left to right, but adjust the target accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should implement the reverse approach.

Let me try to adjust the code accordingly.

Here's the corrected approach:

- Initialize freq as empty

- Initialize count = 0

- Iterate through the array from left to right:

- For each a_i:

- Compute target_rx = (-a_i % x)

- Compute target_ry = (a_i % y)

- count += freq[(target_rx, target_ry)]

- Compute current_rx = (a_i % x)

- Compute current_ry = (a_i % y)

- freq[(current_rx, current_ry)] += 1

But wait, in this approach, freq contains frequencies of a_j with j > i, because we're processing from i=0 to n-1, and adding a_j with j > i.

Wait, actually, in this adjusted approach, freq contains a_j with j > i, because we haven't processed a_i yet, so freq has frequencies of a_j for j > i.

Wait, no, actually, when processing a_i, freq contains a_j for j > i, because we're processing from i=0 to n-1, and we're adding a_j for j > i.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to process the array from right to left:

- Initialize freq as empty

- Initialize count = 0

- Iterate through the array from n-1 downto 0:

- For each a_i:

- Compute target_rx = (-a_i % x)

- Compute target_ry = (a_i % y)

- count += freq.get((target_rx, target_ry), 0)

- Compute current_rx = (a_i % x)

- Compute current_ry = (a_i % y)

- freq[(current_rx, current_ry)] = freq.get((current_rx, current_ry), 0) + 1

In this case, when processing a_i, freq contains a_j with j > i, which is correct because we're processing from right to left.

This should work.

So, the original code is incorrect because it's processing from left to right, which would count pairs where j < i, whereas we need j > i.

To fix the code, we need to process the array from right to left.

Let me adjust the func_1 accordingly.

def func_1(test_cases):

results = []

for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:

freq = {}

count = 0

for a in reversed(arr):

rx = (-a % x)

ry = a % y

count += freq.get((rx, ry), 0)

current_pair = (a % x, a % y)

freq[current_pair] = freq.get(current_pair, 0) + 1

results.append(count)

return results

Yes, this should work.

But in the original code, it's processing from left to right, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, Correctness: **False**

Wait, but in the first example, it gave the correct answer of 2.

Wait, but according to my earlier manual count, it should work.

Wait, perhaps processing from left to right is still correct, and I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me re-examine.

In the first example:

n=6, x=5, y=2

a=[1,2,7,4,9,6]

Processing from left to right:

Initialize freq={}

i=0, a=1

rx = (-1 % 5) = 4

ry = 1 % 2 = 1

freq[(4,1)] = 0, so count += 0

Add (1%5,1%2)=(1,1) to freq: freq={(1,1):1}

i=1, a=2

rx = (-2 % 5)=3

ry = 2%2=0

freq[(3,0)] = 0

Add (2%5,2%2)=(2,0) to freq: freq={(1,1):1, (2,0):1}

i=2, a=7

rx = (-7 % 5)=3

ry =7%2=1

freq[(3,1)] = 0

Add (7%5,7%2)=(2,1) to freq: freq={(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1}

i=3, a=4

rx = (-4 % 5)=1

ry=4%2=0

freq[(1,0)] = 0

Add (4%5,4%2)=(4,0) to freq: freq={(1,1):1, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1}

i=4, a=9

rx = (-9 % 5)=1

ry=9%2=1

freq[(1,1)]=1, so count +=1, count=1

Add (9%5,9%2)=(4,1) to freq: freq={(1,1):2, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1, (4,1):1}

i=5, a=6

rx = (-6 % 5)=4

ry=6%2=0

freq[(4,0)]=1, so count +=1, count=2

Add (6%5,6%2)=(1,0) to freq: freq={(1,1):2, (2,0):1, (2,1):1, (4,0):1, (4,1):1, (1,0):1}

Total count=2, which matches the expected output.

So, even though I thought it should process from right to left, it seems that processing from left to right still gives the correct count.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the direction doesn't matter because we're dealing with unordered pairs, and by processing from left to right and looking for freq[(rx,ry)], we're effectively counting pairs where j > i, as a_j with j > i would have been added to freq before processing a_i.

Wait, no, if we process from left to right, freq contains a_j with j > i, so looking up freq[(rx,ry)] gives the number of a_j with j > i that can pair with a_i.

So, the original code is actually correct.

I must have misthought this earlier.

So, the original code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in an array based on given conditions involving divisibility by two integers, x and y. A pair <i, j> is considered beautiful if:

1. The sum of a_i and a_j is divisible by x.
2. The difference of a_i and a_j is divisible by y.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
   - For the sum a_i + a_j to be divisible by x, it must satisfy (a_i + a_j) % x == 0.
   - For the difference a_i - a_j to be divisible by y, it must satisfy (a_i - a_j) % y == 0.

2. **Modular Arithmetic Insights**:
   - From (a_i + a_j) % x == 0, we get a_j ≡ -a_i mod x.
   - From (a_i - a_j) % y == 0, we get a_j ≡ a_i mod y.

3. **Efficient Pair Counting**:
   - Use a frequency map to track occurrences of (a % x, a % y) tuples.
   - For each element, calculate the required (rx, ry) for a_j based on the conditions.
   - Look up the frequency of this required tuple in the frequency map to count valid pairs.

4. **Processing Order**:
   - Process the array from left to right, ensuring that for each a_i, we check for a_j with j > i by maintaining the frequency map of elements processed so far.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}

### Explanation

1. **func_1**:
   - Processes each test case.
   - Uses a frequency map to keep track of (a % x, a % y) pairs.
   - For each element, calculates the required (rx, ry) for a_j and counts how many such pairs exist using the frequency map.

2. **func_2**:
   - Reads input from stdin.
   - Parses the input into test cases.
   - Calls func_1 to process the test cases and prints the results.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the beautiful pairs for each test case in O(N) time complexity, where N is the total number of elements across all test cases.
