Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide them into several groups with a specific condition. The condition is that in any group, any pair of numbers doesn't have matching bit values among bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. That means, for any two numbers in the same group, for every bit position from 1 to 31, their bit values should be different.

First, I need to understand what this condition really means. Essentially, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations should differ in all the first 31 bits. That sounds a lot like saying that no two numbers in the same group should have any bit in common in these positions.

Wait, but that can't be right because if they differ in all bits, that means for each bit position, one number has 0 and the other has 1, or vice versa. So, it's like they are complements of each other in these bits.

But actually, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, the ith bits of x and y are not equal. That means, for every bit position, the bits are different between any pair of numbers in the same group.

This sounds a lot like creating groups where no two numbers share any common bit set in the same positions. Wait, but it's stronger than that because it's not just that they don't share a common bit being set, but that their bits are different in every position.

Let me think about this in terms of bitwise operations. If two numbers have different bits in all positions from 1 to 31, that means that for each bit position, one has a 0 and the other has a 1. So, their bitwise XOR would have all bits set to 1 in these positions.

Wait, actually, if two numbers differ in all bits, their XOR would be all 1's in those positions.

But I need to group numbers such that any two numbers in the same group differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

This seems tricky. Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Let's consider the problem in terms of graph theory. Imagine each number is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if they cannot be in the same group, i.e., if there exists at least one bit position from 1 to 31 where their bits are the same.

Wait, no, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, their bits are different in all positions from 1 to 31. So, they cannot have any bit in common being the same.

Actually, re-reading the problem, it says: "any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit".

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

That means, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y must have all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1.

Wait, no. x XOR y will have a 1 in positions where x and y differ, and 0 where they are the same.

So, if x and y differ in all bits from 1 to 31, then x XOR y will have all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1.

But the condition is that they differ in all these bits, meaning x XOR y should have all these bits set to 1.

But in practice, this is equivalent to saying that x and y are complements of each other in these bits.

Wait, but complements would mean that x = ~y, but in binary, ~y would flip all bits of y.

But here, we're only considering bits from 1 to 31, not the entire number.

Wait, in the problem, k_2(i) denotes the i-th bit from the right, starting from 1.

So, bit 1 is the least significant bit.

Given that, the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 31, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i).

That is, for each bit position from 1 to 31, the bits of x and y are different.

This is equivalent to saying that x AND y has no bits set in positions 1 to 31.

Wait, no. If x and y differ in all bits from 1 to 31, then x AND y would have no bits set in those positions, because for each of those positions, one of x or y has a 0 and the other has a 1, so their AND is 0.

But actually, x AND y would have a 0 in all positions from 1 to 31 if they differ in all those positions.

But the condition is that in the same group, any two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

So, in other words, for any two numbers in the same group, their AND in bits 1 to 31 is 0.

Wait, but that's not sufficient because they could have some bits the same and others different, but the condition is that all bits from 1 to 31 are different.

So, x AND y in bits 1 to 31 must be 0, and x OR y in bits 1 to 31 must be all 1's.

Wait, no. If x and y differ in all bits from 1 to 31, then for each of those bits, one is 0 and the other is 1.

Therefore, x XOR y in bits 1 to 31 is all 1's, and x AND y is 0.

So, x AND y in bits 1 to 31 must be 0, and x OR y in bits 1 to 31 must be all 1's.

Wait, no. x OR y in bits 1 to 31 would be all 1's only if for each bit in 1 to 31, at least one of x or y has that bit set to 1.

But if x and y differ in all bits, it's possible that some bits are 0 in x and 1 in y, or vice versa.

So, x OR y in bits 1 to 31 would be all 1's only if neither x nor y has any 0's in the same position.

Wait, this is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to think about it differently.

Let me consider that for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR in bits 1 to 31 is all 1's.

Because if they differ in all bits, their XOR will be all 1's in those positions.

So, x XOR y = (1 << 31) - 1, which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

Wait, (1 << 31) - 1 is indeed a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

So, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y == (1 << 31) - 1.

But, this seems too restrictive because XOR being all 1's means that x = y ^ ((1 << 31) - 1).

That is, y = x ^ ((1 << 31) - 1).

So, essentially, each group can have at most two numbers: x and x ^ ((1 << 31) - 1).

Wait, but the problem allows for more than two numbers in a group, as long as any two numbers in the group differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

But according to this, it seems that each group can have only one number, because if you have two numbers, they must be complements of each other in bits 1 to 31.

Wait, but the example given has groups with more than two numbers.

Wait, let's look at the example.

In the first test case:

4

1 4 3 4

Output: 4

Explanation: Any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so each number must be in its own group.

Wait, but 1 and 4 have different bits in their binary representations.

1 is 0001, 4 is 0100, so they differ in bits.

But according to the problem, they should be able to be in the same group only if their bits differ in all positions from 1 to 31.

Wait, 1 is 0001, 4 is 0100.

In binary, 1 is 00000000000000000000000000000001, and 4 is 00000000000000000000000000000100.

So, in bit positions 1 and 3, they differ: 1 has bit 1 in position 1, 0 in position 3; 4 has bit 0 in position 1 and 1 in position 3.

Wait, actually, in position 1, 1 has 1 and 4 has 0; in position 3, 1 has 0 and 4 has 1.

So, in all positions, their bits are different.

Wait, no. In position 2, both have 0.

Wait, hold on.

1 in binary is 000...0001

4 in binary is 000...0100

So, in position 1, 1 has 1 and 4 has 0.

In position 2, both have 0.

Wait, but the condition is that for any two numbers in the same group, for all 1 ≤ i < 32, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i).

So, in position 2, both have 0, which violates the condition.

Therefore, 1 and 4 cannot be in the same group because they both have 0 in position 2.

Wait, but according to the explanation in the example, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

In the first test case, the output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

But according to the condition, 1 and 4 cannot be in the same group because they both have 0 in position 2, violating the condition that their bits differ in all positions from 1 to 31.

Similarly, 3 is 000...0011, and 4 is 000...0100.

Comparing 3 and 4:

Position 1: 3 has 1, 4 has 0

Position 2: 3 has 1, 4 has 0

Position 3: 3 has 0, 4 has 1

So, in position 2, both have different bits.

Wait, position 2: 3 has 1, 4 has 0, which are different.

Position 3: 3 has 0, 4 has 1, different.

Position 1: 3 has 1, 4 has 0, different.

So, all positions differ between 3 and 4.

Wait, but according to the explanation, they need to be in separate groups.

Wait, maybe I need to look back at the problem statement.

"any group, any pair of numbers does not have matching bit values among bits from 1-st to 31-st bit"

Wait, "does not have matching bit values among bits from 1-st to 31-st bit"

So, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

So, in the first test case, the numbers are 1,4,3,4.

Looking at 1 and 4:

In position 2, both have 0, which is a matching bit value, so they cannot be in the same group.

Similarly, 4 and 4 are the same number, so they have all bits the same, so they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, each number must be in its own group.

Got it.

So, the condition is that in any group, any two numbers do not have any bit in common from positions 1 to 31 being the same.

Wait, no, more strictly, for any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bit values are different.

So, no two numbers in the same group can have the same bit set in any position from 1 to 31.

This sounds a lot like creating groups where each number's bits from 1 to 31 are unique across the group.

Wait, but it's stronger than that because it's not just that no two numbers share the same bit in any position, but that for any two numbers, all their bits are different.

This seems similar to orthogonal vectors in some sense.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think in terms of the complement.

If two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31, that means that for each of those bits, one has a 0 and the other has a1.

So, effectively, they are complements of each other in those bits.

Wait, but complements would mean that x = ~y in those bits.

But in binary, ~y would flip all bits of y.

So, if x = ~y in bits 1 to 31, then x and y differ in all those bits.

Hence, for any two numbers in the same group, they must be complements of each other in bits 1 to 31.

But, in that case, each group can have at most two numbers: a number and its complement.

But in the first test case, there are four numbers, and the output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

Wait, but according to this logic, perhaps some numbers are their own complements.

But in 31 bits, a number and its complement are distinct.

Wait, for example, 1 and its complement would be all 1's except for the bit position where 1 has a 1.

But in practice, it's complicated.

Looking back at the first test case:

Numbers: 1,4,3,4

Binary:

1: 000...0001

4: 000...0100

3: 000...0011

Another 4: 000...0100

So, 1 and 4 differ in position 1 and 3, but match in position 2.

Hence, they cannot be in the same group.

3 and 4 differ in position 1, match in position 3.

Wait, in position 1: 3 has 1, 4 has 0

Position 2: 3 has 1, 4 has 0

Position 3: 3 has 0, 4 has 1

Wait, they differ in all positions.

Wait, position 1: 1 vs 0

Position 2: 1 vs 0

Position 3: 0 vs 1

So, they differ in all positions.

Then why can't 3 and 4 be in the same group?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Looking back, 3 is 000...0011, which is binary 11.

4 is 000...0100, which is binary 100.

Wait, but in the 31-bit representation, they have differences in multiple positions.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the full 31 bits.

But for small numbers like 1,3,4, their higher bits are all 0's.

So, in practice, for these numbers, all higher bits are 0's.

Hence, for positions where one number has a 1 and the other has a 0, they differ.

But if both have 0's in some positions, they match there, violating the condition.

Hence, in the first test case, since there are multiple numbers with overlapping 0's in some bit positions, they cannot be in the same group.

Hence, each number needs its own group.

Got it.

So, to minimize the number of groups, we need to group numbers such that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit set in any position from 1 to 31.

This sounds similar to graph coloring, where each number is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if they cannot be in the same group.

But given the constraints on n (up to 2e5 per test case), and t up to 1e4, but with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, we need an efficient algorithm.

Graph coloring is NP-hard, so that's not feasible here.

Hence, I need a better approach.

Let me think about the condition again.

For any two numbers in the same group, for all bits from 1 to 31, their bits are different.

That means that for any two numbers x and y in the same group, x XOR y == (1 << 31) - 1.

Because XOR will be 1 in positions where they differ and 0 where they are the same.

So, if they differ in all bits from 1 to 31, x XOR y == (1 << 31) - 1.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 XOR 4 == 5, which is not equal to (1 << 31) - 1.

Wait, (1 << 31) -1 is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1.

In the first test case, 1 XOR 4 == 5, which in binary is 101, which is not equal to (1 << 31) -1.

Hence, my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that x XOR y should have all bits from 1 to 31 set to 1, meaning x XOR y == (1 << 31) -1.

But in the first test case, 1 XOR 4 == 5, which is not equal to (1 << 31) -1.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that x XOR y should be equal to (1 << 31) -1.

But in that case, each group can have at most two numbers: a number and its complement.

But in the first test case, output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

Hence, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the bits that are set.

Let me consider that for any two numbers in the same group, their bitwise AND in bits 1 to 31 is 0.

Because if they have any bit in common set to 1, that would violate the condition.

Wait, but in the first test case, 1 AND 4 == 0, which is fine, but according to the explanation, they still can't be in the same group because they have matching 0's in some positions.

Wait, but if their AND is 0 in bits 1 to 31, that means they don't have any 1's in common in those positions, which satisfies part of the condition.

But the full condition is that for all bits from 1 to 31, x_2(i) ≠ y_2(i), meaning that for each bit position, their bits are different.

That is equivalent to their XOR being equal to (1 << 31) -1.

Wait, no.

XOR being equal to (1 << 31) -1 means that they differ in all bits from 1 to 31.

Hence, for any two numbers in the same group, x XOR y == (1 << 31) -1.

But in reality, for a group, any two numbers must satisfy this condition.

Hence, in a group, all numbers must be pairwise differing in all bits from 1 to 31.

This seems very restrictive.

In other words, for any two numbers in the group, their XOR must be equal to (1 << 31) -1.

This implies that each group can have at most two numbers: a number and its complement.

But in the first test case, output is 4, meaning each number is in its own group.

Wait, but according to this, perhaps some numbers don't have their complement present in the list.

Wait, in the first test case, numbers are 1,4,3,4.

The complement of 1 is (1 << 31) -1 ^ 1.

Similarly for others.

But in this case, it's seems complicated.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for any two numbers in the same group, their XOR must be equal to (1 << 31) -1.

Hence, in a group, all numbers must satisfy that any two of them have XOR equal to (1 << 31) -1.

This would imply that all numbers in the group are pairwise related in this way.

But in practice, this seems too restrictive for grouping multiple numbers.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of distinct sets of numbers where each set consists of numbers that are pairwise XOR equal to (1 << 31) -1.

But this seems too narrow, as in the first test case, each number is in its own group.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that each group can have only one number, but the goal is to minimize the number of groups.

Hence, we need to maximize the number of numbers in each group.

But given the restrictive condition, perhaps in many cases, groups can only have one number.

Wait, but in the second test case:

2

0 2147483647

Output:1

Explanation: 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group because their bits are all different.

2147483647 is (1 << 31) -1, which is all 1's in the first 31 bits.

0 is all 0's.

Hence, their bits are all different in positions 1 to 31.

Hence, they can be in the same group.

So, in this case, only one group is needed.

Similarly, in other test cases, groups can have more than one number if they satisfy the condition.

Hence, perhaps groups can have multiple numbers, but only if they are all pairwise differing in all bits from 1 to 31.

Wait, but in the second test case, 0 and (1 << 31) -1 can be in the same group because their XOR is (1 << 31) -1.

Similarly, any number and its complement can be in the same group.

But in the first test case, numbers are 1,4,3,4.

None of them are complements of each other, hence each must be in its own group.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of distinct "equivalence classes" where two numbers are in the same class if their XOR is equal to (1 << 31) -1.

Wait, but in the first test case, no two numbers have XOR equal to (1 << 31) -1, hence each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 have XOR equal to (1 << 31) -1, so they can be in the same group.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of pairs where x XOR y == (1 << 31) -1, plus the numbers that don't have a complement in the list.

Wait, but in the first test case, none of the numbers have their complement in the list, hence each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, so they can be in the same group.

Hence, perhaps the minimal number of groups is equal to the number of numbers not paired with their complement, plus half the number of pairs that are complements.

Wait, but in the first test case, no complements are present, so each number is in its own group.

In the second test case, 0 and 2147483647 are complements, so they can be in the same group.

Hence, only one group is needed.

But in other test cases, it might be more complicated.

Wait, but in the third test case, with 5 numbers, the output is 3.

Hence, perhaps some numbers can be grouped together if they are complements.

But this seems too simplistic.

Perhaps I need to model this as a graph where nodes are numbers, and edges connect numbers that can be in the same group.

But given the constraints on n and t, this approach would be too slow.

Hence, I need a better way.

Let me consider the problem differently.

Each number can be represented by its 31-bit binary representation.

The condition for two numbers to be in the same group is that their bits are all different in positions 1 to 31.

That is, for any two numbers in the same group, their binary representations differ in all these positions.

This is equivalent to saying that the bitwise AND of the two numbers in positions 1 to 31 is 0, and their bitwise OR in these positions is (1 << 31) -1.

Wait, no.

If two numbers differ in all bits from 1 to 31, then their AND is 0 in these positions, and their OR is (1 << 31) -1.

Hence, for two numbers to be in the same group, their AND in bits 1 to 31 must be 0, and their OR in these bits must be (1 << 31) -1.

Wait, but this is equivalent to saying that their XOR is (1 << 31) -1.

Because if x XOR y == (1 << 31) -1, then x AND NOT y in these bits is 0, and x OR y is (1 << 31) -1.

Hence, for any two numbers in
