Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this thing called a "progressive square," which is an n x n matrix. Maxim chooses three integers: a_{1,1}, c, and d, and constructs this square based on some rules. From the example, when n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, and d=3, the square looks like this:

1 3 6

5 7 10

4 1 8

Wait, actually, in the example, it's:

a_{1,1} =1, c=2, d=3, and the square is:

1 3 6

5 7 10

4 1 8

Hmm, but when I look at how it's constructed, it seems like each element a_{i,j} is calculated as a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d. Let me verify that with the example.

For a_{1,1}: 1 + 0*2 + 0*3 = 1

a_{1,2}: 1 + 0*2 + 1*3 = 4, but in the example, it's 3. Wait, that's not matching. Maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but in the example, a_{1,2} is 3, which would be 1 + 0*2 + 1*3 = 4, but it's 3. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + j*d. Wait, still not matching.

Wait, maybe it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but then in the example, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3:

a_{1,1}=1

a_{1,2}=1 + 0*2 + 1*3=4

a_{1,3}=1 + 0*2 + 2*3=7

But in the example, a_{1,2}=3, a_{1,3}=6. So my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + d*j, but that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's a different formula. Let's see the example again.

Given n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3, the square is:

1 3 6

5 7 10

4 1 8

Looking at the first row: 1, 3, 6

Second row: 5,7,10

Third row:4,1,8

Hmm, maybe a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but that doesn't match the example.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Let's try to find a pattern.

Looking at the first row: 1, 3, 6

Differences: 2, 3

Second row: 5,7,10

Differences:2,3

Third row:4,1,8

Differences:-3,7

Hmm, not consistent.

Wait, maybe it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but with different starting points.

Wait, perhaps the formula is a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + j*d, but in the example, that would be:

a_{1,1}=1 +0*2 +1*3=1+0+3=4, but it's 1. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's a different formula altogether.

Wait, perhaps it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but in the example, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3:

a_{1,1}=1 +0*2 +0*3=1

a_{1,2}=1 +0*2 +1*3=4, but it's 3 in the example. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + d*(j-1), but that's the same as above.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, the problem says: "Maxim chooses three integers a_{1,1}, c, and d and constructs a progressive square according to the following rules:"

It doesn't specify the rules in this snippet, perhaps I need to look back.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says: "For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive square looks as follows:"

And shows:

1 3 6

5 7 10

4 1 8

Hmm, perhaps the rules are not explicitly stated, and we need to reverse-engineer them from the example.

Looking at the example, maybe a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the example or my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the square is constructed in a different way, and the rules are not directly formula-based.

Wait, perhaps it's based on some sequence where each element is determined by adding c or d based on the position.

Alternatively, maybe it's a spiral or some other pattern.

Wait, but the problem mentions that for any n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square. So, there must be a specific way to construct it based on these parameters.

Given that, perhaps the progressive square is constructed by filling it in row-major order, with each element incremented by c when moving down and by d when moving right.

Wait, but that seems similar to my earlier assumption, which doesn't match the example.

Alternatively, maybe it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but in the example, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the example.

Alternatively, maybe the progressive square is constructed differently.

Wait, perhaps a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d + some adjustment.

Looking back at the example:

a_{1,1}=1

a_{1,2}=3 (which is 1 + 2)

a_{1,3}=6 (which is 3 + 3)

a_{2,1}=5 (which is 1 + 4)

a_{2,2}=7 (which is 5 + 2, or 3 + 4)

a_{2,3}=10 (which is 7 + 3)

a_{3,1}=4 (which is 5 + (-1))

a_{3,2}=1 (which is 4 + (-3))

a_{3,3}=8 (which is 1 + 7)

Hmm, seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + j*d, but adjusted modulo something.

Alternatively, maybe it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but with wrap-around.

But in the example, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps the progressive square is constructed by filling it row by row, starting from a_{1,1}, and then adding d for the next column, and when wrapping to the next row, adding c and continuing.

So, starting with a_{1,1}=1, then a_{1,2}=1 + 3=4, a_{1,3}=4 + 3=7

Then, a_{2,1}=1 + 2=3, a_{2,2}=3 + 3=6, a_{2,3}=6 + 3=9

Then, a_{3,1}=3 + 2=5, a_{3,2}=5 + 3=8, a_{3,3}=8 + 3=11

But that doesn't match the example.

Wait, but in the example, it's different.

Wait, perhaps the progressive square is constructed differently.

Alternatively, maybe it's a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but with c and d applied differently.

Wait, perhaps c is the increment for rows and d for columns, but with a different starting point.

Alternatively, maybe the progressive square is constructed by filling it in a specific order, like a spiral or zigzag.

But the problem mentions that for any n, a_{1,1}, c, and d, there exists exactly one progressive square, so there must be a specific formula or rule to generate it.

Given that, perhaps the progressive square is generated by filling it row by row, where each element in a row is obtained by adding d to the previous element, and each first element of a row is obtained by adding c to the first element of the previous row.

So, for n=3, a_{1,1}=1, c=2, d=3:

Row 1: 1, 1+3=4, 4+3=7

Row 2: 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+3=9

Row 3: 3+2=5, 5+3=8, 8+3=11

But in the example, the square is:

1 3 6

5 7 10

4 1 8

Which doesn't match the above construction.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Wait, maybe the progressive square is constructed by filling it in a specific pattern based on c and d.

Alternatively, perhaps it's generated by starting from a_{1,1} and then incrementing by c when moving down and by d when moving right, but combining both.

Wait, perhaps a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d, but in the example, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the progressive square is constructed by filling it in a specific sequence, like a raster scan, and then applying some transformations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at the problem differently.

The problem says that Maxim constructs a progressive square based on a_{1,1}, c, and d, and then an array b is given, which is a shuffled version of the elements of this square, and we need to check if it's possible to construct the progressive square from b.

Given that, perhaps the key is to generate the unique progressive square for the given n, c, d, and a_{1,1}, sort its elements, and compare it to the sorted b.

But wait, in the code provided, it tries to do something similar.

Looking at the code:

def func_1(n, c, d, l):

a = min(l)

li = []

for k in range(0, n):

for h in range(0, n):

li.append(a + k * c + h * d)

li.sort()

l.sort()

if l == li:

return 'yes'

return 'no'

It seems to assume that a_{1,1} is the minimum element in b, and then constructs the progressive square based on that a_{1,1}, c, and d, and checks if the sorted elements match.

But in the problem, a_{1,1} is chosen by Maxim, and we need to construct the square based on that a_{1,1}, c, and d, and see if the elements of b match the elements of that square.

However, in the code, it assumes that a_{1,1} is the minimum element in b, which might not be the case.

Wait, in the example, a_{1,1}=1, and 1 is indeed the minimum element in b, but in general, a_{1,1} can be any integer, and it's chosen by Maxim.

So, perhaps assuming that a_{1,1} is the minimum element in b is not always correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says: "the values of n, c, and d. Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific square."

So, he remembers n, c, and d, and has b, which is the elements of the square in random order.

So, to check if b matches the elements of the progressive square constructed with a_{1,1}, c, and d, we need to know a_{1,1}.

But a_{1,1} is not given; only n, c, d, and b are given.

Wait, but the problem says: "the values of n, c, and d" are remembered, and "the array b is found in random order."

So, perhaps a_{1,1} is not provided, and we need to figure out if there exists an a_{1,1} such that the progressive square constructed with a_{1,1}, c, and d has exactly the elements in b.

Wait, but the problem says: "the progressive square for the given n, c, and d can be constructed from the array elements a."

Wait, in the code, it's func_1(n, c, d, l), where l is b.

But in the problem statement, it's b.

Assuming a typo, and it's b.

So, the task is, given n, c, d, and b, determine if there exists an a_{1,1} such that the progressive square constructed with a_{1,1}, c, and d has exactly the elements in b.

Wait, but the problem says: "the progressive square for the given n, c, and d can be constructed from the array elements a."

Wait, in the code, it's l, which is b.

Probably a typo in the code.

Assuming it's b.

So, given n, c, d, and b, we need to check if there exists an a_{1,1} such that the progressive square constructed with a_{1,1}, c, and d has exactly the elements in b.

Now, the code assumes that a_{1,1} is the minimum element in b, and constructs the square based on that, and checks if the sorted elements match.

But is this correct?

Well, in the first test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3, b=[3,9,6,5,7,1,10,4,8]

Assuming a_{1,1}=1 (which is the minimum in b), constructing the square:

a_{1,1}=1

a_{1,2}=1 + 0*2 + 1*3=4

a_{1,3}=1 + 0*2 + 2*3=7

a_{2,1}=1 + 1*2 + 0*3=3

a_{2,2}=1 + 1*2 + 1*3=6

a_{2,3}=1 + 1*2 + 2*3=9

a_{3,1}=1 + 2*2 + 0*3=5

a_{3,2}=1 + 2*2 + 1*3=8

a_{3,3}=1 + 2*2 + 2*3=11

So, the square would be:

1,4,7

3,6,9

5,8,11

Elements: [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11]

Sorted: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

b sorted: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Which don't match, since 11 is in the square but 10 is in b.

Hence, output should be "NO", which matches the first output in the example.

In the second test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3, b=[3,9,6,5,7,1,11,4,8]

Following the same a_{1,1}=1, the square elements are [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11], sorted [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

b sorted: [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], which matches, so output "YES".

In the third test case:

n=2, c=100, d=100, b=[400,300,400,500]

Assuming a_{1,1}=100, the square would be:

100, 100+0*100+1*100=200

100+1*100+0*100=200

100+1*100+1*100=300

So, elements: [100,200,200,300], sorted [100,200,200,300]

b sorted: [300,400,400,500], which don't match.

Wait, but in the example, the output is "YES". So, perhaps my assumption of a_{1,1}=100 is incorrect.

Wait, the code assumes a_{1,1}=min(b)=300.

So, a_{1,1}=300

Then, the square would be:

a_{1,1}=300

a_{1,2}=300 + 0*100 + 1*100=400

a_{2,1}=300 + 1*100 + 0*100=400

a_{2,2}=300 + 1*100 + 1*100=500

So, elements: [300,400,400,500], sorted [300,400,400,500]

b sorted: [300,400,400,500], which matches, so output "YES".

Hence, the code seems correct in this case.

In the fourth test case:

n=3, c=2, d=3, b=[3,9,6,6,5,1,11,4,8]

Assuming a_{1,1}=1, the square would be [1,4,7,3,6,9,5,8,11], sorted [1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11]

b sorted: [1,3,4,5,6,6,8,9,11], which doesn't match because of the extra 6.

Hence, output "NO".

In the fifth test case:

n=4, c=4, d=4, b=[15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Assuming a_{1,1}=min(b)=3,

Construct the square:

a_{1,1}=3

a_{1,2}=3 + 0*4 + 1*4=7

a_{1,3}=3 + 0*4 + 2*4=11

a_{1,4}=3 + 0*4 + 3*4=15

a_{2,1}=3 + 1*4 + 0*4=7

a_{2,2}=3 + 1*4 + 1*4=11

a_{2,3}=3 + 1*4 + 2*4=15

a_{2,4}=3 + 1*4 + 3*4=19

a_{3,1}=3 + 2*4 + 0*4=11

a_{3,2}=3 + 2*4 + 1*4=15

a_{3,3}=3 + 2*4 + 2*4=19

a_{3,4}=3 + 2*4 + 3*4=23

a_{4,1}=3 + 3*4 + 0*4=15

a_{4,2}=3 + 3*4 + 1*4=19

a_{4,3}=3 + 3*4 + 2*4=23

a_{4,4}=3 + 3*4 + 3*4=27

So, elements: [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27], sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,19,23,23,27]

b sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27], which matches, so output "YES".

But in the example, the output is "NO". Why?

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Looking back at b: [15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Sorted: [3,7,7,11,11,11,15,15,15,15,19,19,23,23,27]

And the square elements: [3,7,11,15,7,11,15,19,11,15,19,23,15,19,23,27], sorted same.

But the example output is "NO", which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the progressive square has unique elements, but in this case, elements are repeated.

Wait, in the fifth test case, the square elements have duplicates, but b has the same frequencies.

Wait, in the square, 7 appears twice, 11 appears three times, 15 appears four times, 19 appears three times, 23 appears two times, and 3 and 27 appear once.

In b, 7 appears twice, 11 appears three times, 15 appears four times, 19 appears twice, 23 appears two times, 3 and 27 appear once.

Wait, a_{4,2}=3 + 3*4 + 1*4=3 + 12 + 4=19

a_{4,3}=3 + 3*4 + 2*4=3 + 12 + 8=23

a_{4,4}=3 + 3*4 + 3*4=3 + 12 + 12=27

So, in the square, 19 appears three times (a_{2,4}, a_{3,4}, a_{4,2}), but in b, 19 appears only twice.

Hence, frequencies don't match, so output should be "NO", which matches the example.

Therefore, the code seems to be incorrect in this case because it only checks if the sorted b matches the sorted elements of the square, but doesn't account for the frequencies of duplicate elements.

Wait, but in the code, it generates the square based on a_{1,1}=min(b), and checks if sorted b matches sorted square elements.

But in this case, with a_{1,1}=3, the square has three 19's, but b has only two 19's, so they don't match.

Hence, the code would return "NO", which is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the code would return "YES", but actually, in this case, it should return "NO", as per the example.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the frequencies.

Wait, in the square:

a_{1,1}=3

a_{1,2}=7

a_{1,3}=11

a_{1,4}=15

a_{2,1}=7

a_{2,2}=11

a_{2,3}=15

a_{2,4}=19

a_{3,1}=11

a_{3,2}=15

a_{3,3}=19

a_{3,4}=23

a_{4,1}=15

a_{4,2}=19

a_{4,3}=23

a_{4,4}=27

So, frequencies in the square:

3:1

7:2

11:3

15:4

19:3

23:2

27:1

In b:

[15,27,7,19,23,23,11,15,7,3,19,23,11,15,11,15]

Counting:

15:4

27:1

7:2

19:2

23:2

11:3

3:1

So, 19 appears twice in b but three times in the square, hence they don't match.

Hence, "NO", which is correct.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, it should return "NO", which it does.

In the second test case, it returns "YES", which is correct.

In the third test case, it returns "YES", which is correct.

In the fourth test case, it returns "NO", which is correct.

In the fifth test case, it returns "NO", which is correct.

Hence, the code seems correct.

But earlier I thought that assuming a_{1,1}=min(b) might not always be correct, but in practice, it seems to work.

Wait, why does it work?

Because a_{1,1} is the smallest element in the square.

Wait, is that always the case?

Given a_{1,1}, c, and d, and constructing the square as a_{i,j}=a_{1,1}+(i-1)*c+(j-1)*d, is a_{1,1} always the smallest element?

Well, if c and d are positive, then yes, a_{1,1} is the smallest.

But in the problem, c and d are given as positive integers (from the input constraints: 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6), so yes, c and d are at least 1.

Hence, a_{1,1} is indeed the smallest element in the square.

Therefore, assuming a_{1,1}=min(b) is correct.

Hence, the code is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given array `b` can form a "progressive square" of size `n` with given constants `c` and `d`. A progressive square is an `n x n` matrix constructed using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d`, where `a_{1,1}` is the top-left element of the matrix.

### Approach

1. **Identify a_{1,1}**: Since `c` and `d` are at least 1, the smallest element in the progressive square is `a_{1,1}`. Therefore, we can determine `a_{1,1}` as the minimum value in the array `b`.

2. **Generate the Progressive Square Elements**: Using the formula for `a_{i,j}`, generate all elements that would be present in the progressive square.

3. **Compare Sorted Lists**: Sort both the generated list of elements from the progressive square and the array `b`. If they match, it means the array `b` can form the progressive square; otherwise, it cannot.

### Solution Code

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(n):
        for h in range(n):
            li.append(a + k * c + h * d)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        c = int(data[index+1])
        d = int(data[index+2])
        b = list(map(int, data[index+3:index+3+n*n]))
        index += n*n + 3
        print(func_1(n, c, d, b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Identify a_{1,1}**: We find the minimum value in `b` which corresponds to `a_{1,1}`.

2. **Generate Elements**: We generate the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1)*c + (j-1)*d` for each position `(i,j)` in the `n x n` matrix.

3. **Sort and Compare**: We sort both the generated list of square elements and the array `b`. If these sorted lists match, it means the array `b` contains exactly the elements of the progressive square, and we output "YES". Otherwise, we output "NO".

This method ensures that we correctly determine if the array `b` can form the progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.
