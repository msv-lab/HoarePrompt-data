Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into substrings where none of these substrings is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba".

First, I need to understand what a partition is. It's an ordered sequence of strings that, when concatenated, form the original string. So, for example, if I have the string "abc", possible partitions could be ["a", "b", "c"], ["ab", "c"], or ["a", "bc"], etc.

My task is to find at least one way to partition the string such that none of the substrings are palindromes. If such a partition exists, I should output "YES", followed by the number of parts in the partition and the parts themselves. If no such partition exists, I should output "NO".

Looking at the constraints, there can be up to 10,000 test cases, and each string can be up to 1,000,000 characters long, but the sum of lengths across all test cases doesn't exceed 1,000,000. So, I need an efficient solution that can handle large strings quickly.

Let me think about when a partition into non-palindromic substrings is possible. If the entire string is not a palindrome, then I can just take the whole string as one substring, and I'm done. So, in that case, it's easy: "YES" followed by 1 and the string itself.

But if the entire string is a palindrome, I need to split it into smaller parts, each of which is not a palindrome. For example, if I have "aaa", which is a palindrome, I can split it into "a" and "aa", but "a" is a palindrome, so that doesn't work. Similarly, "aa" is a palindrome. So, in this case, there's no way to partition "aaa" into non-palindromic substrings. Same with "a", which is trivially a palindrome.

Wait, so for strings that consist of the same character repeated, like "aaa", "bbbb", etc., it's impossible to partition them into non-palindromic substrings because any substring of such a string is also consisting of the same character repeated, which is a palindrome.

So, a string where all characters are the same cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. In such cases, I should output "NO".

Now, what about strings where not all characters are the same? For example, "ab", "abc", "abccba", etc. If the string itself is not a palindrome, I can take the whole string as one substring. If it is a palindrome but has some variations in characters, maybe I can split it in such a way that the substrings are not palindromes.

Let me consider some examples.

Example 1:

Input: "sinktheyacht"

This string is not a palindrome. So, I can output "YES", 1, "sinktheyacht".

Example 2:

Input: "lllllllll"

All characters are 'l', so any substring is a palindrome. Hence, "NO".

Example 3:

Input: "uwuowouwu"

This string is a palindrome. So, I need to see if I can split it into non-palindromic substrings.

Let's try splitting it into "uw", "uow", "ouwu". "uw" is not a palindrome, "uow" is not a palindrome, "ouwu" is not a palindrome. So, this works: "YES", 3, "uw uow ouwu".

Another way: "uw", "uo", "wou", "wu". All of these are not palindromes. So, multiple partitions are possible.

Now, how to generalize this?

I need to check if the entire string is a palindrome. If it's not, output the whole string as one substring.

If it is a palindrome, then I need to try splitting it into smaller parts and check if those parts are not palindromes.

But, if the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, like "aaa", then it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

If the string is a palindrome but has different characters, maybe I can find a way to split it.

Wait, but even if it's a palindrome with different characters, some splits might still result in palindromic substrings.

For example, take "abccba". It's a palindrome. If I split it into "ab", "cc", "ba", then "cc" is a palindrome, so that's invalid.

Alternatively, "abc", "cba". "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome, so that works.

Wait, but "abccba" can be split into "abc" and "cba". Both are not palindromes. So, in this case, it's possible.

So, one approach could be:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output the whole string.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- Check if all characters are the same. If yes, output "NO".

- If not, try to split it into two or more substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

But, how to ensure that such a split exists?

I need to find at least one way to split the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Let me think about the properties of palindromes.

A single character is a palindrome.

A two-character string is a palindrome only if both characters are the same.

A three-character string is a palindrome if the first and last characters are the same.

And so on.

So, for a string to be not a palindrome, there must be at least one pair of symmetric positions around the center that don't match.

Wait, but in the problem, I need to ensure that none of the substrings in the partition are palindromes.

So, perhaps I can look for positions where splitting the string would result in at least one substring that is not a palindrome.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that if a string has at least two different characters not symmetrically placed, I can split it in a way that avoids creating palindromic substrings.

Wait, perhaps I should look for positions where the characters differ from their symmetric positions.

For example, in "abccba", the first 'a' matches the last 'a', the second 'b' matches the second-to-last 'b', and the middle 'c' matches itself.

So, it's a perfect palindrome.

But, in "abccba", if I split it into "ab", "cc", "ba", "ab" and "ba" are not palindromes, but "cc" is. So, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, split into "abc", "cba". "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome. So, that works.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings, if I can split it into two parts that are not palindromes, that would suffice.

But, is there a general way to do this?

Let me think about the structure of the string.

If the string is a palindrome and has even length, splitting it into two equal halves would give two halves that are reverses of each other. If these halves are not palindromes themselves, then maybe they can be considered non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but if the halves are not palindromes, then yes.

For example, in "abccba", splitting into "abc" and "cba": "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, in "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba": both are not palindromes.

But, in "racecar", splitting into "race" and "car": "race" is not a palindrome, "car" is not a palindrome.

Seems promising.

But, what if the halves are palindromes themselves?

For example, "abba" splits into "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes.

Wait, "ab" is not a palindrome.

Another example: "aabbcc", which is not a palindrome, so I can take the whole string.

Wait, "aabbcc" is not a palindrome, so it's easy.

What about "abcba", which is a palindrome?

Split into "abc" and "ba". "abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

Another way: "ab", "c", "ba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "c" is a palindrome. So, that's invalid.

So, choosing the right split is important.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings, splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome works, provided that the parts are not palindromes.

But, how to ensure that the parts are not palindromes?

Well, for two parts, if the original string is a palindrome, and I split it into two non-empty parts, then as long as the two parts are not palindromes, it should be fine.

But, how to ensure that?

Wait, in a palindromic string, if I split it into two parts of unequal lengths, then the two parts are not reverses of each other, so they might not be palindromes.

Wait, no. For example, in "abccba", splitting into "abc" and "cba": "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba": "abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba": both are not palindromes.

In "aa", splitting into "a" and "a": both are palindromes.

Wait, but "aa" is a palindrome, and splitting into "a" and "a" gives palindromic substrings, which is invalid.

So, in cases where the string is a palindrome and all characters are the same, splitting into single characters won't work because single characters are palindromes.

Similarly, splitting "aa" into "a" and "a" is invalid.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings where all characters are the same, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

But, for palindromic strings where not all characters are the same, maybe it's possible.

Wait, but in "abccba", splitting into "abc" and "cba" works, both of which are not palindromes.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

In "abba", splitting into "ab" and "ba" works.

In "aabbcc", which is not a palindrome, taking the whole string works.

In "aa", splitting into "a" and "a" is invalid.

In "aba", splitting into "ab" and "a" is invalid because "a" is a palindrome.

Wait, but "ab" is not a palindrome, and "a" is a palindrome, so the whole partition is invalid.

So, in "aba", maybe another split: "a", "ba". "a" is a palindrome, invalid.

Or "aba" as a single substring, which is a palindrome, invalid.

So, is there any way to partition "aba"?

Wait, "ab", "a". "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome. Invalid.

"aba" as a single substring is a palindrome. Invalid.

So, "aba" cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

But "aba" consists of characters that are the same: 'a's and one 'b' in the middle.

Wait, no, 'a' and 'b' are different characters.

But the string is a palindrome.

So, even if not all characters are the same, if the string is a palindrome, it might still be impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in "abccba", I could split into "abc" and "cba", both not palindromes.

In "abcba", I could split into "abc" and "ba", both not palindromes.

But in "aba", splitting into "ab" and "a" has "a" as a palindrome, and "aba" itself is a palindrome.

So, maybe for strings of length 3 where the first and last characters are the same, and the middle one is different, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but "abccba" is length 6, which is even, and I could split it into two parts that are not palindromes.

Similarly, "abba" is length 4, split into "ab" and "ba".

But "aba" is length 3, which is odd, and it seems impossible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings of odd length where the middle character is different from the others, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in "abccba", which is even length, I could split it into two non-palindromic substrings.

In "abcba", which is odd length, splitting into "abc" and "ba" gives "abc" which is not a palindrome, and "ba" which is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "abcba" is a palindrome, and "abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was impossible, but actually, it's possible.

So, perhaps for any palindromic string where not all characters are the same, it's possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

But, in "aba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" doesn't apply because "aba" only has length 3.

Wait, "aba" is length 3.

Let me try splitting "aba" into "ab" and "a". "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome. Invalid.

Splitting into "a" and "ba". "a" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome. Still invalid because "a" is a palindrome.

Taking "ab" and "a" or "a" and "ba", both have "a" which is a palindrome.

Taking "aba" as a single substring, which is a palindrome. Invalid.

So, in this case, it's impossible.

Wait, but in "abcba", which is length 5, splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

Similarly, in "abccba", which is length 6, splitting into "abc" and "cba" works.

But in "aba", which is length 3, it seems impossible.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings where the length is odd and the middle character is different from the others, it's impossible.

Wait, in "abccba", the middle characters are 'c's, which are the same.

In "abcba", the middle character is 'c', which is different from 'a's.

But in "abccba", splitting works, and in "abcba", splitting works.

Wait, in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

In "aba", splitting into "ab" and "a" doesn't work because "a" is a palindrome.

Wait, maybe in "aba", splitting into "ab" and "a" doesn't work, but is there another way?

Is there any way to split "aba" into non-palindromic substrings?

Let's see:

- "a", "b", "a": all are palindromes.

- "ab", "a": "ab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome.

- "a", "ba": "a" is a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

- "aba": is a palindrome.

So, no valid partition exists for "aba".

But in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

So, perhaps for longer palindromic strings, it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings, but for shorter ones, it might not be possible.

Wait, but in "abcba", which is length 5, splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

In "abccba", which is length 6, splitting into "abc" and "cba" works.

In "aba", which is length 3, no split works.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings with length >=4, it's possible to split them into non-palindromic substrings, but for lengths <=3, it might not be possible in some cases.

Wait, "abccba" is length 6, split into "abc" and "cba".

"abcba" is length 5, split into "abc" and "ba".

So, perhaps for palindromic strings of length >=4, it's possible to split them into two non-palindromic substrings.

But, for lengths <=3, it might not always be possible.

For example:

- Length 1: "a" -> cannot be split.

- Length 2: "aa" -> cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

- "ab" -> can be split as "ab" which is not a palindrome.

- Length 3: "aba" -> cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

- "abc" -> can be split as "abc" which is not a palindrome.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings:

- If the string has all characters the same, output "NO".

- Else, if the string length is >=4, split it into two parts, each of length >=2, which are not palindromes.

- For string lengths 2 and 3, check if they can be split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in "ab", which is length 2 and not a palindrome, can be taken as a single substring.

In "aa", which is length 2 and a palindrome, cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "abc", which is length 3 and not a palindrome, can be taken as a single substring.

In "aba", which is length 3 and a palindrome, cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output the whole string as one substring.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else:

- If the string length >=4, split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- If the string length is 2 or 3, check if it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

- For length 2: only possible if the two characters are different.

- For length 3: split into two parts, one of length 1 and the other of length 2, and check if both are not palindromes.

But, in "ab", which is length 2 and not a palindrome, can be taken as a single substring.

In "aa", which is length 2 and a palindrome, cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "aba", which is length 3 and a palindrome, cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "abc", which is length 3 and not a palindrome, can be taken as a single substring.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, if the string length >=4, split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- For string lengths 2 and 3, output "NO" if all characters are the same or if it's a palindrome that cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but for length 2, if the characters are different, it's not a palindrome, so can be taken as a single substring.

For length 3, if it's a palindrome, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps the general rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output the whole string as one substring.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else:

- If the string length >=4, split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- For string lengths 2 and 3, output "NO" if it's a palindrome.

Wait, but for length 2, if it's not a palindrome, output the whole string.

So, perhaps:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output the whole string as one substring.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else:

- If the string length >=4, split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- For string lengths 2 and 3, output "NO".

But, in "ab", which is length 2 and not a palindrome, output the whole string.

In "aa", which is length 2 and a palindrome, output "NO".

In "aba", which is length 3 and a palindrome, output "NO".

In "abc", which is length 3 and not a palindrome, output the whole string.

In "abccba", which is length 6 and a palindrome, split into "abc" and "cba".

In "abcba", which is length 5 and a palindrome, split into "abc" and "ba".

So, this seems consistent.

Now, I need to implement this logic efficiently.

First, for each test case:

- Read the string.

- Check if it's a palindrome.

- If not, output "YES", 1, and the string.

- If it is a palindrome:

- Check if all characters are the same.

- If yes, output "NO".

- Else:

- If the string length >=4, split it into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- For string lengths 2 and 3, output "NO".

But, how to ensure that the splits are not palindromes?

For example, in "abccba", splitting into "abc" and "cba" works.

In "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba" works.

So, perhaps splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome is sufficient.

But, how to ensure that the parts are not palindromes?

Well, in "abccba", "abc" is not a palindrome, and "cba" is not a palindrome.

In "abcba", "abc" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings of length >=4, splitting into two parts where each part has length >=2 works.

Because a string of length >=2 with different characters is not a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abccba", "abc" is not a palindrome, and "cba" is not a palindrome.

Similarly, in "abcba", "abc" is not a palindrome, and "ba" is not a palindrome.

But, what if the string is "aabbcc", which is a palindrome, and splitting into "aab" and "bcc" which are not palindromes.

So, seems like splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome works.

But, to be safe, I need to ensure that the parts are indeed not palindromes.

How to do that efficiently?

One way is to choose a split position such that neither part is a palindrome.

Given that the original string is a palindrome, but not all characters are the same, I can find a position to split where the two parts are not palindromes.

How?

Well, since the string is a palindrome, splitting it into two halves would give two parts that are reverses of each other.

But, if the string is of even length, splitting into two equal parts would give two parts that are reverses.

But, if the string is of odd length, splitting into two parts of different lengths would give parts that are not necessarily reverses.

But, in practice, for strings of length >=4, splitting into two parts where each part has length >=2 should work, because if the string is not composed of all identical characters, then the parts are unlikely to be palindromes.

But, to be sure, I can check if the parts are not palindromes.

Alternatively, I can choose to split the string into two parts where the first part is not a palindrome, and the second part is not a palindrome.

To check if a string is a palindrome, I can compare it with its reverse.

But, for efficiency, since the sum of lengths across all test cases is up to 1,000,000, I need an efficient way to check for palindromes.

A straightforward way is to reverse the string and check if it's equal to the original.

But, for multiple test cases, I need to optimize this.

Also, checking if all characters are the same can be done by counting the frequency of the first character.

So, let's outline the steps:

For each test case:

1. Read the string s.

2. Check if s is a palindrome:

- Reverse s and check if it's equal to s.

3. If s is not a palindrome:

- Output "YES", 1, s.

4. Else (s is a palindrome):

- Check if all characters in s are the same:

- Count the frequency of the first character.

- If the frequency equals the length of s, output "NO".

5. Else (s is a palindrome but not all characters are the same):

- If the length of s >=4:

- Split s into two parts, e.g., first part of length len(s)//2, second part accordingly.

- Check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output "YES", 2, and the two parts.

- Else, try a different split position.

- For lengths 2 and 3, output "NO".

But, for lengths 2 and 3, which are palindromic, it's impossible to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, for length 2:

- If the two characters are different, the whole string is not a palindrome, so output the whole string.

- If the two characters are the same, it's a palindrome, and splitting into single characters is invalid because single characters are palindromes.

So, for palindromic strings of length 2, output "NO".

For non-palindromic strings of length 2, output the whole string.

Similarly, for length 3:

- If it's a palindrome, output "NO".

- If it's not a palindrome, output the whole string.

So, to generalize:

- If s is not a palindrome, output "YES", 1, s.

- If s is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else:

- If len(s) >=4, try to split into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

- For len(s) == 2 or 3, output "NO".

But, I need to ensure that the splits result in non-palindromic substrings.

Let me think about how to split the string for len(s) >=4.

Suppose s is a palindrome and not all characters are the same.

Then, there exists at least one position where s[i] != s[-(i+1)].

I can look for such positions and split the string accordingly.

Wait, but since s is a palindrome, s[i] == s[-(i+1)] for all i.

Wait, no, that's the definition of a palindrome.

Wait, if s is a palindrome, s[i] == s[-(i+1)] for all i.

So, if s is a palindrome, and not all characters are the same, there must be at least one position where s[i] != s[i+1], because if s[i] == s[-(i+1)] for all i, and s is not uniform, there must be at least one position where consecutive characters differ.

Wait, not necessarily. For example, "abba" is a palindrome, and s[0] != s[1], but s[1] == s[2].

So, in "abba", s[0] != s[3], but s[1] == s[2].

Wait, but s[0] == s[3] and s[1] == s[2].

Wait, in a palindrome, s[i] == s[-(i+1)] for all i.

So, in "abba", s[0] == s[3], s[1] == s[2].

Wait, but s[0] != s[1], so it's okay.

So, perhaps I can split the string into two parts where the first part is not a palindrome.

For example, in "abba", split into "ab" and "ba". Both are not palindromes.

In "abcba", split into "abc" and "ba". "abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

In "abccba", split into "abc" and "cba". Both are not palindromes.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings of length >=4, splitting into two parts where each part has length >=2 works.

Because, for a part to be a palindrome, it must have s[i] == s[-(i+1)], but since the original string is a palindrome, splitting into two parts where each part is not a palindrome should be possible if the parts are not palindromes themselves.

Wait, but "abcba" split into "abc" and "ba":

- "abc" is not a palindrome.

- "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, it works.

Similarly, "abccba" split into "abc" and "cba":

- "abc" is not a palindrome.

- "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, seems consistent.

But, what if the string is "aabbcc", which is a palindrome.

Splitting into "aab" and "bcc":

- "aab" is not a palindrome.

- "bcc" is not a palindrome.

So, it works.

Another example: "abba", split into "ab" and "ba": both not palindromes.

So, perhaps for palindromic strings of length >=4, splitting into two parts where each part has length >=2 works.

But, to be safe, I should check if the parts are not palindromes.

But, in practice, since the original string is a palindrome and not all characters are the same, splitting into two parts where each part has length >=2 should result in parts that are not palindromes.

Because, if both parts were palindromes, their concatenation would also be a palindrome only if the parts are reverses of each other.

Wait, but since the original string is a palindrome, and we're splitting into two parts, if both parts are palindromes, then the first part should be the reverse of the second part.

But, in our earlier splits, "abc" and "cba" are both palindromes, but "abc" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "abc" is not a palindrome because "abc" != "cba".

Wait, in Python, s == s[::-1] checks if s is a palindrome.

So, in "abc", "abc" != "cba", so it's not a palindrome.

Similarly, "ba" != "ab", so not a palindrome.

So, in practice, splitting a palindromic string into two parts where each part has length >=2 works, because the parts are not palindromes.

Hence, in code, for palindromic strings of length >=4, split into two parts, each of length >=2, and output them.

For palindromic strings of length 2 or 3 where not all characters are the same, check if they can be split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but for length 2, if it's a palindrome, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

For length 3, if it's a palindrome, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, in code:

- If s is not a palindrome:

- Output "YES", 1, s.

- Else (s is a palindrome):

- If all characters are the same:

- Output "NO".

- Else:

- If len(s) >=4:

- Split into two parts, each of length >=2, and output them.

- Else (len(s) == 2 or 3):

- Output "NO".

This seems efficient and should work within the time constraints.

Now, let's think about edge cases:

1. Single character: "a" -> "NO", since "a" is a palindrome.

2. Two identical characters: "aa" -> "NO", since both "a" are palindromes.

3. Two different characters: "ab" -> "YES", 1, "ab".

4. Three identical characters: "aaa" -> "NO".

5. Three different characters where it's a palindrome: "aba" -> "NO".

6. Three different characters where it's not a palindrome: "abc" -> "YES", 1, "abc".

7. Longer palindromic strings like "abccba" -> "YES", 2, "abc" and "cba".

8. Longer non-palindromic strings like "sinktheyacht" -> "YES", 1, "sinktheyacht".

9. Strings with all characters the same, like "aaaaaaa" -> "NO".

10. Strings where splitting into two parts results in one part being a palindrome: need to ensure that both parts are not palindromes.

Wait, but in practice, for palindromic strings of length >=4, splitting into two parts where each part has length >=2 should result in both parts not being palindromes, as we've seen in examples.

Hence, this approach should work.

Now, implement this logic in code.

Efficiency:

- Checking if s is a palindrome: O(n).

- Checking if all characters are the same: O(n).

- Splitting the string: O(1).

- Total time per test case: O(n).

With t test cases and sum of n over all test cases <= 10^6, this should be efficient enough.

Hence, the program provided seems correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to partition a given string into substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. 

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
   - We need to partition the string into substrings that are not palindromes.
   
2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the string is not a palindrome, we can take the entire string as one substring.
   - If the string is a palindrome:
     - If all characters are the same, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.
     - For longer palindromic strings (length >= 4), we can split into two parts, each of which is not a palindrome.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Check if the string is a palindrome.
   - If it is not a palindrome, output the whole string as one substring.
   - If it is a palindrome:
     - Check if all characters are the same. If so, output "NO".
     - If not, and the length is at least 4, split into two parts and output them.
     - For lengths 2 or 3, output "NO" since it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

## Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        string = data[idx]
        idx += 1
        s = list(string)
        n = len(s)
        done = False
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        x = s[0]
        if x != s[-1]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        if s.count(x) == n:
            print('NO')
            continue
        elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
            if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(string)
            continue
        # Check if the string is a palindrome
        is_palindrome = True
        for i in range(n // 2):
            if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
                is_palindrome = False
                break
        if not is_palindrome:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        # If it is a palindrome and not all characters are the same
        if n >= 4:
            # Split into two parts
            mid = n // 2
            part1 = ''.join(s[:mid])
            part2 = ''.join(s[mid:])
            # Check if both parts are not palindromes
            is_part1_palindrome = part1 == part1[::-1]
            is_part2_palindrome = part2 == part2[::-1]
            if not is_part1_palindrome and not is_part2_palindrome:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(part1, part2)
            else:
                # Try a different split position
                for split in range(2, n-1):
                    part1 = ''.join(s[:split])
                    part2 = ''.join(s[split:])
                    is_part1_palindrome = part1 == part1[::-1]
                    is_part2_palindrome = part2 == part2[::-1]
                    if not is_part1_palindrome and not is_part2_palindrome:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(part1, part2)
                        done = True
                        break
                if not done:
                    print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')

## Explanation

- **Step-by-step Breakdown:**
  1. Read the input values.
  2. For each test case, check if the string is a palindrome.
  3. If it is not a palindrome, simply output the whole string as one substring.
  4. If it is a palindrome:
     - Check if all characters are the same. If so, output "NO" because it's impossible to partition.
     - If not, and the string length is at least 4, attempt to split the string into two parts that are not palindromes.
     - For lengths 2 or 3, output "NO" as it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

- **Efficiency:**
  - Each test case is processed in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string.
  - Given the constraints, this approach efficiently handles up to 10^6 characters in total across all test cases.
