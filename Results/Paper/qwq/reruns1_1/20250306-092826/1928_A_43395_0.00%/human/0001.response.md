Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles are the same up to rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with, using this process.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, parallel to one of the sides. So, if he has a rectangle of size a by b, he can either cut it into two rectangles of size a by something, or something by b.

Let's think about the possible ways he can cut the rectangle. If he cuts horizontally, he's dividing the height, so he gets two rectangles of size a by k and a by (b - k), where k is between 1 and b-1. Similarly, if he cuts vertically, he gets two rectangles of size k by b and (a - k) by b.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles, and he can rotate and move them around to try to form a new rectangle. The new rectangle can be of different dimensions, but again, rotations don't count as different.

The problem is to determine if, after this process, Bob can end up with a rectangle that is different from the one he started with, considering the rotation equivalence.

Let's look at the examples provided to get a better understanding.

In the first test case, the rectangle is 1x1. He can't cut it into two smaller rectangles because 1 can't be divided further into integers. So, he can't form any other rectangle, hence "No".

In the second test case, 2x1. If he cuts it horizontally, he gets two 2x1 rectangles. He can't form any new rectangle because combining them would give him back the same 2x1 or a 1x4, but 1x4 is considered the same as 4x1, which is different from the original 2x1. But according to the example, the answer is "No", so maybe there's a restriction I'm missing.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that for the 2x1 rectangle, it can only be cut into two 1x1 rectangles, and from those, only 1x2 or 2x1 can be formed, which are considered the same as the original. So, in this case, since the new rectangle is considered the same as the original, the answer is "No".

In the third test case, 2x6. It says he can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles, and then form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6, so "Yes".

In the fourth test case, 3x2. He can cut it into two 3x1 rectangles, and then form a 1x6 rectangle, which is considered the same as 6x1, but different from the original 3x2, so "Yes".

In the fifth test case, 2x2. He can cut it into two 1x2 rectangles, and then form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2, so "Yes".

In the sixth test case, 2x4. He can cut it into two 2x2 rectangles, and then form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4, so maybe "No"? But the example says "Yes". Wait, in the example output, it's "Yes", but according to my reasoning, forming a 4x2 rectangle is the same as 2x4, so should it be "No"? Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the key is whether the new rectangle has the same area as the original but different dimensions up to rotation.

Wait, in the 2x4 case, the area is 8. If he cuts it into two 2x2 rectangles, he can form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as 2x4, so no new rectangle. But the example says "Yes". So maybe there's another way to cut it.

Alternatively, if he cuts the 2x4 rectangle vertically into two 1x4 rectangles, then he can form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4. So, in this case, "Yes".

Ah, so the way I was thinking about it initially was incomplete. He can cut it vertically as well, and that leads to a different rectangle.

So, to generalize, for a given a x b rectangle:

- He can cut it horizontally into two a x k and a x (b - k) rectangles.

- Or vertically into two k x b and (a - k) x b rectangles.

Then, he can combine these two smaller rectangles in different ways to form a new rectangle.

Given that, I need to find if there's any way to cut the rectangle and recombine the pieces to form a new rectangle that is not equivalent to the original one under rotation.

Let me try to find a general condition for when this is possible.

First, consider that the area of the new rectangle must be the same as the original one, since we're just rearranging the pieces.

So, the area is a * b.

Now, when he cuts the rectangle, say horizontally, into a x k and a x (b - k), then he has two rectangles of those sizes.

He can then try to arrange these two rectangles together to form a new rectangle.

One way is to place them side by side, which would give a rectangle of size a x b, which is the same as the original.

Or, he can stack them, which would give a rectangle of size (a + a) x k, but that would be 2a x k, which may or may not be equivalent to the original.

But, considering that he can rotate the pieces, perhaps there are other configurations.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the total perimeter and see if that helps.

Wait, maybe not.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If the original rectangle is a square (a = b), then any cutting and rearranging should result in rectangles that are either the same square or smaller rectangles, but perhaps not a different square.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, the example says "Yes", meaning he can form a different rectangle.

Wait, in the 2x2 case, cutting it vertically into two 1x2 rectangles, and then combining them horizontally would give a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

So, in this case, it's possible.

Similarly, in the 1x1 case, it's not possible because you can't cut it.

In the 2x1 case, cutting it into two 1x1 rectangles, and then combining them to form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is considered the same as the original, so "No".

In the 3x2 case, cutting it into two 3x1 rectangles, and then combining them to form a 3x2 rectangle, which is the same, or a 1x6 rectangle, which is different.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, is 1x6 considered different from 3x2?

Well, 1x6 and 6x1 are considered the same, and 3x2 and 2x3 are considered the same.

So, 1x6 is different from 3x2.

Hence, "Yes".

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, cutting it into two 2x2 rectangles, and combining them to form a 4x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x4, or cutting it into two 1x4 rectangles and combining them to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different.

Hence, "Yes".

Wait, but in the 6x3 case, which is the same as 3x6, and the answer is "No".

Wait, 6x3 is the same as 3x6, which might be considered the same as the original 3x6 if a and b are swapped.

Wait, in the example, it's 6x3, and the answer is "No".

But according to the previous logic, cutting it into two 3x3 rectangles and combining them to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original, or cutting it into two 6x1 rectangles and combining them to form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different.

So, why is the answer "No"?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90 degree rotation, they are considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6x4 and 4x6 are considered the same."

Hence, in the 6x3 case, the new rectangle would be 3x6, which is the same as 6x3, so no new rectangle is formed.

Wait, but 6x3 and 3x6 are considered the same.

So, in that case, "No".

Similarly, in the 2x4 case, forming a 1x8 rectangle, which is considered the same as 8x1, which is different from the original 2x4.

But in the example, it's "Yes".

Wait, but according to the problem statement, for 6x3, it's "No", even though you can form a 3x6, which is the same as 6x3.

Similarly, for 2x4, forming a 1x8, which is different from 2x4.

Hence, "Yes".

Wait, perhaps the condition is that if the new rectangle has the same area and different dimensions up to rotation, then it's considered different.

Wait, but in the 6x3 case, forming a 3x6 is the same as 6x3, so "No".

In the 2x4 case, forming a 1x8 is different from 2x4, so "Yes".

Hence, in the 6x3 case, "No".

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, forming a 1x6, which is different from 3x2, so "Yes".

Similarly, in the 2x2 case, forming a 1x4, which is different from 2x2, so "Yes".

In the 2x1 case, forming a 1x2, which is the same as 2x1, so "No".

In the 1x1 case, can't be cut, so "No".

In the 2x6 case, forming a 4x3, which is different from 2x6, so "Yes".

Hence, perhaps the general condition is that if at least one of the sides is even, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, 6 is even, but the answer is "No".

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, both sides are divisible by 3, which might be the issue.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

Wait, in the 6x3 case, GCD is 3, and the answer is "No".

In the 2x4 case, GCD is 2, and the answer is "Yes".

In the 2x2 case, GCD is 2, and the answer is "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, GCD is 1, and the answer is "Yes".

Wait, no, 3x2 has GCD 1, and answer is "Yes".

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe it's related to whether a or b is even.

In the 1x1 case, both odd, "No".

In the 2x1 case, a is even, but answer is "No".

In the 2x6 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, one even, "Yes".

In the 2x2 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 2x4 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, one even, "No".

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether both a and b are odd or not.

If both are odd, like 1x1, "No".

If at least one is even, then "Yes", except in some cases like 6x3.

Wait, in 6x3, a is even, b is odd, answer is "No".

Wait, maybe it's more complicated.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have a rectangle a x b.

After cutting, we have two smaller rectangles.

Let's say we cut horizontally into a x k and a x (b - k).

Then, we can arrange these two rectangles in two ways:

1. Place them side by side horizontally, forming a rectangle of a x b, which is the same as the original.

2. Place them vertically, forming a rectangle of (a + a) x k, which is 2a x k.

Similarly, if we cut vertically into k x b and (a - k) x b, and arrange them in two ways:

1. Place them vertically, forming a rectangle of a x b, same as original.

2. Place them horizontally, forming a rectangle of k x 2b.

Now, we need to see if any of these new rectangles are different from the original, considering rotation.

So, for the horizontal cut and vertical arrangement, we get 2a x k.

The original rectangle is a x b.

For 2a x k to be different from a x b, we need to check if 2a = b and k = a, or if 2a = a and k = b, but 2a = a only if a = 0, which is invalid.

Similarly, for vertical cut and horizontal arrangement, we get k x 2b.

Comparing to a x b, we need to see if k x 2b is different from a x b.

So, in general, it seems that if we can find a way to cut and arrange the pieces such that the new rectangle has dimensions that are not equal to the original dimensions or their rotation, then the answer is "Yes".

But this seems too vague. Let's look for a mathematical condition.

Perhaps it's related to the number of ways to factorize the area.

Wait, but that might be too broad.

Let me consider specific cases.

Case 1: Both a and b are odd.

In this case, cutting the rectangle will result in smaller rectangles with at least one odd side.

When combining two rectangles, if both have odd sides, the new rectangle will have at least one odd side.

Hence, the new rectangle cannot be equivalent to the original one unless it has the same dimensions.

But since the original rectangle has both sides odd, and the new rectangle has at least one side odd, but possibly different dimensions, it might be different.

But in the 1x1 case, it's "No", and in the 3x1 case (if there was one), it would be "No".

Wait, perhaps only if both a and b are odd, it's "No".

But in the 3x1 case, it should be "No", but according to the example, 2x1 is "No".

Wait, but 3x1 is not in the example.

Wait, perhaps if both a and b are odd, and a != b, it's "Yes", but for 1x1, it's "No".

Wait, need a better approach.

Let me consider the parity of a and b.

If both a and b are even, then we can cut the rectangle into four smaller rectangles of size a/2 x b/2, but that might not directly help.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible cuts and arrangements.

Suppose a is even.

Then, we can cut the rectangle vertically into two a/2 x b rectangles.

Then, we can arrange them horizontally to form a rectangle of a/2 x 2b.

If a/2 x 2b is different from a x b, then it's a different rectangle.

Similarly, if b is even, we can cut horizontally and arrange to form 2a x b/2.

So, in general, if either a or b is even, we can form a different rectangle.

But in the 6x3 case, a is even, and we get a different rectangle, but the example says "No".

Wait, but in the 6x3 case, 6 is even, and cutting vertically into two 3x3 rectangles, and arranging them horizontally gives a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3, so no new rectangle.

Similarly, cutting horizontally into two 6x1.5 rectangles, but since dimensions must be integers, it's not allowed.

Wait, but 1.5 is not an integer, so invalid.

Hence, only valid cut is vertical into two 3x3 rectangles, which when arranged horizontally give 3x6, which is the same as 6x3.

Hence, "No".

In the 2x4 case, a=2, b=4.

Cut vertically into two 1x4 rectangles, arrange horizontally to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from 2x4.

Hence, "Yes".

Similarly, in the 2x2 case, cut vertically into two 1x2 rectangles, arrange horizontally to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x2.

Hence, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, cut vertically into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but 1.5 is not integer, invalid.

Hence, only valid cut is horizontal into two 3x1 rectangles, arrange horizontally to form a 3x2 rectangle, same as original, or vertically to form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from 3x2.

Hence, "Yes".

Wait, but 6x1 is considered different from 3x2.

Wait, but 6x1 and 1x6 are considered the same, and 3x2 and 2x3 are considered the same.

So, 6x1 is different from 3x2.

Hence, "Yes".

So, in summary:

- If at least one of a or b is even, then it's possible to form a different rectangle.

- If both a and b are odd, then it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

But in the 6x3 case, a is even, but the answer is "No".

Wait, why is that?

Because, although a is even, the only valid cut is vertical into two 3x3 rectangles, and arranging them gives 3x6, which is the same as 6x3.

Hence, no new rectangle is formed.

So, the condition is not just that at least one is even, but also that the new rectangle formed is different from the original one.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, and that a does not equal b.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, a = b, and the answer is "Yes".

Wait, in the 2x2 case, cutting vertically into two 1x2 rectangles, and arranging them horizontally to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x2.

Hence, "Yes".

So, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even.

In the 1x1 case, both are odd, "No".

In the 2x1 case, a is even, but forming a 1x2, which is the same as 2x1, so "No".

Wait, but according to this, it should be "Yes", but the example says "No".

Wait, perhaps I need to consider more carefully.

In the 2x1 case, cutting vertically into two 1x1 rectangles, and arranging them horizontally to form a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1, so "No".

In the 2x2 case, cutting vertically into two 1x2 rectangles, and arranging them horizontally to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2, so "Yes".

In the 2x4 case, cutting vertically into two 1x4 rectangles, and arranging them horizontally to form a 1x8 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4, so "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, cutting vertically into two 3x3 rectangles, and arranging them horizontally to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3, so "No".

Hence, the condition seems to be that if there exists a way to cut the rectangle such that after rearranging the pieces, the new rectangle has different dimensions from the original, considering rotation.

In other words, after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle should not be equal to the original rectangle or its rotation.

Hence, perhaps the condition is that the area has more than one distinct factorization.

Wait, but that might not capture the rotation aspect.

Wait, more precisely, if the area a*b can be factored into c*d, where c != a or d != b, and c != b or d != a.

In other words, if there exists a pair (c, d) such that c*d = a*b, c != a, d != b, and c != b, d != a.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose we have a rectangle a x b.

After cutting and rearranging, we get a rectangle c x d, where c*d = a*b.

Moreover, c != a or d != b, considering that c and d can be rotated.

Hence, c != a or d != b, and also c != b or d != a.

In other words, the new rectangle is different from the original and its rotation.

Hence, to have "Yes", there must exist at least one way to cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form such a c x d rectangle.

Now, considering the cutting part, the cuts must be parallel to the sides, and the resulting pieces must have integer dimensions.

Hence, when cutting horizontally, we get two a x k and a x (b - k) rectangles.

Similarly, cutting vertically, we get two k x b and (a - k) x b rectangles.

Then, arranging these two pieces together, we can place them either side by side or one above the other.

Hence, for horizontal cuts:

- Placing the two a x k and a x (b - k) rectangles side by side horizontally gives a rectangle a x b, same as original.

- Placing them vertically gives a rectangle (a + a) x k = 2a x k.

Similarly, for vertical cuts:

- Placing the two k x b and (a - k) x b rectangles vertically gives a rectangle a x b, same as original.

- Placing them horizontally gives a rectangle k x 2b.

Hence, the possible new rectangles are:

- 2a x k

- k x 2b

We need to check if either of these is different from the original rectangle and its rotation.

Hence, for "Yes", there must exist some k such that:

- 2a x k != a x b and 2a x k != b x a

- Or k x 2b != a x b and k x 2b != b x a

But k can be from 1 to b-1 for horizontal cuts and from 1 to a-1 for vertical cuts.

Wait, but k must be such that the pieces have integer dimensions.

Hence, k must be an integer between 1 and b-1 for horizontal cuts, and between 1 and a-1 for vertical cuts.

Now, let's consider that.

For horizontal cuts:

- New rectangle: 2a x k

We need to have 2a x k != a x b and 2a x k != b x a

Similarly, for vertical cuts:

- New rectangle: k x 2b

We need k x 2b != a x b and k x 2b != b x a

Hence, if there exists a k such that 2a x k is different from a x b and b x a, then "Yes".

Similarly, if there exists a k such that k x 2b is different from a x b and b x a, then "Yes".

Now, let's see.

In the 2x1 case:

- Horizontal cut: 2 x k and 2 x (1 - k), but k can be 1 only.

- New rectangle: 4 x 1, which is the same as 1 x 4, which is considered the same as 4 x 1.

- But 4x1 is different from 2x1, but according to the example, it's "No".

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, cutting horizontally into two 2x1 rectangles and arranging them horizontally gives a 2x2 rectangle, which is different from 2x1.

Wait, but according to the example, it's "No".

Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is not allowed in that way.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when arranging the pieces, their orientations are fixed.

Wait, no, the problem says Bob can rotate and move the pieces as he wishes.

Hence, in the 2x1 case:

- Cut horizontally into two 2x1 rectangles.

- Arrange them horizontally to form a 2x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x1.

- Arrange them vertically to form a 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x1.

But according to the example, the answer is "No".

Hence, perhaps there's an additional constraint.

Wait, perhaps the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original and its rotation, but also, the pieces must
