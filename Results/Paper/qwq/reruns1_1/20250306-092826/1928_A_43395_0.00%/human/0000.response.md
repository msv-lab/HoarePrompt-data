Alright, I have this problem to solve. Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The goal is to determine if he can form a different rectangle from the original one, considering that rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. So, Bob starts with a rectangle of size a x b. He makes one cut parallel to either side, resulting in two smaller rectangles. Then, he tries to rearrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, where "different" means not the same as the original rectangle or its 90-degree rotation.

Let me think about the possible ways Bob can cut the rectangle. He can either cut parallel to the length (a) or parallel to the width (b). For example, if he cuts parallel to side a, he would be dividing side b into two parts, say b1 and b2, such that b1 + b2 = b. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to side b, he divides side a into two parts, a1 and a2, with a1 + a2 = a.

After cutting, he has two smaller rectangles. He can rotate and move these rectangles to form a new rectangle. The key here is that the new rectangle should be different from the original one, meaning its dimensions should not be the same as the original rectangle or its rotated version.

I need to find a general rule or condition to determine, for any given a and b, whether it's possible for Bob to form such a different rectangle.

Let me look at some examples from the problem statement to get a better understanding.

First test case:

1 1

This is a 1x1 square. If Bob tries to cut it, say into two 1x0.5 rectangles, but since the problem specifies integer sides, I need to check if 0.5 is an integer, which it's not. So, likely, cuts must result in integer dimensions. Therefore, a cut parallel to side a would try to divide b into two integers, but b=1, so the only possible division is 0 and 1, but 0 is not a valid dimension. Similarly, cutting parallel to b would try to divide a=1 into 0 and 1. So, no valid cuts are possible, hence no new rectangle can be formed. Output should be "No".

Second test case:

2 1

A 2x1 rectangle. Let's see possible cuts.

If Bob cuts parallel to side a (length 2), he can divide side b (1) into two integers that sum to 1. The only way is 0 and 1, but 0 is invalid. So, no valid cut in that direction.

If he cuts parallel to side b (length 1), he can divide side a (2) into two integers that sum to 2, say 1 and 1. So, he gets two 1x1 rectangles.

Now, from two 1x1 rectangles, he can arrange them to form either a 2x1 rectangle or a 1x2 rectangle, which are considered the same (since one is just a 90-degree rotation of the other). So, he cannot form a different rectangle from the original 2x1. Output should be "No".

Third test case:

2 6

A 2x6 rectangle. Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to side a (length 2): divide b=6 into two integers, say 1 and 5, or 2 and 4, or 3 and 3.

- Cut parallel to side b (length 6): divide a=2 into two integers, say 1 and 1.

Let's consider cutting parallel to side a, dividing b into 2 and 4:

- Two rectangles: 2x2 and 2x4.

Now, from these two rectangles, he can arrange them in different ways:

- Place them side by side along their a sides: 2 + 2 = 4 in width, height remains 2, so 4x2.

- Place them on top of each other along their b sides: 2 + 4 = 6 in height, width remains 2, so 6x2.

- Place them in other configurations, but essentially, the possible new rectangles would be 4x2 and 6x2, which are the same as 2x4 and 2x6, respectively.

Now, 2x4 is different from the original 2x6, and 2x6 is the same as the original. So, he can form a different rectangle (2x4).

Hence, output should be "Yes".

Fourth test case:

3 2

A 3x2 rectangle.

Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to side a (length 3): divide b=2 into two integers, say 1 and 1.

- Cut parallel to side b (length 2): divide a=3 into two integers, say 1 and 2.

Let's consider cutting parallel to side a, dividing b into 1 and 1:

- Two rectangles: 3x1 and 3x1.

From these, he can arrange them side by side: 3 + 3 = 6 in width, height remains 1, so 6x1.

Alternatively, place them on top of each other: 1 + 1 = 2 in height, width remains 3, so 3x2, which is the same as the original.

So, from this cut, he can form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

Hence, output should be "Yes".

Fifth test case:

2 2

A 2x2 square.

Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to side a (length 2): divide b=2 into two integers, say 1 and 1.

- Cut parallel to side b (length 2): divide a=2 into two integers, say 1 and 1.

Let's take cutting parallel to side a, dividing b into 1 and 1:

- Two rectangles: 2x1 and 2x1.

From these, he can arrange them side by side: 2 + 2 = 4 in width, height remains 1, so 4x1.

Alternatively, place them on top of each other: 1 + 1 = 2 in height, width remains 2, so 2x2, which is the same as the original.

So, he can form a 4x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2.

Hence, output should be "Yes".

Sixth test case:

2 4

A 2x4 rectangle.

Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to side a (length 2): divide b=4 into two integers, say 1 and 3, or 2 and 2.

- Cut parallel to side b (length 4): divide a=2 into two integers, say 1 and 1.

Let's consider cutting parallel to side a, dividing b into 2 and 2:

- Two rectangles: 2x2 and 2x2.

From these, he can arrange them side by side: 2 + 2 = 4 in width, height remains 2, so 4x2.

Alternatively, place them on top of each other: 2 + 2 = 4 in height, width remains 2, so 2x4, which is the same as the original.

So, he can form a 4x2 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x4.

Hence, output should be "Yes".

Seventh test case:

6 3

A 6x3 rectangle.

Possible cuts:

- Cut parallel to side a (length 6): divide b=3 into two integers, say 1 and 2.

- Cut parallel to side b (length 3): divide a=6 into two integers, say 3 and 3.

Let's consider cutting parallel to side a, dividing b into 1 and 2:

- Two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

From these, he can arrange them side by side: 6 + 6 = 12 in width, height remains 1, so 12x1.

Alternatively, place them on top of each other: 1 + 2 = 3 in height, width remains 6, so 6x3, which is the same as the original.

So, he can form a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3.

Hence, output should be "No". Wait, but according to the sample output, it's "No". But according to my reasoning, he can form a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps in this case, 12x1 is considered the same as 1x12, which might be equivalent to the original in some way, but I don't think so. Anyway, perhaps my reasoning is flawed here.

Looking back at the sample output, for 6 3, it's "No". So, perhaps in this case, no different rectangle can be formed. Maybe because 12x1 is not considered different for some reason.

Wait, perhaps because 12x1 can be rotated to 1x12, which is not different from the original in terms of the problem's consideration. But 1x12 is different from 6x3, so maybe it's considered different. I'm a bit confused here.

Looking back at the problem statement, it says that rectangles differing only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same. So, 12x1 and 1x12 are considered the same, but both are different from 6x3.

However, perhaps in some cases, the new rectangle can be the same as the original or its rotation, but in this case, 12x1 is different from 6x3 and its rotation, which would be 3x6. So, why is the output "No"?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.

"Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same."

So, the new rectangle formed from the two pieces should be different from the original rectangle and its 90-degree rotation.

In the case of 6x3, its 90-degree rotation is 3x6.

So, if Bob can form a new rectangle that is neither 6x3 nor 3x6, then the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, "No".

In the 6x3 case, if he cuts parallel to side a (length 6), dividing b=3 into 1 and 2, he gets two rectangles: 6x1 and 6x2.

From these, he can arrange them side by side to form a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3 and 3x6.

Alternatively, he can arrange them to form a 6x3 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, he can form a 12x1 rectangle, which is different, so why is the output "No"?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the sample output or my understanding.

Looking back at the sample output, for 6 3, it's "No". But according to my reasoning, he can form a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3 and 3x6.

Maybe I need to consider that 12x1 is considered the same as 1x12, which is different from 6x3 and 3x6. So, perhaps the sample output is wrong, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a constraint that the new rectangle must have integer dimensions, but since 12x1 is integer, it should be acceptable.

Wait, maybe the problem is that after cutting and rearranging, the new rectangle must have different dimensions from the original and its rotation, but in this case, 12x1 is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the new rectangle must have both dimensions different from the original and its rotation, but in this case, 12x1 has dimensions 12 and 1, which are different from 6 and 3.

I'm confused. Maybe I need to look for a general approach.

Let me try to find a general solution.

Given a rectangle of size a x b, Bob makes one cut parallel to one of its sides, resulting in two smaller rectangles.

Then, he rearranges these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The new rectangle should have area equal to the original rectangle, i.e., a*b.

So, the new rectangle will have dimensions c x d, where c*d = a*b.

Moreover, c and d must be integers, and the new rectangle should not be the same as the original or its rotation, meaning (c, d) != (a, b) and (c, d) != (b, a).

So, the problem reduces to checking if there exists any pair (c, d) such that c*d = a*b, c and d are integers, and (c, d) is not equal to (a, b) or (b, a).

But, there's a catch: the new rectangle must be formed from the two pieces obtained by one cut.

So, I need to ensure that the two pieces can be arranged to form the new rectangle.

Let me think about the possible ways to cut the rectangle.

Case 1: Cut parallel to side a.

- Divide side b into b1 and b2, where b1 and b2 are positive integers such that b1 + b2 = b.

- The two rectangles obtained are a x b1 and a x b2.

- To form a new rectangle from these two pieces, we can arrange them either side by side along their a sides or on top of each other along their b sides.

- If arranged side by side along a sides, the new rectangle would have width a + a = 2a and height max(b1, b2), but since b1 + b2 = b, this might not be useful.

- If arranged on top of each other along b sides, the new rectangle would have width a and height b1 + b2 = b, which is the original rectangle.

- Alternatively, if we rotate one or both pieces, we can arrange them differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible ways of arranging the two pieces.

Let me consider that each piece can be rotated by 0 or 90 degrees before arranging them.

So, for each piece, there are two possibilities: original orientation or rotated.

Therefore, for two pieces, there are 2 * 2 = 4 possible arrangements.

But, since rotation of the final rectangle is considered the same, some of these arrangements might lead to the same final rectangle.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that after cutting, the two pieces have areas a*b1 and a*b2, with b1 + b2 = b.

The total area is a*b.

To form a new rectangle with dimensions c x d, where c*d = a*b, we need to arrange the two pieces into this new shape.

The possible values of c and d are the divisors of a*b.

But, to actually form the new rectangle from the two pieces, the pieces must fit together in such a way that their combined shape matches the new rectangle.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Maybe I need to look for a mathematical condition that determines whether such a rearrangement is possible.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If a and b have a common divisor greater than 1, perhaps that can be exploited to form a different rectangle.

Wait, for example, in the 2x6 rectangle, GCD(2,6)=2, and we can form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different.

In the 3x2 rectangle, GCD(3,2)=1, and we can still form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different.

Wait, but in the 2x1 rectangle, GCD(2,1)=1, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

Hmm, maybe if GCD(a,b) > 1, we can form a different rectangle, but in the 2x1 case, GCD=1, and we cannot.

But in the 3x2 case, GCD=1, and we can form a different rectangle.

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a or b is even.

In the 2x6 case, both a and b are even, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 3x2 case, one is odd and one is even, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 2x1 case, one is even, one is odd, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, both are odd, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

In the 2x2 case, both are even, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 2x4 case, both are even, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 6x3 case, one even, one odd, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the 3x2 case, one even, one odd, and we can form a different rectangle.

This is inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a*b is even or odd.

If a*b is even, we can form a different rectangle; if a*b is odd, we cannot.

But in the 3x2 case, a*b=6 is even, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 2x1 case, a*b=2 is even, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

Wait, no, in the 2x1 case, we cannot.

Wait, but according to the sample output, for 2x1, it's "No", meaning cannot form a different rectangle.

But according to this logic, since a*b is even, we can form a different rectangle, but the sample output says "No".

So, that can't be the condition.

Alternatively, maybe it's related to whether both a and b are greater than 1.

But in the 2x1 case, both are greater than 1, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

Wait, no, 1 is not greater than 1.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, a=2>1, b=1 not greater than 1.

In the 1x1 case, neither is greater than 1.

In the 2x2 case, both are greater than 1, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 3x2 case, both are greater than 1, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 2x4 case, both are greater than 1, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 6x3 case, both are greater than 1, and the sample output is "No", meaning cannot form a different rectangle.

Wait, but in the 6x3 case, we can form a 12x1 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", so perhaps I'm missing something.

Maybe the condition is that a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is a multiple of the first.

Wait, but that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a and b share a common factor other than 1.

But in the 3x2 case, GCD is 1, and we can still form a different rectangle.

Wait, maybe it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 2.

Wait, perhaps if both a and b are odd, then we cannot form a different rectangle.

In the 1x1 case, both odd, "No".

In the 2x1 case, one even, one odd, "No".

In the 2x6 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, one odd, one even, "Yes".

In the 2x2 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 2x4 case, both even, "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, one even, one odd, "No".

So, perhaps when both a and b are even, we can form a different rectangle, and when at least one is odd, we cannot.

But in the 3x2 case, one is odd, one is even, and we can form a different rectangle.

Similarly, in the 2x1 case, one is even, one is odd, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps when a and b are both even, or when one is even and the other is odd but a*b is divisible by 4, or something like that.

Wait, in the 3x2 case, a*b=6, which is divisible by 2 but not by 4, and we can form a different rectangle.

In the 2x1 case, a*b=2, which is divisible by 2 but not by 4, and we cannot form a different rectangle.

In the 2x2 case, a*b=4, divisible by 4, "Yes".

In the 3x2 case, a*b=6, divisible by 2, "Yes".

In the 2x4 case, a*b=8, divisible by 4, "Yes".

In the 6x3 case, a*b=18, divisible by 2 and 9, but "No".

Wait, 18 is divisible by 2 but not by 4, but in the 2x1 case, a*b=2, which is divisible by 2 but not by 4, and "No".

Wait, this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of ways to factorize a*b into two integers c and d, where c != a and d != b, considering the rotation.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider all possible factor pairs of a*b and see if there exists at least one pair (c, d) such that c != a and c != b, and d != a and d != b.

But, in the 6x3 case, a*b=18.

Possible factor pairs are:

(1,18), (2,9), (3,6).

Now, comparing to original (6,3), which is the same as (3,6).

So, the possible new rectangles are (1,18) and (2,9).

So, he can form a 1x18 or 2x9 rectangle, which are different from 6x3 and 3x6.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", so perhaps there's another constraint.

Wait, maybe it's not sufficient to just have a different factor pair; he must be able to arrange the two pieces to form that new rectangle.

So, perhaps there's a constraint on the possible arrangements based on the cuts.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles.

He then arranges these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The key is that the two smaller rectangles must fit together perfectly to form the new rectangle.

Given that, perhaps the new rectangle's dimensions must be such that one of its sides is equal to one of the sides of the original rectangle, or some multiple.

Wait, perhaps the new rectangle's dimensions must be such that one side is a divisor of one of the original sides.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to find a general condition.

I notice that in all the cases where the sample output is "Yes", a*b is even, and in "No" cases, a*b is even in some cases, so that doesn't help.

Wait, in the
