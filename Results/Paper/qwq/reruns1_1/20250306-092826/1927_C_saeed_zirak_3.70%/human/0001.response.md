Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have two arrays, a and b, with lengths n and m respectively, and an even number k. The task is to choose exactly k/2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what exactly is being asked. The arrays a and b can have duplicates since the problem mentions, for example, a=[2,3,8,5,6,5] and b=[1,3,4,10,5]. So, elements can repeat within an array but are likely irrelevant beyond the range of 1 to k.

Wait, actually, the problem specifies that the elements in both arrays are between 1 and 1e6, but we're only interested in elements from 1 to k, since we need to include all integers from 1 to k in the chosen elements.

So, my first thought is that I need to ensure that all values from 1 to k are covered by the elements chosen from a and b, with exactly k/2 elements chosen from each array.

Given that k is even, k/2 is an integer, which is good because we're dealing with counts of elements.

Let me think about the example provided:

Example 1:

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,4,10,5]

k = 6

In this case, we need to choose 3 elements from a and 3 from b such that all numbers from 1 to 6 are included.

One possible selection is:

From a: 2,3,6

From b:1,4,5

This covers all numbers from 1 to 6.

Another example where it's not possible:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b = [1,3,8,10,3]

k = 6

Here, trying to choose 3 from a and 3 from b, but no matter how you choose, you can't cover all numbers from 1 to 6 because 7 is not present in either array, but wait, k=6, so we need 1 through 6.

Wait, in this case, in array a: [2,3,4,5,6,5], which has 2,3,4,5,6.

In array b: [1,3,8,10,3], which has 1,3,8,10.

So, to choose 3 from a and 3 from b, let's see:

From a: choose 2,4,6

From b: choose 1,3,8

This covers 1,2,3,4,6,8, but misses 5.

Alternatively, from a: 2,3,5

From b:1,4,10

Covers 1,2,3,4,5,10

Still misses 6.

Another try: from a:2,5,6

From b:1,3,4

Covers 1,2,3,4,5,6. Oh, wait, is this possible? Let's check the counts.

In a: 2,3,4,5,6,5

So, 2 once, 3 once, 4 once, 5 twice, 6 once.

In b:1,3,8,10,3

1 once, 3 twice, 8 once, 10 once.

So, choosing from a:2,5,6 (all unique)

From b:1,3,4

This covers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, in this case, it should be possible, but the example says it's not possible. Wait, maybe I misread the example.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's said that in the second example, it's not possible. But according to my selection, it seems possible. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in a, the elements are [2,3,4,5,6,5], and in b, [1,3,8,10,3], k=6.

Choosing from a:2,5,6

From b:1,3,4

This covers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So why is it said to be not possible in the problem statement? Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that elements chosen must be unique in their selection, meaning no overlaps in the chosen elements between a and b.

But the problem doesn't specify that. It just says to choose k/2 from each array such that all integers from 1 to k are included among the chosen elements.

So, in this case, it should be possible, but the example says it's not possible. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the arrays are supposed to contain only elements from 1 to k. But in the problem, it's stated that elements can be up to 1e6, but we should consider only elements from 1 to k.

So, perhaps, I should ignore elements in a and b that are greater than k.

Let's consider that.

In the first example:

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5], but k=6, so 8 is ignored.

b = [1,3,4,10,5], 10 is ignored.

So, a effective: [2,3,5,6,5]

b effective: [1,3,4,5]

Now, need to choose 3 from a and 3 from b.

From a:2,5,6

From b:1,3,4

This covers 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So, possible.

In the second example:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], k=6, so all elements are <=6.

b = [1,3,8,10,3], ignore 8 and 10, so b effective: [1,3,3]

Now, choose 3 from a:2,4,6

Choose 3 from b:1,3,3

This covers 1,2,3,4,6, but misses 5.

Alternatively, choose from a:2,5,6

Choose from b:1,3,3

Covers 1,2,3,5,6, but misses 4.

Another try: choose from a:3,4,5

Choose from b:1,3,3

Covers 1,3,4,5, but misses 2 and 6.

No way to cover all from 1 to 6.

Hence, it's not possible.

I see, so ignoring elements greater than k is necessary.

So, in my approach, I need to consider only elements from a and b that are between 1 and k, inclusive.

Now, to generalize, for each test case, I need to:

1. Read n, m, k.

2. Read array a and array b.

3. Ignore elements in a and b that are greater than k.

4. Check if it's possible to choose k/2 elements from a and k/2 elements from b such that all integers from 1 to k are included in the chosen elements.

Given that k can be up to 2*min(n,m), and n and m can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but the total sum of n and m over all test cases is up to 4e5, I need an efficient solution.

Time complexity should be O(t*(n + m)), but since n and m can be up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, but with the sum over all test cases up to 4e5, it should be manageable.

Now, how to approach this?

I need to ensure that all numbers from 1 to k are covered by the chosen elements from a and b.

I need to choose exactly k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b.

One way is to think in terms of covering the required numbers from 1 to k.

Let me consider the frequency of each number from 1 to k in a and b.

Let me define:

- For each number i from 1 to k, count how many times it appears in a (let's say fa[i]) and in b (fb[i]).

Now, I need to select some of these fa[i] and fb[i] such that:

- The total number of elements chosen from a is k/2.

- The total number of elements chosen from b is k/2.

- For each i from 1 to k, at least one of fa[i] or fb[i] is chosen (meaning that i is included in the chosen elements).

Wait, but it's not exactly about choosing fa[i] or fb[i], because fa[i] and fb[i] represent counts.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting which numbers to take from a and which to take from b.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each number i from 1 to k, it must be chosen from either a or b, but not necessarily from both.

But since I have to choose exactly k/2 from a and k/2 from b, I need to distribute the selection in such a way that the counts add up.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a selection problem where I need to assign each number i from 1 to k to either a or b, ensuring that the total number of selections from a is k/2 and from b is k/2.

But I have to consider the availability of each number in a and b.

For example, if a number i is not present in a, then it must be chosen from b, and vice versa.

If a number i is present in both a and b, then I can choose to take it from either a or b.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 1 to k and decide from which array to take it, ensuring that I don't exceed the required counts from a and b.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define:

- available_a: the number of elements I can still choose from a.

- available_b: the number of elements I can still choose from b.

Initially, available_a = k/2 and available_b = k/2.

Then, for each number i from 1 to k:

- If i is present in a and available_a > 0, I can choose it from a, and decrement available_a.

- Else if i is present in b and available_b > 0, I can choose it from b, and decrement available_b.

- Else, it's impossible to choose i, so the answer is "NO".

If I can go through all i from 1 to k and assign each to a or b without exceeding the available choices from each, then it's possible, and the answer is "YES".

Wait, but this seems too simplistic because it doesn't account for the fact that some numbers may appear multiple times in a or b.

But since we're only interested in whether a number is present or not (at least once), because we just need to include it in the chosen elements, not necessarily choose multiple instances of it.

So, perhaps I can consider the presence of each number i in a and b as binary: present or not.

But wait, no. Because if a number appears multiple times in an array, I can choose multiple instances of it, but I only need it once to cover that number.

So, for each number i from 1 to k, I need to decide whether to take it from a or from b, provided it's present in that array, and keep track of how many elements I've chosen from a and b so far.

If at any point, I can't choose a number from either array because it's not present or I've already chosen the maximum allowed from that array, then it's impossible.

So, in essence, it's about assigning each number i from 1 to k to either a or b, ensuring that:

- Each i is assigned to at least one of a or b.

- The total number of assignments to a is <= k/2.

- The total number of assignments to b is <= k/2.

But actually, since I have to choose exactly k/2 from each, the total number of assignments to a must be exactly k/2, and same for b.

Wait, but that might not hold because some numbers may be chosen multiple times, but since we're only interested in covering the numbers from 1 to k, and not necessarily choosing multiple instances of the same number, perhaps I need to think in terms of selecting which numbers to take from a and which to take from b, ensuring that the count of selected numbers from a is exactly k/2 and from b is exactly k/2.

Wait, but if I have to choose exactly k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b, but some numbers may appear multiple times in a or b, I need to make sure that the number of distinct numbers I choose from a and b adds up to cover all numbers from 1 to k.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of frequency.

Let me try to think differently.

Let me consider that for each number i from 1 to k:

- If i is present in a, I can choose it from a.

- If i is present in b, I can choose it from b.

- If i is present in both, I can choose it from either a or b.

- If i is not present in either, it's impossible.

But since I have to choose exactly k/2 elements from a and k/2 from b, I need to distribute the choices accordingly.

Perhaps I can iterate through the numbers from 1 to k and decide from which array to take each number, prioritizing one array over the other to balance the counts.

Wait, maybe I should first identify the numbers that are only present in a, only in b, and in both.

- Let’s define:

- only_a: numbers present in a but not in b.

- only_b: numbers present in b but not in a.

- both: numbers present in both a and b.

Now, to cover all numbers from 1 to k, I need to cover:

- all numbers in only_a must be chosen from a.

- all numbers in only_b must be chosen from b.

- for numbers in both, I can choose to take them from a or b.

Let’s denote:

- len_only_a = number of elements in only_a.

- len_only_b = number of elements in only_b.

- len_both = number of elements in both.

Now, the total number of elements to choose from a is k/2, and from b is k/2.

We need to ensure that:

- The number of elements chosen from a is exactly k/2, which includes len_only_a plus some from both.

- Similarly, the number of elements chosen from b is exactly k/2, which includes len_only_b plus some from both.

So, if we denote the number of elements from both that we choose from a as x, and from b as y, then:

x + len_only_a = k/2

y + len_only_b = k/2

And also, x + y = len_both

Because each number in both can be chosen from either a or b, but not both.

So, from the first two equations:

x = k/2 - len_only_a

y = k/2 - len_only_b

And these must be non-negative integers.

Also, x + y = len_both

So, substituting:

(k/2 - len_only_a) + (k/2 - len_only_b) = len_both

Simplify:

k - len_only_a - len_only_b = len_both

But len_both = k - len_only_a - len_only_b

Because total numbers are k, and only_a and only_b are mutually exclusive, and both is the intersection.

Wait, actually:

len_only_a + len_only_b + len_both = k

Because these are the three categories that cover all numbers from 1 to k.

So, len_both = k - len_only_a - len_only_b

Therefore, x = k/2 - len_only_a

y = k/2 - len_only_b

And x + y = len_both = k - len_only_a - len_only_b

Substituting x and y:

(k/2 - len_only_a) + (k/2 - len_only_b) = k - len_only_a - len_only_b

Which holds true.

So, for the selection to be possible, x and y must be non-negative integers.

That is:

k/2 - len_only_a >= 0

k/2 - len_only_b >= 0

Which implies:

len_only_a <= k/2

len_only_b <= k/2

So, if both these conditions hold, then it's possible to choose the required elements.

Therefore, the solution is:

For each test case:

1. Identify len_only_a, len_only_b, and len_both based on the presence of numbers from 1 to k in a and b.

2. Check if len_only_a <= k/2 and len_only_b <= k/2.

3. If both conditions are satisfied, output "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

This seems efficient because for each test case, we can iterate through the arrays once to determine the presence of each number from 1 to k.

Implementing this, I can use sets to track the presence of numbers in a and b.

Given that k can be up to 2*min(n,m), and n and m up to 2e5, but t up to 1e4, with the sum of n and m over all test cases up to 4e5, using sets should be efficient enough.

Let me try to verify this approach with the given examples.

First example:

a = [2,3,8,5,6,5], b = [1,3,4,10,5], k=6

Ignoring elements >k, so a = [2,3,5,6,5], b = [1,3,4,5]

only_a: [2,6] (len=2)

only_b: [1,4] (len=2)

both: [3,5] (len=2)

Check len_only_a <= k/2 => 2 <= 3: yes

len_only_b <= k/2 => 2 <= 3: yes

So, "YES"

Second example:

a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3,8,10,3], k=6

Ignoring elements >k, so a = [2,3,4,5,6,5], b = [1,3]

only_a: [2,4,5,6] (len=4)

only_b: [1] (len=1)

both: [3] (len=1)

Check len_only_a <= k/2 => 4 <= 3: no

So, "NO"

Third example:

a = [1,3,5], b = [2,4,6], k=4

only_a: [1,5] (len=2)

only_b: [2,4,6] (len=3)

both: [] (len=0)

Check len_only_a <= k/2 => 2 <= 2: yes

len_only_b <= k/2 => 3 <= 2: no

So, "NO"

Wait, but in the sample input, the third test case is:

3 3 4

1 3 5

2 4 6

And the output is "YES"

Wait, according to my approach, len_only_a = 2 (1,5), len_only_b = 3 (2,4,6), len_both = 0

Then, len_only_a <= 2: yes

len_only_b <= 2: no (3 > 2)

So, according to my approach, it should be "NO", but the sample output is "YES"

Hmm, which means my approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Looking back at the third example:

a = [1,3,5], b = [2,4,6], k=4

So, numbers from 1 to 4 are: 1,2,3,4

only_a: [1,3,5], but k=4, so only_a = [1,3]

only_b: [2,4,6], but k=4, so only_b = [2,4]

both: [] (since 5 is only in a, 6 is only in b, but for numbers 1 to 4, no overlaps)

Wait, but according to the sample, it's "YES"

How is that possible?

Choosing from a:1,3

From b:2,4

This covers 1,2,3,4, which is all numbers from 1 to 4.

So, it should be "YES"

But according to my earlier approach, len_only_a = 2, len_only_b = 2, len_both = 0

Check: len_only_a <= k/2 = 2 <= 2: yes

len_only_b <= k/2 = 2 <= 2: yes

So, it should be "YES"

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had len_only_b = 3, which was incorrect.

Wait, no, k=4, so only_b = [2,4], because 6 is greater than k and should be ignored.

So, len_only_b = 2, not 3.

I must have misread earlier.

So, in this case, len_only_a = 2, len_only_b = 2, len_both = 0

Hence, "YES"

Another test case:

n=2, m=5, k=4

a=[1,4], b=[7,3,4,4,2], k=4

only_a: [1,4]

only_b: [3,2], assuming 7 is ignored as it's >k=4

both: []

So, len_only_a = 2, len_only_b = 2

Check: 2 <= 2 and 2 <=2: yes, so "YES"

But the sample output is "YES"

Another test case:

n=1, m=4, k=2

a=[6], b=[4,2,2,4], k=2

only_a: [], since 6 > k=2

only_b: [2], len=1

both: [], since no overlaps in numbers 1 to 2

But k=2, so need to choose 1 from a and 1 from b.

But a has no numbers from 1 to 2, so impossible.

But according to my approach, len_only_a = 0, len_only_b =1

Check: 0 <=1 and 1 <=1: yes, but it's impossible because a has no numbers from 1 to 2.

So, in this case, my approach fails.

Hence, my earlier approach is incorrect.

I need to refine it.

Wait, in this case, a has no numbers from 1 to k, but len_only_a =0, which satisfies len_only_a <= k/2 and len_only_b <=k/2, but it's impossible because a has no numbers from 1 to k to choose from.

So, I need to ensure that for len_only_a, it's the count of numbers from 1 to k that are only in a.

In this case, len_only_a =0, len_only_b=1, len_both=0

But to cover k=2, need to choose 1 from a and 1 from b.

But a has no numbers from 1 to 2, so it's impossible.

Hence, my approach is incomplete.

I need to ensure that the numbers in only_a and only_b are actually present in the arrays within the range 1 to k.

So, perhaps I need to consider the effective a and b, ignoring elements greater than k.

Let me try to redefine:

For each test case:

- Create set_a = set(a) intersected with range(1, k+1)

- Create set_b = set(b) intersected with range(1, k+1)

- only_a = set_a - set_b

- only_b = set_b - set_a

- both = set_a intersect set_b

- len_only_a = len(only_a)

- len_only_b = len(only_b)

- len_both = len(both)

Then, check if len_only_a <= k/2 and len_only_b <= k/2

But also ensure that set_a union set_b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

In the previous failed case:

a=[6], b=[4,2,2,4], k=2

set_a = {} (since 6 >2)

set_b={2,4}, but k=2, so set_b={2}

only_a={}

only_b={2}

both={}

len_only_a=0 <=1

len_only_b=1 <=1

But set_a union set_b = {2}, which does not contain 1.

Hence, it's impossible.

So, I need to add an additional condition that set_a union set_b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

Hence, the correct approach is:

For each test case:

- Create set_a = set(a) intersected with range(1, k+1)

- Create set_b = set(b) intersected with range(1, k+1)

- only_a = set_a - set_b

- only_b = set_b - set_a

- both = set_a intersect set_b

- len_only_a = len(only_a)

- len_only_b = len(only_b)

- Check if len_only_a <= k/2 and len_only_b <= k/2

- And also, set_a union set_b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

If both conditions are satisfied, output "YES"; else, "NO"

This should work.

Let me verify with the previous failed case:

a=[6], b=[4,2,2,4], k=2

set_a = {}

set_b={2}

only_a={}

only_b={2}

len_only_a=0 <=1

len_only_b=1 <=1

But set_a union set_b = {2}, which does not contain 1.

Hence, "NO"

Another test case:

a=[2,3,4,5,6,5], b=[1,3,8,10,3], k=6

set_a={2,3,4,5,6}

set_b={1,3,5}

only_a={2,4,6}

only_b={1}

both={3,5}

len_only_a=3 <=3

len_only_b=1 <=3

And set_a union set_b = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, which contains all numbers from 1 to 6.

Hence, "YES"

But earlier, I thought it was "NO", but according to this, it's "YES"

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said to be "NO"

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem.

Looking back at the problem statement, in the second example, it's said to be "NO"

But according to this approach, it should be "YES"

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.

Wait, in the second example:

a=[2,3,4,5,6,5], b=[1,3,8,10,3], k=6

Ignoring elements >k in a and b:

a: [2,3,4,5,6,5] -> [2,3,4,5,6,5]

b: [1,3,8,10,3] -> [1,3]

set_a={2,3,4,5,6}

set_b={1,3}

only_a={2,4,5,6}

only_b={1}

both={3}

len_only_a=4 <=3: no

Hence, "NO"

Wait, earlier I miscounted only_a as 3, but it's actually 4 (2,4,5,6)

So, len_only_a=4 >3, which fails the condition.

Hence, "NO"

So, the approach is correct.

Another test case:

a=[1,3,5], b=[2,4,6], k=4

set_a={1,3,5} intersected with 1 to 4: {1,3}

set_b={2,4,6} intersected with 1 to 4: {2,4}

only_a={1,3} - {2,4} = {1,3}

only_b={2,4} - {1,3} = {2,4}

both={ } intersect

len_only_a=2 <=2

len_only_b=2 <=2

set_a union set_b = {1,2,3,4}, which contains all numbers from 1 to 4.

Hence, "YES"

Another test case:

a=[1,4], b=[7,3,4,4,2], k=4

set_a={1,4}

set_b={3,4,2}

only_a={1}

only_b={2,3}

both={4}

len_only_a=1 <=2

len_only_b=2 <=2

set_a union set_b = {1,2,3,4}, which contains all numbers from 1 to 4.

Hence, "YES"

Another test case:

a=[6], b=[4,2,2,4], k=2

set_a={}

set_b={2}

only_a={}

only_b={2}

both={}

set_a union set_b = {2}, which does not contain 1.

Hence, "NO"

Seems correct.

So, the final approach is:

For each test case:

- Create set_a = set(a) intersected with range(1, k+1)

- Create set_b = set(b) intersected with range(1, k+1)

- only_a = set_a - set_b

- only_b = set_b - set_a

- both = set_a intersect set_b

- Check if len(only_a) <= k/2 and len(only_b) <= k/2

- And set_a union set_b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

If both conditions are true, output "YES"; else, "NO"

To implement this efficiently, in code, I can:

- For each test case, read n, m, k

- Read array a and b, but only consider elements <=k.

- Create set_a from a, filtered by elements <=k

- Create set_b from b, filtered by elements <=k

- Compute only_a, only_b, both as above

- Check the conditions

This should be efficient enough given the constraints.

Now, looking at the given program, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Given program:

def func():

for t in range(int(input())):

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

aOnes = 0

bOnes = 0

newk = k // 2

i = 1

while i <= k:

if i in a and i in b:

if aOnes < bOnes:

aOnes += 1

else:

bOnes += 1

elif i in a and aOnes <= newk:

aOnes += 1

elif i in b and bOnes <= newk:

bOnes += 1

else:

break

i += 1

if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:

print('yes')

else:

print('no')

This program seems to be trying to assign each number i from 1 to k to either a or b, prioritizing the one with fewer current choices.

But there are a few issues:

1. It uses 'aOnes' and 'bOnes' to count the number of elements chosen from a and b, but it doesn't ensure that the total chosen elements from each are exactly k/2.

2. The condition 'if aOnes < bOnes:' suggests that it's trying to balance the counts, but it may not lead to exactly k/2 from each.

3. The loops 'while i <=k:' and the breaks might not cover all cases correctly.

4. It doesn't explicitly check if set_a union set_b contains all numbers from 1 to k.

Given that, the approach in the given program seems flawed compared to the correct approach I outlined earlier.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
