Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop that can have multiple screens. Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells per screen. There are two types of applications: those with 1x1 icons and those with 2x2 icons. The 1x1 icons take up one cell each, and the 2x2 icons take up a square of four cells. The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to understand the constraints and what's being asked. Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, making it a 5x3 grid, which is 15 cells in total. The 1x1 icons occupy one cell each, and the 2x2 icons occupy a 2x2 square, which is 4 cells. Importantly, each cell can be occupied by only one icon.

So, the problem is to find the minimal number of such screens needed to fit all the given icons without overlapping.

Let's think about how to approach this. One way is to calculate how many icons can fit into a single screen and then determine how many screens are needed based on the number of each type of icon.

But it's not as simple as just dividing the total number of icons by the capacity of one screen because the 2x2 icons take up more space and their placement can affect where the 1x1 icons can be placed.

I need to consider the interaction between the two types of icons.

Let me consider the screen grid. It's 5 rows by 3 columns:

Row 1: Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3

Row 2: Cell 4, Cell 5, Cell 6

Row 3: Cell 7, Cell 8, Cell 9

Row 4: Cell 10, Cell 11, Cell 12

Row 5: Cell 13, Cell 14, Cell 15

Now, a 2x2 icon would occupy four consecutive cells in a square. For example, cells 1,2,4,5 or cells 2,3,5,6, etc.

Given that, in a 5x3 grid, how many 2x2 icons can fit?

Let's see:

- In row 1 and row 2, we can place one 2x2 icon (cells 1,2,4,5)

- In row 2 and row 3, another 2x2 icon (cells 4,5,7,8)

- In row 3 and row 4, another one (cells 7,8,10,11)

- In row 4 and row 5, another one (cells 10,11,13,14)

So, in total, we can place up to 4 2x2 icons per screen, each occupying 4 cells, totaling 16 cells, but since the screen only has 15 cells, there must be an overlap or some cells are shared. Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, actually, in a 5x3 grid, placing one 2x2 icon would occupy 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

If I place another 2x2 icon, it would overlap with the first one unless placed carefully.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe I should calculate the total number of cells required and see how many screens are needed.

But that might not work because of the way 2x2 icons are placed; they can't be split across cells in any way; they need a contiguous block of 4 cells.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen and then see how many screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the example provided, it shows specific placements.

Looking back at the example in the problem statement, it's better to see how the icons are placed.

In the first test case, x=1, y=1.

The solution is 1 screen.

In the third test case, x=12, y=4, and the solution is 2 screens.

So, perhaps there's a formula to calculate the minimal number of screens required.

Looking at the code provided:

import math

func_1()

def func_1():

ap = int(input())

for k in range(ap):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

if x > 0 and y > 0:

bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

elif x == 0 and y > 0:

print(math.ceil(y / 2))

elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(x / 15))

else:

print(0)

Hmm, this seems a bit confusing. Let's try to understand what's happening here.

First, it reads the number of test cases, ap.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

If both x and y are greater than 0, it calculates bxsfory as ceil(y / 2).

Then, it updates x to x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

Then, bxsfory1 is 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15).

Finally, it prints bxsfory1 + bxsfory.

If x == 0 and y > 0, it prints ceil(y / 2).

If x > 0 and y == 0, it prints ceil(x / 15).

If both x and y are 0, it prints 0.

Wait, there are some test cases provided:

Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Looking at the first test case: x=1, y=1 → output=1

According to the code:

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

bxsfory1 = 0 (since x <= 0)

print(0 + 1) = 1

Which matches the output.

Second test case: x=7, y=2 → output=1

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 7 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 7 - 15 + 8 = 0

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 1) = 1

Third test case: x=12, y=4 → output=2

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 2) = 2

Fourth test case: x=0, y=3 → output=2

ceil(3 / 2) = 2

Fifth test case: x=1, y=0 → output=1

ceil(1 / 15) = 1

Sixth test case: x=8, y=1 → output=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 8 - 15 + 4 = -3

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 1) = 1

Seventh test case: x=0, y=0 → output=0

Eighth test case: x=2, y=0 → output=1

ceil(2 / 15) = 1

Ninth test case: x=15, y=0 → output=1

ceil(15 / 15) = 1

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2 → output=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

print(1 + 1) = 2

Eleventh test case: x=0, y=9 → output=5

ceil(9 / 2) = 5

So, the code seems to be working correctly for these test cases.

But I need to understand why this logic works.

Let's try to decipher the logic.

In the case where both x and y are greater than 0:

- bxsfory = ceil(y / 2)

This suggests that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, since ceil(y / 2) gives the number of screens needed if each screen can hold 2 such icons.

- Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

This part is confusing. It's updating x based on bxsfory and y.

- bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

This calculates additional screens needed for the remaining x after accounting for the screens used for y.

But why is x being updated by subtracting bxsfory * 15 + y * 4?

Let's think about screen capacity.

Each screen has 15 cells.

A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells.

But in the code, it seems to be assuming that each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and some 1x1 icons.

Wait, in a 5x3 grid, can we fit more than 2 2x2 icons?

From earlier thinking, we can fit up to 4 2x2 icons, but that seems impossible because 4*4=16 cells, but the screen only has 15 cells.

Wait, that can't be right.

Let me try to visualize:

Rows: 1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9

10 11 12

13 14 15

If we place a 2x2 icon on cells 1,2,4,5

Another on cells 7,8,10,11

That's two 2x2 icons, using 8 cells in total, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Alternatively, if we try to place three 2x2 icons:

Say, cells 1,2,4,5

cells 7,8,10,11

cells 13,14,16,17 – but there is no row 5, column 4; the grid is only 5 rows and 3 columns, so cells 13,14,15 are the last row.

So, we can't place three 2x2 icons because there aren't enough cells.

Hence, maximum 2 2x2 icons per screen.

Wait, but in my earlier count, I thought of four possible positions for 2x2 icons, but that must be overlapping.

Let me see:

Possible 2x2 placements:

- Cells 1,2,4,5

- Cells 2,3,5,6

- Cells 4,5,7,8

- Cells 5,6,8,9

- Cells 7,8,10,11

- Cells 8,9,11,12

- Cells 10,11,13,14

- Cells 11,12,14,15

So, there are multiple overlapping positions, but we can't use overlapping positions simultaneously.

So, the maximum number of 2x2 icons per screen is 2, as suggested by the code.

Therefore, bxsfory = ceil(y / 2) gives the number of screens needed solely for the 2x2 icons.

Then, x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, this seems off.

If we allocate bxsfory screens for the 2x2 icons, each such screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, but we have to account for the cells already occupied by the 2x2 icons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the total number of cells used by y 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells across the screens.

But the code seems to be calculating something different.

Wait, perhaps the logic is:

- First, allocate screens for the 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.

- Then, calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after accounting for the screens used for 2x2 icons.

But I'm not fully following the formula used.

Let me look at specific examples.

Take the first test case: x=1, y=1

According to the code:

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

bxsfory1 = 0 (since x <= 0)

print(0 + 1) = 1

Which matches the output.

But why is x being updated like that?

If we allocate 1 screen for the 2x2 icon, that screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, but the 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the remaining cells for 1x1 icons are 11.

So, in this case, x=1, which is less than 11, so no additional screens are needed.

Hence, total screens = 1.

Similarly, third test case: x=12, y=4

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

bxsfory1 = 0

print(0 + 2) = 2

Meaning, allocating 2 screens for the 2x2 icons, each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons, but with 2x2 icons occupying 8 cells in total (2 icons * 4 cells each), the remaining cells are 15 - 4 = 11 per screen, so 22 cells for 1x1 icons.

But x=12, which is less than 22, so no additional screens are needed.

Hence, total screens = 2.

Wait, but in this calculation, x is being decreased by bxsfory * 15 + y * 4.

Wait, that seems incorrect.

Wait, in the code, it's x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

But perhaps it should be x = x - (15 - y * 4)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the formula is trying to account for the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed along with the 2x2 icons on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons, and then see how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider another approach.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 11 1x1 icons.

Because 2x2 icons take 4 cells each, so 2 icons take 8 cells, leaving 7 cells for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but in the first test case, x=1, y=1

So, allocating 1 screen for the 2x2 icon, which occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells for 1x1 icons.

Since x=1, which is less than 11, no additional screens are needed.

Hence, total screens = 1.

Similarly, third test case: x=12, y=4

Allocating 2 screens for 4 2x2 icons (2 per screen), each screen can hold 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

So, total 14 1x1 icons can be placed along with the 4 2x2 icons.

But x=12, which is less than 14, so no additional screens are needed.

Hence, total screens = 2.

Wait, but in the code, it's calculating x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which in this case is x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

Then bxsfory1 = 0, since x <= 0

So, total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Which matches.

But is this a general formula?

Let me try another test case.

Take the tenth test case: x=8, y=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

print(1 + 1) = 2

So, allocating 1 screen for 2x2 icons, which can hold 2 2x2 icons and 7 1x1 icons.

But x=8, so after placing 7 1x1 icons on the first screen, there's still 1 left, requiring an additional screen.

Hence, total screens = 2.

Which makes sense.

Another way to think about it is:

Total screens needed = max(ceil(y / 2), ceil(x / 11))

Because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 11 1x1 icons.

But in the code, it's not directly doing that.

Wait, perhaps it's calculating the number of screens needed for y, and then seeing how many additional screens are needed for the remaining x after accounting for the screens used for y.

But I'm still not fully understanding the formula used in the code.

Let me look at the formula again:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in the code.

It should be x = x - (bxsfory * (15 - y * 4))

Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of screens needed for y, and then see how many 1x1 icons can be placed on those screens along with the y icons.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 11 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed for y is ceil(y / 2)

Then, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed on those screens is ceil(y / 2) * 11

If x is less than or equal to ceil(y / 2) * 11, then no additional screens are needed.

Else, additional screens are needed for the remaining x icons.

So, total screens = ceil(y / 2) + ceil((x - ceil(y / 2) * 11) / 15)

But in the code, it's not exactly doing that.

In the code, it's calculating x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo and it should be x = x - bxsfory * 11

Then, bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

And total screens = bxsfory1 + bxsfory

That would make more sense.

But in the code, it's x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which doesn't seem right.

But let's see if it works for the test cases.

First test case: x=1, y=1

bxsfory = ceil(1 / 2) = 1

x = 1 - 1*15 + 1*4 = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

bxsfory = ceil(4 / 2) = 2

x = 12 - 2*15 + 4*4 = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Which matches.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 8 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1

bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1

total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Which matches.

Another test case: x=15, y=0

According to the code:

Since y=0, it goes to elif x > 0 and y == 0:

print(math.ceil(x / 15)) = ceil(15 / 15) = 1

Which matches the sample output.

Another test case: x=0, y=9

bxsfory = ceil(9 / 2) = 5

x = 0 - 5*15 + 9*4 = 0 - 75 + 36 = -39

bxsfory1 = 0

total screens = 0 + 5 = 5

Which matches the sample output.

So, despite my confusion about the formula, the code seems to be working correctly for the provided test cases.

Perhaps there's a reasoning behind the formula that I'm missing.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is incorrect but coincidentally works for the sample inputs.

I need to check with another test case to verify.

Let's consider x=11, y=2

According to my earlier reasoning:

Number of screens needed for y = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

Each screen can hold up to 11 1x1 icons along with the 2x2 icons.

Since x=11, which is equal to 11, so no additional screens are needed.

Total screens = 1

Now, according to the code:

bxsfory = ceil(2 / 2) = 1

x = 11 - 1*15 + 2*4 = 11 - 15 + 8 = 4

bxsfory1 = ceil(4 / 15) = 1

total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

But according to my reasoning, only 1 screen should be needed.

So, there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe my reasoning is wrong.

Let's see.

Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons and 11 1x1 icons.

So, with y=2, we need 1 screen for the 2x2 icons.

That screen can also hold 11 1x1 icons.

So, if x=11, then yes, 1 screen should suffice.

But according to the code, it's calculating x = 11 - 15 + 8 = 4, then bxsfory1 = ceil(4 / 15) = 1, total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Which is incorrect, as per my reasoning.

Hence, the code is wrong in this case.

Wait, but the sample inputs seem to work, but this additional test case shows a mistake.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

But I need to confirm.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the formula is trying to account for the total cells used by y 2x2 icons and then see how many 1x1 icons can be placed in the remaining cells.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells.

So, y 2x2 icons use 4y cells.

Each 1x1 icon uses 1 cell.

Each screen has 15 cells.

So, total cells needed = 4y + x

Total screens needed = ceil((4y + x) / 15)

But, considering that 2x2 icons cannot overlap and their placements are constrained, this might not be accurate.

But in the code, it's not calculating ceil((4y + x) / 15)

Instead, it's allocating screens for y first, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, and then seeing how many 1x1 icons can be placed on those screens.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: screens_y = ceil(y / 2)

- Each of these screens can additionally hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

- So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens: screens_y * 11

- If x <= screens_y * 11, then total screens needed = screens_y

- Else, additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: ceil((x - screens_y * 11) / 15)

- Total screens = screens_y + additional screens

But in the code, it's not exactly doing that.

In the code, it's:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)

Which is different from the above reasoning.

In my reasoning, it should be x = x - bxsfory * 11

Then, bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else ceil(x / 15)

Total screens = bxsfory1 + bxsfory

But in the code, it's x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Which seems incorrect.

But let's see why it works for the sample inputs.

First test case: x=1, y=1

x = 1 - 15 + 4 = -10 → bxsfory1 = 0 → total screens = 0 + 1 = 1

Which is correct.

Third test case: x=12, y=4

x = 12 - 30 + 16 = -2 → bxsfory1 = 0 → total screens = 0 + 2 = 2

Which is correct.

Tenth test case: x=8, y=2

x = 8 - 15 + 8 = 1 → bxsfory1 = ceil(1 / 15) = 1 → total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

Which is correct.

But in my additional test case: x=11, y=2

x = 11 - 15 + 8 = 4 → bxsfory1 = ceil(4 / 15) = 1 → total screens = 1 + 1 = 2

But according to my reasoning, it should be 1 screen.

So, perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Maybe the formula in the code is correct and my understanding is incomplete.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps the formula is:

x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4

Wait, maybe it's a mistake and it should be x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)

Which would be x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - cells_used_by_y)

But I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing y 2x2 icons and maximizing the use of remaining cells for 1x1 icons.

But I'm not sure.

Given that the code works for all the sample inputs, including the one where x=11, y=2, but according to my earlier reasoning, it seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe my additional test case is wrong.

Let me think again.

If y=2, we need 1 screen (since ceil(2/2)=1)

This screen can hold up to 11 1x1 icons.

So, if x=11, it should fit on that screen.

But according to the code, it's calculating x = 11 - 15 + 8 = 4, then needing an additional screen, totaling 2 screens, which is incorrect.

Hence, the code is wrong in this case.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: False}}\]
