Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: the first every 'a' minutes and the second every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after launch, meaning it's visible from time x to x + m inclusive, where x is the launch time.

The question is to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the fireworks from both installations interact over time. Since both installations start at the same time, I need to consider their launch schedules and the periods during which their fireworks are visible.

Let's think about the launch times:

- Installation 1 launches at times: a, 2a, 3a, ..., ka, ...

- Installation 2 launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, ..., lb, ...

Each firework from these installations is visible for m + 1 minutes after launch, so for any launch at time t, it's visible from t to t + m inclusive.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time, I need to find a time when the most number of these visibility intervals overlap.

I need to consider the possibility of overlapping launches from both installations and how their visibility periods coincide.

Let me consider the first test case from the example:

Input: 6 7 4

So, a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

This means:

- Fireworks from installation 1 are launched at 6, 12, 18, 24, ...

- Fireworks from installation 2 are launched at 7, 14, 21, 28, ...

Each firework is visible for 5 minutes (since m = 4), so:

- Firework launched at 6 is visible from 6 to 10

- Firework launched at 7 is visible from 7 to 11

- Firework launched at 12 is visible from 12 to 16

- Firework launched at 14 is visible from 14 to 18

- And so on.

Looking at time t = 7:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at 6 is visible until 10, so at t=7 it's visible.

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 7 just started.

- So, at t=7, two fireworks are visible.

Similarly, at t=14:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at 12 is visible from 12 to 16

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 14 is visible from 14 to 18

- So, at t=14, both are visible.

But, is there a time where more than two fireworks are visible? Let's check t=10:

- Firework from installation 1 launched at 6: visible until 10

- Firework from installation 1 launched at 12: starts at 12, so not yet visible at t=10

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 7: visible until 11

- Firework from installation 2 launched at 14: starts at 14, not yet visible at t=10

- So, at t=10, only the firework from installation 1 launched at 6 and from installation 2 launched at 7 are visible. That's still two.

It seems that in this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is two.

Now, looking at the second test case:

Input: 3 4 10

So, a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

Launch times:

- Installation 1: 3,6,9,12,15,18,21,24,27,30,...

- Installation 2: 4,8,12,16,20,24,28,...

Visibility:

- Each firework is visible for 11 minutes (m=10)

Let's see at t=12:

- From installation 1:

- Firework launched at 3: visible from 3 to 13

- Firework launched at 6: visible from 6 to 16

- Firework launched at 9: visible from 9 to 19

- Firework launched at 12: visible from 12 to 22

- From installation 2:

- Firework launched at 4: visible from 4 to 14

- Firework launched at 8: visible from 8 to 18

- Firework launched at 12: visible from 12 to 22

At t=12:

- Installation 1: 3-13, 6-16, 9-19, 12-22

- Installation 2: 4-14, 8-18, 12-22

So, at t=12, all these fireworks are visible:

- Installation 1: 3-13, 6-16, 9-19, 12-22

- Installation 2: 4-14, 8-18, 12-22

That's 4 from installation 1 and 3 from installation 2, but some of these intervals overlap in time, but each firework is distinct.

Wait, but the problem is to count the number of fireworks visible at time t, not the number of installations.

So, at t=12, how many fireworks are visible?

- From installation 1: launched at 3 (visible until 13), 6 (until 16), 9 (until 19), 12 (until 22)

- From installation 2: launched at 4 (until 14), 8 (until 18), 12 (until 22)

So, 7 fireworks are visible at t=12.

Is that the maximum? Let's check t=8:

- Installation 1: launched at 3 (until 13), 6 (until 16), 9 (until 19)

- Installation 2: launched at 4 (until 14), 8 (until 18)

That's 5 fireworks visible at t=8.

So, at t=12, there are 7 fireworks visible, which seems to be more than at other times.

Therefore, for this test case, the answer should be 7.

Looking at the third test case:

Input: 7 8 56

So, a=7, b=8, m=56

Launch times:

- Installation 1: 7,14,21,28,35,42,49,56,63,...

- Installation 2: 8,16,24,32,40,48,56,64,...

Visibility: m=56, so each firework is visible for 57 minutes.

Let's find a time t where the number of visible fireworks is maximized.

Let's consider t=56:

- Installation 1:

- Launched at 7: visible from 7 to 63

- Launched at 14: 14 to 70

- Launched at 21: 21 to 77

- Launched at 28: 28 to 84

- Launched at 35: 35 to 91

- Launched at 42: 42 to 98

- Launched at 49: 49 to 105

- Launched at 56: 56 to 112

- Installation 2:

- Launched at 8: visible from 8 to 64

- Launched at 16: 16 to 72

- Launched at 24: 24 to 80

- Launched at 32: 32 to 88

- Launched at 40: 40 to 96

- Launched at 48: 48 to 104

- Launched at 56: 56 to 112

At t=56:

- From installation 1: 7-63, 14-70, 21-77, 28-84, 35-91, 42-98, 49-105, 56-112

- From installation 2: 8-64, 16-72, 24-80, 32-88, 40-96, 48-104, 56-112

So, at t=56, all these fireworks are visible. That's 8 from installation 1 and 7 from installation 2, totaling 15.

But according to the sample output, it's 17. So, maybe I missed some.

Wait, perhaps I need a better way to calculate this.

Let me think about it differently.

I need to find a time t where the number of fireworks visible is maximized.

Each firework from installation 1 is launched at ka minutes, and visible from ka to ka + m.

Similarly, each firework from installation 2 is launched at lb minutes, and visible from lb to lb + m.

So, for a given time t, the number of visible fireworks is:

- Number of ka such that ka <= t <= ka + m, where ka is a multiple of a.

- Plus the number of lb such that lb <= t <= lb + m, where lb is a multiple of b.

So, for installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is the number of multiples of a that satisfy t - m <= ka <= t.

Similarly, for installation 2, it's the number of multiples of b that satisfy t - m <= lb <= t.

So, to maximize the total number of visible fireworks, I need to choose t such that both counts are maximized.

This seems tricky, especially with large values of a, b, and m.

Perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute this without iterating through all possible t.

Let me think about the number of fireworks from each installation visible at time t.

For installation 1:

Number of fireworks visible = floor((t - m)/a) - floor((t)/a - 1)

Wait, not sure about that.

Actually, the number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at time t is ceil((t - m)/a) to floor(t/a).

Wait, perhaps it's floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2: floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

So, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is:

(floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)) + (floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b))

I need to maximize this sum.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Looking at the sample input and output:

First test case: a=6, b=7, m=4

From earlier analysis, maximum is 2.

Second test case: a=3, b=4, m=10

Maximum is 7.

Third test case: a=7, b=8, m=56

Sample output is 17.

Fourth test case: a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

Sample output is 28645268630.

Fifth test case: a=1, b=1, m=1

Sample output is 4.

Wait, if a=1 and b=1 and m=1, then at t=1:

- Installation 1: launched at 1, visible from 1 to 2

- Installation 2: launched at 1, visible from 1 to 2

At t=1, both fireworks are visible.

But sample output is 4, which suggests that there are four fireworks visible at t=1.

Wait, perhaps multiple fireworks are launched at the same time from the same installation if a=1.

Wait, if a=1, then fireworks are launched every 1 minute.

So, at t=1:

- Installation 1: launched at 1, visible from 1 to 2

- Installation 2: launched at 1, visible from 1 to 2

At t=2:

- Installation 1: launched at 1 (visible until 2), launched at 2 (visible from 2 to 3)

- Installation 2: launched at 1 (visible until 2), launched at 2 (visible from 2 to 3)

So, at t=2, four fireworks are visible: two from installation 1 and two from installation 2.

Hence, the maximum is 4.

Similarly, for a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

At t=1, fireworks from installation 1 launched at 1 to 1 + m, and from installation 2 launched at 1 to 1 + m.

At t=1, both installations have launched one firework each, visible from 1 to 1 + m.

But since m is large, more fireworks are visible.

Wait, but m=10^18 is very large, and a=1, so fireworks are launched every second.

At t=1, fireworks launched at t=1 are visible until t=1 + m.

At t=2, fireworks launched at t=1 and t=2 are visible, and so on.

Wait, but the sample output is 2000000000000000002, which is 2*(m + 1) + 2.

This seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's 2*(floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)).

But I need to think differently.

Looking at the sample output, it seems that the maximum number of visible fireworks is simply the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at the time when their visibility overlaps the most.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at the time when their launch schedules overlap in terms of visibility.

Given that, perhaps the maximum is A + B, where A is the number of fireworks from installation 1 visible at some time t, and B is the number of fireworks from installation 2 visible at the same time t.

To compute A, for installation 1, the number of fireworks visible at time t is floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for installation 2.

To maximize A + B, I need to choose t such that both A and B are maximized.

But with large a, b, and m, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

First test case: a=6, b=7, m=4

A = floor(t/6) - floor((t - 5)/6)

B = floor(t/7) - floor((t - 5)/7)

To maximize A + B.

From earlier analysis, at t=7, A=1, B=1, total=2

At t=12, A=2, B=1, total=3

Wait, earlier I thought at t=12, A=2, B=1, but according to the sample output, it's 2.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, with m=4, visibility is from t to t+4.

For installation 1, launched at 6,12,18,...

At t=12:

- Firework launched at 6: visible from 6 to 10

- Firework launched at 12: visible from 12 to 16

So, at t=12, both are visible from installation 1: launched at 6 and 12.

For installation 2, launched at 7,14,21,...

At t=12:

- Firework launched at 7: visible from 7 to 11

- Firework launched at 14: not yet visible

So, only the firework launched at 7 is visible.

Thus, total visible at t=12: 2 from installation 1 and 1 from installation 2, totaling 3.

But according to the sample output, it's 2, which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the visibility periods.

Wait, m=4 means visibility from t to t+4 inclusive.

So, for installation 1:

- Launched at 6: visible from 6 to 10

- Launched at 12: visible from 12 to 16

At t=12:

- Firework launched at 6: 6 to 10 -> not visible at t=12

- Firework launched at 12: 12 to 16 -> visible at t=12

Wait, earlier I thought the firework launched at 6 is visible until t=10, so at t=12 it's not visible anymore.

So, only the firework launched at 12 is visible from installation 1.

Similarly, for installation 2:

- Launched at 7: 7 to 11 -> not visible at t=12

- Launched at 14: 14 to 18 -> not visible at t=12

So, no fireworks from installation 2 are visible at t=12.

Thus, only one firework is visible at t=12.

But earlier I thought t=7 had two fireworks visible.

Wait, at t=7:

- Installation 1: launched at 6 (6-10), launched at 12 (not yet visible)

- Installation 2: launched at 7 (7-11)

So, two fireworks visible: one from each installation.

Similarly, at t=14:

- Installation 1: launched at 12 (12-16), launched at 18 (not yet visible)

- Installation 2: launched at 14 (14-18)

So, two fireworks visible.

Hence, the maximum is indeed 2, matching the sample output.

So, perhaps the maximum number of visible fireworks is 2 when a and b are co-prime, and m is smaller than a and b.

But in the second test case, a=3, b=4, m=10

At t=12:

- Installation 1: launched at 3 (3-13), 6 (6-16), 9 (9-19), 12 (12-22)

- Installation 2: launched at 4 (4-14), 8 (8-18), 12 (12-22)

So, at t=12:

- From installation 1: 3-13, 6-16, 9-19, 12-22 -> 4 fireworks

- From installation 2: 4-14, 8-18, 12-22 -> 3 fireworks

Total: 7 fireworks visible.

Hence, the sample output is 7.

Similarly, for a=1, b=1, m=1:

At t=1:

- Installation 1: launched at 1 (1-2)

- Installation 2: launched at 1 (1-2)

Total: 2 fireworks

At t=2:

- Installation 1: launched at 1 (1-2), 2 (2-3)

- Installation 2: launched at 1 (1-2), 2 (2-3)

Total: 4 fireworks

Hence, the maximum is 4, matching the sample output.

For a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000:

At t=1:

- Installation 1: launched at 1 to 1 + m

- Installation 2: launched at 1 to 1 + m

But since a=1, fireworks are launched every second, so at t=1, fireworks launched at t=1 to t=1 + m are visible.

But m is 10^18, so number of fireworks from each installation is m + 1.

Hence, total visible fireworks at t=1: 2*(m + 1)

But according to the sample output, it's 2000000000000000002, which is 2*(m + 1).

Wait, m=1000000000000000000, so m + 1 = 1000000000000000001

Then, 2*(m + 1) = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, the maximum number of visible fireworks is 2*(m + 1).

This suggests that when a and b are both 1, the maximum is 2*(m + 1).

Similarly, for a=5, b=6, m=78123459896:

Sample output is 28645268630.

I need to verify if this matches the formula.

Let me see:

A = floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

B = floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

To maximize A + B.

I need to choose t such that A and B are maximized.

Looking at the sample input and output, it seems that the maximum is A + B, where:

A = ceil(m / a) + 1

B = ceil(m / b) + 1

Wait, in the first test case:

m=4, a=6, ceil(4/6)=1, A=1+1=2

b=7, ceil(4/7)=1, B=1+1=2

Total: 4, but sample output is 2.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(m / a) + 1

For first test case: floor(4/6)=0, A=0+1=1

floor(4/7)=0, B=0+1=1

Total: 2, matches sample output.

Second test case: floor(10/3)=3, A=3+1=4

floor(10/4)=2, B=2+1=3

Total: 7, matches sample output.

Third test case: floor(56/7)=8, A=8+1=9

floor(56/8)=7, B=7+1=8

Total: 17, matches sample output.

Fourth test case: floor(78123459896 / 5)=15624691979, A=15624691979+1=15624691980

floor(78123459896 / 6)=13020576649, B=13020576649+1=13020576650

Total: 15624691980 + 13020576650 = 28645268630, matches sample output.

Fifth test case: floor(1/1)=1, A=1+1=2

floor(1/1)=1, B=1+1=2

Total: 4, matches sample output.

Sixth test case: floor(1000000000000000000 /1)=1000000000000000000, A=1000000000000000000 +1=1000000000000000001

Similarly, B=1000000000000000001

Total: 2000000000000000002, matches sample output.

So, it seems that the formula A + B, where A = floor(m / a) + 1 and B = floor(m / b) + 1, matches all the sample inputs and outputs.

Therefore, the program provided is correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: True

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
