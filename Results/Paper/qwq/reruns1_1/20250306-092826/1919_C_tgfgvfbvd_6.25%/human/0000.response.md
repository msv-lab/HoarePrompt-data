Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of size n, and I need to split it into two subsequences, s and t. Every element of the original array a must be in either s or t, but not both. Then, for each of these subsequences, I need to calculate something called the "penalty." The penalty p(b) for a subsequence b is the number of times an element is less than the next one in the sequence. Finally, I need to sum up the penalties of s and t and find the minimum possible value of this sum.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is derived from the original array by deleting some elements, possibly zero, without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, both s and t are subsequences of a, and together they include all elements of a.

The penalty p(b) counts the number of pairs (b_i, b_{i+1}) in the subsequence where b_i < b_{i+1}. So, it's counting the number of increasing adjacent pairs.

My goal is to split the array into two subsequences in such a way that the sum of these penalties is minimized.

Let me look at the examples to get a better understanding.

First test case:

n = 5

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

One possible split is s = [2, 4, 5] and t = [1, 3]

p(s) = number of times s_i < s_{i+1} in s. Here, 2 < 4 and 4 < 5, so p(s) = 2

p(t) = number of times t_i < t_{i+1} in t. Here, 1 < 3, so p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 2 + 1 = 3

But is this the minimal possible? Maybe there's a better split that results in a smaller sum.

Another possible split: s = [1, 2, 3, 4] and t = [5]

p(s) = number of times s_i < s_{i+1}: 1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4 → p(s) = 3

p(t) = 0 (only one element)

Total penalty = 3 + 0 = 3, same as before.

Another split: s = [1, 3, 5] and t = [2, 4]

p(s) = 1 < 3 and 3 < 5 → p(s) = 2

p(t) = 2 < 4 → p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 2 + 1 = 3 again.

Is there a way to get a smaller penalty?

What if s = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and t = empty?

p(s) = 4 (since 1 < 2, 2 < 3, 3 < 4, 4 < 5)

p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 4 + 0 = 4, which is worse.

What if s = [1, 3, 4, 5] and t = [2]?

p(s) = 1 < 3, 3 < 4, 4 < 5 → p(s) = 3

p(t) = 0 (single element)

Total penalty = 3 + 0 = 3.

Still the same.

Is there a split where the total penalty is less than 3?

Let's try s = [1, 2, 4] and t = [3, 5]

p(s) = 1 < 2, 2 < 4 → p(s) = 2

p(t) = 3 < 5 → p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 2 + 1 = 3.

Same again.

Hmm, seems like 3 is the minimal possible for this case.

Let's look at the second test case:

n = 8

a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]

One possible split: s = [8, 3, 1] and t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]

p(s) = 8 > 3 > 1, so no increasing pairs → p(s) = 0

p(t) = 2 < 1 (no), 1 < 7, 7 > 4, 4 > 3 → only one increasing pair: 1 < 7 → p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 0 + 1 = 1

Is there a split with a smaller penalty, like 0?

To get a total penalty of 0, both p(s) and p(t) must be 0, meaning no increasing adjacent pairs in either sequence.

Is that possible?

Let's try to split the array so that neither s nor t has any increasing adjacent pairs.

One way is to have one sequence containing all decreasing elements and the other handling the rest.

For example, s = [8, 2, 1, 1, 3] and t = [3, 7, 4]

Wait, in s: 8 > 2 > 1 > 1 < 3 → has 1 < 3, which is an increasing pair → p(s) = 1

In t: 3 < 7 > 4 → 3 < 7 is an increasing pair → p(t) = 1

Total penalty = 1 + 1 = 2, which is worse than the previous split.

Another split: s = [8, 1, 1, 3] and t = [2, 3, 7, 4]

In s: 8 > 1 > 1 < 3 → has 1 < 3 → p(s) = 1

In t: 2 < 3 < 7 > 4 → has 2 < 3 and 3 < 7 → p(t) = 2

Total penalty = 1 + 2 = 3, worse than before.

Seems like the initial split in the example is better.

Is there a way to get penalty 0?

Let me think.

If I can arrange both s and t to be non-increasing sequences, then p(s) and p(t) would both be 0.

But is that possible?

In the array [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3], can I partition it into two sequences, each of which is non-increasing?

Let's try.

Start with s empty and t empty.

Take the first element, 8. Assign it to s: s = [8]

Next, 2. It's less than 8, so can be added to s: s = [8, 2]

Next, 3. It's greater than 2, so can't be added to s. Assign to t: t = [3]

Next, 1. It's less than 2 in s and less than 3 in t. Can be added to either s or t.

If I add to s: s = [8, 2, 1], t = [3]

Then next 1: less than 1 in s and less than 3 in t, so can be added to either.

Add to s: s = [8, 2, 1, 1], t = [3]

Next, 7. It's greater than 1 in s and greater than 3 in t, so can't be added to either. Wait, but in t, 3 is less than 7, so 7 can't be added to t because t should be non-increasing.

Similarly, s has 1, and 7 is greater than 1, so can't be added to s either.

So, I can't add 7 to either sequence if I want both to remain non-increasing.

Hence, it's impossible to split the array into two non-increasing subsequences.

Therefore, penalty 0 is not achievable, and the minimal possible penalty is 1, as in the example.

Moving on to the third test case:

n = 5

a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

This is easy. All elements are equal.

If I split it into s = [] and t = [3,3,3,3,3], then p(s) = 0 and p(t) = 0, since there are no increasing adjacent pairs.

Alternatively, any other split would also result in p(s) + p(t) = 0, because no two elements have a < b relationship.

Hence, minimal penalty is 0.

Fourth test case:

n = 1

a = [1]

Only one element. Split it into s = [1] and t = []. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 0.

Fifth test case:

n = 2

a = [2, 1]

Possible splits:

s = [2], t = [1]. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0.

s = [2,1], t = []. p(s) = 0 (since 2 > 1).

s = [1], t = [2]. p(s) = 0, p(t) = 0.

s = [1,2], t = []. p(s) = 1 (1 < 2).

So, the minimal penalty is 0.

From these examples, it seems that the minimal penalty is achieved when we try to maximize the number of decreasing runs in the two subsequences combined.

I need to find a way to split the array into two subsequences such that the total number of increasing adjacent pairs is minimized.

One approach could be to try to make both subsequences as non-increasing as possible. If I can partition the array into two non-increasing subsequences, then the penalty would be zero. However, as seen in the second test case, this is not always possible.

So, the minimal penalty would be the total number of elements that cannot be placed into these two non-increasing subsequences in a way that avoids increasing pairs.

Wait, but in the second test case, I tried to make both s and t non-increasing, but I couldn't place all elements without violating the non-increasing property.

I need a way to quantify how many increasing pairs I must have in the two subsequences combined.

Another way to think about it is to model this as a path cover problem in a graph, where the vertices are the elements of the array, and there is an edge from i to j if a[i] >= a[j], meaning that j can follow i in a non-increasing subsequence.

The minimal number of paths needed to cover all vertices in this graph would correspond to the minimal number of non-increasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

Since we are allowed to split the array into two subsequences, s and t, the minimal penalty would be related to how well we can cover the array with these two subsequences.

If the array can be covered with two non-increasing subsequences, then the penalty is zero. Otherwise, the penalty is equal to the number of additional increasing pairs that cannot be avoided.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider the problem in terms of Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS).

If I find the LDS of the array, that gives me the longest subsequence that is non-increasing. If I can put that LDS into one subsequence, and the rest into the other subsequence, then the penalty would be equal to the number of increasing pairs in the remaining subsequence.

But I need to minimize the sum of penalties in both subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I should aim to maximize the number of elements in non-increasing subsequences across both s and t.

In other words, I want to cover as much of the array as possible with non-increasing subsequences in s and t.

The minimal penalty would then be equal to the number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided in this covering.

But I need a more concrete algorithm to compute this.

Let me consider a greedy approach.

I can iterate through the array and try to assign each element to one of the two subsequences, s or t, in a way that minimizes the number of increasing pairs.

I need to keep track of the last elements of s and t to decide where to place the current element.

Let me think about maintaining two sequences, s and t, and keeping track of their last elements.

Initialize s and t as empty lists.

For each element in the array:

- If the element is less than or equal to the last element of s, assign it to s.

- Else if the element is less than or equal to the last element of t, assign it to t.

- Else, assign it to the subsequence where it causes the least penalty, which in this case would be the subsequence with the smaller last element.

Wait, but this is similar to the way we handle the two-pointer approach in some array partitioning problems.

Let me try this approach with the first test case:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Initialize s and t as empty.

Start with 1:

- Both s and t are empty, so assign 1 to s. s = [1], t = []

Next, 2:

- 2 > last(s) = 1, so assign to t. t = [2]

Next, 3:

- 3 > last(s) = 1, and 3 > last(t) = 2.

- Assign to the one with smaller last element, which is s.

- But wait, both s and t have last elements less than 3, so choose one where it doesn't create an increasing pair.

- If I assign 3 to s: s = [1, 3], which has 1 < 3, so p(s) = 1

- If I assign 3 to t: t = [2, 3], which has 2 < 3, so p(t) = 1

- Either way, I have to add 1 to the penalty.

- Let's assign 3 to s: s = [1, 3], t = [2]

Next, 4:

- 4 > last(s) = 3, and 4 > last(t) = 2.

- Assign to s: s = [1, 3, 4], p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 and 3 < 4)

- Or assign to t: t = [2, 4], p(t) = 1 (2 < 4)

- Current penalties: p(s) = 2, p(t) = 1 → total 3

- If I assign 4 to s: s = [1, 3, 4], p(s) = 2; t = [2], p(t) = 0 → total 2

- If I assign 4 to t: s = [1, 3], p(s) = 1; t = [2, 4], p(t) = 1 → total 2

- So, total penalty is 2 in both cases, which is less than the earlier split.

Wait, but according to the example, the minimal penalty is 3. So maybe my approach is not optimal.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, in the first test case, the minimal penalty is 3, as per the example.

But in my approach, I'm getting a total penalty of 2, which is better.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me re-examine.

If s = [1, 3, 4], p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 and 3 < 4)

t = [2], p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 2 + 0 = 2

Is this a valid split? Yes, because s and t are both subsequences of a, and every element is in either s or t.

But according to the example, the minimal penalty is 3, but I've found a split with penalty 2.

Wait, maybe the example is not showing the minimal penalty.

Wait, no, perhaps I misread the problem.

Wait, in the first test case, the example split is s = [2,4,5], t = [1,3], with p(s) = 2 and p(t) = 1, total 3.

But I found s = [1,3,4], t = [2], with p(s) = 2 and p(t) = 0, total 2.

Is this allowed?

Wait, in my split, s = [1,3,4], which is a subsequence of a, and t = [2], which is also a subsequence, and all elements are covered.

So, perhaps the example is not showing the minimal penalty, or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the definition of penalty is not correctly understood.

Let me re-read the problem.

"Define the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1}."

So, p(b) counts the number of times an element is less than the next one.

Wait, hold on, in s = [1,3,4], p(s) counts the number of times s_i < s_{i+1}, which is 1 < 3 and 3 < 4, so p(s) = 2.

In t = [2], p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 2 + 0 = 2.

But according to the example, the minimal penalty is 3.

Wait, maybe I misread the example.

In the first test case, the example split is s = [2,4,5], t = [1,3], with p(s) = 2 (2 < 4 and 4 < 5) and p(t) = 1 (1 < 3), total 3.

But I found a split with penalty 2.

Is my split invalid?

Wait, no, it seems valid.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts the number of increasing pairs, and in my split, s = [1,3,4] has two increasing pairs, and t = [2] has none, so total penalty is 2.

But according to the example, the minimal penalty is 3.

So, perhaps my understanding is correct, and the example is just showing one possible minimal split, not necessarily the absolute minimal.

Wait, but in the note, it says "a possible way to split a is s=[2,4,5] and t=[1,3] . The penalty is p(s)+p(t)=2 + 1 =3 ."

But I found a split with penalty 2, which is better.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the penalty is the number of increasing adjacent pairs, and the minimal possible is indeed 2.

But in that case, why does the example show 3?

Wait, perhaps the problem is to maximize the penalty, but no, it says "the minimal possible penalty."

Wait, perhaps I need to confirm with other test cases.

In the third test case, a = [3,3,3,3,3], minimal penalty is 0, which makes sense, as no increasing pairs.

In the second test case, a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3], minimal penalty is 1.

In the fifth test case, a = [2,1], minimal penalty is 0.

In the fourth test case, a = [1], minimal penalty is 0.

In the first test case, according to the example, minimal penalty is 3, but I found a split with penalty 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to minimize p(s) + p(t), and in the first test case, it's indeed 2.

Maybe the example is just demonstrating one possible split, not necessarily the optimal one.

So, perhaps the minimal penalty is 2, and the example didn't show the optimal split.

Wait, but in that case, there might be an error in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscounted the penalty.

Wait, in s = [1,3,4], p(s) = number of times s_i < s_{i+1}.

So, 1 < 3 and 3 < 4 → p(s) = 2.

In t = [2], p(t) = 0.

Total penalty = 2 + 0 = 2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to minimize p(s) + p(t), and in the first test case, 2 is achievable, but the example shows 3.

So, perhaps the example is not demonstrating the minimal penalty.

I need to proceed with the understanding that the minimal penalty is the minimal possible, not necessarily what's shown in the example.

So, in the first test case, minimal penalty is 2, achievable by s = [1,3,4], t = [2], as I showed.

Wait, but according to the problem's output, for the first test case, it's 3.

Wait, the output is:

3

1

0

0

0

But according to my calculation, for the first test case, it should be 2, not 3.

Hmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the penalty is defined differently.

Wait, the problem says "the penalty p(b) of an array b as the number of indices i between 1 and m - 1 where b_i < b_{i + 1}."

So, it's counting the number of increasing adjacent pairs.

In s = [1,3,4], p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 and 3 < 4)

In t = [2], p(t) = 0

Total penalty = 2 + 0 = 2

But according to the output, it's 3.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that s and t must be built by removing elements from a without changing the order.

Wait, but in my split, s = [1,3,4], which is a subsequence of a, and t = [2], which is also a subsequence, and all elements are covered.

So, perhaps the problem expects 3, but I don't see why.

Wait, maybe the problem is to split a into two subsequences, but the penalty is calculated based on the merged sequence, but no, it's per subsequence.

I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that the total penalty is the sum of p(s) and p(t), and I need to minimize this sum.

I need to find a way to assign each element to s or t such that the total number of increasing adjacent pairs in both s and t is minimized.

I need an algorithm that can do this efficiently, given the constraints (n up to 2e5 per test case, and up to 1e4 test cases, with total n across all test cases up to 2e5).

So, time complexity should be O(n) per test case, or at least O(n log n).

Let me think about a way to model this.

I can think of this as processing the array from left to right, and for each element, deciding whether to assign it to s or t, based on the last elements of s and t.

I need to keep track of the last elements of s and t to decide where to place the current element.

I can maintain two variables, say last_s and last_t, which store the last elements of s and t, respectively.

Initialize s and t as empty, so last_s and last_t can be considered as infinity initially.

Then, for each element in the array, I have two choices: assign it to s or to t.

But I need to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a dynamic programming problem.

Define dp[i][0] as the minimal penalty for the first i elements, where the i-th element is assigned to s.

Similarly, dp[i][1] is the minimal penalty for the first i elements, where the i-th element is assigned to t.

Then, for each i, I can transition from dp[j][0] or dp[j][1] for j < i, depending on whether a[j] < a[i].

But this seems too slow for n up to 2e5.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is the number of increasing adjacent pairs in s and t.

I need to minimize the sum of these penalties.

This seems similar to covering the array with two decreasing subsequences, and the penalty is the number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal number of increasing pairs that must be present, given that I split the array into two decreasing subsequences.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider starting with two empty subsequences and iterating through the array, assigning each element to the subsequence where it causes the least increase in penalty.

To do this, I need to keep track of the last elements of s and t.

Initialize last_s and last_t to negative infinity.

For each element in the array:

- If a[i] is less than or equal to last_s, assign it to s, and update last_s to a[i], with no increase in penalty.

- Else if a[i] is less than or equal to last_t, assign it to t, and update last_t to a[i], with no increase in penalty.

- Else, assign it to the subsequence whose last element is smaller, and increase the penalty by 1.

Also, update the last element of the assigned subsequence to a[i].

Wait, perhaps I need to track the minimal possible penalty based on which subsequence I assign the current element to.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach, but I need to optimize it for time.

Wait, maybe I can use a greedy approach.

Initialize two variables to track the last elements of s and t, say last_s and last_t, both set to negative infinity.

Initialize a counter for the penalty.

Iterate through each element in the array:

- If a[i] <= last_s, assign to s, update last_s = a[i], no penalty increase.

- Else if a[i] <= last_t, assign to t, update last_t = a[i], no penalty increase.

- Else, assign to the subsequence whose last element is smaller, and increase the penalty by 1.

- Update the last element of the assigned subsequence to a[i].

This seems similar to the way we handle the patience sorting algorithm for finding the longest increasing subsequence.

Wait, in the longest increasing subsequence problem, we use a greedy approach with a list of tails of increasing subsequences.

Here, since we have two subsequences, perhaps I can maintain two lists, one for s and one for t, and try to minimize the number of increasing pairs.

But I need to think differently.

Let me try implementing this greedy approach and see if it works with the first test case.

First test case: a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize last_s = last_t = -inf

Penalty = 0

Start with 1:

- 1 <= -inf is false.

- 1 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to the subsequence with smaller last element, which is s (since both are -inf).

- Assign to s, set last_s = 1, penalty += 0.

Next, 2:

- 2 <= 1 is false.

- 2 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to the subsequence with smaller last element, which is t (since last_s = 1 and last_t = -inf).

- Assign to t, set last_t = 2, penalty += 1 (since it's greater than last_s and last_t).

Wait, no, according to the rule, if a[i] > last_s and a[i] > last_t, assign to the one with the smaller last element.

In this case, last_s = 1, last_t = -inf, so last_t is smaller.

Assign to t, set last_t = 2, penalty += 1.

Next, 3:

- 3 <= 1 is false.

- 3 <= 2 is false.

- Assign to the subsequence with smaller last element, which is t (last_t = 2).

- Assign to t, set last_t = 3, penalty += 1.

Next, 4:

- 4 <= 1 is false.

- 4 <= 3 is false.

- Assign to t (last_t = 3), set last_t = 4, penalty += 1.

Next, 5:

- 5 <= 1 is false.

- 5 <= 4 is false.

- Assign to t (last_t = 4), set last_t = 5, penalty += 1.

Total penalty = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4.

But earlier, I found a split with penalty 2.

So, this approach gives penalty 4, which is worse than the optimal.

Hence, this greedy approach is not optimal.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times I have to "switch" subsequences when assigning elements, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided.

In other words, if I try to cover the array with two decreasing subsequences, the minimal number of increasing pairs is equal to the number of times I have to "break" the decreasing property.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let me look at the official solution or think of a different strategy.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array.

In the standard problem, the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

But in this problem, since I have two subsequences, perhaps the minimal penalty is related to the length of the longest increasing subsequence minus one, or something similar.

Wait, in the first test case, the longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,4,5], of length 5.

If I have two decreasing subsequences, the minimal number of increasing pairs is... not clear.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the minimal number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided when splitting into two decreasing subsequences.

This seems related to the minimal number of "conflicts" where elements are increasing between subsequences.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Let me try to formalize the problem.

Let s and t be two subsequences such that every element of a is in exactly one of them.

We need to minimize p(s) + p(t), where p(b) counts the number of times b_i < b_{i+1} in b.

This is equivalent to minimizing the total number of increasing adjacent pairs in s and t.

I need to assign each element to s or t such that this sum is minimized.

I can model this as a graph where nodes are the elements, and edges represent the possibility of one element following another in a subsequence without creating an increasing pair.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a DAG and find a way to partition the nodes into two paths that minimize some criteria.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I fix one subsequence, say s, and try to make it as "good" as possible, then assign the remaining elements to t.

But I need to optimize both s and t simultaneously.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the array and try to assign elements in a specific order.

No, the array must be split into subsequences that maintain the original order.

I need to preserve the relative order of elements in the subsequences.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and greedily assign each element to the subsequence that allows it without creating an increasing pair, or assign it to the subsequence that minimizes the penalty.

Let me try to formalize a greedy approach.

Initialize last_s = -inf, last_t = -inf, penalty = 0.

For each element a[i] in order:

- If a[i] <= last_s, assign to s, set last_s = a[i], no penalty increase.

- Else if a[i] <= last_t, assign to t, set last_t = a[i], no penalty increase.

- Else, assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, set that last element to a[i], and increase penalty by 1.

Wait, similar to what I tried earlier, but in the first test case, it gave penalty 4, which is worse than the optimal.

Hence, this approach is not optimal.

I need to adjust it.

Wait, perhaps when a[i] > last_s and a[i] > last_t, I should assign it to the subsequence that maximizes the last element, to minimize future penalties.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, I assigned to the subsequence with the smaller last element.

Maybe that's not the best strategy.

Let me try assigning to the subsequence with the larger last element when a[i] > last_s and a[i] > last_t.

Wait, in the first test case:

Initialize last_s = last_t = -inf, penalty = 0.

First element, 1:

- 1 <= -inf is false.

- 1 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to the subsequence with the larger last element, which is s (last_s = -inf, last_t = -inf, so choose one, say s).

- Assign to s, set last_s = 1, penalty += 0.

Next, 2:

- 2 <= 1 is false.

- 2 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to the subsequence with the larger last element, which is s (last_s = 1, last_t = -inf).

- Assign to s, set last_s = 2, penalty += 1 (since 2 > 1).

Next, 3:

- 3 <= 2 is false.

- 3 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to s (last_s = 2), set last_s = 3, penalty += 1.

Next, 4:

- 4 <= 3 is false.

- 4 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to s (last_s = 3), set last_s = 4, penalty += 1.

Next, 5:

- 5 <= 4 is false.

- 5 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to s (last_s = 4), set last_s = 5, penalty += 1.

Total penalty = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4, same as before.

Worse than the optimal.

Alternative approach: try to maximize the last elements of s and t.

Initialize last_s = -inf, last_t = -inf, penalty = 0.

For each element a[i]:

- If a[i] <= last_s, assign to s, set last_s = a[i], no penalty.

- Else if a[i] <= last_t, assign to t, set last_t = a[i], no penalty.

- Else, assign to the subsequence where a[i] can extend the subsequence without creating an increasing pair, if possible.

- If neither is possible, assign to the subsequence with the larger last element, and increase penalty by 1.

Wait, not sure.

Perhaps I need to keep track of multiple possible assignments.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

I recall that in some similar problems, the minimal number of increasing subsequences needed is equal to the size of the longest decreasing subsequence.

But here, we have to split into exactly two subsequences, and minimize the sum of penalties, which is related to the number of increasing pairs.

Wait, perhaps I can find the minimal number of increasing pairs by assigning elements to s and t in a way that minimizes the number of times we have to "increase" within a subsequence.

Wait, perhaps I can use a priority queue to manage the last elements of s and t.

Initialize two variables last_s and last_t to -inf.

Initialize a counter for penalty.

For each element a[i]:

- If a[i] <= last_s, assign to s, set last_s = a[i], no penalty.

- Else if a[i] <= last_t, assign to t, set last_t = a[i], no penalty.

- Else, find the subsequence whose last element is smallest and assign a[i] to it, set the last element to a[i], and increase penalty by 1.

Wait, similar to what I did earlier.

In the first test case, this gives penalty 4, but I know that a better split exists with penalty 2.

Hence, this approach is not optimal.

I need to find a way to delay the assignment to the subsequence with the larger last element.

Wait, perhaps I need to assign to the subsequence that allows for more flexibility in the future.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix one subsequence, say s, to be a decreasing subsequence, and assign the rest to t.

Then, the penalty would be the number of increasing pairs in t.

To minimize the total penalty, I need to maximize the number of non-increasing pairs in s, so that t has fewer increasing pairs.

But I need to optimize for both s and t simultaneously.

This seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the minimal penalty is equal to the length of the array minus twice the length of the longest decreasing subsequence.

Because if I can cover the array with two decreasing subsequences, the penalty would be zero.

If not, the penalty would be the number of elements not covered by two such subsequences.

So, if LDS is the length of the longest decreasing subsequence, then the minimal penalty is n - 2*LDS.

But I need to verify this.

In the first test case, LDS is 1 (since all elements are increasing), so n - 2*LDS = 5 - 2*1 = 3, which matches the example's penalty.

Wait, but earlier I found a split with penalty 2.

So, this formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's n - LDS - LICS, where LICS is the longest increasing common subsequence or something.

Wait, no.

I need to find a better way.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of elements that are part of increasing pairs in both subsequences.

But this is too vague.

Let me look for a different strategy.

I recall that in the patience sorting algorithm, we can find the minimal number of decreasing subsequences needed to cover the array, which is equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

In this problem, since we are allowed to use two subsequences, perhaps the minimal penalty is related to the longest increasing subsequence in some way.

Let me denote LIS as the length of the longest increasing subsequence.

In the first test case, LIS is 5, and n = 5, so n - LIS = 0, but the minimal penalty is 3.

Wait, no, according to earlier calculations, it's possible to have penalty 2.

Wait, perhaps it's n - LDS - (n - LDS), but that doesn't make sense.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of times I have to "switch" the subsequence assignment, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this as a graph where nodes are the elements, and edges represent possible assignments without creating increasing pairs.

Then, finding the minimal penalty would be equivalent to finding a way to partition the nodes into two paths.

But this seems too involved for the time constraints.

I need a more straightforward approach.

Let me consider that the penalty is minimized when the increasing pairs are distributed optimally between s and t.

So, perhaps I need to distribute the increasing pairs as evenly as possible between s and t.

But I'm not sure how to implement this.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the array and assign elements to s or t based on whether assigning to s or t would create fewer increasing pairs.

This sounds similar to the earlier greedy approach, but perhaps with a different tiebreaker.

Let me try this with the first test case.

a = [1,2,3,4,5]

Initialize s = [], t = [], last_s = -inf, last_t = -inf, penalty = 0.

First element, 1:

- Assign to s, set last_s = 1, penalty += 0.

Next, 2:

- If assigned to s: s = [1,2], penalty += 1 (since 1 < 2)

- If assigned to t: t = [2], penalty += 0

- Choose to assign to t, set last_t = 2, penalty += 0.

Now, s = [1], t = [2], penalty = 0.

Next, 3:

- If assigned to s: s = [1,3], penalty += 1 (1 < 3)

- If assigned to t: t = [2,3], penalty += 1 (2 < 3)

- Both options give penalty += 1, so choose one, say s.

- Assign to s, set last_s = 3, penalty += 1.

Now, s = [1,3], t = [2], penalty = 1.

Next, 4:

- If assigned to s: s = [1,3,4], penalty += 1 (3 < 4)

- If assigned to t: t = [2,4], penalty += 1 (2 < 4)

- Both options give penalty += 1, so choose one, say t.

- Assign to t, set last_t = 4, penalty += 1.

Now, s = [1,3], t = [2,4], penalty = 2.

Next, 5:

- If assigned to s: s = [1,3,5], penalty += 1 (3 < 5)

- If assigned to t: t = [2,4,5], penalty += 1 (4 < 5)

- Both options give penalty += 1, so choose one, say s.

- Assign to s, set last_s = 5, penalty += 1.

Final s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], penalty = 3.

Wait, now the total penalty is 3, same as the example.

But earlier, I had a split with penalty 2.

What's different here?

In the earlier approach, I assigned 4 to t, making s = [1,3,5], t = [2,4], with penalties p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 and 3 < 5) and p(t) = 1 (2 < 4), total 3.

But previously, I thought of assigning 4 to s: s = [1,3,4], p(s) = 2 (1 < 3 and 3 < 4), t = [2], p(t) = 0, total penalty 2.

But according to this approach, assigning 4 to t gives penalty 3.

So, perhaps I need to choose the assignment that minimizes the current penalty increase, but also consider future elements.

This seems like a look-ahead approach, which is not feasible for large n.

I need a better strategy.

Let me consider that the minimal penalty is equal to the number of increasing pairs that cannot be avoided when splitting into two decreasing subsequences.

In other words, it's the total number of increasing pairs in the array minus the maximum number of increasing pairs that can be placed into one subsequence.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the total number of increasing pairs in the array and subtract the maximal number of increasing pairs that can be placed into one subsequence.

But I'm not sure.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that in the minimal penalty split, each increasing pair in the array must be split between s and t, unless both elements can be placed in the same subsequence without violating the non-increasing property.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of increasing pairs that must be split between s and t.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

This is getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should implement the earlier greedy approach and see if it works for the sample inputs.

In the first test case, it gives penalty 3, which matches the sample output.

In the second test case, let's try it.

a = [8,2,3,1,1,7,4,3]

Initialize last_s = last_t = -inf, penalty = 0.

First element, 8:

- Assign to s, set last_s = 8, penalty += 0.

Next, 2:

- 2 <= 8 is true, assign to s, set last_s = 2, penalty += 0.

Next, 3:

- 3 <= 2 is false.

- 3 <= -inf is false.

- Assign to the subsequence with the smaller last element, which is t (last_t = -inf).
