Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play the game again with the remaining numbers. This continues until there are no numbers left.

The task is to figure out the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes the numbers optimally. So, Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins.

First, I need to understand how the XOR operation works with the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's list out their binary representations:

- 1: 001

- 2: 010

- 3: 011 (which is 1|2)

- 4: 100

So, the XOR of a sequence of these numbers will depend on how many times each bit is set across all numbers.

Given that each number is at most 4, we're dealing with numbers that have bits only in positions 0, 1, and 2 (since 4 is 100 in binary).

The XOR of a sequence of numbers is the bitwise XOR of all of them, which means for each bit position, the XOR is 1 if there's an odd number of 1s in that bit position across all numbers, and 0 otherwise.

Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is zero. So, Eve wants to arrange the removals in such a way that the sequence has an XOR of zero as often as possible.

Given that Eve removes one number at a time, starting from the full sequence down to an empty sequence, we have n steps, and at each step, Eve chooses which number to remove.

Wait, but actually, Eve removes one number at each step, and then Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers. So, at each step, the sequence has one fewer number than before.

But the problem says: "Eve removes one number from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers." And so on, until the sequence is empty.

So, it's a sequence of games: one with n numbers, one with n-1, one with n-2, ..., down to zero.

Eve removes one number at each step, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the current sequence.

Wait, but once Eve removes a number, it's permanently removed for the next games.

So, the sequence of games is:

1. Start with n numbers, Eve removes one, play with n-1.

2. From the remaining n-1, Eve removes one, play with n-2.

3. And so on, until there are no numbers left.

But actually, reading the problem again: "Eve removes one number from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it's a sequence of games where in each game, Eve has removed one more number than in the previous game.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

- Initially, there are n numbers.

- Eve removes one number, leaving n-1 numbers, and Alice and Bob play with these n-1 numbers.

- Then, Eve removes another number from these n-1, leaving n-2, and Alice and Bob play with n-2.

- And so on, until there are no numbers left.

So, there are n games in total: one for each possible number of removals, from removing 1 to removing n.

But actually, the output is a single number for each test case, which is the maximum number of times Bob can win.

So, perhaps it's not about playing n games, but about playing n games where in each game, a different subset of the original sequence is considered after removing some numbers.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Looking back at the problem: "Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems like a sequence of games, where in each game, Eve has removed one more number, and Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers.

So, for each k from 0 to n-1, there's a game with n - k numbers after Eve has removed k numbers.

But Eve gets to choose which number to remove at each step.

Wait, but actually, Eve removes one number at each step, and after each removal, Alice and Bob play with the remaining numbers.

So, it's like:

1. Start with n numbers.

2. Eve removes one number, now there are n-1 numbers. Alice and Bob play with these n-1 numbers.

3. Eve removes another number from these n-1, now there are n-2 numbers. Alice and Bob play with these n-2 numbers.

4. And so on, until there are no numbers left.

And for each of these games (with n-1, n-2, ..., 0 numbers), we need to determine if Bob wins or Alice wins based on the XOR of the current sequence.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the remaining sequence has a XOR of zero.

Given that, Eve needs to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Now, to maximize Bob's wins, Eve needs to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we have counts of each, perhaps there is a pattern or a formula to determine how many times Bob can win.

Let's consider the properties of XOR:

- XOR is associative and commutative.

- XOR of a number with itself is zero.

- XOR of a sequence is zero if every bit position has an even number of 1s.

Given that the numbers are 1, 2, 3, or 4, which in binary are 001, 010, 011, and 100 respectively, we can consider the XOR of the entire sequence based on the counts of each number.

Let's think about the XOR of the entire sequence.

Let me denote the sequence as a list of numbers, each being 1, 2, 3, or 4.

The XOR of the sequence is the XOR of all these numbers.

We can also think of it in terms of the counts of each number.

But since XOR is not linear like addition, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, but since XOR is associative and commutative, maybe we can find a way to compute the XOR based on the counts.

Let's consider that each number contributes its binary representation to the overall XOR.

So, for bit 0 (least significant bit), it's set in 1 and 3.

For bit 1, it's set in 2 and 3.

For bit 2, it's set in 4.

So, for each bit position, the XOR will be 1 if there's an odd number of 1s in that bit position across all numbers.

Therefore, for the entire sequence, the XOR is zero if and only if, for each bit position, the number of 1s in that position is even.

Given that, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of linear algebra over GF(2), but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Given the constraints, t can be up to 10^4, and p_i up to 200, so n can be up to 800.

But since n can be up to 800, and we have to simulate the process, we need an efficient way to compute the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, we check if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled using the properties of XOR and the counts of each number.

Given that the numbers are only 1, 2, 3, and 4, and their binary representations are known, perhaps we can find a way to compute the XOR based on the counts.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the parity of the counts.

Let me try to compute the XOR of the entire sequence based on the counts.

Let me denote:

- c1: count of 1s

- c2: count of 2s

- c3: count of 3s

- c4: count of 4s

Then, the total count n = c1 + c2 + c3 + c4.

Now, the XOR of the sequence is:

- For bit 0: (c1 + c3) mod 2

- For bit 1: (c2 + c3) mod 2

- For bit 2: c4 mod 2

So, the overall XOR is:

x = ( (c1 + c3) mod 2 ) * 1 + ( (c2 + c3) mod 2 ) * 2 + ( c4 mod 2 ) * 4

Now, at each step, Eve removes one number, which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we need to choose which one to remove to maximize the number of times the remaining XOR is zero.

Wait, but Eve can choose which number to remove at each step, based on the current sequence.

But this seems too involved to simulate directly, especially since n can be up to 800 and t up to 10^4.

Perhaps there's a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider that each removal changes the counts of the numbers, and consequently, the XOR.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Let me think about the parity of the counts.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the sums.

Given that XOR is essentially about the parity of the number of 1s in each bit position, maybe I can find a way to manipulate the parities to maximize Bob's wins.

Let me consider that for the XOR to be zero, all bit positions must have even number of 1s.

So, for bit 0: (c1 + c3) mod 2 == 0

For bit 1: (c2 + c3) mod 2 == 0

For bit 2: c4 mod 2 == 0

So, the XOR is zero only if all these conditions hold.

Eve wants to remove numbers in such a way that these conditions hold as often as possible.

Now, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step.

So, at each step, Eve can choose to remove a 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on which one allows the remaining counts to satisfy the above conditions.

This seems quite involved.

Perhaps there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the total number of possible games.

There are n steps, and at each step, Eve chooses one number to remove.

But since n can be up to 800, and t up to 10^4, we need an efficient algorithm.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times each type of number is removed.

Wait, but the order of removal matters because the XOR changes based on which number is removed at each step.

This seems too complicated to handle directly.

Maybe I can think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that the sequence starts with n numbers and ends with none.

At each step, Eve removes one number, and we check if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

I need to maximize the number of times this XOR is zero.

Let me consider the total number of games: n games (from n-1 numbers down to 0 numbers).

But actually, when the sequence is empty, the XOR is zero (since XOR is associative and XOR of no elements is zero), so Bob wins the last game.

Wait, but the problem says "play with n-1 numbers, then n-2, and so on until the sequence is empty."

So, there are n games: n-1, n-2, ..., 1, and 0 numbers.

Bob wins if the XOR is zero in each game.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

Given that, and considering that the XOR is determined by the counts of each number, perhaps there's a way to compute how many times the XOR can be zero.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the total number of subsets with XOR zero.

But no, it's not about subsets; it's about the sequence after removing k numbers, for k from 1 to n.

Wait, but Eve gets to choose which number to remove at each step, so she can choose in a way that maximizes Bob's wins.

This seems tricky.

Let me try to look for patterns or properties.

First, let's consider small examples.

Take the first test case: 1 1 1 0

So, c1=1, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

Total n=3

Games:

1. With 2 numbers: Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers: 2 and 3

XOR: 2 XOR 3 = 1, which is non-zero, so Alice wins.

Or, if Eve removes 2, remaining:1 and 3, XOR:1 XOR 3=2, Alice wins.

Or, remove 3, remaining:1 and 2, XOR:1 XOR 2=3, Alice wins.

So, in this case, Bob doesn't win in the first game.

2. With 1 number: Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining:1 and 3

Wait, no, after first removal, suppose Eve removes 1, remaining:2 and 3

Then, in the second game, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining:3

Then, in the third game, Eve removes 3, remaining empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins only once, in the last game.

Similarly, in the second test case:1 0 1 2

So, c1=1, c2=0, c3=1, c4=2

Total n=4

Games:

1. Remove one number, say 1, remaining:0,1,2 (numbers:2,3,4,4)

XOR:2 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 2 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Or, remove 3, remaining:1,0,2 (numbers:1,4,4)

XOR:1 XOR 4 XOR 4 =1 XOR 0=1, Alice wins.

Or, remove 4, remaining:1,1,1 (numbers:1,3,4)

XOR:1 XOR 3 XOR 4=1 XOR 3 XOR 4=6, Alice wins.

So, in the first game, Bob doesn't win.

Then, in the second game, Eve removes another number, say 3, remaining:1,2,4

XOR:1 XOR 4=5, Alice wins.

Third game, remove another number, say 4, remaining:1,2

XOR:1 XOR 2=3, Alice wins.

Fourth game, remove 1, remaining:2

XOR:2, Alice wins.

Fifth game, remove 2, remaining empty, XOR:0, Bob wins.

So, again, Bob wins only once, in the last game.

Wait, but the sample output for the second test case is 1, which matches.

In the third test case:2 2 2 0

c1=2, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

n=6

Similarly, following the same logic, Bob wins only once, in the last game, according to the sample output:3

Wait, the sample output is 3, which is different from my earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Looking back at the sample output:1,1,3,3,12

Wait, for the third test case, output is 3.

Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Let me think again.

Maybe Eve can arrange to have Bob win more times than just the last game.

Perhaps by removing numbers in a specific order, she can make the XOR zero at multiple steps.

Let me consider that.

In the third test case:2 2 2 0

So, c1=2, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

n=6

Possible sequence of removals:

1. Remove 1, remaining:1,2,3,4,4

Wait, c1=1, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

Wait, c4=0, but earlier c4=0, but in this test case, c4=0.

Wait, no, c4=0 in the first test case, but in the third test case, c4=0 as well.

Wait, no, looking back:

Third test case:2 2 2 0

So, c1=2, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

Total n=6

Possible sequence:

1. Remove 1, remaining c1=1, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

XOR: (1 + 3)=0, (2 + 3)=1, c4=0

So, XOR= 0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4 = 2, which is non-zero, Alice wins.

2. Remove another 1, remaining c1=0, c2=2, c3=2, c4=0

XOR: (0 + 2)=0, (2 + 2)=0, 0

So, XOR=0, Bob wins.

3. Remove 2, remaining c1=0, c2=1, c3=2, c4=0

XOR: (0 + 2)=0, (1 + 2)=1, 0

So, XOR=0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4=2, Alice wins.

4. Remove 3, remaining c1=0, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (0 +1)=1, (1 +1)=0, 0

So, XOR=1*1 + 0*2 + 0*4=1, Alice wins.

5. Remove 2, remaining c1=0, c2=0, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (0 +1)=1, (0 +1)=1, 0

So, XOR=1*1 + 1*2 + 0*4=3, Alice wins.

6. Remove 3, remaining c1=0, c2=0, c3=0, c4=0

XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, in this sequence, Bob wins twice: after removing two numbers and after removing all six numbers.

But according to the sample output, it's 3.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence where Bob wins three times.

Let me try a different sequence:

1. Remove 3, remaining c1=2, c2=2, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (2 +1)=1, (2 +1)=1, 0

So, XOR=1*1 + 1*2 + 0*4=3, Alice wins.

2. Remove 1, remaining c1=1, c2=2, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (1 +1)=0, (2 +1)=1, 0

So, XOR=0*1 + 1*2 + 0*4=2, Alice wins.

3. Remove 2, remaining c1=1, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (1 +1)=0, (1 +1)=0, 0

So, XOR=0, Bob wins.

4. Remove 1, remaining c1=0, c2=1, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (0 +1)=1, (1 +1)=0, 0

So, XOR=1*1 + 0*2 + 0*4=1, Alice wins.

5. Remove 2, remaining c1=0, c2=0, c3=1, c4=0

XOR: (0 +1)=1, (0 +1)=1, 0

So, XOR=1*1 + 1*2 + 0*4=3, Alice wins.

6. Remove 3, remaining c1=0, c2=0, c3=0, c4=0

XOR=0, Bob wins.

Again, Bob wins twice.

But the sample output is 3, which suggests there's a way for Bob to win three times.

Wait, perhaps including the initial game before any removal.

Wait, looking back at the problem: "Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, the initial game is with n numbers, but Eve hasn't removed any yet.

Wait, no, in the first game, Eve removes one number, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers.

So, the first game is with n-1 numbers.

Wait, but perhaps I misread it.

Looking back: "Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, the sequence is:

1. Eve removes one number, play with n-1.

2. Eve removes another number from the n-1, play with n-2.

3. And so on, until no numbers are left.

So, there are n games in total: from n-1 down to 0.

So, in the third test case, n=6, so there are 6 games: with 5,4,3,2,1,0 numbers.

According to the sample output, Bob wins 3 times.

In my earlier sequence, Bob wins twice (with 0 and with 4 numbers), but the sample output is 3.

So, perhaps there's a way for Bob to win three times.

Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to consider that Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the remaining XOR is zero.

So, perhaps there's a way to have the XOR zero at three different steps.

Let me consider that.

Let me try to maximize the number of times the XOR is zero.

Given that, perhaps I can look for the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But no, it's not about subsets; it
