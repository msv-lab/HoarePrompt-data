Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's, and I need to make sure it's sorted in non-descending order. That means all the '0's should come before the '1's. For example, "000111" is sorted, but "101010" is not.

The operation I can perform is a cyclic shift on any substring of the string. A cyclic shift means taking the last character of the substring and moving it to the front, pushing the other characters to the right. The cost of this operation is the length of the substring I choose to shift.

My goal is to find the minimum total cost to make the string sorted using any number of these operations.

First, I need to understand what a cyclic shift does to a substring. Let's take an example. Suppose I have the substring "10". If I perform a cyclic shift, it becomes "01". The cost is 2 because the substring length is 2.

Another example: "110". A cyclic shift would make it "011". Again, cost is 3.

So, essentially, each cyclic shift can rearrange the substring in a specific way, and I need to use these shifts to arrange the entire string in the desired order.

Now, looking at the given program, it seems to try to fix the string by swapping '1's and '0's in certain positions and keeping track of the cost.

Let me try to understand the approach in the code.

The function `func_1` takes the string `sChar`, converts it into a list `s`, and then initializes `left` and `right` pointers and the `cost`.

It seems to be trying to find pairs where `s[left]` is '1' and `s[right]` is '0', and then swapping them and adding the cost, which is the distance between `left` and `right` plus one.

Wait, but in the problem, the operation is a cyclic shift on a substring, not just swapping two characters. So, this seems different.

Let me look closer.

The code has:

```python

if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':

    (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])

    cost += right - left + 1

```

This is swapping `s[left]` and `s[right]` directly, which is not the same as performing a cyclic shift on a substring. A cyclic shift would involve shifting the last character of the substring to the front, not just swapping two characters.

So, this seems incorrect.

Wait, maybe it's trying to mimic the effect of a cyclic shift, but it's not clear.

Let me think about what a cyclic shift does.

Suppose I have a substring "10". A cyclic shift would change it to "01", which is like swapping the two characters. So, in this case, it's similar to swapping '1' and '0'.

But for longer substrings, like "110", a cyclic shift changes it to "011", which is not just a simple swap.

So, the code's approach seems limited to swapping two characters, which is only equivalent to a cyclic shift for substrings of length 2.

But in the problem, I can choose any substring of length >=2 and perform a cyclic shift on it.

I need to find a way to use these operations to sort the string, minimizing the total cost.

Let me think differently.

What is the end goal? To have all '0's before '1's.

So, I need to move all '1's to the end of the string.

Each cyclic shift operation allows me to move the last character of a substring to the front of that substring.

I need to find a sequence of such operations that moves all '1's to the end, with the minimum total cost.

Maybe I can model this as moving each '1' to the end of the string, and calculate the cost for each move.

But I need to consider that operations can overlap and maybe some operations can be combined to move multiple '1's at once.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of inversions. In a sorted array, there should be no '1' before any '0'.

So, the number of inversions would be the number of pairs where a '1' appears before a '0'.

But in this problem, the cost is related to the operations I perform, not directly to the number of inversions.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the number of '1's before each '0', and sum up the costs accordingly.

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case: "10"

To sort it, I need to make it "01".

I can perform a cyclic shift on the entire string, which costs 2, and it's sorted.

So, cost is 2.

In the code, for "10", it would swap s[0] and s[1], costing 2, which matches.

Another test case: "0000"

It's already sorted, so cost is 0.

The code would not swap anything, cost is 0.

Third test case: "11000"

According to the code's logic, it would find the first '1' at position 0 and the first '0' at position 2.

Swap s[0] and s[2]: "11000" -> "01100", cost += 3.

Then, find the next '1' at position 1 and '0' at position 3.

Swap s[1] and s[3]: "01100" -> "00110", cost += 3, total cost 6.

Then, find the next '1' at position 2 and '0' at position 4.

Swap s[2] and s[4]: "00110" -> "00011", cost += 3, total cost 9.

Which matches the sample output.

But is this the minimal cost? Let's see.

Alternatively, I could perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 3.

Then, on [2,4]: "01100" -> "00110", cost 3.

Then, on [3,5]: "00110" -> "00011", cost 3.

Total cost 9.

Is there a way to do it with less cost?

If I perform a cyclic shift on [1,4]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 4.

Then, on [2,5]: "01100" -> "00110", cost 4.

Total cost 8, which is better than 9.

But according to the code, it's 9.

So, maybe the code is not giving the minimal cost.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 9, and according to the explanation, 9 is acceptable, but apparently, 8 is possible.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Let's see: performing a cyclic shift on [1,4]: "11000" -> "01100", cost 4.

Then, on [2,5]: "01100" -> "00110", cost 4.

Then, on [3,5]: "00110" -> "00011", cost 3.

Total cost 4+4+3=11, which is higher than 9.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 8, but actually, it's 11.

So, the initial approach of swapping pairs gives a total cost of 9, which is better than this 11.

So, maybe 9 is better.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought of shifting [1,3], [2,4], [3,5], totaling 3+3+3=9, which matches.

Alternatively, is there a better sequence of operations that can achieve a lower cost?

Let's think differently.

Suppose I consider each '1' that needs to move past '0's to reach its final position.

Each time I move a '1' over a '0', it costs something.

But I need to find a way to minimize the total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of inversions, where a '1' is before a '0', and each inversion costs something.

But I need to find a way to fix all inversions with minimal cost.

Let me think about the positions of '1's and '0's.

Suppose I have a '1' at position i and a '0' at position j, where i < j.

This is an inversion that needs to be fixed.

To fix it, I need to move the '1' after the '0'.

I can do this by performing a cyclic shift on the substring from i to j.

This would move the '1' to position j, and the '0' to position i+1.

But actually, a cyclic shift on substring [i, j] would move the last character to the front.

Wait, for substring s[i..j], cyclic shift would change it to s[j] s[i] s[i+1] ... s[j-1].

So, in this case, s[j] is '0', and s[i] is '1'.

So, after shift, s[i] becomes '0', and s[j] becomes '1'.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's take an example.

Suppose s = "10", positions 0 and 1.

Cyclic shift on [0,1]: move s[1] to the front, so "10" -> "01".

Yes, which is what I want.

Another example: s = "110", positions 0,1,2.

Cyclic shift on [0,2]: "110" -> "011".

So, it seems that performing a cyclic shift on a substring that contains a '1' before a '0' can help move the '1' past the '0'.

But I need to find an efficient way to do this with minimal total cost.

Maybe I can iterate through the string and whenever I find a '1' before a '0', I perform a cyclic shift on the substring from that '1' to the '0', and add the cost.

But I need to make sure that I'm not overlooking any optimizations.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to group shifts together to minimize the total cost.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I find all the positions of '1's in the string.

In the sorted string, all '0's should be before all '1's.

So, in the final string, all '1's should be after the last '0'.

So, I need to move all '1's to positions after the last '0'.

In other words, to the end of the string.

Each cyclic shift operation allows me to move a '1' closer to the end.

I need to find the minimal cost to do this.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as moving each '1' to the end, and sum up the individual costs.

But I need to consider that some operations might allow me to move multiple '1's at once more efficiently.

Wait, let's think about it.

Suppose I have "101010".

To sort it to "000111", I need to move each '1' past the '0's.

If I move one '1' at a time, it might be inefficient.

Alternatively, if I can move multiple '1's together, it might be cheaper.

But in cyclic shift, each shift operation only affects one substring.

I need to find a sequence of operations that minimizes the total cost.

This seems tricky.

Let me look back at the code provided.

The code seems to iterate through the string, find the leftmost '1' and the rightmost '0', swap them, and add the cost.

But as I saw earlier, this might not always give the minimal cost.

In the third test case, it gave a cost of 9, but I thought of a sequence that costs 11, which is worse, so 9 is better.

But maybe there's a better way to get a lower cost.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a different approach altogether.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix the positions of the '0's and move the '1's past them.

Each '1' needs to pass all the '0's that come after it.

Each time a '1' passes a '0', it costs something.

But I need to find a way to calculate the minimal total cost.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the number of inversions, where a '1' is before a '0', and each inversion costs the distance between them.

But I need to find a way to fix all inversions with minimal total cost.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as reversing the substrings in a way that brings all '0's to the front.

But the operation is a cyclic shift, not a reversal.

This is confusing.

Let me look for a different approach.

Suppose I consider the positions of '1's in the string.

In the sorted string, all '1's are at the end.

So, I need to move each '1' from its current position to a position after all the '0's.

The cost for moving a '1' from position i to position j is the cost of the operations needed to move it there.

But since I can perform cyclic shifts on any substrings, it's not straightforward to calculate the exact minimal cost.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of '0's after each '1'.

Each '1' that has '0's after it needs to be moved past those '0's.

The cost for moving a '1' past a '0' can be considered as the distance between them.

But I need to find a way to minimize the total cost.

This seems similar to the problem of sorting with inversions, but I need to adapt it to this specific operation.

Maybe I can calculate for each '1' the number of '0's after it, and sum up the costs accordingly.

Wait, let's try that.

For each '1' in the string, count the number of '0's after it.

Each '1' needs to be moved past each '0' that comes after it.

The cost for moving a '1' past one '0' could be considered as 1 operation of length equal to the distance between them.

But that might not be the most efficient way, because multiple '1's can be moved together in one operation.

So, perhaps I need to group the '1's and move them together to reduce the total cost.

This is getting complicated.

Let me try to find a different way.

Suppose I iterate through the string and keep track of the positions where '1' appears before '0'.

For each such pair, I need to fix it.

But fixing one pair might affect others.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to find the minimal cost.

Define dp[i] as the minimal cost to sort the substring s[i:].

Then, dp[i] = minimal cost to sort s[i:].

But I need to define the transitions properly.

This might be too time-consuming, especially since the constraints are large (sum of string lengths up to 2e5).

I need a linear time solution.

Let me consider the following approach.

Count the number of '1's that need to be moved past '0's.

For each '0' in the string, count the number of '1's before it.

The total cost would be the sum of the positions of '0's minus the number of '0's before them.

Wait, that might not be directly applicable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a string "101010".

To sort it to "000111", I need to move each '1' after all '0's.

Each '1' needs to be moved past all '0's that come after it.

So, for each '1', count the number of '0's after it, and the cost is equal to the position differences.

But I need to find a way to group these moves to minimize the total cost.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look back at the sample inputs and see if I can find a pattern.

First sample: "10" -> "01" with cost 2.

Second sample: "0000" is already sorted, cost 0.

Third sample: "11000" -> "01100" -> "00110" -> "00011", cost 3+3+3=9.

But as I thought earlier, maybe there's a better way.

Wait, another way to look at it is to find the number of swaps needed to sort the string, where each swap can be a cyclic shift of a substring.

But I need to minimize the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

I need to find a way to minimize this sum.

Perhaps the code's approach is acceptable, even if it's not the most optimal, as long as it matches the sample outputs.

But in the third test case, it matches the sample output of 9.

So, maybe 9 is the minimal cost, and my earlier attempt of 11 was incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is correct.

Wait, but I need to verify if the code actually sorts the string correctly and calculates the minimal cost.

Let me try to understand the code's logic.

It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to 1.

It has a loop that runs while `left <= right` and `right < len(s)` and `left < len(s)`.

Inside the loop, if `s[right] == '0'` and `s[left] == '1'`, it swaps `s[left]` and `s[right]` and adds `right - left + 1` to the cost.

Then, it moves `right` forward until it finds a '0', and `left` forward until it finds a '1'.

This seems like it's repeatedly swapping '1's and '0's in a certain order.

It's similar to bubble sort, where you repeatedly swap adjacent elements to sort the array.

In this case, it's swapping '1's with '0's whenever a '1' is found before a '0'.

The cost is the distance between the '1' and the '0' being swapped.

But, in bubble sort, the number of swaps is equal to the number of inversions.

Here, the cost is the sum of the lengths of the substrings shifted.

In this code, each swap corresponds to a cyclic shift of the substring from `left` to `right`, and the cost is `right - left + 1`.

But actually, in the operation defined in the problem, a cyclic shift on a substring can affect multiple characters at once, potentially allowing for more efficient rearrangements.

However, the code is only swapping two characters at a time, which might not be the most efficient way to use the cyclic shift operation.

But in the sample inputs, it seems to match the expected outputs.

So, perhaps this approach, although not perfectly aligned with the problem's operation, still manages to calculate the correct minimal cost.

Alternatively, maybe the cost calculation in the problem is such that this approach coincidentally gives the correct minimal cost.

I need to think of a test case where this code gives an incorrect minimal cost.

Let me try with "1010".

According to the code:

Initial s = ['1', '0', '1', '0']

left=0, right=1: s[0]='1', s[1]='0' -> swap to get ['0','1','1','0'], cost=2.

Now, left=0 (s[0]='0'), right=1 (s[1]='1') -> no swap.

Move right to 2 (s[2]='1'), left to 2 (s[2]='1'), right to 3 (s[3]='0') -> swap s[2] and s[3]: ['0','1','0','1'], cost=2+2=4.

Then, left=2 (s[2]='0'), right=3 (s[3]='1') -> no swap.

No more swaps, so total cost=4.

But is there a way to sort "1010" with a lower cost?

If I perform a cyclic shift on substring [1,3]: "0101", cost=3.

Then, another cyclic shift on [2,4]: "0011", cost=3.

Total cost=6, which is higher than 4.

So, in this case, the code's approach gives a lower cost.

Another test case: "0110".

According to the code:

s=['0','1','1','0']

left=0 (s[0]='0'), right=1 (s[1]='1') -> no swap.

left=0, right=2 (s[2]='1') -> no swap.

left=0, right=3 (s[3]='0') -> swap s[0] and s[3]: ['0','1','1','0'] -> ['0','1','1','0'], cost=4.

Wait, no swap needed because s[0]='0' and s[3]='0'.

Wait, actually, s[0]='0' and s[3]='0', so no swap.

Need to find s[right]='0' and s[left]='1'.

In this case, s[1]='1' and s[3]='0', so swap s[1] and s[3]: ['0','1','1','0'] -> ['0','0','1','1'], cost=4.

Sorted, total cost=4.

Alternatively, perform a cyclic shift on [2,4]: "0110" -> "0101", cost=3.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on [1,3]: "0101" -> "0011", cost=3.

Total cost=6, which is higher than 4.

So, again, the code's approach gives a better cost.

Another test case: "101011".

According to the sample output, the cost should be 5.

But according to the code's approach:

s=['1','0','1','0','1','1']

left=0 (s[0]='1'), right=1 (s[1]='0') -> swap s[0] and s[1]: ['0','1','1','0','1','1'], cost=2.

Now, left=0 (s[0]='0'), right=1 (s[1]='1') -> no swap.

left=0, right=2 (s[2]='1') -> no swap.

left=0, right=3 (s[3]='0') -> swap s[0] and s[3]: ['0','1','1','0','1','1'] -> ['0','0','1','1','1','1'], cost=2+4=6.

Sorted, total cost=6.

But according to the sample output, it should be 5.

So, in this case, the code gives a higher cost than the sample output.

Hmm, that suggests the code is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code does not always give the minimal cost.

In this test case, there exists a sequence of operations with total cost 5, but the code gives 6.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for "101011", the output is 5, but according to the code, it's 6.

So, the code is giving a higher cost than the minimal possible.

Hence, it's incorrect.

I need to find a correct approach.

Let me think again.

Perhaps, instead of swapping individual '1's and '0's, I can perform cyclic shifts on substrings that contain multiple '1's and '0's to move them in one operation.

In the test case "101011", maybe there's a way to perform a single cyclic shift on a larger substring to move multiple '1's at once.

For example, consider substring [1,4]: "0101" -> "1010", cost=4.

Then, substring [2,5]: "0101" -> "1010", cost=4.

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that each cyclic shift can be used to move a '1' past a '0'.

In one operation, I can choose a substring that contains a '1' and a '0', perform a cyclic shift, and effectively move the '1' past the '0'.

The cost is the length of the substring.

I need to find a way to minimize the total cost of such operations.

Perhaps, for each '1' that needs to be moved past a '0', I can find the minimal cost to move it past that '0'.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the positions of '1's and '0's.

Suppose I have the string "101011".

Positions:

0:1, 1:0, 2:1, 3:0, 4:1, 5:1

In the sorted string, all '0's should be before all '1's.

So, I need to move the '1's at positions 0 and 2 past the '0's at positions 1 and 3.

The '1' at position 0 needs to be moved past the '0's at positions 1 and 3.

The '1' at position 2 needs to be moved past the '0' at position 3.

So, total inversions: 3.

If I can fix each inversion with a single operation, the cost would be the length of the substring from the '1' to the '0'.

So, for position 0 to position 1: cost 2.

Position 0 to position 3: cost 4.

Position 2 to position 3: cost 2.

Total cost: 2+4+2=8.

But the sample output is 5, which is less than 8.

So, there must be a way to fix multiple inversions in one operation.

Perhaps performing a cyclic shift on a larger substring can fix multiple inversions at once.

For example, performing a cyclic shift on substring [0,3]: "1010" -> "0101", cost=4.

Now, the string is "010111".

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [2,3]: "010111" -> "011011", cost=2.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [3,4]: "011011" -> "011101", cost=2.

Finally, perform a cyclic shift on substring [4,5]: "011101" -> "011110", cost=2.

Total cost: 4+2+2+2=10, which is higher than the sample output of 5.

Not helpful.

Wait, maybe there's a better sequence.

Let's try performing a cyclic shift on substring [1,4]: "1010" -> "0101", cost=4.

Now, string is "010111".

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [2,3]: "010111" -> "011011", cost=2.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [3,4]: "011011" -> "011101", cost=2.

Finally, perform a cyclic shift on substring [4,5]: "011101" -> "011110", cost=2.

Total cost: 4+2+2+2=10.

Still higher than 5.

Wait, maybe I can perform larger shifts.

Let's try performing a cyclic shift on substring [0,4]: "10101" -> "11010", cost=5.

Now, string is "110101".

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [0,5]: "110101" -> "111010", cost=6.

Then, perform a cyclic shift on substring [3,4]: "111010" -> "111100", cost=2.

Total cost: 5+6+2=13.

Higher than before.

Not helpful.

I need a better approach.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I want to move all '1's to the end.

Each '1' needs to be moved past all '0's that come after it.

So, for each '1', count the number of '0's after it, and the cost is the distance to each '0'.

But summing up all these distances might not give the minimal total cost because operations can be combined.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of '0's after each '1', and sum up the minimal costs to move each '1' past its '0's.

Let me try to calculate it.

In "101011":

- '1' at position 0: '0's at positions 1 and 3 -> need to move past 2 '0's.

- '1' at position 2: '0' at position 3 -> need to move past 1 '0'.

- '1' at position 4: no '0's after it.

- '1' at position 5: no '0's after it.

Total inversions: 3.

So, total cost should be the sum of the distances for each inversion.

But in the sample output, it's 5, which is less than 2+4+2=8 (as calculated earlier).

So, there must be a way to optimize the operations.

Perhaps performing operations on larger substrings can fix multiple inversions at once with a lower average cost.

But I need a systematic way to calculate this.

This is getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, I'll assume the code is incorrect since it gives a higher cost than the sample output for one of the test cases.

Therefore, the answer is:

**False**
