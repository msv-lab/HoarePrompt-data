Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cows with unique ratings, each in their initial positions from 1 to n. They have a tournament where cows fight in a specific sequence, and the one with the higher rating always wins and proceeds to the next match. I own cow k, and I want to maximize the number of wins this cow gets. I have the option to swap my cow with another cow once or choose not to swap at all.

First, I need to understand the tournament structure. The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2. The winner of that matches against cow 3, and this continues until all cows have competed. So, it's like a single-elimination tournament where the winner of each match advances to the next round.

My goal is to position my cow in such a way that it wins as many matches as possible before losing. Since the cow with the higher rating always wins, I need to ensure that my cow has higher ratings compared to the cows it will face in the sequence of matches.

Let me think about the sequence of matches. In the initial setup, the matches proceed as follows:

- Match 1: Cow 1 vs Cow 2

- Match 2: Winner of Match 1 vs Cow 3

- Match 3: Winner of Match 2 vs Cow 4

- ...

- Match n-1: Winner of Match n-2 vs Cow n

I need to see how changing the position of my cow affects the number of wins it can achieve. I can choose to swap my cow with any other cow or keep it in its original position.

Let's consider the original position of my cow, which is position k. If I don't swap, the number of wins my cow can achieve depends on how many cows before it (in positions 1 to k-1) have lower ratings than my cow. Because, in the sequence of matches, my cow will be fighting against the winner of all the previous matches.

Wait, actually, it's a bit more complicated than that. Let's think step by step.

Suppose I don't swap my cow. Then, the tournament proceeds as per the initial positions. I need to simulate the tournament to see how many wins my cow gets.

But simulating the entire tournament for each test case might be inefficient, especially since n can be up to 10^5 and t can be up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 10^5. So, I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of wins for my cow, considering whether to swap or not.

Let me consider the key insight: the cow with the highest rating can potentially win all matches if placed in the right position. But since ratings are unique, there is only one cow with the highest rating, one with the second highest, and so on.

If my cow has the highest rating, then no matter where I place it, it can win all matches until it faces a cow with a higher rating, but since it has the highest, it won't lose unless it's forced to fight itself, which is impossible. So, it can theoretically win all n-1 matches.

But wait, in the problem, all ratings are distinct, so if my cow has the highest rating, it should be able to win all matches unless its path is blocked by a higher-rated cow, which can't happen since it's the highest.

However, in practice, due to the tournament structure, the path my cow takes depends on where it's positioned and who it faces in the sequence.

I need to find a way to maximize the number of wins for my cow by choosing the best position through swapping.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Identify the position where, if my cow is placed there, it can win the maximum number of matches.

2. Compare this with the number of wins if I don't swap (i.e., keep my cow in position k).

3. Choose the option that gives the maximum number of wins.

But even this seems too vague. I need a more concrete plan.

Let's think about how the tournament progresses. It's like a single-elimination tournament where each match is between the current winner and the next cow in line.

If I can determine the sequence of cows my cow would fight against based on its position, I can calculate how many it can defeat before losing.

Let me consider that if I place my cow in position p, then it will first fight against the winner of the previous matches (which is the winner of position 1 to p-1).

So, to maximize the number of wins, I need to position my cow such that it faces the weakest possible opponents until it reaches a point where it has to face a cow stronger than itself.

Wait, but in this tournament structure, it's not straightforward because the opponent is the winner of the previous matches.

This seems tricky. Maybe I should look for a pattern or a mathematical formula that can help me calculate the maximum number of wins without simulating the entire tournament.

Let me consider that in order for my cow to win m matches, it needs to defeat m cows that are stronger than it in some order.

Wait, no. Since the winner is always the one with the higher rating, my cow can keep winning as long as it has a higher rating than the cow it's facing.

But in this tournament structure, the cow it's facing in each match is the next cow in line, and the previous winner.

Wait, actually, in this specific tournament structure, it's more like a "cumulative" winner. The first match is between cow 1 and cow 2, and the winner faces cow 3, and so on.

So, effectively, the tournament is determining the cow with the highest rating among the first p cows, where p is the current match number.

Wait, maybe I can think of it as, after m matches, the winner is the cow with the highest rating among the first m+1 cows.

Because in each match, the winner is the one with the higher rating, so cumulatively, the winner after m matches is the highest-rated among the first m+1 cows.

Is that correct?

Let's see with an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 6, k = 1

a = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]

So, cow k=1 has rating 12.

Match 1: cow 1 (12) vs cow 2 (10). Cow 1 wins.

Match 2: cow 1 (12) vs cow 3 (14). Cow 3 wins.

Match 3: cow 3 (14) vs cow 4 (11). Cow 3 wins.

Match 4: cow 3 (14) vs cow 5 (8). Cow 3 wins.

Match 5: cow 3 (14) vs cow 6 (3). Cow 3 wins.

So, cow 1 wins only once.

In the second test case:

n = 6, k = 5

a = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]

Cow k=5 has rating 12.

If I don't swap, the matches are:

Match 1: cow 1 (7) vs cow 2 (2). Cow 1 wins.

Match 2: cow 1 (7) vs cow 3 (727). Cow 3 wins.

Match 3: cow 3 (727) vs cow 4 (10). Cow 3 wins.

Match 4: cow 3 (727) vs cow 5 (12). Cow 3 wins.

Match 5: cow 3 (727) vs cow 6 (13). Cow 3 wins.

So, cow 5 wins only once.

But in the explanation, it says that by swapping cow 5 with cow 3, cow 5 can win twice.

Wait, let's see that.

If I swap cow 5 (12) with cow 3 (727), then the list becomes:

[7, 2, 12, 10, 727, 13]

Match 1: cow 1 (7) vs cow 2 (2). Cow 1 wins.

Match 2: cow 1 (7) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 3 wins.

Match 3: cow 3 (12) vs cow 4 (10). Cow 3 wins.

Match 4: cow 3 (12) vs cow 5 (727). Cow 5 wins.

Match 5: cow 5 (727) vs cow 6 (13). Cow 5 wins.

So, cow 5 wins twice.

Wait, but cow 5 was originally in position 5, and after swapping with cow 3, it's in position 3.

Wait, no. In the explanation, it says to swap cow 5 to position 3, meaning swap cow 5 with cow 3.

So, the list becomes:

Position 1: 7

Position 2: 2

Position 3: 12

Position 4: 10

Position 5: 727

Position 6: 13

Then, the matches are:

Match 1: cow 1 (7) vs cow 2 (2). Cow 1 wins.

Match 2: cow 1 (7) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 3 wins.

Match 3: cow 3 (12) vs cow 4 (10). Cow 3 wins.

Match 4: cow 3 (12) vs cow 5 (727). Cow 5 wins.

Match 5: cow 5 (727) vs cow 6 (13). Cow 5 wins.

So, cow 5 wins twice.

Okay, that makes sense.

So, in this case, by swapping cow 5 with cow 3, we positioned cow 5 earlier in the sequence, allowing it to win more matches before facing a stronger opponent.

Wait, but in this case, cow 5 still had to face cow 3 (now with rating 12) before facing cow 5's original position's cow (727).

Wait, no. After swapping, cow 5 is in position 3, with rating 12.

Then, in the matches:

- Match 1: cow 1 (7) vs cow 2 (2). Cow 1 wins.

- Match 2: cow 1 (7) vs cow 3 (12). Cow 3 wins.

- Match 3: cow 3 (12) vs cow 4 (10). Cow 3 wins.

- Match 4: cow 3 (12) vs cow 5 (727). Cow 5 wins.

- Match 5: cow 5 (727) vs cow 6 (13). Cow 5 wins.

So, cow 5 wins twice.

If we hadn't swapped, cow 5 would have only won once.

Hence, swapping can increase the number of wins for cow 5.

Now, I need a general strategy to maximize the number of wins for cow k, possibly by swapping it with another cow.

Let me try to find a pattern or formula.

First, consider not swapping. In this case, the number of wins for cow k is equal to the number of cows before it (positions 1 to k-1) that have lower ratings than cow k.

Wait, is that correct?

In the first test case:

n=6, k=1, a=[12,10,14,11,8,3]

Cow k=1 has rating 12.

There are no cows before it, so it should win all matches until it loses to cow 3 (rating 14). So, it wins once.

But according to the above statement, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows before it with lower ratings, which is 0, but in reality, it wins once.

So, that's not accurate.

Wait, perhaps I need to rethink this.

Let me consider that in the tournament, the winner of each match is the one with the higher rating, and this winner proceeds to the next match.

So, if I have cow k with rating x, and I place it in position p, then it will first face the winner of positions 1 to p-1.

If x is higher than the winner of positions 1 to p-1, it wins the first match.

Then, it faces cow p+1, and so on, winning as long as its rating is higher than the next cow's rating.

Wait, no. Because in each match, it faces the next cow in line, but the opponent is actually the cow in position p+1, and the winner proceeds.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define that the winner of match i is the one with the higher rating between the winner of match i-1 and cow p+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at it differently.

Let me consider that the tournament is effectively finding the maximum rating among the first p cows.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum rating up to each position.

Let me define for each position p, the winner after p-1 matches is the cow with the maximum rating among the first p cows.

Wait, let's see.

For position p, the winner up to position p is the cow with the highest rating among positions 1 to p.

Then, in the match between the winner up to position p and cow p+1, the one with the higher rating wins.

So, the winner up to position p+1 is the maximum of the winner up to position p and cow p+1.

Hence, the winner up to position p is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p.

So, in the tournament, the winner after all matches is the cow with the highest rating.

Now, for my cow k with rating x, placed at position p, I need to see how many matches it can win.

If I place my cow at position p, then it will first face the winner of the first p-1 matches, which is the maximum rating among positions 1 to p-1.

If x is higher than that, it wins the first match.

Then, it faces cow p+1, and so on, winning as long as its rating is higher than the next cow's rating.

Wait, no. Because in each match, it faces the next cow in line, which is cow p+1, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after winning the first match against the winner of positions 1 to p-1, it then faces cow p+1, and so on.

But it's getting confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix the position p where I place my cow.

Then, the number of wins my cow can achieve is equal to the number of cows after position p (including p) that have lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider that in the sequence of matches, my cow will keep winning as long as it has a higher rating than the next cow it faces.

So, if I place my cow at position p, it will face the winner of positions 1 to p-1 in the first match.

If it wins, then it faces cow p+1, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows after position p that have lower ratings than my cow, until it faces a cow with a higher rating.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the number of cows after p with lower ratings than my cow, but considering the order.

This seems similar to calculating the length of the increasing subsequence starting from position p, where the subsequence consists of cows with ratings less than x, and x is greater than all of them.

Wait, maybe I need to find the longest sequence of cows after position p that have ratings less than x, until I encounter a cow with a higher rating.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of consecutive cows after p (including p) that have ratings less than x, until I encounter a cow with a rating higher than x.

Wait, but it's not exactly consecutive, because in each match, it's fighting the next cow in line.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of how many cows it can defeat in a row before losing.

Yes, that seems right.

So, if I place my cow at position p, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from position p to n that have ratings less than x, until it faces a cow with a rating higher than x.

So, it's like counting the number of cows after p (including p) with ratings less than x, until the first cow with a rating higher than x.

Then, the maximum number of wins is the maximum over all possible p (including the original position k) of this count.

And since I can swap my cow with at most one other cow, I need to choose p such that my cow is placed there, possibly swapping with the cow that is originally at position p.

Wait, but I can only swap my cow with one other cow, meaning I can choose to place my cow at position p, but I have to swap it with the cow at position p.

So, effectively, I can choose to place my cow at any position p, but I can only do this once, meaning I can choose one position to place my cow, and keep all other cows in their original positions.

Wait, no. More precisely, I can choose to swap my cow with another cow once, meaning I choose one cow to swap with my cow, and the rest remain in their positions.

So, in terms of choosing the position p for my cow, p can be any position from 1 to n, and the cow originally at position p will be swapped with my cow.

Hence, I can choose to place my cow at any position p, and the rest of the cows adjust accordingly.

Therefore, I need to consider all possible positions p from 1 to n, place my cow at position p, and compute the number of wins it can achieve, then take the maximum over all p.

Additionally, I should also consider the option of not swapping, meaning keeping my cow at position k.

So, the maximum number of wins is the maximum over all possible positions p (including k) of the number of wins when my cow is placed at position p.

Now, I need an efficient way to compute this for all p, given the constraints on time and memory.

Given that the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution per test case.

Let me try to find a way to compute the number of wins for my cow when placed at position p.

Given that, when placed at position p, my cow will first face the winner of the first p-1 cows.

Since the winner of the first p-1 cows is the one with the highest rating among the first p-1 cows, my cow can defeat this winner only if its rating is higher than the highest rating among the first p-1 cows.

If it wins, it then faces cow p+1, and so on, winning each match as long as its rating is higher than the next cow's rating.

Wait, no. Because in each match, it faces the next cow in line, which is cow p+1, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I need to think recursively.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define that when my cow is at position p, the number of wins w(p) is:

- 0, if p > n (no more cows to fight)

- 1 + w(p+1), if x > max(a[1..p-1]) and x > a[p+1]

- 1, if x > max(a[1..p-1]) and x <= a[p+1]

- 0, if x <= max(a[1..p-1])

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think again.

If x > max(a[1..p-1]), then my cow wins the first match.

Then, it faces cow p+1.

If x > a[p+1], it wins again, and proceeds to face cow p+2, and so on.

So, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from p+1 to n that have ratings less than x, plus one for defeating the winner of the first p-1 cows, but only if x > max(a[1..p-1]).

Hence, w(p) = 0, if x <= max(a[1..p-1])

Otherwise, w(p) = 1 + count of cows from p+1 to n with ratings less than x, until it faces a cow with rating higher than x.

Wait, more precisely, w(p) = 0, if x <= max(a[1..p-1])

Else, w(p) = 1 + w(p+1), where w(p+1) is the number of wins in the subsequent matches.

But this recursive definition is inefficient for large n.

I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute the maximum rating for each prefix of the array.

Let me define prefix_max[p] = max(a[1..p-1]), for p from 1 to n+1.

Note that prefix_max[1] = 0, since there are no cows before position 1.

Then, for each position p, if x > prefix_max[p], my cow can win at least one match (defeating the winner of the first p-1 cows).

Then, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from p to n that have ratings less than x, until it faces a cow with rating higher than x.

Wait, more precisely, it's the length of the largest suffix starting from p where all cows have ratings less than x, plus one for defeating the winner of the first p-1 cows.

But that's not entirely accurate.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the first cow after position p that has a rating higher than x.

Then, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from p to that position minus one.

Wait, let's formalize this.

For each position p, if x > prefix_max[p], then my cow can win against the winner of the first p-1 cows.

Then, it can continue winning against the cows from p+1 to some position q, where q is the smallest position greater than p such that a[q] > x.

Then, the number of wins is q - p.

Wait, more precisely, it's q - p, where q is the smallest position greater than p such that a[q] >= x.

Wait, no. Since my cow has rating x, and it can defeat any cow with rating less than x.

So, it can keep winning against all cows with rating less than x, until it faces a cow with rating greater than or equal to x.

Hence, the number of wins is equal to the number of cows from p to q-1, where q is the smallest position greater than p such that a[q] >= x.

Plus one for defeating the winner of the first p-1 cows.

Wait, but only if x > prefix_max[p].

Hence, w(p) = 0, if x <= prefix_max[p]

Else, w(p) = 1 + (q - p - 1), where q is the smallest position > p such that a[q] >= x.

Wait, but in reality, it's not q - p -1, because q is the first position where a[q] >= x, so the number of cows from p to q-1 that have a[q-1] < x.

Wait, perhaps it's q - p, because from p to q-1, all cows have a[i] < x, and there are q - p cows.

Then, w(p) = 1 + (q - p - 1), which simplifies to q - p.

But actually, it's better to think of it as w(p) = (q - p), where q is the smallest position > p such that a[q] >= x.

Wait, but then, if q > p, and a[q] >= x, then w(p) = q - p.

Because my cow defeats the winner of the first p-1 cows (1 win), and then defeats q - p -1 cows with a[i] < x, for a total of 1 + (q - p -1) = q - p wins.

Yes, that makes sense.

Hence, w(p) = 0, if x <= prefix_max[p]

Else, w(p) = q - p, where q is the smallest position > p such that a[q] >= x.

If no such q exists, then q = n+1, and w(p) = n+1 - p.

So, to compute w(p) for each p, I need:

- prefix_max[p] = max(a[1..p-1])

- q(p) = smallest q > p such that a[q] >= x, or q = n+1 if no such q exists.

Then, w(p) = 0, if x <= prefix_max[p]

Else, w(p) = q - p.

And the maximum over all p of w(p).

Now, I need to compute this efficiently.

First, compute prefix_max[p] for all p from 1 to n+1.

This can be done in O(n).

Then, for each p from 1 to n, compute q(p), the smallest q > p such that a[q] >= x.

This can be done using a monotonic stack or by preprocessing the next greater element for each position.

Given that n can be up to 10^5, I need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.

Let me consider preprocessing the next greater element for each position.

Define next_greater[p] = the smallest q > p such that a[q] >= a[p].

But in this case, I need next_greater[p] where a[q] >= x, and x is the rating of my cow.

So, for a fixed x, I can preprocess the next greater or equal to x for each position.

This can be done using a stack in O(n) time.

Hence, I can preprocess next_greater[p] for each p, where next_greater[p] is the smallest q > p such that a[q] >= x.

Then, for each p, w(p) = 0, if x <= prefix_max[p]

Else, w(p) = next_greater[p] - p.

Then, the maximum over all p of w(p).

This seems efficient.

Now, I need to implement this logic.

But there is a catch.

In the problem, all a_i are distinct, so "next greater or equal" is the same as "next greater".

Also, x is the rating of my cow, which is a[k].

Wait, but in the swapping scenario, if I swap my cow with another cow, then x becomes the rating of the cow I choose to place at position p.

Wait, no.

Actually, I can choose to place my cow at any position p by swapping it with the cow at position p.

So, in terms of choosing p, I'm effectively choosing to place my cow at p, and x remains the same (the rating of my original cow k).

Wait, no.

If I swap my cow with the cow at position p, then my cow is now at position p, with its original rating x.

The cow that was originally at position p is now at position k.

But in terms of computing w(p), I need to consider that my cow is at position p with rating x, and the rest of the cows are in their positions accordingly.

But for simplicity, I can think that for each p, I place my cow at p with rating x, and the rest of the cows remain in their positions.

Wait, but actually, when I swap my cow with the cow at position p, my cow goes to position p, and the cow at position p goes to position k.

So, the array becomes:

a' = a, but a'[p] = a[k], a'[k] = a[p]

Then, for each p, I need to compute w(p), where w(p) is the number of wins for my cow at position p.

But to compute w(p), I need to consider that a'[p] = a[k] = x, and a'[k] = a[p].

Then, the prefix_max[p] needs to be computed based on the new array a'.

This seems complicated because prefix_max[p] depends on the value at position p, which changes when I swap.

Hence, I need to find a way to compute prefix_max[p] for the new array a' for each p.

This seems inefficient, as it would require O(n^2) time, which is too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Perhaps I can precompute the prefix_max for the original array, and then adjust it for each p based on the swap.

Let me see.

Define prefix_max[p] = max(a[1], a[2], ..., a[p-1])

Then, if I swap a[k] with a[p], the new array a' has a'[p] = a[k], a'[k] = a[p]

Then, for p < k:

prefix_max'[p] = prefix_max[p], if p < p

max(prefix_max[p-1], a'[p]), if p >= p

Wait, this is getting messy.

Maybe I need to consider two cases:

1. p < k

2. p >= k

But it's still complicated.

Let me consider that I can compute prefix_max for the original array, and then adjust it for each p based on the swap.

Specifically, for each p, prefix_max'[p] = max(prefix_max[p], a[k] if p > k else a[p])

Wait, perhaps not.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that I can choose to place my cow at any position p, and I need to compute w(p), the number of wins for my cow at position p.

Then, the maximum over all p of w(p) is the answer.

To compute w(p), I need:

- If x > prefix_max[p], then my cow can win against the winner of the first p-1 cows.

- Then, it can win against all cows from p+1 to q-1, where q is the smallest position > p such that a[q] >= x.

- Hence, w(p) = (q - p)

- Else, w(p) = 0

So, for each p, w(p) = q - p, where q is the smallest position > p such that a[q] >= x, but only if x > prefix_max[p].

Otherwise, w(p) = 0.

Hence, to compute w(p), I need to know q(p), the smallest q > p such that a[q] >= x.

This can be precomputed using a monotonic stack.

Then, I need to compute prefix_max[p] for each p.

Given that, for each p, w(p) = q(p) - p, if x > prefix_max[p], else 0.

Then, the maximum over all p of w(p) is the answer.

But in this approach, I need to compute prefix_max[p] for the original array, but since I'm swapping a[k] with a[p], the array changes.

Wait, that's the issue.

So, in reality, when I swap a[k] with a[p], the prefix_max[p] needs to be recomputed based on the new array.

This seems tricky.

Let me see if there's another way.

Perhaps I can consider that, for p < k, prefix_max[p] remains the same as original prefix_max[p], because a[p] hasn't changed.

For p >= k, prefix_max[p] = max(original prefix_max[p], a[k])

Wait, no.

Actually, when I swap a[k] and a[p], for p < k, prefix_max[p] is the same as original prefix_max[p], because a[p] is now a[k], but prefix_max[p] is max(a[1], ..., a[p-1]).

Wait, no.

Wait, prefix_max[p] in the new array a' is max(a'[1], a'[2], ..., a'[p-1]).

If p < k, a'[p] = a[k], and a'[k] = a[p].

But for p < k, a'[p] = a[k], and a'[k] = a[p], but since p < k, p-1 < k, so a'[p-1] = a[p-1], and so on.

Hence, prefix_max'[p] = max(a[1], a[2], ..., a[p-1]).

Wait, but a'[p] = a[k], but p-1 < k, so a'[p-1] = a[p-1].

Wait, no, prefix_max'[p] = max(a'[1], a'[2], ..., a'[p-1]).

But a'[p] is at position p, which is not included in prefix_max'[p].

Wait, p-1 < k, so a'[p-1] = a[p-1], because p-1 != k.

Hence, prefix_max'[p] = max(a[1], a[2], ..., a[p-1]).

So, prefix_max'[p] = original prefix_max[p], for p < k.

Similarly, for p >= k, a'[k] = a[p], but since p >= k, p-1 >= k-1, and a'[p-1] = a[p-1], unless p-1 = k, in which a'[p-1] = a[p].

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that computing prefix_max'[p] for each p requires considering the swap, which is too time-consuming.

Let me consider another approach.

Perhaps I can consider that, regardless of the swap, the number of wins for my cow is determined by its position and the ratings around it.

I need to maximize the number of cows with lower ratings that my cow can defeat before facing a stronger cow.

So, maybe I can find the position p where the number of consecutive cows with lower ratings after p is maximized, provided that my cow's rating is higher than the maximum rating before p.

This sounds similar to finding the longest sequence where a[p] < x and a[p+1] < x, and so on, until a[q] >= x, and x > max(a[1..p-1]).

To maximize this sequence, I need to choose p such that:

- p is as small as possible, to minimize max(a[1..p-1])

- The sequence of cows after p with a[i] < x is as long as possible.

But choosing p too small may mean that max(a[1..p-1]) is high, which could disqualify x from even winning the first match.

Hence, I need to balance choosing p small enough so that x > max(a[1..p-1]), but also having a long sequence of cows after p with a[i] < x.

This seems tricky to optimize directly.

Let me think about the extreme cases.

Case 1: x is the highest rating among all cows.

Then, no matter where I place my cow, it can win all matches until the last one, achieving n-1 wins.

Wait, no. If I place it at position 1, it will win all matches, because it's the highest.

Wait, actually, if x is the highest, placing it at position 1, it will win all matches, as it's higher than all other cows.

Hence, w(1) = n - 1.

Similarly, placing it at any other position p, it will still win all matches, because it's the highest.

Wait, no. If I place it at position p, it has to defeat the winner of the first p-1 cows.

If x is the highest, then x > max(a[1..p-1]), for any p.

Then, it can win against all cows after p, until the end.

Hence, w(p) = n - p, for all p.

Hence, the maximum is w(1) = n - 1.

So, if x is the highest, placing it at position 1 gives the maximum wins.

Case 2: x is not the highest.

Then, there exists at least one cow with a higher rating than x.

I need to position my cow such that it avoids facing a higher-rated cow as early as possible.

Hence, I should place it before the first higher-rated cow.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me consider that.

Let me find the position of the first cow with rating higher than x.

Let's call this position q.

Then, if I place my cow at p < q, and ensure that x > max(a[1..p-1]), then it can win p-1 matches plus the matches against cows from p+1 to q-1.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me formalize this.

Let q be the smallest position where a[q] > x.

If no such q exists, then q = n+1.

Then, for p < q, if x > max(a[1..p-1]), then w(p) = q - p.

Hence, to maximize w(p), I need to maximize q - p, under the condition that p < q and x > max(a[1..p-1]).

Hence, I need to choose p as small as possible, but ensuring that x > max(a[1..p-1]).

Hence, find the smallest p such that max(a[1..p-1]) < x, and p < q.

Wait, actually, to maximize q - p, I need to choose p as small as possible, but ensuring that x > max(a[1..p-1]).

Hence, find the smallest p such that max(a[1..p-1]) < x.

Then, w(p) = q - p.

Hence, the maximum w(p) is q - p, where p is the smallest position where max(a[1..p-1]) < x.

Alternatively, if I can find the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x, and q is the smallest position > p where a[q] >= x, then w(p) = q - p.

But to maximize q - p, I need to minimize p, given that p is the smallest possible where max(a[1..p-1]) < x.

Hence, find p_min, the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x.

Then, q = smallest position > p_min where a[q] >= x.

Then, w(p_min) = q - p_min.

This would be the maximum possible w(p).

Wait, but what if there are multiple p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x? I need to choose the smallest such p.

Yes, that makes sense.

Hence, the algorithm is:

1. Find p_min, the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x.

2. Find q, the smallest position > p_min where a[q] >= x.

3. Then, the maximum w(p) is q - p_min.

Additionally, consider the case where p = k, i.e., not swapping.

Compute w(k), and take the maximum of w(p_min) and w(k).

Wait, no. Since I can choose to swap with any cow, including keeping it in its original position, I need to consider all p, including p = k.

Hence, the maximum w(p) over all p, including p = k.

But with the above approach, I can find the maximum w(p) by choosing p_min as defined.

But perhaps there are cases where choosing a different p gives a better w(p).

Let me consider an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 6, k = 1, a = [12,10,14,11,8,3]

x = a[0] = 12

Find p_min, the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x.

For p = 1, max(a[1..0]) = 0 < 12, so p_min = 1.

Find q, the smallest position > 1 where a[q] >= 12.

a[2] = 14 >= 12, so q = 2.

Hence, w(p_min) = q - p_min = 2 - 1 = 1.

Which matches the sample output.

Now, consider the second test case:

n = 6, k = 5, a = [7,2,727,10,12,13]

x = a[4] = 12

Find p_min, the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < 12.

Check p = 1: max(a[1..0]) = 0 < 12, so p_min = 1.

Find q, the smallest position > 1 where a[q] >= 12.

a[2] = 727 >= 12, q = 2.

Hence, w(p_min) = 2 - 1 = 1.

But in the sample explanation, by swapping cow 5 to position 3, w(p) = 3 - 3 = 0, which is less than 2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, in the sample explanation, by swapping cow 5 to position 3, the array becomes [7,2,12,10,727,13].

Then, p = 3, x = 12.

max(a[1..2]) = max(7,2) = 7 < 12, so p_min could be 3.

Then, q = smallest position > 3 where a[q] >= 12.

a[4] = 10 < 12

a[5] = 727 >= 12, q = 5.

Hence, w(p=3) = 5 - 3 = 2.

Which matches the sample.

But according to my earlier algorithm, p_min = 1, w(p_min) = 1, but in reality, choosing p = 3 gives w(p=3) = 2, which is better.

Hence, my earlier approach is incomplete.

Hence, I need to adjust my algorithm to consider that p_min might not always be the best choice.

I need to find the p that maximizes q - p, under the condition that x > max(a[1..p-1]).

Hence, I need to choose the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x, and q - p is maximized.

Wait, but in the second test case, p = 3 gives q - p = 2, which is better than p = 1 giving q - p = 1.

Hence, I need to consider other p's, not just p_min.

Hence, perhaps I need to consider all p where x > max(a[1..p-1]), and find the one with the maximum q - p.

But this would require iterating over all p where x > max(a[1..p-1]), and finding the maximum q - p.

This seems inefficient for large n.

Is there a smarter way?

Let me consider that the best p is the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x, and there exists a q > p where a[q] >= x.

But in the second test case, p = 1 satisfies max(a[1..0]) = 0 < 12, and q = 2, giving w(p=1) = 1.

But p = 3 gives max(a[1..2]) = 7 < 12, and q = 5, giving w(p=3) = 2.

Hence, p = 3 is better.

So, simply choosing the smallest p where max(a[1..p-1]) < x doesn't always give the maximum w(p).

Hence, I need a better strategy
