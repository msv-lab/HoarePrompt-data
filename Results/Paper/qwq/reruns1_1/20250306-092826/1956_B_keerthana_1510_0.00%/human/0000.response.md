Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there's this card game with 2n cards, and each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Me and Nene each get n cards. Then, we take turns playing cards, one by one, alternating between me and Nene, for a total of 2n turns. The rule is that if the card I play has a number that's already on the table, I get a point.

Nene is really smart and always plays optimally to maximize her points, and if there's a tie in that, she tries to minimize my points. So, I need to figure out, given my cards, what's the maximum number of points I can get if I play optimally.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics better. Let's think about how the turns work.

Each turn, a player chooses one of their cards and plays it on the table. If the number on that card is already on the table, they get a point. So, the key is to play cards in such a way that maximizes the number of times you play a duplicate number that's already on the table.

But there's a catch: Nene is playing optimally against me, trying to maximize her points and minimize mine. So, I need to anticipate her moves and plan accordingly.

Let's consider the distribution of cards. There are 2n cards, with each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice. Me and Nene each have n cards, so we each have some subset of these numbers.

Some numbers might appear only once in my hand, while others might appear twice. Since each number appears exactly twice in total, if I have two cards with the same number, that means Nene doesn't have any of that number. Conversely, if I have only one card of a certain number, Nene must have the other one.

This seems important. If I have two cards with the same number, Nene doesn't have any of that number, so I can control when to play those cards to maximize my points.

Let's think about an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, total cards: 1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4

Since I have 1,1,2,3, Nene must have 2,3,4,4.

Now, let's see how the game can play out.

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1 and get a point (since 1 is already on the table)

4. Nene plays 4 and gets a point (since 4 is already on the table)

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 3 and gets a point (since 3 is already on the table)

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 2 and gets a point (since 2 is already on the table)

In this case, I get 1 point.

Is there a better way for me to play to get more points?

Let's try another sequence:

1. I play 2

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1

4. Nene plays 4 and gets a point

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 3

7. I play 3 and get a point

8. Nene plays 2 and gets a point

Wait, in this sequence, I get 2 points. But according to the example, it's only 1 point. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize mine. So, in the first sequence, she might choose to play 4 first to minimize my potential points.

Let me think differently. Maybe the order of play affects the outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better strategy involving the frequency of the numbers.

Let me think about the general approach.

I need to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

Given that Nene is playing optimally against me, I need to consider her moves as well.

Perhaps I should focus on the numbers that appear multiple times and try to play them in a way that increases my chances of getting points.

Wait, let's think in terms of graph theory or something similar.

Actually, maybe it's better to think in terms of sets.

Let me consider the frequency of each number in my hand.

Define freq[x] as the number of times x appears in my hand.

Since each number appears exactly twice in total, Nene's freq[x] would be 2 - freq[x] for each x.

So, for each x, Nene has 2 - freq[x] cards of that number.

Now, I need to decide the order in which to play my cards to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

But Nene is also trying to maximize her points and minimize mine.

This seems complex. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me consider the numbers that appear twice in my hand. For those, Nene doesn't have any of them, so I can control when to play them.

For numbers that appear only once in my hand, Nene has the other one.

So, for numbers that I have two of, I can choose to play them together to maximize my points, but I need to consider Nene's moves in between.

Wait, perhaps I should group the numbers into those that I have two of and those that I have only one of.

Let me define:

- My pairs: numbers that I have two of.

- My singles: numbers that I have only one of.

Similarly, Nene's pairs would be the numbers where she has two of them, which are the numbers where I have zero of them, but since I have n cards and n is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient way.

Wait, no, n per test case is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, but sum of n over all test cases is up to 2*10^5, so it's fine.

So, for each test case, n <= 2*10^5, and t <= 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases <= 2*10^5.

So, per test case, n can be up to 2*10^5, but across all test cases, the total n is up to 2*10^5, so it's manageable.

Back to the problem.

Let me consider that I have some numbers in pairs and some in singles.

For the pairs that I have, I can choose to play them together, ensuring that I get a point when I play the second one.

But Nene might interfere by playing her cards in between.

Wait, but since we alternate turns, and I go first, I can plan the sequence accordingly.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to count the number of points I can get based on the number of pairs I have and the number of singles.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have.

For each pair that I have, I can potentially get one point by playing the second card when the first one is already on the table.

But Nene might play her cards in such a way to interfere with that.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for each pair I have, I can get a point, but only if Nene doesn't play a card with the same number in between.

But since Nene has no cards of the numbers that I have two of, she can't interfere with those.

Wait, that's interesting.

So, for the numbers that I have two of, Nene has none, so she can't play any cards with that number.

Therefore, for those numbers, I can control when to play the two cards.

So, for each pair that I have, I can arrange to play the first card, then play the second card later to get a point.

Similarly, for the singles that I have, Nene has the other one, so she can play her card at some point.

I need to think about how to sequence my plays to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of graph theory or some matching.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of pairs I have and the number of singles.

Let me try to formalize it.

Let me denote:

- p: number of pairs that I have (i.e., numbers that appear twice in my hand)

- s: number of singles that I have (i.e., numbers that appear once in my hand)

Then, Nene has:

- For each of my p pairs, she has 0 cards of those numbers.

- For each of my s singles, she has one card of those numbers.

So, total cards Nene has: n cards, which consist of one card from each of my s singles, and some other cards.

Wait, no. Since each number appears exactly twice, and I have p pairs and s singles, then:

- For the p pairs, I have both cards of those numbers, so Nene has none of those.

- For the s singles, I have one card, so Nene has the other card of those numbers.

- Since I have n cards, and n = p*2 + s*1, because each pair contributes 2 cards and each single contributes 1 card.

Wait, but p is the number of pairs, so p numbers with 2 cards each, and s singles, with 1 card each, so total cards I have: 2p + s = n.

But since there are n numbers, and each number appears twice, total cards are 2n.

So, Nene has the remaining cards: 2n - n = n cards.

But, for the p pairs that I have, Nene has no cards of those numbers.

For the s singles that I have, Nene has the other card of those numbers, and for the remaining numbers, which are numbers that I don't have at all, Nene has both cards.

Wait, let's see:

Total numbers: n

I have p pairs and s singles, so the numbers that I have are:

- p numbers with 2 cards each

- s numbers with 1 card each

So, total cards I have: 2p + s = n

Then, the remaining numbers that I don't have at all are:

total numbers - (p + s) = n - p - s

Because p numbers are from pairs, and s numbers are from singles.

Wait, no. If I have p pairs and s singles, then the total distinct numbers I have are p (from pairs) + s (from singles). So, the numbers that I don't have at all are n - p - s.

For those numbers, Nene has both cards.

And for the s singles that I have, Nene has the other card.

So, Nene's cards consist of:

- For each of the s singles that I have, she has one card (the other one)

- For each of the n - p - s numbers that I don't have at all, she has two cards.

So, total cards Nene has: s + 2*(n - p - s) = s + 2n - 2p - 2s = 2n - 2p - s

But since Nene has n cards, we have:

2n - 2p - s = n

So, 2n - 2p - s = n => n = 2p + s, which matches with my earlier equation: 2p + s = n

So, everything checks out.

Now, back to the problem.

I need to maximize my points, considering that Nene plays optimally to maximize her points and minimize mine.

Given that, I need to find a strategy to play my cards in such a way that I get as many points as possible.

Let me consider the following approach:

- For each pair that I have, I can arrange to play the first card at some point, and then play the second card later to get a point.

- For the singles that I have, Nene has the other card, so she can play her card at some point.

I need to sequence my plays to maximize the number of times I play a card that's already on the table.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of pairs I have.

Each pair that I have allows me to potentially get one point, by playing the second card when the first one is already on the table.

But, Nene might play her cards in between, potentially interfering with my plans.

However, since Nene doesn't have any cards of the numbers that I have pairs of, she can't play any cards that would interfere with my pairs.

So, for each pair that I have, I can ensure that I play the first card, then later play the second card to get a point.

Similarly, for the singles, I have one card, and Nene has the other card.

So, when I play my single, if Nene has already played her corresponding card, then I get a point.

Otherwise, if Nene hasn't played her card yet, I don't get a point.

Nene, being smart, will try to minimize my points.

So, she will play her cards in such a way that minimizes the number of times I can play a card that's already on the table.

Wait, but she also wants to maximize her own points.

So, she has to balance between maximizing her points and minimizing mine.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to find a way to count the maximum points I can get, considering that Nene is playing optimally against me.

Let me consider that for each pair that I have, I can get one point, because I can control when to play the second card.

For the singles, it's more complicated, because it depends on when Nene plays her corresponding card.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of pairs I have, and then see how the singles interact.

Let me consider that for each pair that I have, I can get one point.

Then, for the singles, it's possible that I might get some points, but it's more tricky.

Wait, perhaps not.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have p pairs and s singles.

Each pair allows me to get one point, as I can play the first card, and then the second card to get a point.

For the singles, it's more complicated because Nene has the other card, and she can choose when to play it.

Nene will try to minimize my points from singles.

So, perhaps for singles, I can only get a point if Nene has already played her corresponding card.

But since Nene is playing optimally, she will try to play her cards in such a way that minimizes the number of times I can play a card that's already on the table.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of graph theory or something, but that might be too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula based on the number of pairs and singles.

Let me look back at the example.

In the first example:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

So, p = 1 pair (1,1), s = 1 single (2), and one single (3)

Wait, no. My cards are 1,1,2,3, so p = 1 pair (1,1), and s = 2 singles (2 and 3)

But according to the explanation, I can get 1 point.

In this case, p = 1, s = 2, and the answer is 1.

Is it just p?

Wait, in the second example:

n = 8

My cards: 7,4,1,2,8,8,5,5

So, p = 2 pairs (8,8 and 5,5), s = 4 singles (7,4,1,2)

The answer is 2 points.

So, p = 2, s = 4, points = 2.

Similarly, in the third test case, answer is 1.

Wait, in the third test case:

n = 8

My cards: 7,1,4,5,3,4,2,6

So, p = 1 pair (4,4), s = 6 singles (7,1,5,3,2,6)

Answer is 1.

So, p = 1, s = 6, points = 1.

In the fourth test case:

n = 3

My cards: 1,2,3

So, p = 0 pairs, s = 3 singles (1,2,3)

Answer is 0.

Similarly, in the fifth test case:

n = 1

My cards: 1

So, p = 0 pairs, s = 1 single (1)

Answer is 0.

So, from these examples, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have, p.

Is that always the case?

In the first test case, p = 1, points = 1.

Second test case, p = 2, points = 2.

Third test case, p = 1, points = 1.

Fourth test case, p = 0, points = 0.

Fifth test case, p = 0, points = 0.

So, it seems that the number of points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But wait, in the first test case, the answer is 1, which matches p = 1.

In the second test case, answer is 2, which matches p = 2.

In the third test case, answer is 1, which matches p = 1.

In the fourth and fifth test cases, answer is 0, which matches p = 0.

So, perhaps the maximum points I can get is equal to the number of pairs I have.

But is this always true?

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n = 2.

My cards: 1,1

So, p = 1 pair, s = 0 singles.

Answer should be 1, because I can play one 1, then the other 1 to get one point.

Nene has no cards, since all cards are my pairs.

So, points = p = 1.

Another example:

n = 3

My cards: 1,1,2

So, p = 1 pair, s = 1 single.

Answer should be 1, same as p.

Wait, but in the first test case, n = 4, p = 1, points = 1.

In the third test case, n = 8, p = 1, points = 1.

So, seems consistent.

Wait, but maybe there are cases where p doesn't equal the points.

Let me think of a case where p doesn't equal points.

Suppose n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,2

So, p = 2 pairs, s = 0 singles.

Answer should be 2 points.

Nene has no cards, since all numbers are in my pairs.

So, I can play one 1, then one 2, then the other 1 to get a point, then the other 2 to get another point.

Total points: 2.

Another case:

n = 5

My cards: 1,1,2,3,3

So, p = 2 pairs (1 and 3), s = 1 single (2)

Nene has singles of 2, and pairs of 4 and 5, but I have no 4 or 5.

So, I can play one 1, then one 3, then the other 1 to get a point, then the other 3 to get another point.

Nene can play her 2, but it doesn't affect my points.

So, points = 2, which is p = 2.

Seems consistent.

Wait, but what if Nene plays in a way to maximize her points and minimize mine?

In the earlier example, Nene might play her cards in a way that affects my potential points.

Wait, but in the cases I've considered, it seems that points equal p.

Maybe it's always p.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(p / 2).

Wait, no, in the second test case, p = 2, points = 2.

In the third test case, p = 1, points = 1.

In the first test case, p = 1, points =1.

So, perhaps it's p.

Wait, but what if p is larger than s or something.

Wait, another example.

n = 6

My cards: 1,1,2,2,3,3

p = 3 pairs, s = 0 singles

Nene has no cards, since all numbers are in my pairs.

So, I can get 3 points.

Another example:

n = 5

My cards: 1,1,2,3,4

p = 1 pair, s = 3 singles

Nene has singles of 2,3,4, and pairs of 5.

So, I have p =1, s =3.

Can I get more than p points?

Let's see.

I have 1,1,2,3,4.

Nene has 2,3,4,5,5.

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 5

3. I play 1 and get a point

4. Nene plays 5 and get a point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and get a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and get a point

9. I play 4

10. Nene plays 4 and get a point

Total points for me: 1

Alternatively:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 5

3. I play 1 and get a point

4. Nene plays 5 and get a point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and get a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and get a point

9. I play 4

10. Nene plays 4 and get a point

Again, I get 1 point.

Seems like p =1, points =1.

Is there a way for me to get more than p points?

It doesn't seem so.

Another example:

n = 4

My cards: 1,1,2,3

Nene's cards: 2,3,4,4

Possible sequence:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 1 and get a point

4. Nene plays 4 and get a point

5. I play 2

6. Nene plays 2 and get a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 3 and get a point

Total points for me:1

Alternatively:

1. I play 1

2. Nene plays 4

3. I play 2

4. Nene plays 4 and get a point

5. I play 1 and get a point

6. Nene plays 3 and get a point

7. I play 3

8. Nene plays 2 and get a point

Total points for me:1

Same result.

So, seems like I can get p points.

Hence, the answer is the number of pairs I have.

So, in the code, I need to count the number of pairs I have.

Given the list of cards I have, I can count the frequency of each number.

For each number, if it appears twice in my hand, it's a pair.

So, count the number of numbers that appear twice in my hand.

That's the number of pairs I have, which is equal to the maximum points I can get.

Wait, but in the code provided, it's doing something different.

Let's look at the code:

def func():

for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:

elements = line.split()

print(sum((elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements})))

So, it's reading every second line starting from the third line (since [2::2]), splitting it into elements, then for each unique item in elements, it counts the number of times it appears in elements and divides it by 3, then sums these up.

Wait, that seems unrelated to counting the number of pairs.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

If I have a list of elements, and I count the frequency of each unique item, then for each item, elements.count(item) gives the frequency.

Then, elements.count(item) // 3 would be floor division of the frequency by 3.

So, for example, if an item appears 3 times, //3 is 1.

If it appears 4 times, //3 is 1.

If it appears 2 times, //3 is 0.

If it appears 1 time, //3 is 0.

Then, summing these up for all unique items.

So, in the first test case:

My cards: 1 1 2 3

Unique items: 1,2,3

elements.count(1) =2, 2//3=0

elements.count(2)=1,1//3=0

elements.count(3)=1,1//3=0

Sum:0

But according to the problem, p=1, but here it's 0.

So, incorrect.

In the second test case:

My cards:7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5

Unique items:7,4,1,2,8,5

counts:7->1,4->1,1->1,2->1,8->2,5->2

So, 1//3=0 for each, sum:0

But according to the problem, answer is2.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, p=2, which matches the answer.

But according to this code, it's sum of floor(count(item)/3), which is 0.

So, doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe it's sum(floor(freq[x]/3) for x in unique elements).

In the first test case, sum is 0, but answer is1.

In the second test case, sum is0, but answer is2.

So, doesn't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps it's a different approach.

Wait, maybe it's counting something else.

Wait, perhaps it's counting the number of times a number appears at least 3 times in my hand, but that doesn't make sense because in my hand, numbers can appear at most twice.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says each number appears exactly twice in the entire deck, so in my hand, a number can appear at most twice.

So, elements.count(item) can be at most 2, so elements.count(item)//3=0 always.

So, sum is always 0, but in the problem, answers are 1,2,1,0,0.

So, the code is always outputting0, which is incorrect for the first two test cases.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: False.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{False}}\]
