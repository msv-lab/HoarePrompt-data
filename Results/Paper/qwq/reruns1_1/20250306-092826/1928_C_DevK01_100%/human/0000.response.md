Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's this physical education lesson in a school, and students are lining up and getting assigned numbers based on their positions and a parameter k. The goal is to figure out how many possible values of k are valid given Vasya's position and the number he received.

First, I need to understand how the numbering works. It says that the first k people get numbers 1 through k, and then the next k-2 people get numbers k-1 down to 2, and this pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions.

So, for example, if k=3, the sequence would be:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10...

Numbers: 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 1 2...

Wait, in the example for k=3, it seems like it's 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2,1,2,... Is that right? Yes, according to the problem.

Another example for k=2: 1,2,1,2,1,2,...

And for k=5: 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1,...

Okay, so the pattern repeats every 2k-2 positions. For k=3, cycle length is 4 (1,2,3,2), for k=5, it's 8 (1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2).

Given that, for a position n and number x that Vasya received, I need to find all possible k >1 such that in the sequence generated with that k, the number at position n is x.

Constraints are 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and t <= 100 test cases.

First, I need to find a way to model this sequence mathematically so that I can find k given n and x.

Let's think about the repeating cycle: each cycle has length 2k-2.

Within each cycle:

- Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

- Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 to 2

So, for a given position n, I can find out which part of the cycle it falls into.

Let me denote m = 2k - 2.

Then, the cycle repeats every m positions.

So, the position n in the sequence corresponds to position p in the cycle, where p = n mod m.

But need to be careful with modulo operation, especially when n is a multiple of m.

Wait, in programming, modulo operation in Python gives 0 for n divisible by m, but in sequence, position m corresponds to the last position in the cycle.

So, p = n mod m, but if p == 0, then p = m.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, p = n if n mod m != 0 else m.

Then, in the cycle:

- If 1 <= p <= k, number is p

- If k+1 <= p <= 2k-2, number is 2k - p

So, for a given k, the number at position n is:

- p, if p <= k

- 2k - p, if p > k

And we want this to be equal to x.

So, we have:

If p <= k, then p = x

Else, 2k - p = x

So, two cases:

1. p <= k: p = x

2. p > k: 2k - p = x

In both cases, we can solve for k.

First case: p = x => k >= p

Second case: 2k - p = x => k = (p + x)/2

But k must be an integer, so (p + x) must be even.

Also, k >1.

So, for each possible p, which is from 1 to m=2k-2, but k depends on p.

Wait, this seems a bit circular.

Maybe I need to find a relationship between k and p, and then find k that satisfies the equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible k and check if for that k, the number at position n is x.

But with n up to 1e9, iterating over k is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the cycle length m = 2k - 2.

The sequence repeats every m positions.

So, positions in the sequence can be divided into blocks of m positions, each block having the same pattern.

Given that, for a given k, m = 2k -2.

Then, for a position n, the number at that position is determined by p = n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0.

Then, as above, number at position p is:

- p, if p <=k

- 2k - p, if p >k

We want this number to be x.

So, set up the equation based on p and k.

Case 1: p <=k => p =x

Case 2: p >k => 2k - p =x

So, for case 1: p =x and p <=k

Which implies k >=x

For case 2: 2k - p =x and p >k

From 2k - p =x, we get p =2k -x

Substitute into p >k: 2k -x >k => k >x

So, k >x

Also, p <=m=2k-2, so 2k -x <=2k -2 => -x <= -2 => x >=2

But x can be 1, so need to be careful.

Wait, x is at least 1, and n >x, as per constraints.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Let me try to express k in terms of known quantities.

From case 1: p =x and k >=x

From case 2: p =2k -x and k >x

Also, p =n mod m, where m=2k -2

But m=2k -2, so m+2=2k

So, k=(m+2)/2

Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of m.

Let's set m=2k -2 => k=(m+2)/2

Then, p =n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0

Then, in terms of m, express the conditions.

Case 1: p <=k => p <= (m+2)/2

And p =x

Case 2: p >k => p > (m+2)/2

And p =2k -x = m +2 -x

Wait, let's see.

From p=2k -x and k=(m+2)/2, so p=2*(m+2)/2 -x = m +2 -x

So, in case 2, p =m +2 -x

And p >k => m +2 -x > (m+2)/2 => m +2 -x > (m+2)/2

Simplify: m +2 -x > (m+2)/2 => (m +2 -x)*2 > m +2

=> 2m +4 -2x > m +2 => m -2x +4 >0 => m > 2x -4

But m=2k -2, and k >=2 (since k >1, and k is integer)

So, m >=2

So, m > 2x -4

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the sequence in terms of blocks of size m=2k-2.

Within each block:

Positions 1 to k: numbers 1 to k

Positions k+1 to 2k-2: numbers k-1 down to 2

So, for a given n, p =n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0

Then, number at position p is:

- p, if p <=k

- 2k -p, if p >k

We want this number to be x.

So, set up the equation:

If p <=k, then p =x

Else, 2k -p =x

So, in both cases, we can express in terms of p and k.

But p is related to n and m, which is 2k-2.

This seems recursive.

Maybe I can solve for k in terms of n and x.

Let me try to find a relationship.

From p =n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0

And m=2k-2

So, m =2k -2 => k=(m+2)/2

Now, in terms of p and x:

Case 1: p <=k => p =x

Case 2: p >k => 2k -p =x

So, for case 1: p =x and k >=x

For case 2: 2k -p =x and k >x

But p =n mod m, and m=2k -2

So, p =n mod (2k -2), or 2k -2 if n mod (2k -2)==0

This seems tricky because m depends on k, which is what we're solving for.

Perhaps I can iterate over possible m and see if the conditions are satisfied.

Given that m=2k -2, and k >=2, so m >=2

Also, m must be such that p =n mod m (or m if n mod m ==0)

And then, based on p, we have p =x or 2k -p =x

Let me try to express this differently.

Let me consider that m=2k -2, so k=(m+2)/2

Then, p =n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0

Then, number at position p is:

- p, if p <=k=(m+2)/2

- 2k -p = m +2 -p, if p >k=(m+2)/2

We want this number to be x.

So, two cases:

1. p <= (m+2)/2 and p =x

2. p > (m+2)/2 and m +2 -p =x

So, in both cases, we can express in terms of p and m.

Let's consider both cases.

Case 1: p =x and p <= (m+2)/2

Case 2: m +2 -p =x and p > (m+2)/2

Also, p =n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0

Let me denote q =n mod m

So, p =q if q !=0 else m

Then, in terms of q:

p = q if q !=0 else m

Now, q =n mod m, which is n - m * floor(n/m)

So, q is between 1 and m inclusive.

Now, for case 1: q <= (m+2)/2 and q =x

For case 2: q > (m+2)/2 and m +2 -q =x

So, in both cases, we can solve for m.

But m=2k -2, and k >=2

So, m >=2, and m is even because k is integer, so m=2k -2 is even for k >=2.

Wait, k is integer >=2, so m=2k -2 is even for k >=2.

Because for k=2, m=2, for k=3, m=4, etc.

So, m is even and >=2.

Now, let's consider the two cases again.

Case 1: q =x and q <= (m+2)/2

Case 2: m +2 -q =x and q > (m+2)/2

Our goal is to find m such that one of these two cases holds, given n and x.

Now, q =n mod m, or m if n mod m ==0

But m divides n if q=0, but q cannot be 0 because m >=2 and n >=2.

Wait, in programming, n mod m can be 0 if m divides n.

But in the sequence, if n is a multiple of m, p=m.

So, p = m if m divides n, else p =n mod m

So, p can be from 1 to m.

Now, in terms of m, we have:

- If p <= (m+2)/2, then p =x

- Else, m +2 -p =x

So, in both cases, we can express in terms of m and x.

Let's consider case 1: p =x and p <= (m+2)/2

So, x <= (m+2)/2

Which implies m >= 2x -2

Also, since m is even and m >=2, k=(m+2)/2 is integer.

Case 2: p > (m+2)/2 and m +2 -p =x

So, p =m +2 -x

And p > (m+2)/2

So, m +2 -x > (m+2)/2

Simplify: m +2 -x > (m+2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: 2(m +2 -x) > m +2

=> 2m +4 -2x > m +2

=> 2m - m +4 -2x >2

=> m > 2x -2

Same as case 1.

So, in both cases, m >= 2x -2

But m must be even, and m >=2

Also, k=(m+2)/2 >1, which implies m >=2

So, m can be from 2 to ... up to some maximum value.

But n and x are up to 1e9, so m can be up to 2e9.

But we need an efficient way to find all m that satisfy the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relationship between m and n, x.

Given that p =n mod m or m if n mod m ==0

And in terms of p, we have p =x or m +2 -p =x

So, let's consider p =x or p =m +2 -x

And p =n mod m or m if n mod m ==0

So, p =n - m * floor(n/m)

Or p =m if m divides n.

So, in general, p =n - m * floor(n/m)

But p can be from 1 to m.

Now, for p =x or p =m +2 -x

So, set up the equation:

n - m * floor(n/m) =x or n - m * floor(n/m) =m +2 -x

Let me denote q = floor(n/m)

Then, n - m*q =x or n - m*q =m +2 -x

So, n - m*q =x or n - m*q =m +2 -x

Which can be rewritten as:

m*q =n -x or m*q =n - (m +2 -x)

So, m*q =n -x or m*q =n -m -2 +x

But this seems a bit messy.

Maybe I can think differently.

Let me consider that p =x or p =m +2 -x

And p =n - m*q, where q = floor(n/m)

So, n - m*q =x or n - m*q =m +2 -x

So, m*q =n -x or m*q =n - (m +2 -x)

So, m*q =n -x or m*q =n -m -2 +x

But m*q =n -x implies m divides (n -x)

Similarly, m*q =n -m -2 +x implies m*(q+1) =n -2 +x

So, m divides (n -x) or m divides (n -2 +x)

Wait, that seems promising.

So, m divides (n -x) or m divides (n -2 +x)

And m=2k -2, where k >=2, and m is even.

So, m must be a divisor of (n -x) or a divisor of (n -2 +x)

But m must be even and >=2.

So, to find all m that satisfy m divides (n -x) or m divides (n -2 +x), and m is even, m >=2.

Then, k=(m+2)/2

So, for each even m >=2 that divides (n -x) or (n -2 +x), we can compute k=(m+2)/2

Now, need to make sure that k >=2, which implies m >=2, which is already satisfied.

Also, need to ensure that in case p =x, p <=k, which is x <=k

But k=(m+2)/2, so x <= (m+2)/2

Similarly, in case p =m +2 -x, p >k, which is m +2 -x > (m+2)/2

Simplify: m +2 -x > (m+2)/2

Multiply both sides by 2: 2m +4 -2x > m +2

=> m > 2x -2

So, m > 2x -2

Therefore, for m to be valid:

- m divides (n -x) or m divides (n -2 +x)

- m is even

- m >=2

- m > 2x -2

Now, considering that m must divide (n -x) or (n -2 +x), and m is even, m >=2, and m > 2x -2

So, to find all such m, I need to find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n -2 +x), that are >=2 and > 2x -2

Then, for each such m, compute k=(m+2)/2

But need to make sure that k is integer, which it is since m is even.

Also, k >1, which is already satisfied since m >=2.

Now, let's consider that m must divide (n -x) or (n -2 +x)

So, I need to find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n -2 +x), that are >=2 and > 2x -2

Then, for each such m, compute k=(m+2)/2

But need to make sure that for each m, it corresponds to only one k.

Yes, since k=(m+2)/2

So, the number of valid k is equal to the number of valid m that satisfy the conditions.

Now, to implement this efficiently, given that n and x can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to find all even divisors of (n -x) and (n -2 +x), that are >=2 and > 2x -2

First, compute y =n -x and z =n -2 +x

Then, find all even divisors of y and z that are >=2 and > 2x -2

Then, for each such divisor m, compute k=(m+2)/2

But need to make sure that k is integer and k >1, which is already satisfied.

Also, need to ensure that m > 2x -2

Now, let's consider that m must be even, so only consider even divisors.

Also, m >=2

And m > 2x -2

So, for m to be valid, m >= max(2, 2x -1)

But m is even, so m >= max(2, ceil(2x -1))

But ceil(2x -1) is 2x -1 if x is integer.

Wait, x is integer, as it's a position number.

So, m > 2x -2 => m >= 2x -1

But m must be even, so m >= ceil(2x -1)

If 2x -1 is odd, ceil(2x -1) =2x -1, but m must be even, so m >= 2x

If 2x -1 is even, then m >=2x -1

Wait, 2x -1 is always odd for integer x >=1

So, m >=2x

But m must be even, so m >=2x, and m is even.

But m >=2x and m is even implies m >= ceil(2x)

But ceil(2x) is 2x, since x is integer.

Wait, x can be 1, so for x=1, m >=2, which is already satisfied.

For x=2, m >=4, etc.

So, in general, m >=2x -1, but since m is even, m >= ceil(2x -1)

Which is m >=2x -1, but m is even, so m >= max(2, 2x -1)

But since m must be even, for m >=2x -1, and m even, m >=2x if 2x -1 is odd, else m >=2x -1.

But 2x -1 is always odd for integer x, so m >=2x

So, m >=2x

Now, to find all even divisors of y and z that are >=2x

Where y =n -x and z =n -2 +x

Wait, z =n -2 +x =n +x -2

So, z =n +x -2

Wait, in the code, y =n +x, but in my derivation, z =n +x -2

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, in the code, y =n +x

But in my earlier steps, I set y =n -x and z =n -2 +x =n +x -2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting y and z.

Let me double-check.

From earlier:

m divides (n -x) or m divides (n -2 +x)

Which is m divides (n -x) or m divides (n +x -2)

So, y =n -x and z =n +x -2

But in the code, y =n +x -2

Wait, in the code, it's y =n +x -2, but in my earlier steps, z =n +x -2

Wait, perhaps I misassigned y and z.

Let me correct that.

Set y =n -x

And z =n +x -2

Then, m divides y or m divides z, and m is even, m >=2, m >=2x -1 (since m >2x -2)

But m is even, so m >=2x -1, but 2x -1 is odd, so m >=2x

Because the smallest even m >=2x -1 is m=2x

So, m >=2x

Hence, for each even m >=2x that divides y or z, we have a valid k=(m+2)/2

Now, to implement this efficiently, given that n and x are up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to find all even divisors of y and z that are >=2x

First, compute y =n -x and z =n +x -2

Then, find all even divisors of y that are >=2x

And all even divisors of z that are >=2x

Then, combine them and remove duplicates, since k must be unique.

But need to make sure that for each m, k=(m+2)/2 is integer and k >=2

Which is already satisfied since m >=2 and m is even.

Now, in the code, it seems that the author has implemented a function func_1(q, x) to find such m's.

Wait, let's look at the code.

Given code:

import math

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

L = list(map(int, input().split()))

n = L[0]

x = L[1]

ans = 0

y = n + x

if y % 2 != 0:

print(0)

continue

else:

L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)

if n >= 3 * x - 2:

L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)

L1 = list(set(L1))

print(len(L1))

continue

def func_1(q, x):

M = []

w = math.sqrt(q)

if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:

M += [w]

i = 1

while i < w:

if q % i == 0:

if i >= x - 1:

M += [i]

if q // i >= x - 1:

M += [q // i]

i += 1

return M

So, the code defines a function func_1(q, x) that finds divisors of q that are >= x-1, and adds them to list M.

Then, in the main loop, for each test case, it sets y =n +x

If y is odd, prints 0

Else, calls func_1 with q=(y -2)//2, x=x, and if n >=3x -2, also calls func_1 with q=(n -x)//2, x=x

Then combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the count.

Wait, but in my earlier derivation, I had y =n -x and z =n +x -2

But in the code, y =n +x, and q=(y -2)//2 = (n +x -2)//2 = z//2, where z =n +x -2

Similarly, (n -x)//2 is y//2, where y =n -x

So, it seems the author has considered q=(z)//2 and q=(y)//2

Now, let's see why.

From earlier:

m divides y =n -x or m divides z =n +x -2

And m is even, m >=2x

In the code, q=(z)//2 or q=(y)//2

Wait, z =n +x -2, so q=(n +x -2)//2

Similarly, y =n -x, q=(n -x)//2

Now, m divides z => m divides 2q, since z=2q

Because z =n +x -2, q=(n +x -2)//2

Similarly, m divides y => m divides 2q', where q'=(n -x)//2

But m is even, so m divides 2q implies m divides q, since m is even and 2q is divisible by m.

Wait, no. If m divides 2q, and m is even, then m/2 divides q.

But m is even, so m=2k -2=2(k-1), so m is divisible by 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider m divides z =n +x -2

So, m divides z => m divides n +x -2

Similarly, m divides y =n -x => m divides n -x

But m divides both n +x -2 and n -x, so m divides their difference: (n +x -2) - (n -x) = 2x -2

So, m divides 2x -2

But earlier, I had m divides y or m divides z, but now it seems m divides both y and z only if m divides their difference, which is 2x -2

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the greatest common divisor (gcd) of y and z.

Compute gcd(y, z) = gcd(n -x, n +x -2)

Which is gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

Because n +x -2 = (n -x) + 2x -2

So, gcd(a, a + b) = gcd(a, b)

Hence, gcd(n -x, n +x -2) = gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

So, the common divisors of y and z are the divisors of gcd(y, z) = gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

But in the code, it seems to be considering divisors of q=(n +x -2)//2 and q=(n -x)//2 separately.

I think there might be a better way to approach this.

Let me try to think differently.

Given that m divides z =n +x -2 and m divides y =n -x, then m divides both y and z.

But gcd(y, z) = gcd(n -x, n +x -2) = gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

So, the common divisors of y and z are the divisors of gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

Hence, m must be a divisor of gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

Also, m must be even, m >=2, and m >=2x -1, but since m is even, m >=2x

So, find all even divisors of gcd(n -x, 2x -2) that are >=2x

Then, for each such m, compute k=(m+2)/2

But need to make sure that k is integer and k >=2, which is already satisfied.

Hence, the number of valid k is equal to the number of even divisors of gcd(n -x, 2x -2) that are >=2x

Now, this seems more efficient because gcd(n -x, 2x -2) can be computed efficiently, and then finding its even divisors that are >=2x can be done by iterating up to sqrt(gcd).

In the code, it seems that the author is considering q=(n +x -2)//2 and q=(n -x)//2 separately, and finding divisors of q that are >=x -1.

But according to my derivation, it should be finding even divisors of gcd(n -x, 2x -2) that are >=2x

So, perhaps there is a mistake in the code.

Wait, maybe the author has a different approach.

Let me try to understand the code step by step.

First, it reads t, the number of test cases.

For each test case:

- Read n and x

- Set y =n +x

- If y is odd, print 0 and continue

- Else, set q=(y -2)//2 = (n +x -2)//2

- Call func_1(q, x), which finds divisors of q that are >=x -1

- If n >=3x -2, also call func_1((n -x)//2, x)

- Combine the results, remove duplicates, and print the count

Now, func_1(q, x) finds divisors of q that are >=x -1

Then, k=(m+2)/2, where m is the divisor.

But according to my earlier reasoning, m should be even divisors of gcd(n -x, 2x -2) that are >=2x

So, there seems to be a discrepancy.

Perhaps the author is considering m=2k -2, and k=(m+2)/2

Given that, m must divide either y=n -x or z=n +x -2, and m is even, m >=2x

But in the code, it's checking y=n +x is even, then sets q=(y -2)//2=(n +x -2)//2

Then, finds divisors of q that are >=x -1

Similarly, if n >=3x -2, finds divisors of (n -x)//2 that are >=x -1

Then, combines them and removes duplicates.

Wait, perhaps the author is considering m=2q, since m is even.

So, m=2q, and q=(n +x -2)//2

But I'm getting confused.

Let me try to see with an example.

Take the first test case:

n=10, x=2

y =n +x =12, which is even

q=(12 -2)//2=5

So, func_1(5,2) finds divisors of 5 that are >=1 (since x-1=1)

Divisors of 5 are 1 and 5, both >=1

So, m=2*1=2 and m=2*5=10

Then, k=(2+2)/2=2 and k=(10+2)/2=6

So, k=2 and k=6

Then, check if n >=3x -2: 10 >= 4, which is true, so also call func_1((10 -2)//2,2)=func_1(4,2)

Divisors of 4 that are >=1 are 1,2,4

So, m=2*1=2, m=2*2=4, m=2*4=8

Then, k=(2+2)/2=2, k=(4+2)/2=3, k=(8+2)/2=5

So, k=2,3,5

Combine with previous k=2,6, get k=2,3,5,6

Hence, 4 possible k's, which matches the first test case output.

So, in this case, it works.

Another test case: n=3, x=1

y=4, which is even

q=(4-2)//2=1

func_1(1,1): divisors of 1 that are >=0 (x-1=0), which is 1

m=2*1=2

k=(2+2)/2=2

Then, n >=3x -2: 3 >=1, which is true, so also call func_1((3-1)//2,1)=func_1(1,1)

Which again gives m=2

So, k=2 is the only unique k, which matches the second test case output.

Seems correct.

Another test case: n=76, x=4

y=80, even

q=(80-2)//2=39

func_1(39,4): divisors of 39 that are >=3: 3,13,39

m=6,26,78

k=4,14,40

Then, n >=3x -2:76 >=10, true, so also call func_1((76-4)//2,4)=func_1(36,4)

Divisors of 36 >=3: 3,4,6,9,12,18,36

m=6,8,12,18,24,36,72

k=4,5,7,10,13,19,37

Combine with previous k=4,14,40

Unique k's:4,5,7,10,13,14,19,37,40

Which is 9 k's, matching the third test case.

Seems correct.

Fourth test case: n=100, x=99

y=199, which is odd, so output 0, matches the fourth test case.

Fifth test case: n=1000000000, x=500000000

y=1500000000, even

q=(1500000000-2)//2=749999999

func_1(749999999,500000000)

Need divisors of 749999999 that are >=499999999

But 749999999 is 2*374999999. Wait, no, 749999999 is prime or something.

Wait, in reality, 749999999 is 750000000 -1, which is (2^3 * 3^1 * 5^6 *1)-1, but anyway.

Assuming it's prime, then only divisors are 1 and 749999999

But 1 < 499999999, so only 749999999 >=499999999

So, m=2*749999999=1499999998

k=(1499999998 +2)/2=750000000

Then, check n >=3x -2:1000000000 >=1499999998? No, 1000000000 <1499999998, so don't call func_1((n -x)//2, x)=func_1(250000000,500000000)

But 250000000 <500000000 -1=499999999, so no divisors >=499999999

Hence, only k=750000000 is valid, which matches the fifth test case output of 1.

So, the code seems to be working correctly for the given examples.

But is this logic correct in general?

Let me try to see.

In the code, for y=n +x even, it sets q=(y -2)//2=(n +x -2)//2

Then, finds divisors of q that are >=x -1

Then, m=2*d, where d is the divisor

Then, k=(m+2)/2=(2*d +2)/2=d +1

Similarly, if n >=3x -2, also finds divisors of (n -x)//2 that are >=x -1, and does the same.

But according to my earlier reasoning, m should be even divisors of gcd(n -x, 2x -2) that are >=2x

But in the code, it's considering divisors of (n +x -2)//2 and (n -x)//2 that are >=x -1

Then, m=2*d, and k=d +1

Now, perhaps there is a relationship between these approaches.

Wait, maybe the author has considered that m=2*d, and d divides q=(n +x -2)//2 or d divides (n -x)//2

Then, m=2*d divides n +x -2 or m=2*d divides n -x

But m=2*d, so 2*d divides n +x -2 or 2*d divides n -x

Which seems related to m dividing z or y.

But I'm still not fully understanding the logic.

Perhaps I need to accept that the code is correct based on the test cases, even if I don't fully understand the logic behind it.

But as an AI, I should ensure that the logic is sound.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose m=2*d, where d is a divisor of q=(n +x -2)//2

Then, m=2*d divides n +x -2, since m=2*d and d divides q=(n +x -2)//2

Similarly, if d divides (n -x)//2, then m=2*d divides n -x

Hence, m divides both n +x -2 and n -x, which means m divides their gcd, which is gcd(n -x, n +x -2)=gcd(n -x, 2x -2)

So, by considering d as divisors of q=(n +x -2)//2 and d >=x -1, and m=2*d, the code is effectively finding m=2*d where d divides q and d >=x -1

Then, k=(m+2)/2=(2*d +2)/2=d +1

Similarly, for the second call when n >=3x -2, it considers d divides (n -x)//2 and d >=x -1, then m=2*d, k=d +1

Then, combines these k's and removes duplicates.

Now, to verify if this is correct, I need to see if these k's satisfy the original condition that the number at position n is x.

Given that, and based on the test cases, it seems to be correct.

Hence, I can conclude that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{The given program is correct.}}
