Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array of integers, a positive integer m, and a string of commands consisting of 'L's and 'R's. For each command, I need to output the product of the current array modulo m, and then remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'. This process repeats for all commands in the string.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have to process each command in order, output the product modulo m before performing the removal, and then adjust the array by removing either the first or last element as specified by the command.

Given that the array can be quite large, up to 2*10^5 elements, and there can be up to 10^4 test cases, efficiency is crucial. I need to make sure that my solution doesn't exceed time limits, so I have to think about the time complexity.

A naive approach would be to compute the product modulo m for the entire array for each command, but that would be O(n^2), which is too slow for the given constraints. I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me think about how the product changes with each removal. If I remove an element from the left or the right, the product changes by dividing by that element. However, since we're dealing with modulo m, division isn't straightforward because m might not be a prime number, and thus, modular inverses might not exist for all elements.

Wait, but in the problem, a_i is at least 1, and m can be up to 10^4. So, a_i and m might not be coprime, meaning that a_i might not have an inverse modulo m. That complicates things.

Maybe instead of trying to divide, I can keep track of the product as I remove elements. Let's consider processing the commands in reverse. If I start from the end, I can build up the product step by step, keeping track of what would be the product at each step if I were to reverse the operations.

Wait, that might be a way to go. Let's think about it more carefully.

Suppose I start from the end of the command string, and I build the array back up by adding elements either to the left or to the right, depending on the command. As I do this, I can keep track of the product modulo m, and then, when I reach the beginning, I can have the sequence of products in reverse order, which I can then reverse to get the correct order.

Let me try to formalize this.

Define a list b that represents the elements removed in the order specified by the commands. So, for each command:

- If it's 'L', remove the leftmost element, which is a[l], where l is the current left index.

- If it's 'R', remove the rightmost element, which is a[r], where r is the current right index.

I can collect these removed elements in a list b, in the order they are removed.

Then, starting from an empty array, I can add these elements back in reverse order of b, which corresponds to processing the commands from the end to the beginning.

As I add each element, I can update the product modulo m, and keep track of the products in this process.

Finally, the sequence of products I get from this reverse process needs to be reversed again to match the original order.

Let's see with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

n = 4, m = 6

a = [3, 1, 4, 2]

s = "LRRL"

So, processing the commands:

1. 'L': remove 3, product = (1*4*2) % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2

2. 'R': remove 2, product = (1*4) % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4

3. 'R': remove 4, product = (1) % 6 = 1 % 6 = 1

4. 'L': remove 1, empty array, product = 0

Output: 0 2 4 1

Now, according to my idea, I collect b = [3, 2, 4, 1]

Then, starting from an empty array, add 1, then 4, then 2, then 3.

Initialize product p = 1

Add 1: p = 1 * 1 % 6 = 1 % 6 = 1

Add 2: p = 1 * 2 % 6 = 2 % 6 = 2

Add 4: p = 2 * 4 % 6 = 8 % 6 = 2

Add 3: p = 2 * 3 % 6 = 6 % 6 = 0

So, the products in reverse order are: 0, 2, 2, 1

Reversing this gives: 1, 2, 2, 0

But the correct output is: 0, 2, 4, 1

Hmm, that doesn't match. So, my initial idea has a flaw.

Let me think again.

Maybe I need to consider the order in which elements are removed and how the product is affected.

Another approach could be to precompute the product of the entire array modulo m, output it, then based on the first command, remove the leftmost or rightmost element, and update the product accordingly.

But as I thought earlier, updating the product by removing an element isn't straightforward modulo m due to potential lack of inverses.

Wait, but maybe in this specific problem, since we're dealing with removals and the array is getting smaller each time, I can keep track of the product at each step.

Let me consider computing the product for the current array at each step, but doing it efficiently.

One way to do this is to precompute prefix and suffix products modulo m.

Let me define:

- prefix[i] = (a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i-1]) % m

- suffix[i] = (a[i] * a[i+1] * ... * a[n-1]) % m

Then, at any step, the product of the current array is suffix[l] * prefix[r+1] % m, where l is the current left index and r is the current right index.

Wait, no. Actually, the product of the current array from l to r is suffix[l] * prefix[r+1] % m.

But I need to be careful with how I compute prefix and suffix.

Let me redefine:

- prefix[i] = (a[0] * a[1] * ... * a[i-1]) % m

- suffix[i] = (a[i] * a[i+1] * ... * a[n-1]) % m

Then, the product from l to r is (prefix[l] * suffix[r]) % m.

Wait, no. prefix[l] is the product up to l-1, and suffix[r] is the product from r to n-1.

So, if l <= r, the product from l to r is (prefix[r+1] // prefix[l]) * suffix[r] % m), but since we're dealing with modulo m, and m might not be prime, division isn't straightforward.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Another idea: since we're removing elements one by one, either from the left or the right, I can simulate the process while keeping track of the current product.

But again, updating the product efficiently is the challenge.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and update it as I remove elements.

Let's consider that I maintain the current product modulo m.

At each step:

- Output the current product modulo m.

- Remove the element as specified by the command.

- Update the product by dividing by the removed element, if possible.

But again, division modulo m is tricky if the element and m are not coprime.

This seems messy.

Maybe I should consider another approach.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Sample Input:

4

4 6

3 1 4 2

LRRL

5 1

1 1 1 1 1

LLLLL

6 8

1 2 3 4 5 6

RLLLRR

1 10000

10000

R

Sample Output:

0 2 4 1 

0 0 0 0 0 

0 0 0 4 4 4 

0 

Looking at the first test case:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s="LRRL"

Output: 0 2 4 1

As per the explanation:

- Initial product: 3*1*4*2 = 24 % 6 = 0

- Remove left (3), array becomes [1,4,2]

- Product: 1*4*2 = 8 % 6 = 2

- Remove right (2), array becomes [1,4]

- Product: 1*4 = 4 % 6 = 4

- Remove right (4), array becomes [1]

- Product: 1 % 6 = 1

- Remove left (1), array is empty

- Product: 0

So, the outputs are 0,2,4,1.

Now, looking at the third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s="RLLLRR"

Output: 0 0 0 4 4 4

Let's simulate:

- Initial product: 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720 % 8 = 0

- Remove right (6), array becomes [1,2,3,4,5]

- Product: 1*2*3*4*5 = 120 % 8 = 0

- Remove left (1), array becomes [2,3,4,5]

- Product: 2*3*4*5 = 120 % 8 = 0

- Remove left (2), array becomes [3,4,5]

- Product: 3*4*5 = 60 % 8 = 4

- Remove left (3), array becomes [4,5]

- Product: 4*5 = 20 % 8 = 4

- Remove right (5), array becomes [4]

- Product: 4 % 8 = 4

- Remove right (4), array is empty

- Product: 0

So, outputs are 0,0,0,4,4,4.

This seems consistent with the sample output.

Now, considering the approach in the given program:

def func_1(n, m, a, s):

b = []

l = 0

r = n - 1

for i in range(n):

if s[i] == 'L':

b.append(a[l])

l += 1

else:

b.append(a[r])

r -= 1

ans = []

p = 1

for v in reversed(b):

p = p * v % m

ans.append(p)

return reversed(ans)

So, what this code does is:

- It collects the elements that are removed in the order specified by the commands into list b.

- Then, it initializes p=1.

- It iterates over b in reverse order, multiplying p by each v in reversed b, taking modulo m, and appending to ans.

- Finally, it returns the reversed ans.

Wait, let's see with the first test case:

b = [3,2,4,1]

reversed b is [1,4,2,3]

Initialize p=1

- Multiply by 1: p=1*1%6=1, ans=[1]

- Multiply by 2: p=1*2%6=2, ans=[1,2]

- Multiply by 4: p=2*4%6=8%6=2, ans=[1,2,2]

- Multiply by 3: p=2*3%6=6%6=0, ans=[1,2,2,0]

Then, return reversed(ans) which is [0,2,2,1]

But the correct output is 0,2,4,1

This doesn't match. So, there's an error in this approach.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I'm building the product.

Let me think differently.

If I process the commands in reverse, starting from the empty array, and adding elements back according to the commands, I can keep track of the product at each step.

In the first test case:

Commands: LRRL

Reversed commands: LRRL

Starting from empty array, with product=1.

- Add 1 to the left (since command is L), array becomes [1], product=1%6=1

- Add 3 to the right (next reversed command is R), array becomes [1,3], product=(1*3)%6=3%6=3

- Add 4 to the right (next command is R), array becomes [1,3,4], product=(1*3*4)%6=12%6=0

- Add 2 to the left (next command is L), array becomes [2,1,3,4], product=(2*1*3*4)%6=24%6=0

Then, the products in reverse order are: 0,0,3,1

Reversing gives: 1,3,0,0

But the correct output is 0,2,4,1

This doesn't match. So, this approach is also incorrect.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider that the sequence of products can be computed by keeping track of the cumulative product as elements are removed.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the entire array, output it, then based on the first command, divide by the removed element, but again, division modulo m is tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept of modular inverses when m is coprime with the removed element, but since m can be up to 10^4 and a_i can be up to 10^4, it's not guaranteed that a_i and m are coprime.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I precompute the product of all elements in the array modulo m.

Then, for each command, I output the current product modulo m, remove the specified element, and then update the product by dividing by the removed element, if possible.

But again, division is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and update it by multiplying by the inverse of the removed element, if it exists.

But, as mentioned earlier, the inverse may not exist if the removed element and m are not coprime.

This seems unreliable for all test cases.

I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for each step, I need to compute the product of the current array modulo m.

Given that the array is being reduced by one element at each step, perhaps I can find a way to efficiently compute the product at each step without recalculating the entire product each time.

Wait, here's an idea: compute the product of the entire array, output it, then based on the first command, divide the product by the removed element, but do it in a way that avoids division.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the product and update it by removing the contribution of the removed element.

But removing the contribution is equivalent to dividing, which brings us back to the same problem.

This seems challenging.

Let me look at the constraints again.

n can be up to 2*10^5, and t (number of test cases) up to 10^4, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 2*10^5.

So, per test case, the time complexity should be O(n), or perhaps O(n log n), but O(n^2) is definitely too slow.

I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Let me consider precomputing prefix and suffix products without taking modulo m, but that could lead to very large numbers that are hard to handle.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo some larger number, but that still doesn't solve the division problem.

This seems tricky.

Wait, maybe I can precompute the prefix and suffix products modulo m, and then, for each step, compute the product of the current array as prefix[l] * suffix[r] % m.

But, no, that's similar to what I thought earlier, and it has the same issue.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the prefix and suffix products, and then, for each step, the product is prefix[l] * suffix[r] % m.

But, in reality, prefix[l] is the product of a[0] to a[l-1], and suffix[r] is the product of a[r] to a[n-1].

So, the product from l to r is (prefix[r+1] * suffix[l]) % m.

Wait, no.

Actually, if prefix[i] is the product of a[0] to a[i-1], and suffix[i] is the product of a[i] to a[n-1], then the product from l to r is suffix[l] / prefix[r+1], but again, division is problematic.

This seems like a dead end.

Maybe I need to consider that for each step, the product is the product of the remaining elements, and I can compute that by dividing the total product by the product of the removed elements.

But again, division is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the product of the removed elements and then compute the product of the remaining array as total_product / product_removed.

But this still requires division, which is problematic.

I need another way.

Let me think about the properties of modulo m.

If m is small, up to 10^4, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m directly without worrying about overflow.

But in the process of computing the product, I need to handle the removal of elements efficiently.

This is proving to be difficult.

Maybe I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that the sequence of products can be computed by considering the order in which elements are removed.

If I know the order in which elements are removed, I can compute the product of the remaining elements at each step.

But with n up to 2*10^5, I need this to be efficient.

Wait, perhaps I can simulate the process using a deque, where I can remove elements from the left or right efficiently.

But even with a deque, computing the product at each step would still be O(n), which could be too slow for the time limits.

I need something smarter.

Let me consider that the product of the array at each step can be expressed in terms of the product at the previous step, adjusted by the removed element.

But again, adjusting by removing an element requires division, which is problematic.

This seems like a tough problem.

Let me consider an alternative approach: since the array is being reduced by one element at each step, perhaps I can compute the product for each possible subarray efficiently.

But that sounds too broad and likely to be too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the product of all subarrays and then retrieve the product for each step.

But with n up to 2*10^5, that's not feasible.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that since m is up to 10^4, which is relatively small, perhaps I can compute the product modulo m efficiently by keeping track of some factors or by using some mathematical properties related to m.

For example, if m is composite, it has prime factors, and I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to compute the product modulo m by computing it modulo the prime powers in m's factorization.

But this seems too involved and likely to be too slow.

Moreover, even with CRT, division might still be tricky.

This seems too complicated for this problem.

Maybe I need to consider that for each step, the product is the product of the current array modulo m, and I can compute this by iteratively updating the product as I remove elements.

But I still need a way to update the product without division.

Wait, perhaps I can keep track of the product and the removed elements separately and compute the product at each step based on that.

But I'm going in circles here.

Let me look back at the sample input and output again to see if there's a pattern I'm missing.

In the first test case:

n=4, m=6, a=[3,1,4,2], s="LRRL"

- Initial product: 3*1*4*2=24 %6=0

- Remove 3, product:1*4*2=8%6=2

- Remove 2, product:1*4=4%6=4

- Remove 4, product:1%6=1

- Remove 1, product:0

Output:0,2,4,1

In the third test case:

n=6, m=8, a=[1,2,3,4,5,6], s="RLLLRR"

- Initial product:1*2*3*4*5*6=720%8=0

- Remove 6, product:1*2*3*4*5=120%8=0

- Remove 1, product:2*3*4*5=120%8=0

- Remove 2, product:3*4*5=60%8=4

- Remove 3, product:4*5=20%8=4

- Remove 4, product:5%8=5

- Remove 5, product:0

Wait, the sample output is 0,0,0,4,4,4, but according to my calculation, it should be 0,0,0,60%8=4,20%8=4,5%8=5,0.

But in the sample output, it's 0,0,0,4,4,4.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 3*4*5=60%8=4, 4*5=20%8=4, 5%8=5, empty=0.

But the sample output is 0,0,0,4,4,4.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the sample output or in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps when the array is empty, the product is considered 1, and 1 % m =1, but in the first test case, it's 0.

Wait, no, in the first test case, when the array is empty, the product is 0.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that for an empty array, the product is 1, but in the first test case, it's 0.

Wait, no, the problem says that for an empty array, the product is 1, but in the sample input, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps I misread.

Wait, the problem says:

"Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m. Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a, if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a."

And it's specified that after all commands, the array will be empty.

In the first test case, the last output is 1, which corresponds to the array having only one element, 1, and then removing it, resulting in an empty array with product 1 %6=1.

Wait, but in the note, it says:

- 1 mod 6 =1

- Remove 1, array is empty

- Product: 0

So, for the empty array, the product is 0.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says:

"Note that after each move, the length of the array decreases by 1, and after processing all commands, it will be empty."

"Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m."

But in the note, for the empty array, it's 0.

Wait, but in the first test case, the last output is 1, which corresponds to the array [1], product 1%6=1, then remove 1, array is empty, product 0.

So, in the sample output, it's 0,2,4,1, which corresponds to the empty array having product 0.

Wait, but in the explanation, it's said that for the empty array, the product is 1.

This is confusing.

Wait, let's check the problem statement again.

"Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m."

"After processing all commands, it will be empty."

So, for the empty array, the product is 1, but in the sample output, it's 0.

Wait, in the note, it says:

- Remove 1, array is empty

- 1 mod 6=1

- Then, the next product is 0 for the empty array.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, re-reading the note:

- Initial product: 3*1*4*2=24 mod6=0

- Remove 3, array [1,4,2], product 1*4*2=8 mod6=2

- Remove 2, array [1,4], product 1*4=4 mod6=4

- Remove 4, array [1], product 1 mod6=1

- Remove 1, array empty, product 0

So, the output is 0,2,4,1

Wait, but according to the problem statement, for the empty array, the product should be 1, but in the note, it's 0.

Wait, there's inconsistency here.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m."

"For an empty array, the product is considered to be 1."

But in the note, for the empty array, it's 0.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the note.

Wait, no, perhaps I misread.

Wait, in the note, it says:

- Remove 1, array is empty

- [nothing left to multiply, so product is 1, 1 mod6=1]

- Then, after removing 1, array is empty, product is 0.

Wait, perhaps the note is incorrect.

Wait, re-reading the note:

- Remove 1, array is empty

- [nothing left to multiply, so product is 1, 1 mod6=1]

- Then, after removing 1, array is empty, product is 0.

Wait, perhaps the note is trying to say that for the empty array, the product is 1, but in the output, it's 0.

This is confusing.
