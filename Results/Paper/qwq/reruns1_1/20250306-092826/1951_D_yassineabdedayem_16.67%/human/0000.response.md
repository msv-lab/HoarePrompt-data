Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Alice has n coins and wants to buy exactly k jewels from Bob's store. Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel ranging from 1 to 10^18 coins. Alice buys jewels greedily: she goes to each stall in order and buys as many jewels as she can with her remaining coins.

My task is to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that Alice ends up buying exactly k jewels. If it's possible, I need to output "YES", followed by the number of stalls and their respective prices. If it's not possible, I should output "NO".

First, I need to think about how Alice's buying behavior works. She goes to each stall in sequence and buys as many jewels as she can with her current coins. So, at each stall, she buys floor(coins / price) jewels, and then updates her coin count by subtracting the cost of those jewels.

Bob needs to set up the stalls and set the prices in such a way that this process results in Alice buying exactly k jewels.

Constraints:

- T (number of test cases) is up to 1000.

- N and K can be as large as 10^18.

- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

Given that T can be up to 1000 and N and K can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient solution, probably O(T * 60) or better.

Let me look at the example provided to understand better.

Example 1:

Input:

7 3

Output:

YES

10

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

Explanation:

At the first stall with price 2, Alice buys 3 jewels (since 7 // 2 = 3), but actually, 3 * 2 = 6, so she buys 3 jewels and is left with 1 coin. She can't buy any more jewels from the remaining stalls since the prices are higher than her remaining coins.

Wait, but according to the explanation, she buys 3 jewels only from the first stall and doesn't buy any from the others because she doesn't have enough coins left. So, total jewels bought are 3, which matches K=3.

Example 2:

Input:

6 4

Output:

NO

Presumably, there's no way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

Example 3:

Input:

255 8

Output:

YES

8

128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

Explanation:

Alice buys:

- 1 jewel from the first stall (128), left with 255 - 128 = 127 coins.

- 1 jewel from the second stall (64), left with 127 - 64 = 63 coins.

- 1 jewel from the third stall (32), left with 63 - 32 = 31 coins.

- 1 jewel from the fourth stall (16), left with 31 - 16 = 15 coins.

- 1 jewel from the fifth stall (8), left with 15 - 8 = 7 coins.

- 1 jewel from the sixth stall (4), left with 7 - 4 = 3 coins.

- 1 jewel from the seventh stall (2), left with 3 - 2 = 1 coin.

- 1 jewel from the eighth stall (1), left with 1 - 1 = 0 coins.

Total jewels bought: 8, which matches K=8.

From these examples, it seems that in the first case, Bob set up 10 stalls with increasing prices, and Alice bought all her jewels from the first stall, without being able to buy from the others due to insufficient coins left.

In the third case, Bob set up 8 stalls with decreasing prices, and Alice bought one jewel from each stall, spending all her coins.

In the second case, it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.

I need to find a general approach to determine if it's possible for Bob to set up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly K jewels with N coins.

Constraints mention that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. So, the number of stalls is limited to 60.

I need to think about how to distribute the prices of the stalls to control how many jewels Alice buys.

Let me consider that Alice buys jewels from each stall in sequence, buying as many as she can afford at that stall.

So, for each stall, the number of jewels she buys is floor(n / p), where p is the price of the jewel at that stall, and n is her current number of coins.

After buying from that stall, her remaining coins are n - (floor(n / p) * p).

She proceeds to the next stall with the remaining coins.

Bob needs to set up the stalls in such a way that the total jewels bought across all stalls is exactly K.

I need to find a sequence of at most 60 prices such that this process results in Alice buying exactly K jewels.

I need to find a way to partition K jewels into at most 60 stalls, where the way Alice buys is dependent on the prices set.

This seems like a problem of distributing K jewels into up to 60 groups, where each group corresponds to a stall, and the size of each group is determined by the price set for that stall and the coins Alice has at that point.

This sounds a bit tricky because the number of jewels Alice buys at each stall depends on both the price set and the coins she has at that moment, which changes after each stall.

I need to find a way to control the number of jewels bought at each stall by setting the prices appropriately.

Let me think about the simplest case: one stall.

If there's only one stall, Alice will buy floor(n / p) jewels, where p is the price.

So, to make her buy exactly K jewels, I can set p = floor(n / K). But, this might not work because n might not be divisible by p, and she might buy more or less than K jewels.

Wait, actually, if p = floor(n / K), then the number of jewels bought is floor(n / p), which could be greater than K.

For example, n=7, K=3:

p = floor(7/3) = 2

floor(7/2) = 3, which matches K=3.

But in another case, n=6, K=4:

p = floor(6/4) = 1

floor(6/1) = 6, which is more than K=4.

So, in this case, it's impossible because Alice would buy more jewels than desired.

So, setting p = floor(n / K) doesn't always work, especially when floor(n / p) > K.

Hence, I need a better strategy.

Maybe I need to set multiple stalls with decreasing prices so that Alice buys a certain number of jewels at each stall, accumulating to exactly K jewels.

Let me consider the third example:

n=255, K=8

Stalls: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1

At each stall, Alice buys one jewel, spending the price of the stall, and repeats until she has no coins left or has bought K jewels.

In this case, she buys one jewel from each of the eight stalls, totaling 8 jewels.

This seems like a binary search or greedy approach, where each stall corresponds to the largest possible price that Alice can afford with her remaining coins, buying one jewel per stall.

Wait, but in the first example, stalls have increasing prices, and Alice buys multiple jewels from the first stall.

So, perhaps there are different strategies for setting up the stalls.

I need to find a general method that works for any n and k, within the constraints.

Let me consider that Alice buys jewels in a way that maximizes the number of jewels bought, given the stall prices.

But in this problem, she buys as many as she can from each stall in sequence, so the stall prices need to be set in a way that she buys the desired number of jewels in total.

I need to think about how to set the prices so that the total jewels bought is exactly K.

One idea is to set the prices in decreasing order, like in the third example, so that Alice buys one jewel from each stall, until she has bought K jewels.

In that case, the prices would be the largest possible values that she can afford with her remaining coins, ensuring she buys one jewel per stall.

But in the first example, stalls have increasing prices, and Alice buys multiple jewels from the first stall.

So, perhaps there are multiple ways to set up the stalls to achieve the desired total.

I need to find a way to distribute the K jewels across up to 60 stalls, controlling how many jewels are bought at each stall via the price set.

Let me try to model this.

Let's say Bob sets up s stalls, with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, then updates her coins to n1 = n - (floor(n / p1) * p1).

Then, she buys floor(n1 / p2) jewels from the second stall, updates her coins to n2 = n1 - (floor(n1 / p2) * p2), and so on.

The total jewels bought is sum over i from 1 to s of floor(n_{i-1} / p_i), where n_{i-1} is the coins before entering stall i.

Bob needs to choose s <= 60, and p1, p2, ..., ps such that this sum equals K.

I need to find such s and p1, p2, ..., ps.

This seems complicated because of the dependencies between the stalls.

Maybe I can approach this iteratively: set up one stall at a time, calculate how many jewels Alice would buy from that stall, update the remaining coins, and proceed to the next stall.

I need to ensure that after setting up s stalls, the total jewels bought is exactly K.

But with s up to 60, and n and k up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Initialize total_jewels = 0

- Initialize stall_count = 0

- While total_jewels < K and stall_count < 60 and n > 0:

- Choose a price p for the next stall

- Calculate how many jewels Alice can buy from this stall: m = floor(n / p)

- If m > 0:

- Add m to total_jewels

- Update n = n - m * p

- Increment stall_count

- If total_jewels == K:

- Output "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices

- Else:

- Output "NO"

The challenge is to choose the prices p in such a way that total_jewels reaches exactly K.

But how to choose p?

One naive way is to set p=1 always, which would make Alice buy n jewels from the first stall, but that might be more or less than K.

Another way is to set p such that she buys a specific number of jewels from each stall.

But since the number of jewels bought depends on n and p, it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can set p such that at each stall, Alice buys a certain number of jewels, and sum them up to K.

But I need to ensure that the sum equals K exactly.

Let me consider that at each stall, I want Alice to buy a certain number of jewels, say x_i, such that sum(x_i) = K.

Then, for each stall, I can set p_i = ceil(n / x_i), but I need to make sure that floor(n / p_i) = x_i.

Wait, floor(n / p_i) = x_i implies that p_i = floor(n / x_i), but that might not give exactly x_i jewels.

Wait, actually, floor(n / p_i) = x_i implies that p_i >= ceil(n / (x_i + 1)) and p_i <= floor(n / x_i)

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that at each stall, Alice buys as many jewels as possible, given the price p.

I need to choose p such that the total jewels bought across all stalls is exactly K.

An alternative approach is to consider that Alice buys jewels in decreasing order of stall prices, similar to the third example.

Set p1 > p2 > ... > ps, so that Alice buys one jewel from each stall, until she has bought K jewels.

In the third example, p1=128, p2=64, ..., p8=1.

Alice buys one jewel from each stall, totaling 8 jewels.

This works when p1 > p2 > ... > ps, and p1 <= n, p2 <= n - p1, and so on.

But in the first example, p1=2, p2=3, ..., p10=11, and Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, different strategies can be used based on the values of n and k.

I need a general method.

Let me consider that for each stall, I can choose p such that Alice buys a certain number of jewels, and I need to accumulate exactly K jewels.

I need to make sure that the sum of jewels bought from each stall equals K.

This seems like a partitioning problem, where I need to partition K jewels into up to 60 parts, with each part being the number of jewels bought from a stall, and constrained by the stall's price and Alice's coins.

This is getting too abstract.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in algorithms, sometimes we use a greedy approach to solve such problems.

Maybe I can use a greedy algorithm to set the prices in a way that Alice buys the desired number of jewels.

Let me consider starting with the highest possible price and decreasing it.

Wait, perhaps I should consider binary search.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of binary representation.

In the third example, the prices are powers of 2, decreasing from 128 to 1.

This allows Alice to buy one jewel from each stall, effectively turning her coin amount binary-wise.

But in the first example, it's different.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the binary representation of n and k.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think differently.

Suppose Bob sets up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

Alice buys floor(n / p1) jewels from the first stall, then floor((n - floor(n / p1)*p1) / p2) from the second, and so on.

I need the sum of these floor divisions to equal K.

This seems like a problem where I need to solve for p1, p2, ..., ps given n and K.

This is complex because of the dependencies between the p's.

Maybe I can decouple this by setting the p's in a specific way.

Let me consider setting p1 = floor(n / K), p2 = floor((n - floor(n / p1)*p1) / (K - floor(n / p1))), and so on.

But this seems too vague and may not lead to the correct solution.

Let me consider an optimization approach.

I need to minimize the number of stalls, but since s can be up to 60, and t up to 1000, I need an efficient way.

Wait, no, s can be up to 60 for each test case.

I need to make sure that the total time is acceptable.

Let me consider that for each test case, I can try to set up to 60 stalls, choosing prices in a way that allows Alice to buy the desired number of jewels.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can iterate and at each step, decide how many jewels Alice should buy from the current stall.

Then, set the price accordingly.

For example:

Initialize remaining_jewels = K

Initialize remaining_coins = N

stall_prices = []

while remaining_jewels > 0 and len(stall_prices) < 60 and remaining_coins > 0:

# Choose how many jewels to buy from this stall

# Let's say we buy m jewels from this stall

# Then, p = floor(remaining_coins / m)

# But need to ensure that floor(remaining_coins / p) = m

# Which implies that p = floor(remaining_coins / m)

# And remaining_coins -= m * p

# And remaining_jewels -= m

# Need to choose m such that m <= remaining_jewels

# And m <= floor(remaining_coins / p)

# But this seems circular.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose p first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set p such that Alice buys exactly m jewels from this stall.

To set p such that floor(remaining_coins / p) = m, I need p to satisfy:

p <= remaining_coins / m < p + 1

Which implies:

p <= floor(remaining_coins / m)

and

p >= ceil(remaining_coins / (m + 1))

Wait, actually, floor(remaining_coins / p) = m

This implies:

m <= remaining_coins / p < m + 1

Which is:

remaining_coins / (m + 1) < p <= remaining_coins / m

So, p should be in (remaining_coins / (m + 1), remaining_coins / m]

But p must be an integer >=1.

So, for p to be valid, the interval (remaining_coins / (m + 1), remaining_coins / m] should contain integers.

If remaining_coins / (m + 1) < p <= remaining_coins / m

Then, p can be set to any integer in this range.

So, for a chosen m, if remaining_coins / (m + 1) < p <= remaining_coins / m has integers, then p can be set accordingly.

But choosing m is tricky.

I need to choose m such that this interval contains integers, and also m <= remaining_jewels.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to choose p first and then compute m.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate over possible m and see if a p exists in the required range.

But this seems inefficient.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I set up stalls with decreasing prices, similar to the third example.

Set p1 > p2 > ... > ps

Then, Alice buys one jewel from each stall, provided that p_i <= remaining_coins.

In this way, she buys one jewel from each stall, up to s stalls, provided that s <= K and sum of p_i <= N.

But in the third example, s=8, K=8, and sum of p_i =128+64+...+1=255=N.

So, it works.

But in the first example, s=10, K=3, with p1=2, p2=3,...,p10=11.

Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall and nothing from the others.

So, two different strategies.

I need a general method that can handle both cases.

Let me consider that in some cases, it's better to have a single stall with p set such that floor(n / p) = k.

But as we've seen, this doesn't always work.

So, perhaps I need to set up multiple stalls to fine-tune the number of jewels bought.

Let me think about the conditions under which it's possible.

If n < k, it's impossible because Alice can't buy more jewels than she has coins.

Wait, no, if p=1, she can buy up to n jewels.

Wait, but p >=1.

So, if p=1, she can buy up to n jewels.

But if k > n, it's impossible because she can't buy more jewels than her coins allow, even if p=1.

Wait, no, if p=1, she can buy up to n jewels.

But if k > n, she can't buy more than n jewels.

Hence, if k > n, it's impossible.

Similarly, if k=0, which is not possible since k is positive.

So, a basic condition is that k <= n.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6, k=4, which satisfies k <=n, but it's "NO".

So, there must be more constraints.

Hence, k <=n is necessary but not sufficient.

I need to find additional conditions.

Let me consider the minimal number of stalls required.

In the third example, s=8, k=8, n=255.

In the first example, s=10, k=3, n=7.

In the second example, s=up to 60, k=4, n=6, and it's "NO".

So, perhaps there are some mathematical relations between n and k that determine feasibility.

Let me consider that in the first example, n=7, k=3.

Bob sets up 10 stalls with prices 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Alice buys 3 jewels from the first stall (7//2=3, spends 6 coins, left with 1 coin), and can't buy from any other stall because p_i >1.

Total jewels bought:3, which matches k=3.

In the second example, n=6, k=4.

Is there a way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels?

Let's try:

Suppose s=2, p1=2, p2=1.

At p1=2, Alice buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels:3.

Not enough.

Try p1=3, p2=1.

At p1=3, buys 2 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels:2.

Still not enough.

Try p1=1, p2=1.

At p1=1, buys 6 jewels, spends 6 coins.

Total jewels:6, which is more than k=4.

Not acceptable.

Try s=3, p1=2, p2=2, p3=1.

At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels:3.

Not enough.

Try p1=2, p2=1, p3=1.

At p1=2, buys 3 jewels, spends 6 coins, left with 0 coins.

Total jewels:3.

Not enough.

Try p1=1, p2=2, p3=1.

At p1=1, buys 6 jewels, spends 6 coins.

Total jewels:6.

Too many.

Seems like there's no way to get exactly 4 jewels with any number of stalls up to 60.

Hence, "NO".

So, in this case, it's impossible.

Now, I need a general way to determine if it's possible for any n and k.

Let me consider that the minimal number of stalls required is ceil(k / m), where m is the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from a single stall.

But m is floor(n / p), and p >=1.

So, m <= n.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that the total number of jewels bought is the sum of floor(n / p1), floor(n - floor(n / p1)*p1 / p2), and so on.

This is too dependent on the specific values of p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the total number of jewels Alice can buy is less than or equal to n, since each jewel costs at least 1 coin.

Also, it's possible to make Alice buy exactly n jewels by setting p=1 for one stall.

But in some cases, like the second example, even though n >=k, it's impossible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels.

Hence, there must be some other constraints.

Let me think about the minimal and maximal number of jewels Alice can buy.

Minimal is 1 (if p=n), maximal is n (if p=1).

Hence, k must be between 1 and n, inclusive.

But in the second example, k=4, n=6, which satisfies 1 <= k <=n, but it's impossible.

So, there must be more to it.

Let me consider that the number of jewels Alice buys is determined by how the stalls are set up.

I need to find a way to partition the coins in such a way that the total jewels bought are exactly k.

This sounds like a problem related to partitioning, but it's more complex due to the floor divisions involved.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I set up s stalls with prices p1, p2, ..., ps.

I need to choose p1, p2, ..., ps such that sum(floor(n / p_i)) = k.

This is similar to finding s numbers p_i such that floor(n / p_i) sums to k.

This seems difficult, but perhaps I can iterate and choose p_i in a way that controls the number of jewels bought at each step.

Let me consider starting with p1 = ceil(n / k).

Wait, but p must be an integer >=1.

Wait, perhaps p1 = ceil(n / k).

Then, floor(n / p1) is the number of jewels bought from the first stall.

Then, update n = n - floor(n / p1) * p1.

Set k = k - floor(n / p1).

Repeat this process until k=0 or n=0.

If k=0, then it's possible.

Else, it's not.

Wait, but in the second example, n=6, k=4.

Set p1 = ceil(6 / 4) = 2.

floor(6 / 2) = 3.

Update n = 6 - 3*2 = 0.

k = 4 - 3 =1.

But n=0, k=1, which is impossible.

Hence, "NO".

In the first example, n=7, k=3.

Set p1 = ceil(7 / 3) = 3.

floor(7 / 3) = 2.

Update n = 7 - 2*3 =1.

k =3 -2=1.

Set p2 = ceil(1 /1)=1.

floor(1 /1)=1.

Update n =1 -1*1=0.

k=1-1=0.

Hence, total jewels bought:3.

So, "YES", with s=2, p1=3, p2=1.

But in the first test case, s=10 is used, but s=2 is sufficient.

So, perhaps multiple solutions exist.

In the third example, n=255, k=8.

Set p1=ceil(255/8)=32.

floor(255 /32)=7.

Update n=255 -7*32=255-224=31.

k=8-7=1.

Set p2=ceil(31 /1)=31.

floor(31 /31)=1.

Update n=31-1*31=0.

k=1-1=0.

Hence, "YES", with s=2, p1=32, p2=31.

But in the example, s=8 is used, which is also valid.

So, it seems that this approach works.

Hence, I can implement this approach:

- While k >0 and n >0 and s <60:

- Set p = ceil(n / k)

- m = floor(n / p)

- If m >0:

- Add p to the list of prices

- Update n = n - m * p

- Update k = k - m

- Increment s

- If k ==0:

- Output "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices

- Else:

- Output "NO"

But I need to make sure that p is an integer between 1 and 10^18.

Also, s <=60.

In the second example, n=6, k=4:

- p1=ceil(6/4)=2

- m=floor(6/2)=3

- n=6-3*2=0

- k=4-3=1

- p2=ceil(0/1)=0, which is invalid (p >=1)

- Hence, "NO"

In the first example:

- p1=ceil(7/3)=3

- m=floor(7/3)=2

- n=7-2*3=1

- k=3-2=1

- p2=ceil(1/1)=1

- m=floor(1/1)=1

- n=1-1*1=0

- k=1-1=0

- "YES", with s=2, p1=3, p2=1

In the third example:

- p1=ceil(255/8)=32

- m=floor(255/32)=7

- n=255-7*32=255-224=31

- k=8-7=1

- p2=ceil(31/1)=31

- m=floor(31/31)=1

- n=31-1*31=0

- k=1-1=0

- "YES", with s=2, p1=32, p2=31

This matches the first test case's outcome.

Hence, this seems to be a correct approach.

I need to implement this logic, making sure that s does not exceed 60.

Also, handle the cases where k >n or other edge cases.

Let me think about the implementation.

I need to handle large numbers, up to 10^18, so I need to use integer types that can handle large numbers, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.

I need to read t test cases, each with n and k.

For each test case, perform the above procedure.

Also, in the output, if "YES", print the number of stalls and then the prices.

The prices can be printed in any order, as long as the total jewels bought are k.

In the above approach, the stalls are set up sequentially, so the order matters.

But in the problem, the order of stalls is important because Alice buys from them in sequence.

Hence, I need to make sure that the prices are set in such a way that Alice buys the desired number of jewels in sequence.

In the above approach, since we're setting p1, then p2, etc., in sequence, it should work.

Let me consider if there are any cases where this approach fails.

Suppose n=5, k=2.

- p1=ceil(5/2)=3

- m=floor(5/3)=1

- n=5-3=2

- k=2-1=1

- p2=ceil(2/1)=2

- m=floor(2/2)=1

- n=2-2=0

- k=1-1=0

- "YES", with s=2, p1=3, p2=2

Total jewels bought:1 from p1 and 1 from p2, totaling 2, which matches k=2.

Another case: n=10, k=3.

- p1=ceil(10/3)=4

- m=floor(10/4)=2

- n=10-8=2

- k=3-2=1

- p2=ceil(2/1)=2

- m=floor(2/2)=1

- n=2-2=0

- k=1-1=0

- "YES", with s=2, p1=4, p2=2

Total jewels bought:2 from p1 and 1 from p2, totaling 3, which matches k=3.

Seems correct.

Another case: n=1, k=1.

- p1=ceil(1/1)=1

- m=floor(1/1)=1

- n=1-1=0

- k=1-1=0

- "YES", with s=1, p1=1

Total jewels bought:1, which matches k=1.

Edge case: n=1, k=0.

But k is at least 1, as per constraints.

Another edge case: n=1, k=1.

As above, "YES".

Another edge case: n=1, k=2.

- p1=ceil(1/2)=1

- m=floor(1/1)=1

- n=1-1=0

- k=2-1=1

- p2=ceil(0/1)=0, invalid

- "NO"

Correct, since it's impossible.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Now, I need to implement this logic in code.

I need to make sure that s does not exceed 60.

In the above cases, s was small, but in some cases, s might be larger.

I need to ensure that s <=60.

If s >60, then output "NO".

But in the above approach, s is minimized, so it should be fine.

Let me think about the time complexity.

For each test case, in the worst case, s could be up to 60, and for each stall, I perform constant time operations.

Hence, total time should be acceptable.

Now, let's look at the provided code and see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

(n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

rep = 0

number = 0

tab = []

while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:

(Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))

if Max == k and n * Min <= k:

number = Min

k = k - Max

else:

number = Max

k = k - Min

tab.append(str(number))

n -= Min * Max

rep += 1

if k == 0:

print('YES')

print(len(tab))

for i in tab:

print(i, end=' ')

else:

print('NO')

This seems to be attempting to implement the logic I described, but it's a bit confusing.

Let's see.

It has a while loop that runs while n !=0 and k >0 and rep <60 and n >=k.

Inside the loop, it calculates Min and Max as follows:

Min = min(n // k, k)

Max = max(int(n / k), k)

Then, it checks if Max == k and n * Min <= k:

number = Min

k = k - Max

else:

number = Max

k = k - Min

tab.append(str(number))

n -= Min * Max

rep +=1

Finally, if k ==0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices.

Otherwise, "NO".

I need to verify if this implements the correct logic.

First, Min = min(n // k, k)

Max = max(int(n / k), k)

Wait, int(n / k) is the same as n // k in Python, since n and k are integers.

So, Max = max(n // k, k)

Then, if Max == k and n * Min <=k:

number = Min

k = k - Max

else:

number = Max

k = k - Min

tab.append(str(number))

n -= Min * Max

rep +=1

This seems different from the logic I described.

In my logic, I set p = ceil(n / k), then m = floor(n / p), then update n and k accordingly.

In this code, it's choosing a "number" based on Min and Max, and updating k and n using Min and Max.

I need to see if this achieves the same result.

In the first test case:

n=7, k=3

Min = min(7//3,3) = min(2,3)=2

Max = max(7//3,3)= max(2,3)=3

Since Max ==3 and n*Min=7*2=14 <=k=3? 14 <=3? No, so else clause:

number = Max=3

k = k - Min=3-2=1

tab.append('3')

n -= Min*Max=7-2*3=7-6=1

rep=1

Now, n=1, k=1, rep=1 <60, n >=k=1

Min = min(1//1,1)=min(1,1)=1

Max = max(1//1,1)=max(1,1)=1

Max ==1 and n*Min=1*1=1 <=k=1, which is true.

So, number = Min=1

k = k - Max=1-1=0

tab.append('1')

n -= Min*Max=1-1*1=0

rep=2

Now, k=0, so "YES", s=2, prices [3,1]

Which matches the first test case's possible solution.

In the second test case:

n=6, k=4

Min = min(6//4,4)=min(1,4)=1

Max = max(6//4,4)=max(1,4)=4

Max ==4 and n*Min=6*1=6 <=k=4? No, so else clause:

number = Max=4

k = k - Min=4-1=3

tab.append('4')

n -= Min*Max=6-1*4=6-4=2

rep=1

Now, n=2, k=3, rep=1 <60, n >=k? 2 >=3? No, so exit loop.

k !=0, so "NO"

Which matches the second test case.

In the third test case:

n=255, k=8

Min = min(255//8,8)=min(31,8)=8

Max = max(255//8,8)=max(31,8)=31

Max ==31 and n*Min=255*8=2040 <=k=8? No, so else clause:

number = Max=31

k = k - Min=8-8=0

tab.append('31')

n -= Min*Max=255-8*31=255-248=7

rep=1

Now, k=0, so "YES", s=1, prices [31]

But in the example, s=8 with prices [128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1]

But according to this, s=1 with p1=31 would also work.

Wait, but in this case, with s=1, p1=31:

Alice buys floor(255 /31)=8 jewels, spends 8*31=248 coins, left with 7 coins.

Total jewels bought:8, which matches k=8.

Hence, it's a valid solution, although the example used s=8.

So, the code seems to be correct.

But in the first test case, it outputs s=2 with p1=3, p2=1, but in the sample output, s=10 with p1=2 to p10=11.

But both are valid solutions, so it's acceptable.

Hence, the code seems to be correct.

But I need to make sure that it always works.

In the earlier manual simulation, I used p1=ceil(n /k), but in this code, it's using Min and Max based on floor divisions.

But apparently, it achieves the same result.

Hence, the code is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific pricing to ensure that Alice buys exactly k jewels using her n coins. Alice buys jewels greedily from each stall, purchasing as many jewels as possible with her remaining coins.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Alice's Buying Behavior**:
   - Alice visits each stall in sequence and buys as many jewels as possible with her current coins.
   - The number of jewels bought at each stall is `floor(coins / price)`.

2. **Setting Up Stalls**:
   - We need to set up stalls with prices such that the total jewels bought across all stalls equals exactly k.
   - We use an iterative approach to set up stalls, choosing prices that control the number of jewels Alice buys at each stall.

3. **Iterative Stall Setup**:
   - We repeatedly set up stalls while ensuring that Alice can still buy more jewels and we haven't exceeded the maximum number of stalls (60).
   - For each stall, we calculate a price that allows us to fine-tune the number of jewels Alice buys.

4. **Check Feasibility**:
   - If we manage to make Alice buy exactly k jewels within 60 stalls, we output "YES" along with the stall setup.
   - If it's not possible to make Alice buy exactly k jewels, we output "NO".

## Solution Code

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        rep = 0
        number = 0
        tab = []
        while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
            Min = min(n // k, k)
            Max = max(n // k, k)
            if Max == k and n * Min <= k:
                number = Min
                k -= Max
            else:
                number = Max
                k -= Min
            tab.append(str(number))
            n -= Min * Max
            rep += 1
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            print(' '.join(tab))
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the values of n (coins) and k (desired jewels).

- **Stall Setup Logic**:
  - Use a loop to set up stalls iteratively.
  - Calculate `Min` as the minimum of `n // k` and k.
  - Calculate `Max` as the maximum of `n // k` and k.
  - Decide the number of jewels to buy from the current stall based on conditions involving Min and Max.
  - Update the remaining coins and desired jewels accordingly.

- **Output**:
  - If exactly k jewels are bought within constraints, output "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices.
  - Otherwise, output "NO".

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the feasibility of making Alice buy exactly k jewels within the given constraints.
