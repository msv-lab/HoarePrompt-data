Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, x and y, of the same length, and they're made up of digits from 1 to 9. I can swap the i-th digit of x with the i-th digit of y any number of times, and I need to maximize the product of x and y after these swaps.

First, I need to understand what swapping digits means in this context. For example, if x is 73 and y is 31, swapping the second digits gives me x as 71 and y as 33. The product before swapping is 73 * 31 = 2263, and after swapping, it's 71 * 33 = 2343, which is larger. So, swapping improved the product in this case.

I need to find a way to decide which digits to swap to maximize the product. Since I can swap any number of times, I should look for a strategy that systematically improves the product.

One approach is to consider that multiplying two numbers is larger when both numbers are as large as possible. So, I should try to make both x and y as large as possible individually. However, since I'm swapping digits between x and y, increasing one might not always increase the other.

Wait, actually, since I'm swapping the same position in both numbers, it's a direct swap between the two. So, for each position, I can choose to swap or not, and I need to decide based on how that affects the overall product.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let me think about the properties of the numbers. Since they're of the same length, I can consider their digits in positions from left to right.

Perhaps I should sort the digits of x and y in some way to maximize their product.

Let me recall that for two numbers with the same number of digits, to maximize their product, it's often beneficial to make both numbers as large as possible in a combined sense.

But how do I do that by swapping corresponding digits between x and y?

Maybe I should consider each pair of digits at the same position and decide whether swapping them would lead to a higher product.

Let's consider an example to get some intuition.

Take x = 73 and y = 31.

If I look at the first digits: 7 and 3. Swapping them would make x = 33 and y = 71. The product is 33 * 71 = 2343, which is larger than the original 73 * 31 = 2263.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, swapping the second digits gives 71 and 33, which is the same as what I just did. Hmm.

Wait, no, in the problem's example, they swapped the second digits, not the first. Let's clarify that.

Original: x = 73, y = 31.

Swapping second digits: x becomes 71, y becomes 33.

Product: 71 * 33 = 2343.

Original product: 73 * 31 = 2263.

So, swapping improved the product.

Another test case: x = 2, y = 5.

Swapping the only digit: x becomes 5, y becomes 2.

Product before: 2 * 5 = 10.

After swapping: 5 * 2 = 10.

Same product.

So, in this case, swapping doesn't change the product.

Another test case: x = 3516, y = 3982.

If I swap all corresponding digits, I get x = 3982, y = 3516.

Product before: 3516 * 3982 = let's not calculate, but see what the proposed answer is.

In the sample output, it's 3912 and 3586.

Let's see what their product is compared to the original.

But to verify, I need to calculate both products.

But since it's a large number, I'll trust the sample output for now.

So, in this case, swapping some digits improved the product.

From these examples, it seems that swapping digits where x's digit is smaller than y's digit at the same position can potentially increase the product.

Wait, in the first example, x = 73, y = 31.

At position 1: x=7, y=3. Since 7 > 3, no swap.

At position 2: x=3, y=1. Since 3 > 1, no swap.

But in the sample explanation, they swapped the second digits.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the overall effect on the product.

Alternatively, perhaps I should sort the digits in x and y in a specific way.

Wait, but I can only swap corresponding digits, not rearrange digits within the numbers.

This is an important constraint.

So, I can't rearrange the digits within x or y; I can only swap digits at the same positions between x and y.

So, for each position, I can choose to swap or not.

My goal is to decide for each position whether swapping will lead to a higher product.

But deciding this for each position independently might not be straightforward, as the digits interact in the overall product.

Perhaps I need to consider the impact on the product for each position.

Let me think about the mathematical expression for the product.

Suppose x and y are two numbers with digits x1, x2, ..., xn and y1, y2, ..., yn respectively.

Then, the product P = x * y.

If I swap the i-th digits, getting new numbers x' and y', then the new product P' = x' * y'.

I need to compare P' with P and see if P' > P.

But directly comparing P' and P for each possible swap seems computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to 100.

I need a smarter way to decide whether to swap a particular pair of digits.

Let's consider the effect of swapping a single pair of digits.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I swap their i-th digits to get x' and y'.

I need to compare x' * y' with x * y.

Let's denote the original digits as xi and yi, and after swapping, they become xi' = yi and yi' = xi.

Assuming that the other digits remain the same, the change in the product can be expressed in terms of the difference caused by this swap.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to think differently.

Another approach: since multiplication is commutative and associative, perhaps there's a way to model this problem to maximize the product by choosing whether to swap each pair of digits.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think of x and y as vectors of their digits, and try to find a way to maximize the product of the two numbers represented by these vectors, given that I can swap corresponding elements.

But this still seems abstract.

Let me consider the significance of digits in the numbers.

The leftmost digits are more significant than the rightmost ones.

So, for higher positions, the digits have a bigger impact on the overall value of the number.

Therefore, perhaps I should prioritize making the higher digits as large as possible.

But since I have to consider both x and y together, I need to balance making both numbers as large as possible.

Wait, maybe I can consider sorting the digits in each position and assigning them to x and y in a way that maximizes the product.

But again, I can only swap corresponding digits, not rearrange digits across different positions.

So, that seems not directly applicable.

Let me consider the following strategy:

For each position, if swapping the digits at that position increases the product, then swap; else, don't swap.

But determining whether swapping a particular pair increases the product might still be complex.

Is there a simpler rule I can follow?

Let me consider the relative values of the digits at each position.

Suppose, for a given position, xi and yi, if xi > yi, then keeping them as is might be better, but I need to confirm this.

Wait, in the first example, xi=7, yi=3; since 7 > 3, keeping them gives x=73, y=31, product 2263.

If I swap, x=33, y=71, product 2343, which is larger.

So, in this case, swapping even though xi > yi led to a higher product.

This contradicts the idea of keeping xi > yi.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the overall effect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should swap the digits if and only if xi < yi.

Wait, in the first example, xi=7 > yi=3, but swapping improved the product.

So, that doesn't hold.

Another thought: maybe I should swap the digits if swapping makes the overall numbers closer to each other, because the product is maximized when the two numbers are as equal as possible.

Wait, but in the first example, swapping made x=71 and y=33, which are closer than x=73 and y=31, since 73-31=42 and 71-33=38.

So, the difference decreased.

But in the second example, x=2 and y=5; swapping gives x=5 and y=2, which are farther apart, but the product remains the same.

Wait, but in this case, the product didn't change.

So, maybe making the numbers closer doesn't always maximize the product.

Wait, actually, for two numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal.

But in this problem, the sum of the digits in x and y is fixed, but it's not exactly the same as fixing the sum of the numbers.

Because I can only swap corresponding digits, not rearrange the digits freely.

So, perhaps I should aim to make x and y as equal as possible by swapping digits where one is smaller and the other is larger.

But in the first example, swapping made them closer, and the product increased.

In the second example, swapping made them farther apart, but the product stayed the same.

Wait, but in the second example, both numbers are single digits, so swapping doesn't change the product.

Wait, x=2, y=5; swapping gives x=5, y=2; product remains 10.

So, in that case, it doesn't matter.

In the first example, swapping made the product larger.

Maybe there's a pattern here.

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, with digits x1, x2, ..., xn and y1, y2, ..., yn.

I can swap xi with yi for each i independently.

I need to decide for each i whether to swap xi and yi to maximize the product.

This sounds like a greedy algorithm, where for each position, I decide whether swapping increases the product or not.

But implementing this directly would require calculating the change in product for each swap, which is time-consuming for large n.

I need a smarter way to decide for each position whether to swap or not.

Let me consider the impact of swapping a single pair of digits.

Suppose I have two numbers, x and y, and I swap their i-th digits.

Let me denote the original x and y as:

x = x1 * 10^{n-1} + x2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + xi * 10^{n-i} + ... + xn * 10^0

y = y1 * 10^{n-1} + y2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + yi * 10^{n-i} + ... + yn * 10^0

After swapping the i-th digits, x' and y' become:

x' = x1 * 10^{n-1} + ... + yi * 10^{n-i} + ... + xn * 10^0

y' = y1 * 10^{n-1} + ... + xi * 10^{n-i} + ... + yn * 10^0

The difference in the product is:

P' - P = (x' * y') - (x * y)

I need to find when P' - P > 0, i.e., when swapping increases the product.

But calculating this difference directly seems complicated.

Perhaps I can approximate or find a condition based on the digits involved.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to sort the digits in x and y in a specific order to maximize the product.

Wait, but I can only swap corresponding digits, not rearrange the digits within x or y.

So, that seems not directly applicable.

Let me consider the following approach:

Iterate through the digits from the most significant to the least significant.

At each position, decide whether to swap the digits or not, based on some condition.

The condition should be such that it leads to the maximum possible product.

Given that higher digits are more significant, perhaps I should prioritize making the higher digits as large as possible.

But since I have two numbers, I need to balance between making both numbers as large as possible.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of which digit, xi or yi, is larger, and decide based on that.

Let me consider that.

Suppose, for a given position i, xi > yi.

If I swap them, x becomes smaller in that position, and y becomes larger.

But since x has a larger digit in that position originally, swapping would make x smaller and y larger.

But whether this increases or decreases the product depends on the relative magnitudes and positions.

This is getting too vague.

Let me look for another strategy.

Perhaps I can consider the difference in the products caused by swapping each pair of digits, and decide based on that.

But as mentioned earlier, this might be too time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to sort the digits in x and y in a specific order to maximize the product.

Wait, but again, I can only swap corresponding digits, not rearrange the digits within the numbers.

So, that seems not directly applicable.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix all swaps except for one position.

Then, I can decide whether to swap that position based on how it affects the product.

But this seems too involved.

Is there a pattern or rule that can help me decide for each position whether to swap or not?

Let me consider the following heuristic:

- For each position, if swapping makes the overall x and y larger in a combined sense, then swap.

But I need a more concrete condition.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the following:

- If xi < yi, then swapping increases x and decreases y, but the impact on the product depends on the magnitudes.

- If xi > yi, swapping decreases x and increases y.

- If xi == yi, no need to swap.

But since all digits are from 1 to 9, and the numbers are of the same length, I need a way to decide based on the positions.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that multiplying two numbers is equivalent to summing the products of their digits in respective positions, considering their place values.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the logarithm of the product, which is the sum of the logarithms of the numbers.

So, log(P) = log(x) + log(y)

To maximize P, I need to maximize log(x) + log(y).

But I'm not sure if that helps in deciding the swaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the ratio of x and y.

But that seems unrelated.

Maybe I should look for patterns in the sample inputs and outputs.

In the first sample:

Input:

3

73

31

2

5

3516

3982

Output:

71

33

5

2

3912

3586

So, for the first test case, swapping the second digits of 73 and 31 gives 71 and 33, which has a larger product.

For the second test case, swapping the only digits of 2 and 5 gives 5 and 2, which has the same product as before.

For the third test case, the output is 3912 and 3586, which presumably has a larger product than the original 3516 and 3982.

Wait, let's check that.

Calculate original product: 3516 * 3982.

Calculate new product: 3912 * 3586.

I don't have a calculator right now, but assuming the sample output is correct, the new product is larger.

So, perhaps there's a pattern here.

Looking at the third test case:

x = 3516

y = 3982

After swapping some digits, x = 3912, y = 3586.

Comparing digit by digit:

Position 1: x=3, y=3 -> no swap

Position 2: x=5, y=9 -> swap to get x=9, y=5

Position 3: x=1, y=8 -> swap to get x=8, y=1

Position 4: x=6, y=2 -> swap to get x=2, y=6

So, in positions where xi < yi, swap, and where xi >= yi, don't swap.

Wait, in position 2: x=5 < y=9 -> swap

Position 3: x=1 < y=8 -> swap

Position 4: x=6 > y=2 -> don't swap, but in the sample, they swapped.

Wait, in the sample, they swapped position 4 as well.

Wait, in the output, x=3912 and y=3586.

So, position 4: x=2, y=6 -> swapped from x=6, y=2.

So, they swapped position 4 even though x=6 > y=2.

This contradicts the idea of swapping when xi < yi.

Hmm.

So, perhaps the rule is not simply to swap when xi < yi.

Alternatively, maybe it's to swap when the product increases by doing so.

But that's what I'm trying to figure out.

Perhaps I need to consider the impact on the overall product.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following:

For each position, swapping xi and yi changes the product by a factor of (yi * 10^k + (x - xi * 10^k)) * (xi * 10^k + (y - yi * 10^k))) / (xi * 10^k + (x - xi * 10^k)) / (yi * 10^k + (y - yi * 10^k)))

But this seems too complicated.

There must be a simpler way.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I fix all swaps except for one position.

Then, I can decide whether to swap that position based on how it affects the product.

But even that seems too involved.

Maybe I need to look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that I can model this as maximizing the sum of the products of the digits in each position, considering their place values.

Wait, but multiplication is not linear like addition.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that to maximize x * y, I need to maximize the sum of the products of the digits in each position, weighted by their place values.

But again, multiplication is not additive.

This is tricky.

Maybe I should look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that since I can only swap corresponding digits, perhaps I can treat each position independently and decide based on some condition.

Wait, but as we've seen, the decisions for different positions may interfere with each other.

So, maybe I need to consider pairs of digits and make decisions accordingly.

This is getting too convoluted.

Perhaps I should look for a different strategy.

Let me consider the following:

- Start by not swapping any digits.

- Then, for each position, consider swapping it and see if the product increases.

- If it does, swap it; otherwise, keep it as is.

But this would require calculating the product multiple times, which is inefficient for large numbers.

I need something smarter.

Wait, maybe I can consider the difference in the product caused by swapping each pair of digits.

Let's try to derive a formula for that.

Let me denote:

Let’s say we have two numbers x and y, and we swap their i-th digits.

Let’s denote the place value of the i-th digit as p = 10^{n-i}, where n is the number of digits.

Original x: x = x1 * p1 + x2 * p2 + ... + xi * p + ... + xn * p_n

Original y: y = y1 * p1 + y2 * p2 + ... + yi * p + ... + yn * p_n

After swapping the i-th digits:

x' = x - xi * p + yi * p

y' = y - yi * p + xi * p

So, x' = x + (yi - xi) * p

y' = y + (xi - yi) * p

Then, the new product is:

P' = x' * y' = (x + (yi - xi) * p) * (y + (xi - yi) * p)

Expanding this:

P' = x*y + x*(xi - yi)*p + y*(yi - xi)*p + (yi - xi)^2 * p^2

Simplify:

P' = x*y + (x*(xi - yi) - y*(xi - yi))*p + (yi - xi)^2 * p^2

P' = x*y + (xi - yi)*(x - y)*p + (yi - xi)^2 * p^2

P' = x*y + (xi - yi)*(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)^2 * p^2

Now, the difference P' - P is:

P' - P = (xi - yi)*(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)^2 * p^2

Factor out (xi - yi):

P' - P = (xi - yi) * [(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)*p^2]

Now, to decide whether to swap, I need P' - P > 0.

So, (xi - yi) * [(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)*p^2] > 0

This inequality can be used to decide whether to swap or not.

But this seems quite complex to evaluate for each position.

Moreover, for large numbers, calculating x and y at each step is not feasible.

I need a simpler way.

Perhaps I can consider the following heuristic:

- For each position, if xi < yi, swap them; else, don't swap.

Let's test this with the first sample:

x=73, y=31

Position 1: x=7, y=3 -> 7 > 3, don't swap

Position 2: x=3, y=1 -> 3 > 1, don't swap

But in the sample, swapping position 2 increases the product.

So, this heuristic fails.

Another heuristic:

- Swap if xi < yi, otherwise don't swap.

But as seen in the first sample, it doesn't always hold.

Wait, in the first sample, swapping even though xi > yi increased the product.

So, this heuristic is not reliable.

Alternative heuristic:

- Swap if swapping increases the sum of x and y.

But in the first sample, swapping position 2:

x changes from 73 to 71 (decreases by 2)

y changes from 31 to 33 (increases by 2)

So, the sum remains the same.

But the product increases.

So, maximizing the sum doesn't necessarily maximize the product.

Wait, in this case, the sum is the same, but the product increases.

So, perhaps maximizing the sum isn't the goal.

Wait, actually, for two numbers with a fixed sum, their product is maximized when they are equal.

But in this problem, the sum of x and y isn't fixed because swapping changes the digits but keeps the sum of the digits the same.

Wait, no, swapping digits between x and y doesn't change the sum of the digits; it just redistributes them.

But the actual numerical values of x and y change based on the digit positions.

This is getting too tangled.

I need to find a different approach.

Let me consider that I can only swap corresponding digits, so I can treat each position independently in some way.

But as we've seen, decisions at one position affect the overall product, which involves all positions.

Perhaps I need to accept that there isn't a simple rule and that the problem requires a more sophisticated approach.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following:

- For each position, decide to swap or not, and choose the option that leads to the maximum product.

But this would require trying both options for each position, which is exponential in the number of digits.

Given that n can be up to 100, this is not feasible.

So, I need a linear or near-linear time solution.

Perhaps I need to consider the relative sizes of the digits at each position and decide based on that.

Wait, maybe I can sort the digits in x and y separately and then pair them in a certain way.

But again, I can't rearrange digits within x or y; I can only swap corresponding digits.

So, that doesn't help.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix x and try to maximize y, or vice versa.

But since x and y are interdependent in the product, this might not lead to the optimal solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the difference in the logarithms.

Wait, but that might not simplify the problem.

This is really tricky.

Maybe I should look for a different strategy altogether.

Let me consider that for each position, swapping xi and yi changes the product in a way that can be compared based on their values.

Looking back at the earlier derived formula:

P' - P = (xi - yi) * [(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)*p^2]

I need to find when this is positive.

This seems too complicated to evaluate for each position separately.

Perhaps I need to find a way to simplify this decision.

Wait, maybe I can consider the following:

- If x > y, then swapping a position where xi > yi would decrease x and increase y, potentially bringing them closer and increasing the product.

- If x < y, then swapping a position where xi < yi would increase x and decrease y, again bringing them closer.

This seems to align with the idea that maximizing the product occurs when x and y are as equal as possible.

In the first sample, x=73 and y=31; x > y, so swapping positions where xi > yi could help.

In that case, position 1: xi=7 > yi=3, swapping would decrease x to 3 and increase y to 7, making them closer.

Similarly, position 2: xi=3 > yi=1, swapping would make x=71 and y=33, again bringing them closer.

So, perhaps the rule is:

- If x > y, swap positions where xi > yi.

- If x < y, swap positions where xi < yi.

- If x == y, no need to swap.

Let's test this rule with the first sample:

x=73 > y=31, so swap positions where xi > yi, which are both positions.

But in the sample, they only swapped position 2.

Wait, but according to this rule, we should swap both positions.

Original x=73, y=31.

After swapping both positions: x=33, y=71.

Product: 33 * 71 = 2343.

Original product: 73 * 31 = 2263.

So, swapping both positions gives a higher product than swapping only one position.

But in the sample output, they only swapped position 2, getting x=71 and y=33, with product 2343.

Wait, but 33 * 71 is also 2343.

So, both ways give the same product.

Maybe there are multiple ways to achieve the same product.

So, perhaps swapping all positions where xi > yi is acceptable.

Let's try this rule on the third sample:

x=3516, y=3982.

Compare digit by digit:

Position 1: x=3 == y=3, no swap.

Position 2: x=5 < y=9, don't swap (since x < y, according to the rule).

Position 3: x=1 < y=8, don't swap.

Position 4: x=6 > y=2, swap.

So, swapping position 4: x becomes 3512, y becomes 3986.

Product: 3512 * 3986.

But in the sample output, x=3912 and y=3586.

Their product is larger than 3512 * 3986.

So, perhaps my rule is not optimal.

Wait, according to the rule, since x=3516 < y=3982, I should swap positions where xi < yi.

But in position 2, x=5 < y=9, so swap.

Position 3: x=1 < y=8, swap.

Position 4: x=6 > y=2, don't swap.

So, swapping positions 2 and 3:

x becomes 3982, y becomes 3516.

But in the sample output, x=3912 and y=3586.

Which is different from what my rule suggests.

Wait, perhaps my rule is incomplete.

Let me check the products:

Original: 3516 * 3982 = ?

After swapping positions 2 and 3: 3982 * 3516 = same as above.

Sample output: 3912 * 3586 = ?

Assuming sample output has a larger product, my rule didn't achieve that.

So, perhaps the rule needs refinement.

Maybe I need to consider swapping positions where the difference (xi - yi) has a certain sign based on the overall relationship between x and y.

This is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to accept that there isn't a simple rule and that the problem requires a different approach.

Let me consider that the optimal strategy is to make x and y as equal as possible.

Since the product is maximized when x and y are equal, given the sum is fixed.

But in this problem, the sum of x and y isn't fixed; it's the sum of their digits that is fixed.

Wait, no, the sum of the digits is fixed, but the actual numerical values of x and y can change based on how the digits are arranged.

This is confusing.

Perhaps I should look for a different way to approach this problem.

Let me consider that I can represent x and y as sums of their digits multiplied by powers of 10.

Then, the product P = x * y = (sum of xi * 10^{n-i}) * (sum of yi * 10^{n-i}).

Expanding this, P is the sum over all pairs of digits xi and yi multiplied by the respective powers of 10.

But this seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that to maximize x * y, I need to maximize the sum of xi * yi * 10^{2*(n-i)} over all positions.

Wait, no, that's not accurate because the product involves cross terms.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that I can't find a perfect solution and need to use a heuristic.

Given that, perhaps the heuristic is to swap digits where xi < yi if x < y, and swap where xi > yi if x > y.

This seems to align with the earlier thoughts.

Let me try this heuristic on the third sample:

x=3516 < y=3982.

So, swap positions where xi < yi.

Position 1: x=3 == y=3, no swap.

Position 2: x=5 < y=9, swap.

Position 3: x=1 < y=8, swap.

Position 4: x=6 > y=2, don't swap.

So, swapping positions 2 and 3: x becomes 3982, y becomes 3516.

Product: 3982 * 3516.

But in the sample output, x=3912 and y=3586, which might have a larger product.

So, perhaps this heuristic isn't optimal.

Alternatively, maybe I should swap all positions where xi != yi.

But in the first sample, swapping only position 2 was sufficient.

Wait, but according to this, I should swap both positions where xi != yi.

But in the first sample, swapping both positions gives the same product as swapping only position 2.

So, perhaps multiple solutions exist.

In that case, any of them is acceptable.

Given that, perhaps implementing the heuristic where I swap positions where xi < yi if x < y, and swap where xi > yi if x > y, is acceptable.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to formalize this:

- If x > y, swap positions where xi > yi.

- If x < y, swap positions where xi < yi.

- If x == y, no need to swap.

Let me test this on the third sample:

x=3516 < y=3982, so swap positions where xi < yi.

Position 2: x=5 < y=9, swap.

Position 3: x=1 < y=8, swap.

Position 4: x=6 > y=2, don't swap.

So, x becomes 3982, y becomes 3516.

Product: 3982 * 3516 = 14,002,352.

Sample output: x=3912 * y=3586 = 14,002,352.

Wait, according to my calculation, both ways give the same product.

So, perhaps swapping all positions where xi < yi is acceptable.

But in the sample output, x=3912 and y=3586, which is different from x=3982 and y=3516.

Wait, perhaps there are multiple ways to achieve the same product.

In that case, any of them is acceptable.

So, implementing the heuristic where I swap positions where xi < yi if x < y, and swap where xi > yi if x > y, should work.

Let me try this on the second sample:

x=2 < y=5, so swap positions where xi < yi.

Only one position, x=2 < y=5, swap.

So, x becomes 5, y becomes 2.

Product: 5 * 2 = 10.

Original product: 2 * 5 = 10.

Same product.

As in the sample output.

So, this heuristic works for the second sample.

For the first sample:

x=73 > y=31, so swap positions where xi > yi.

Position 1: x=7 > y=3, swap.

Position 2: x=3 > y=1, swap.

So, x becomes 33, y becomes 71.

Product: 33 * 71 = 2343.

Original product: 73 * 31 = 2263.

Sample output swaps only position 2, getting x=71, y=33, product also 2343.

So, both ways work.

Hence, swapping all positions where xi > yi when x > y seems acceptable.

Similarly, swapping all positions where xi < yi when x < y seems acceptable.

If x == y, no need to swap.

This seems like a reasonable heuristic.

Let me try this on another example.

Suppose x=123, y=321.

x=123 < y=321, so swap positions where xi < yi.

Position 1: x=1 < y=3, swap. x becomes 323, y becomes 121.

Position 2: x=2 == y=2, no swap.

Position 3: x=3 > y=1, don't swap (since x < y, we only swap where xi < yi).

So, x=323, y=121.

Product: 323 * 121 = 39,483.

Original product: 123 * 321 = 39,483.

So, in this case, swapping only position 1 gives the same product as the original.

If I swap position 3 as well, x=121, y=323.

Product: 121 * 323 = 39,483.

Again, same product.

So, multiple ways to achieve the same product.

Hence, implementing this heuristic should be acceptable.

Therefore, I can implement this approach.

Now, to implement this, I need to:

- Read t test cases.

- For each test case:

- Read x and y as strings.

- Convert them to lists for easy manipulation.

- Compare x and y as integers.

- Based on whether x > y, x < y, or x == y, decide which positions to swap.

- Swap the digits at positions where the condition is met.

- Print the modified x and y.

But since x and y are read as strings, I need to compare them as strings.

In Python, comparing strings lexicographically works for numerical comparison if the strings have the same length, which they do in this problem.

So, I can compare x and y as strings directly.

Then, for each position, decide whether to swap based on the heuristic.

Let me outline the steps in code:

- Read t.

- For each test case:

- Read x and y as strings.

- Convert them to lists for mutable operations.

- Compare x and y as strings.

- If x > y:

- Swap positions where xi > yi.

- Else if x < y:

- Swap positions where xi < yi.

- Else:

- No swaps needed.

- After deciding swaps, print the modified x and y.

Let me test this logic with the first sample:

x='73', y='31'

x > y ('73' > '31'), so swap positions where xi > yi.

Position 1: '7' > '3', swap. x becomes ['3', '3'], y becomes ['7', '1']

Position 2: '3' > '1', swap. x becomes ['3', '1'], y becomes ['7', '3']

So, x='31', y='73'

But in the sample output, x='71', y='33'

Wait, this differs from the sample output.

Hmm.

Wait, according to my heuristic, x becomes '31' and y becomes '73', with product 31*73=2263, which is the original product.

But in the sample, x='71' and y='33', with product 71*33=2343, which is higher.

So, my heuristic failed to achieve the maximum product.

Hence, this heuristic is not sufficient.

I need to find a better approach.

Perhaps I need to consider swapping positions where swapping increases the product, regardless of whether x > y or x < y.

But how do I decide that efficiently?

Let me consider that swapping a position changes the product in a way that can be calculated.

From the earlier derivation:

P' - P = (xi - yi) * [(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)*p^2]

I need P' - P > 0.

So, (xi - yi) * [(x - y)*p + (xi - yi)*p^2] > 0

This inequality can be used to decide whether to swap or not.

But calculating x and y at each step is not feasible for large n.

Perhaps I can precompute x and y once and then use them for all positions.

But even then, for n=100, it's still too slow.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that p is 10^{n-i}, where i is the position index starting from 1.

So, p is known for each position.

But still, calculating this for each position seems too involved.

Maybe I need to accept that there isn't a simple rule and that I need to follow the mathematical condition derived.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that if x > y, and xi > yi, then swapping decreases x and increases y, which might bring them closer and increase the product.

Similarly, if x < y, and xi < yi, swapping increases x and decreases y, again bringing them closer.

But as seen in the sample, this doesn't always lead to the maximum product.

Wait, in the sample, swapping only position 2 gives a higher product than swapping both positions.

So, perhaps swapping only some positions is better.

But how do I decide which positions to swap?

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem allows multiple correct answers, as long as the product is maximized.

So, perhaps I can implement the heuristic of swapping positions where xi > yi if x > y, and xi < yi if x < y, and accept that it might not always give the absolute maximum but is acceptable.

Given that, I can proceed with this heuristic.

Alternatively, perhaps I can implement the condition based on the derived inequality.

But that seems too involved.

Given time constraints, I'll proceed with the heuristic.

Hence, the program provided seems to implement this heuristic.

Looking at the code:

def func_1():

a = list(input())

b = list(input())

f = 0

for i in range(len(a)):

if f == 0:

if a[i] < b[i]:

(a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])

f = 1

elif a[i] > b[i]:

f = 1

elif a[i] > b[i]:

(a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])

for i in range(len(a)):

print(a[i], end='')

print()

for i in range(len(b)):

print(b[i], end='')

print()

Wait, this seems different from my heuristic.

In this code, it sets f=0 initially.

Then, iterates through the digits:

- If f == 0:

- If a[i] < b[i], swap a[i] and b[i], set f=1

- Elif a[i] > b[i], set f=1

- Else, no action

- After f is set to 1, for subsequent positions, if a[i] > b[i], swap them.

This seems like a different logic.

Let me trace this with the first sample:

a = ['7', '3'], b = ['3', '1']

f=0

Position 0:

a[0]='7', b[0]='3'

a[0] > b[0], set f=1

Position 1:

a[1]='3', b[1]='1'

Since f==1, and a[1] > b[1], swap them.

So, a becomes ['7', '1'], b becomes ['3', '3']

Which matches the sample output.

So, this logic works for the first sample.

Let's see for the second sample:

a = ['2'], b = ['5']

f=0

Position 0:

a[0]='2' < b[0]='5', swap them, set f=1

So, a becomes ['5'], b becomes ['2']

Which matches the sample output.

Third sample:

a = ['3', '5', '1', '6'], b = ['3', '9', '8', '2']

f=0

Position 0:

a[0]='3' == b[0]='3', no action, f remains 0

Position 1:

a[1]='5' < b[1]='9', swap them, set f=1

a becomes ['3', '9', '1', '6'], b becomes ['3', '5', '8', '2']

Position 2:

a[2]='1' < b[2]='8', but f==1, and a[2] < b[2], no swap (since the condition is a[i] > b[i] to swap when f==1)

Position 3:

a[3]='6' > b[3]='2', swap them

a becomes ['3', '9', '1', '2'], b becomes ['3', '5', '8', '6']

Which matches the sample output.

So, this logic seems to work for the sample inputs.

Let me try to understand this logic.

- It starts with f=0.

- For each position:

- If f==0:

- If a[i] < b[i], swap them and set f=1

- Elif a[i] > b[i], set f=1

- Else, do nothing

- If f==1:

- If a[i] > b[i], swap them

- Else, do nothing

This seems to be a way to decide whether to swap based on the relative values of a[i] and b[i], and the flag f.

The flag f seems to be used to decide when to start swapping based on a[i] > b[i].

In the first phase (f==0), it looks for the first position where a[i] < b[i], swaps them, and sets f=1.

If it finds a position where a[i] > b[i], it sets f=1 without swapping.

Once f is set to 1, for all subsequent positions, if a[i] > b[i], it swaps them.

This seems
