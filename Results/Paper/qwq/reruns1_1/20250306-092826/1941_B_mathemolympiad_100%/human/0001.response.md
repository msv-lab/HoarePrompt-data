Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (which has to be between 2 and n-1, inclusive), and then decrementing a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] by 1, 2, and 1, respectively. The goal is to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

First, I need to understand what this operation does. It seems like it's affecting three consecutive elements each time it's applied. Specifically, it's reducing the middle element by 2 and the adjacent elements by 1. So, if I have three elements like [a, b, c], after one operation, they become [a-1, b-2, c-1].

My task is to determine whether it's possible to apply this operation multiple times (possibly zero) to make the entire array zero.

Let's think about the implications of this operation. Since the operation can be applied any number of times, I need to find a way to satisfy the condition for the entire array.

One approach is to consider the operations in reverse. Instead of subtracting from the array, think about adding the operation's effect in reverse to build up to the original array from zero. But that might not be straightforward.

Another way is to model this as a system of equations. Each operation corresponds to subtracting a specific pattern from the array. So, if I think of the array as a vector, and each operation as subtracting a specific vector, I need to see if I can combine these operations to reach the zero vector from the given array.

But with large n (up to 2*10^5), solving a system of equations directly isn't feasible due to time and space constraints.

I need a smarter way to approach this.

Let's consider the constraints on the array elements after applying the operations.

Starting from the first element, a[0]. Since the operation only affects a[i-1] when i >= 2, a[0] can only be reduced by operations on i=2. Each operation on i=2 reduces a[1] by 2 and a[0] by 1.

Wait, hold on. The operation is defined for i from 2 to n-1, so for i=2, it affects a[1], a[2], and a[3].

Wait, the problem says indices are from 1 to n, but in the code, it's using 0-based indexing. I need to be careful with indexing.

Let's clarify: the problem describes indices starting from 1, but in the code, it's using 0-based indexing. So, a[i-1], a[i], a[i+1] correspond to positions i-1, i, i+1 in 0-based indexing.

To avoid confusion, I'll stick to 1-based indexing in my reasoning.

So, for i from 2 to n-1, the operation reduces a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

I need to find a sequence of such operations that makes all a[i] = 0.

Let's try to find a pattern or a way to sequentially determine the operations.

Perhaps I can iterate through the array and determine how many operations to apply at each position.

Let's consider the first few elements.

Start with a[1]. Since operations only affect a[i-1] for i >= 2, a[1] can only be reduced by operations on i=2.

Each operation on i=2 reduces a[1] by 1, a[2] by 2, and a[3] by 1.

So, to make a[1] zero, I need to apply a certain number of operations on i=2 such that a[1] - (number of operations on i=2) = 0.

Wait, but a[1] is only affected by operations on i=2.

So, if I let op2 be the number of operations on i=2, then a[1] - op2 = 0, so op2 = a[1].

But hold on, operations on i=3 would also affect a[2], which in turn affects a[1] indirectly. Wait, no, operations on i=3 affect a[2], a[3], and a[4], but directly, only operations on i=2 affect a[1].

So, initially, op2 = a[1], to make a[1] zero.

Then, moving to a[2], which is affected by operations on i=2 and i=3.

Each operation on i=2 reduces a[2] by 2, and each operation on i=3 reduces a[2] by 1.

So, a[2] - 2*op2 - op3 = 0.

Since op2 = a[1], we can plug that in: a[2] - 2*a[1] - op3 = 0, so op3 = a[2] - 2*a[1].

Similarly, for a[3], it's affected by operations on i=2, i=3, and i=4.

a[3] - op2 - 2*op3 - op4 = 0.

Plugging in op2 and op3 from above: a[3] - a[1] - 2*(a[2] - 2*a[1]) - op4 = 0.

Simplify: a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1] - op4 = 0.

So, op4 = a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1] = a[3] + 3*a[1] - 2*a[2].

This seems getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where each operation has a specific effect, and see if I can solve for the operations.

Alternatively, maybe I can iterate through the array and keep track of the required operations in a way that ensures the cumulative effects lead to all zeros.

Looking at the code provided, it seems to be attempting something similar.

The function func reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n and the array a.

Then, it iterates from i=0 to n-3 (since n-2 in 0-based indexing), which corresponds to applying operations on i+1 (since i starts from 0).

In each iteration, it calculates opNum = a[i], which seems to correspond to the number of operations to apply at this position.

Then, it updates a[i] -= opNum, a[i+1] -= 2*opNum, and a[i+2] -= opNum.

After these operations, it checks if a[n-1] and a[n-2] are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

Wait a minute, this seems too simplistic. Doesn't this just apply a certain number of operations based on the current value of a[i], without considering the effects on subsequent elements?

I'm not sure if this is correct. Let's test it with the first example.

Take the first test case:

n=5

a = [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]

Iterate i from 0 to n-3=2:

i=0:

opNum = a[0]=1

a[0] -=1 → 0

a[1] -=2 → 3-2=1

a[2] -=1 →5-1=4

Now a = [0,1,4,5,2]

i=1:

opNum = a[1]=1

a[1]-=1→0

a[2]-=2→4-2=2

a[3]-=1→5-1=4

Now a = [0,0,2,4,2]

i=2:

opNum = a[2]=2

a[2]-=2→0

a[3]-=4→4-4=0

a[4]-=2→2-2=0

Now a = [0,0,0,0,0]

So, in this case, it correctly makes all elements zero.

Another test case:

n=5

a = [2,4,4,5,1]

i=0:

opNum=2

a[0]-=2→0

a[1]-=4→0

a[2]-=2→2

Now a=[0,0,2,5,1]

i=1:

opNum=0

No change

i=2:

opNum=2

a[2]-=2→0

a[3]-=4→5-4=1

a[4]-=2→1-2=-1

Now a=[0,0,0,1,-1]

Which is not all zeros, and according to the code, it should print "NO", which matches the sample output.

Seems correct so far.

Another test case:

n=5

a=[0,1,3,3,1]

i=0:

opNum=0

No change

i=1:

opNum=1

a[1]-=1→0

a[2]-=2→3-2=1

a[3]-=1→3-1=2

Now a=[0,0,1,2,1]

i=2:

opNum=1

a[2]-=1→0

a[3]-=2→2-2=0

a[4]-=1→1-1=0

Now a=[0,0,0,0,0], which is correct.

Another test case:

n=6

a=[5,6,0,2,3,0]

i=0:

opNum=5

a[0]-=5→0

a[1]-=10→6-10=-4

a[2]-=5→0-5=-5

Now a=[0,-4,-5,2,3,0]

i=1:

opNum=-4 (but in code, it checks if a[i]<0, and if so, prints 'NO'. Here a[1]=-4<0, so it stops and prints 'NO', which matches the sample output.

Good.

Another test case:

n=4

a=[1,2,7,2]

i=0:

opNum=1

a[0]-=1→0

a[1]-=2→0

a[2]-=1→7-1=6

Now a=[0,0,6,2]

i=1:

opNum=0

No change

i=2:

opNum=6

a[2]-=6→0

a[3]-=12→2-12=-10

Now a=[0,0,0,-10], which is not all zeros, so it should print 'NO', which is correct.

Another test case:

n=3

a=[7,1,0]

i=0:

opNum=7

a[0]-=7→0

a[1]-=14→1-14=-13

a[2]-=7→0-7=-7

Now a=[0,-13,-7], which is not all zeros, so 'NO', correct.

Last test case:

n=4

a=[1,1,1,1]

i=0:

opNum=1

a[0]-=1→0

a[1]-=2→-1

a[2]-=1→1-1=0

Now a=[0,-1,0,1]

Since a[1]=-1<0, it stops and prints 'NO', which is correct.

So, based on these observations, the code seems to be working correctly for the sample inputs.

But is this approach generally correct?

Let's think about what the code is doing.

It iterates from the start of the array up to n-3, and for each position i, it calculates opNum = a[i], and then applies the operation by subtracting opNum, 2*opNum, and opNum from a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2], respectively.

It continues this process until i = n-3.

Then, it checks if the last two elements are zero.

If at any point a[i] < 0 before applying opNum, it stops and prints 'NO'.

Is this a valid approach?

I think so, because:

- By iterating from the start and applying operations based on a[i], it's effectively trying to eliminate the values step by step, from the beginning to the end.

- If at any point a[i] < 0, it means that the previous operations have over-subtracted, making a[i] negative, which isn't possible because operations can only subtract, not add.

- Finally, it checks if the last two elements are zero because those are the elements that aren't affected by any more operations (since operations can only be applied up to i = n-1, which affects up to a[n-1]).

Wait, but in the code, it iterates up to i = n-3, which in 1-based indexing would be up to i = n-2.

Wait, in the code, n is the number of elements, and a is 0-based indexed.

So, i ranges from 0 to n-3 inclusive.

Given that, a[i], a[i+1], a[i+2] are being modified.

Yes, the last operation would be on i = n-3, affecting a[n-3], a[n-2], a[n-1].

Then, after all operations, it checks if a[n-2] and a[n-1] are zero.

I think this makes sense because all previous elements should have been adjusted to zero in earlier steps, and the final check is to ensure that the last two elements are also zero.

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is **True**.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can make all elements of a given array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \leq i \leq n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a[i-1] \), \( a[i] \), and \( a[i+1] \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

### Approach

1. **Iterative Operation Application**:
   - We iterate through the array from the start up to the third-to-last element.
   - For each position \( i \), we calculate the number of operations (\( opNum \)) needed to make \( a[i] \) zero.
   - We apply this operation by subtracting \( opNum \), \( 2 \times opNum \), and \( opNum \) from \( a[i] \), \( a[i+1] \), and \( a[i+2] \) respectively.

2. **Validation**:
   - If at any point \( a[i] \) becomes negative before applying the operations, it means it's impossible to make all elements zero, and we print 'NO'.
   - After processing, we check if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, we print 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        for i in range(n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        else:
            if a[-1] == 0 and a[-2] == 0:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation

- **Iterative Operation**:
  - We process the array from the start up to the third-to-last element.
  - For each element \( a[i] \), we calculate the required operations to make it zero and adjust the subsequent elements accordingly.

- **Validation Checks**:
  - If any element \( a[i] \) becomes negative during the process, it indicates an invalid state, and we print 'NO'.
  - After all operations, we ensure the last two elements are zero to confirm the entire array can be made zero.

This method efficiently determines whether it's possible to make all array elements zero using the specified operations, ensuring correctness and efficiency for large inputs.
