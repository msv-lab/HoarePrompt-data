Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, and I need to determine whether certain subarrays of a given array are good or not. The definition of a good array is a bit involved, so I need to understand that first.

A array 'a' of length 'm' is considered good if there exists another integer array 'b' of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in 'a' is equal to the sum of elements in 'b'.

2. For every index 'i', a_i is not equal to b_i.

3. All elements in 'b' are positive integers.

So, for a given subarray of 'c', from l to r, I need to check if it's good based on these conditions.

First, I need to think about what it means for two arrays to have the same sum, yet none of their corresponding elements are equal.

Let me consider a simple example. Suppose the subarray is [1, 2, 3]. So, sum is 6. I need to find another array of length 3, say [b1, b2, b3], such that b1 + b2 + b3 = 6, and b1 != 1, b2 != 2, b3 != 3, and all b_i > 0.

One possible 'b' array could be [2, 1, 3]. But wait, b1 = 2 != 1, b2 = 1 != 2, b3 = 3 != 3. Oh, but b3 is equal to a3, which violates condition 2. So, this doesn't work.

Another try: [2, 1, 3] doesn't work because b3 == a3. How about [2, 3, 1]? Here, b1 = 2 != 1, b2 = 3 != 2, b3 = 1 != 3. Good, this satisfies both conditions: sum is 6, and no b_i equals a_i.

So, in this case, the subarray [1,2,3] is good.

Now, let's consider a subarray that might not be good. Suppose [1,1]. Sum is 2. I need to find [b1, b2] where b1 + b2 = 2, b1 !=1, b2 !=1, and b1, b2 > 0.

Possible options:

- [2,0]: but b2 = 0, which violates b_i > 0.

- [0,2]: again, b1 = 0, invalid.

- [1,1]: but b_i == a_i for both elements, invalid.

- [2,0]: invalid again.

- [1,1]: invalid again.

Seems like there's no possible 'b' array that satisfies all conditions. So, [1,1] is not a good array.

Wait, but is there any other 'b' array I'm missing? Let's think differently. If I have two elements, and their sum needs to be 2, with each being positive integers, and not equal to the corresponding a_i.

So, possible 'b' arrays are:

- [1,1]: invalid because equal to a_i.

- [2,0]: invalid because b2 = 0.

- [0,2]: invalid because b1 = 0.

- [3,-1]: invalid because b2 = -1.

It seems like there's no valid 'b' array for [1,1]. So, it's not good.

Now, what about a subarray with only one element? Say [1]. In this case, I need to find 'b' such that b1 = 1, but b1 != 1, and b1 > 0. So, any positive integer except 1. But then, b1 cannot be equal to a1, which is 1. So, if b1 is any other positive integer, say 2, but then sum of 'b' is 2, which is not equal to sum of 'a', which is 1. So, it's impossible. Hence, single-element subarrays cannot be good.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for n=5 and queries like 4 4 and 1 1, which are single elements, the output is "NO", which aligns with my conclusion.

So, subarrays of length 1 are never good.

Now, for subarrays of length greater than 1, under what conditions are they good?

From the earlier example, [1,2,3] is good, and [1,1] is not.

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose the subarray is of length m, with elements a1, a2, ..., am.

I need to find another array b1, b2, ..., bm such that:

- sum of b_i = sum of a_i

- b_i != a_i for all i

- b_i > 0 for all i

One way to approach this is to set b_i to some value other than a_i, but ensuring that the sum remains the same.

One strategy could be to set b1 = a1 + x, and adjust the remaining b_i accordingly to make sure the sum remains the same.

But this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible sums for 'b'.

Since b_i > 0 and b_i != a_i, the minimal possible b_i is either a_i - 1 (if a_i > 1) or a_i + 1 (if a_i == 1).

Wait, no. Since b_i > 0, and b_i != a_i, if a_i == 1, then b_i >= 2. If a_i > 1, then b_i could be a_i - 1, as long as it's positive and not equal to a_i.

Wait, more carefully:

- If a_i == 1, then b_i >= 2.

- If a_i > 1, then b_i can be either a_i - 1 (if a_i - 1 > 0 and a_i - 1 != a_i, which it isn't), or any other positive integer except a_i.

So, in general, for each a_i:

- If a_i == 1, b_i >= 2.

- If a_i > 1, b_i can be a_i - 1 (which is positive and != a_i), or any other positive integer except a_i.

Hence, for each a_i, there is at least one option for b_i that is positive and != a_i.

Now, the problem reduces to ensuring that the sum of b_i equals the sum of a_i.

Given that, I need to choose b_i for each a_i such that their sum matches the sum of a_i.

This seems tricky, but maybe there's a way to ensure that.

Let me consider the minimal possible sum of b_i.

For each a_i:

- If a_i == 1, b_i >= 2.

- If a_i > 1, b_i >= a_i - 1 (as long as a_i - 1 > 0 and != a_i).

Wait, a_i - 1 is positive if a_i > 1, and it's != a_i by definition.

Hence, for each a_i:

- If a_i == 1, minimal b_i = 2.

- If a_i > 1, minimal b_i = a_i - 1.

So, the minimal possible sum of b_i is sum over i of minimal b_i.

Similarly, there's no upper limit on b_i, since b_i can be as large as desired, as long as it's positive and != a_i.

Therefore, the minimal possible sum of b_i is sum of (a_i - 1) for a_i > 1, and sum of 2 for a_i == 1.

Wait, no. More precisely:

- For a_i == 1, minimal b_i = 2.

- For a_i > 1, minimal b_i = a_i - 1.

Hence, minimal sum of b_i is sum over i of:

- If a_i == 1, add 2.

- Else, add (a_i - 1).

Now, the required sum for b_i is sum of a_i.

So, for the subarray to be good, the minimal sum of b_i should be <= sum of a_i.

Wait, but in the earlier example [1,2,3]:

- a_i = 1,2,3.

- minimal b_i:

- For 1: b_i >= 2.

- For 2: b_i >= 1.

- For 3: b_i >= 2.

- Sum of minimal b_i: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5.

- Sum of a_i: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

- Since 5 <= 6, it's possible to adjust b_i to match sum 6.

Hence, [1,2,3] is good.

Another example [1,1]:

- minimal b_i: 2 + 2 = 4.

- sum of a_i: 1 + 1 = 2.

- 4 > 2, so it's impossible to find such b_i.

Hence, [1,1] is not good.

Wait, but earlier I thought [1,1] is not good, which matches this conclusion.

So, it seems that the condition for a subarray to be good is that the sum of the minimal possible b_i <= sum of a_i.

Wait, but in the [1,2,3] example, sum of minimal b_i is 5 <= 6, which is true, and it's good.

In [1,1], sum of minimal b_i is 4 > 2, which is false, and it's not good.

Is this always the case?

Let me think about another example.

Consider [2,2,2].

- minimal b_i for each a_i = 1 (since a_i > 1, b_i >= a_i - 1 = 1).

- sum of minimal b_i: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

- sum of a_i: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

- 3 <= 6, so it should be good.

Can I find such a b array?

For [2,2,2], let's set b = [1,1,4]. Sum is 6, b_i != a_i for all i, and b_i > 0.

Yes, it works.

Another example: [1,3].

- minimal b_i: 2 (for 1) + 2 (for 3, since b_i >= 2) = 4.

- sum of a_i: 1 + 3 = 4.

- So, sum of minimal b_i = sum of a_i.

Is [1,3] good? Let's see.

Set b = [2,2]. Sum is 4, b_i != a_i for both elements, and b_i > 0.

Yes, it's good.

Another one: [1,2].

- minimal b_i: 2 (for 1) + 1 (for 2) = 3.

- sum of a_i: 1 + 2 = 3.

- So, sum of minimal b_i = sum of a_i.

Is [1,2] good? Let's try b = [2,1]. Sum is 3, b_i != a_i for both, and b_i > 0.

Yes, it's good.

Now, what if the sum of minimal b_i < sum of a_i?

Take [3,3,3].

- minimal b_i: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

- sum of a_i: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

- 6 <= 9, so it should be good.

Can I find b = [2,2,5], for example? Sum is 9, b_i != a_i, and b_i > 0.

Yes, it works.

Seems like as long as sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, it's possible to adjust b_i to match the sum.

Wait, but what if the subarray is [1,1,1], sum is 3.

Sum of minimal b_i: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, which is > 3.

Hence, not good, which makes sense.

Another case: [1,2,1].

- minimal b_i: 2 (for 1) + 1 (for 2) + 2 (for 1) = 5.

- sum of a_i: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

- 5 > 4, so not good.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for n=5 and query 1 to 3: c[1,2,1] = [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 > 4, so it should be NO, but in the sample output, it's NO, which matches.

Wait, but in the sample input, for query 3: 3 to 4, which is [1,4], sum of minimal b_i: 2 + 3 = 5 <= 5 (sum of a_i), so it should be YES, which matches the sample output.

Hence, this condition seems to hold.

So, the condition for a subarray to be good is:

sum over i of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Where minimal b_i is:

- if a_i == 1, minimal b_i = 2.

- else, minimal b_i = a_i - 1.

Wait, but in the [1,2,1] example, minimal b_i: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 > 4, so NO.

In [1,4], minimal b_i: 2 + 3 = 5 <= 5, so YES.

In [1,1], 2 + 2 = 4 > 2, so NO.

In [1,2,3], 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 <= 6, so YES.

Seems consistent.

Hence, I can implement this condition to determine if a subarray is good or not.

Now, in terms of implementation, given that n and q can be up to 3*10^5, and t up to 10^4, but with the sum of n and sum of q over all test cases not exceeding 3*10^5, I need an efficient way to handle this.

I need to process multiple test cases, each with an array of length n and q queries, each query asking about a subarray from l to r.

I need to compute for each subarray from l to r:

sum of a_i from l to r, and sum of minimal b_i from l to r, and check if sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

To compute sum of minimal b_i from l to r, I can precompute a prefix sum array where each element is:

- if a_i == 1, contribute 2.

- else, contribute (a_i - 1).

Then, for each query from l to r, I can compute the sum of a_i from l to r, and the sum of minimal b_i from l to r using the prefix sums, and then compare them.

If sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, then YES, else NO.

Also, need to make sure that the subarray length is at least 2, since subarrays of length 1 are never good, as established earlier.

Wait, in the sample input, for query 1 to 5: [1,2,1,4,5], which is length 5 >=2, sum of a_i =1+2+1+4+5=13, sum of minimal b_i =2+1+2+3+4=12 <=13, so YES.

Query 4 to 4: [4], length 1, which should be NO.

Query 3 to 4: [1,4], length 2, sum of a_i=1+4=5, sum of minimal b_i=2+3=5 <=5, so YES.

Query 1 to 3: [1,2,1], sum of a_i=1+2+1=4, sum of minimal b_i=2+1+2=5 >4, so NO.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, this approach seems correct.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to:

1. Read t, the number of test cases.

2. For each test case:

a. Read n and q.

b. Read the array c of length n.

c. Precompute two prefix sum arrays:

i. One for sum of a_i.

ii. One for sum of minimal b_i.

d. For each query:

i. Read l and r (1-based indices).

ii. Compute sum of a_i from l to r using the prefix sum.

iii. Compute sum of minimal b_i from l to r using its prefix sum.

iv. If r - l + 1 >=2 and sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, then YES, else NO.

3. Output the answers for all queries in order.

Also, need to handle 1-based vs 0-based indexing appropriately.

In the code provided, it seems to be attempting this approach.

Let's look at the code:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = []

c = 0

for x in l:

c += x

p.append(c)

for _ in range(m):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

s = p[b - 1]

if a - 2 >= 0:

s -= p[a - 2]

if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

}

So, in this code:

- It reads t, n, q, and the array c.

- It computes a prefix sum array p, where p[i] = sum of c[0 to i].

- For each query from l to r:

- It computes s = p[r-1], which is sum of c[0 to r-1].

- If a - 2 >=0, it subtracts p[a-2], which would be sum of c[0 to a-2], so s becomes sum of c[a-1 to r-1].

- Then, it checks if the subarray length (b - a + 1) >1 and s >= 2*(b - a +1), then YES, else NO.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be checking sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Where sum of minimal b_i is sum over i from l to r of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- else c_i -1.

But in this code, it's just using the sum of c_i and checking if s >= 2*(b - a +1).

This seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's trying to compute sum of minimal b_i in a different way.

Let me see.

If c_i ==1, minimal b_i =2, else minimal b_i =c_i -1.

So, sum of minimal b_i from l to r is sum over i from l to r of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- else c_i -1.

But in the code, it's using the prefix sum p, which is sum of c_i, and then checking s >= 2*(b - a +1).

This doesn't seem to match.

Wait, maybe the code is trying to compute sum of minimal b_i differently.

Let me think.

Suppose I have sum of c_i = s.

Sum of minimal b_i is sum over i from l to r of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- else c_i -1.

Which is equal to sum over i from l to r of (c_i -1) + number of c_i ==1 * 1.

Wait, because for c_i ==1, minimal b_i =2, which is (c_i -1) +1 =2.

For c_i >1, minimal b_i =c_i -1.

Hence, sum of minimal b_i = sum over i from l to r of (c_i -1) + number of c_i ==1.

Which is sum of c_i from l to r minus the length of the subarray plus the number of c_i ==1.

So, sum of minimal b_i = s - (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1.

And we need this to be <= s.

So, s - (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1 <= s.

Which simplifies to - (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1 <=0.

Or, number of c_i ==1 <= r -l +1.

But r -l +1 is the length of the subarray, which is always >= number of c_i ==1.

So, this inequality always holds.

But that can't be right, because in the earlier examples, [1,1] should be NO, but according to this, it would be YES, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality.

Let's re-examine.

We have sum of minimal b_i = s - (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1.

We need this <= s.

So, s - (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1 <= s.

Subtract s from both sides:

- (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1 <=0.

Which implies number of c_i ==1 <= (r -l +1).

But (r -l +1) is the length of the subarray, which is always >= the number of c_i ==1.

Hence, this inequality always holds.

But this can't be right, because in the sample input, [1,1] should be NO, but according to this, it would be YES, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the condition is not just sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, but also that sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i and the subarray length >=2.

Wait, in the sample input, for [1,1], sum of a_i =2, sum of minimal b_i =4, which is >2, so it should be NO.

But according to the inequality derived, number of c_i ==1 <= (r -l +1), which is always true, so something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

So, s - (r -l +1) + number of c_i ==1 <= s.

Which simplifies to number of c_i ==1 <= (r -l +1).

But this is always true, since number of c_i ==1 <= length of subarray.

Hence, this condition is always satisfied, which contradicts the sample input.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for each c_i ==1, minimal b_i =2, which adds 1 more to the sum compared to c_i.

For c_i >1, minimal b_i =c_i -1, which subtracts 1 from the sum compared to c_i.

Hence, sum of minimal b_i = sum of c_i + number of c_i ==1 - (r -l +1).

Wait, because for c_i ==1, b_i =2, which is c_i +1.

For c_i >1, b_i =c_i -1, which is c_i -1.

Hence, sum of minimal b_i = sum of c_i + number of c_i ==1 - (r -l +1).

Wait, let's verify with [1,2,1]:

sum of c_i =1+2+1=4.

number of c_i ==1:2.

sum of minimal b_i =4 +2 -3=3 <=4, which should be YES, but according to the sample input, it's NO.

Wait, but earlier I thought it should be NO, but according to this, it's YES, which is inconsistent.

Hence, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, and sum of minimal b_i >= sum of a_i.

Wait, no, just <=.

But in the [1,2,1] case, sum of minimal b_i =3 <=4, but it's NO in the sample input.

Wait, but according to the sample input, it's NO, but according to this condition, it should be YES, which is a contradiction.

Hence, my earlier assumption is wrong.

Perhaps I need to consider that the difference between sum of a_i and sum of minimal b_i should be adjustable by modifying b_i's.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i <= sum of maximal b_i.

But what is the sum of maximal b_i? Since b_i can be arbitrarily large, sum of maximal b_i is unbounded.

Hence, perhaps the condition is just sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

But in the sample input, for [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i =3 <=4, but it's NO.

So, perhaps there's another condition I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps for the subarray to be good, in addition to sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, the subarray length must be >=2.

But in the [1,2,1] case, length is 3 >=2, and sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, but it's NO.

Hence, perhaps there's another constraint.

Let me think about the assignment of b_i.

In the [1,2,1] case:

- c_i:1, minimal b_i=2.

- c_i:2, minimal b_i=1.

- c_i:1, minimal b_i=2.

Sum of minimal b_i=5.

Wait, no, earlier I thought it was 3, but actually it's 2+1+2=5.

Wait, in the earlier calculation, for [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i=2+1+2=5, which is > sum of a_i=4.

Hence, it's NO.

Wait, but according to the earlier condition, sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

But in this case, 5 >4, so it's NO.

But in the sample input, for [1,2,1], it's NO.

Wait, but earlier I thought sum of minimal b_i was 3, but actually it's 5.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.

So, in [1,2,1]:

- For c_i=1: minimal b_i=2.

- For c_i=2: minimal b_i=1.

- For c_i=1: minimal b_i=2.

Sum of minimal b_i=2+1+2=5.

Sum of a_i=1+2+1=4.

Since 5 >4, it's NO.

Hence, the condition should be sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, and subarray length >=2.

Wait, but in the code provided, it's checking s >= 2*(b -a +1), where s is sum of a_i.

Wait, 2*(b -a +1) is like sum of minimal b_i if all c_i ==1.

But in reality, sum of minimal b_i is sum over i from l to r of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- c_i -1 otherwise.

Hence, the code is not correctly computing sum of minimal b_i.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the sample input, for [1,2,1], sum of a_i=4, and 4 >=2*3=6 is False, so it prints NO, which matches the sample output.

For [1,2,3], sum=6 >=2*3=6, so YES.

For [4], sum=4 >=2*1=2, but length=1, so NO.

Wait, but in the sample input, query 1 is 1 to 5: [1,2,1,4,5], sum=13 >=2*5=10, so YES.

Query 2:4 to4:[4], length=1, NO.

Query3:3 to4:[1,4], sum=5 >=2*2=4, so YES.

Query4:1 to3:[1,2,1], sum=4 >=2*3=6, which is False, so NO.

Which matches the sample output.

Hence, the condition s >=2*(b -a +1) seems to work in this case.

But is this general?

Wait, in [1,2,1], sum=4 >=2*3=6? No, 4 <6, so NO.

In [1,2,3], sum=6 >=2*3=6, so YES.

In [1,1], sum=2 >=2*2=4? 2 <4, so NO.

In [1,4], sum=5 >=2*2=4, so YES.

Seems to work.

Hence, sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1).

But is this always equivalent to sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i?

Wait, sum of minimal b_i is sum over i from l to r of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- c_i -1 otherwise.

And sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) seems to be equivalent to sum of a_i >= sum of minimal b_i when minimal b_i is at least 2 for each element.

Wait, but for c_i >1, minimal b_i =c_i -1, which could be less than 2.

For example, in [2,2,2], sum of a_i=6, sum of minimal b_i=1+1+1=3 <=6, but 6 >=2*3=6, which holds.

In [1,2,1], sum of a_i=4, sum of minimal b_i=2+1+2=5 <=4? No, 5>4, but 4 >=2*3=6? No, which matches.

In [1,1], sum of a_i=2, sum of minimal b_i=2+2=4 <=2? No, and 2 >=2*2=4? No.

In [1,4], sum of a_i=5 >=2*2=4, and sum of minimal b_i=2+3=5 <=5, which holds.

Hence, sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) seems to be equivalent to sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Wait, but in [2,2,2], sum of minimal b_i=1+1+1=3 <=6, and 6 >=2*3=6 holds.

In [3,3,3], sum of minimal b_i=2+2+2=6 <=9, and 9 >=2*3=6 holds.

Hence, it seems that sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i is equivalent to sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1).

Wait, but in [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i=5 <=4? No, and sum of a_i=4 >=2*3=6? No.

Hence, both conditions are consistent.

Wait, but why is sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i equivalent to sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1)?

Wait, because sum of minimal b_i is sum over i of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- c_i -1 otherwise.

And sum of a_i >= sum of minimal b_i.

But sum of minimal b_i is sum over i of minimal b_i.

Wait, perhaps sum of minimal b_i is at least 2 for each element when c_i ==1, and c_i -1 otherwise.

But in [2,2,2], sum of minimal b_i=1+1+1=3, which is less than 2*3=6.

But sum of a_i=6 >=6 holds.

In [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i=2+1+2=5, which is less than sum of a_i=4? No, 5>4, and sum of a_i=4 >=6? No.

Hence, sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) implies sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Wait, but sum of minimal b_i is sum over i of:

- 2 if c_i ==1,

- c_i -1 otherwise.

And sum over i of 2 =2*(r -l +1).

But in reality, sum of minimal b_i can be less than 2*(r -l +1), for example in [2,2,2], sum of minimal b_i=3 <6.

But in that case, sum of a_i=6 >=6 holds.

Wait, no, in [2,2,2], sum of a_i=6 >=6 holds, and sum of minimal b_i=3 <=6 holds.

Similarly, in [1,2,1], sum of a_i=4 >=6? No, and sum of minimal b_i=5 <=4? No.

Hence, sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) is a stronger condition than sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

But in practice, sum of minimal b_i can be less than 2*(r -l +1).

Hence, perhaps sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) is a sufficient condition for sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i, but not necessary.

Wait, but in [2,2,2], sum of minimal b_i=3 <=6, and sum of a_i=6 >=6.

In [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i=5 <=4 only when sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1)=6.

But sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) implies sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Because sum of minimal b_i is at least sum over i of 2 if c_i ==1, else c_i -1.

But in [2,2,2], sum of minimal b_i=1+1+1=3, which is less than sum of a_i=6.

And sum of a_i=6 >=6 holds.

In [1,2,1], sum of minimal b_i=2+1+2=5, sum of a_i=4, sum of a_i >=6? No.

Hence, sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) is equivalent to sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Wait, but in [1,4], sum of minimal b_i=2+3=5 <=5 holds, and sum of a_i=5 >=4 holds.

In [1,1], sum of minimal b_i=2+2=4 <=2? No, and sum of a_i=2 >=4? No.

Hence, sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) is equivalent to sum of minimal b_i <= sum of a_i.

Hence, using sum of a_i >=2*(r -l +1) as the condition is correct.

Hence, the code is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was incorrect, but now it seems correct.

Hence, the code is correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine if given subarrays are "good" based on specific conditions. An array is considered good if there exists another array with the same sum, no equal elements at the same positions, and all elements being positive integers.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if the sum of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray for subarrays of length greater than 1.
   - Single-element subarrays cannot be good.

2. **Efficient Calculation Using Prefix Sums:**
   - Precompute prefix sums for the array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.
   - For each query, calculate the sum of the specified subarray and check if it meets the condition.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - For a subarray from index `l` to `r`, calculate its sum.
   - Check if the sum is greater than or equal to twice the length of the subarray (i.e., `2 * (r - l + 1)`).
   - Ensure the subarray length is at least 2.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        idx += 2
        c = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        p = []
        c_sum = 0
        for x in c:
            c_sum += x
            p.append(c_sum)
        for _ in range(q):
            a = int(data[idx])
            b = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
