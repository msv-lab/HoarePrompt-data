Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two positive integers, n and m, and I need to find the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, with the condition that a + b is a multiple of b multiplied by the greatest common divisor of a and b. That is, a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

First, I need to understand what this condition means. Let's break it down. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without leaving a remainder. So, gcd(a, b) is that number.

The condition is that a + b should be divisible by b * gcd(a, b). In mathematical terms, this means that b * gcd(a, b) divides a + b evenly.

Let me try to rephrase this. If I have a + b divisible by b * gcd(a, b), that means there exists some integer k such that a + b = k * b * gcd(a, b).

I need to find all pairs (a, b) that satisfy this equation within the given constraints.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can simplify the condition.

Let’s denote d = gcd(a, b). Then, a = d * a1 and b = d * b1, where a1 and b1 are coprime integers (since d is the greatest common divisor).

Substituting these into the condition:

a + b = d * a1 + d * b1 = d * (a1 + b1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * b1 * d = d^2 * b1

So, the condition becomes:

d * (a1 + b1) should be divisible by d^2 * b1.

Simplifying, this means that a1 + b1 should be divisible by d * b1.

But since a1 and b1 are coprime, and d = gcd(a, b), which is also a factor of both a and b.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let's try another approach.

Perhaps I can look at the ratio (a + b) / (b * gcd(a, b)) and see when this is an integer.

Given that, I can write:

(a + b) / (b * gcd(a, b)) = integer k.

So, (a + b) = k * b * gcd(a, b).

Maybe I can solve for a in terms of b and k.

a = k * b * gcd(a, b) - b.

But this seems messy because gcd(a, b) depends on both a and b.

Let me consider fixing b and seeing how many a satisfy the condition for that particular b.

So, for a fixed b, I need to find a such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n, and a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b).

Given that, perhaps I can iterate over all possible b from 1 to m, and for each b, count the number of a that satisfy the condition.

But with n and m up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this without iterating too much.

This suggests that I need a mathematical insight to simplify the problem.

Let me think about the condition again.

We have a + b ≡ 0 mod (b * gcd(a, b)).

But this seems circular because gcd(a, b) depends on a and b.

Maybe I can express a in terms of b and gcd.

Let d = gcd(a, b), then a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1.

Substituting into the condition:

a + b = d * a' + d * b' = d * (a' + b')

And b * gcd(a, b) = d * b' * d = d^2 * b'

So, d * (a' + b') must be divisible by d^2 * b'.

Simplifying, a' + b' must be divisible by d * b'.

But since a' and b' are coprime, and b' divides b', then a' + b' being divisible by b' implies that a' is divisible by b'.

But since a' and b' are coprime, the only way a' is divisible by b' is if b' = 1.

Wait, if b' > 1, and a' is divisible by b', but a' and b' are coprime, that's only possible if b' = 1.

Therefore, b' must be 1.

So, b = d * b' = d * 1 = d.

Therefore, b = d, and a = d * a', where a' is coprime with b'.

But b' = 1, so a' can be any integer coprime with 1, which is any integer.

Wait, but a' must be positive integer.

So, a = d * a', where d = b, and a' is any positive integer such that a <= n.

Given that a = b * a', and a <= n, then a' <= n / b.

Also, since b = d, and d = gcd(a, b), and a = b * a', then gcd(a, b) = b, which implies that b divides a.

Wait, but gcd(a, b) = b only if b divides a.

So, this seems consistent.

Let me summarize:

- For the condition to hold, b must divide a.

- Moreover, b = gcd(a, b), which is only true if b divides a.

Wait, no. If b divides a, then gcd(a, b) = b.

So, in this case, gcd(a, b) = b, and a = b * k for some integer k.

Substituting back into the condition:

a + b = b * k + b = b * (k + 1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * b = b^2

So, the condition becomes: b * (k + 1) is divisible by b^2.

Simplifying, k + 1 must be divisible by b.

So, k + 1 ≡ 0 mod b, which means k ≡ -1 mod b.

Therefore, k = b * t - 1 for some integer t >= 1.

Thus, a = b * k = b * (b * t - 1) = b^2 * t - b.

But a must be >=1 and <=n.

So, 1 <= b^2 * t - b <= n.

Let me solve for t:

1 <= b^2 * t - b <= n

Adding b to all parts:

1 + b <= b^2 * t <= n + b

Dividing by b^2:

(1 + b)/b^2 <= t <= (n + b)/b^2

But t must be an integer >=1.

Wait, t can be zero, but k = b * t - 1, and a = b * k, but k must be >=1 since a >=1.

Wait, k = b * t - 1 >=1 => b * t >=2 => t >= ceil(2/b).

But t must be integer >=1.

This seems a bit messy.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me think differently.

Given that a + b is divisible by b * gcd(a, b), and we've established that gcd(a, b) = b when b divides a.

So, the condition simplifies to a + b divisible by b * b, i.e., b^2.

Because gcd(a, b) = b, so b * b = b^2.

Therefore, a + b must be divisible by b^2.

But a is a multiple of b, since b divides a.

So, a = m * b for some integer m >=1.

Therefore, a + b = m * b + b = b * (m + 1)

This must be divisible by b^2, so b * (m + 1) is divisible by b^2.

Simplifying, m + 1 must be divisible by b.

So, m + 1 ≡ 0 mod b => m ≡ -1 mod b.

Thus, m = b * k - 1 for some integer k >=1.

Therefore, a = m * b = (b * k - 1) * b = b^2 * k - b.

Now, a must be >=1 and <=n.

So, 1 <= b^2 * k - b <= n.

Let's solve for k:

1 <= b^2 * k - b <= n

Add b to all parts:

1 + b <= b^2 * k <= n + b

Divide by b^2:

(1 + b)/b^2 <= k <= (n + b)/b^2

Since k must be an integer >=1, the number of possible k's is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) + 1.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of a's for each b.

Given that a = b * m - b, where m is an integer >=1, and a >=1 and <=n.

So, a = b * (m - 1)

Wait, hold on.

From a = b * m - b, a = b*(m - 1)

Let me set m' = m - 1, so a = b * m'

With m' >=0.

But a >=1, so m' >=1.

Wait, a = b * m' where m' >=1.

But earlier, a = b * (m - 1), and m = k in previous notation.

Wait, I'm getting confused with variable names.

Let's clarify.

From earlier:

a = b * (some integer) - b, but that seems inconsistent because a >=1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me go back.

We have a = b * m - b, where m >=1.

Then a = b*(m - 1).

So, a = b * (m - 1)

Let p = m - 1, then a = b * p, where p >=0.

But a >=1, so p >=1.

Thus, a = b * p, where p >=1 and a <=n.

So, p <= n / b

Therefore, for each b, the number of a's is floor(n / b)

But wait, is this correct?

Wait, no.

Because a = b * p, where p >=1 and p <= floor(n / b)

So, for each b, the number of a's is floor(n / b)

But this seems too straightforward. Is this the answer?

Wait, but according to the sample input and output, it doesn't match.

In the first sample input:

1 1

Output:

1

Which matches floor(1 / 1) = 1

Second sample input:

2 3

Output:

3

floor(2 / 1) = 2

floor(2 / 2) = 1

floor(2 / 3) = 0

Total: 2 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches.

Third sample input:

3 5

Output:

4

floor(3 / 1) = 3

floor(3 / 2) = 1

floor(3 / 3) = 1

floor(3 / 4) = 0

floor(3 / 5) = 0

Total: 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5, but the output is 4.

Wait, this doesn't match.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Apparently, for m=5, n=3, the total should be 4, but according to my calculation, it's 5.

So, something's wrong.

Wait, maybe not all b from 1 to m are valid.

Wait, in the problem, b can be from 1 to m, but not all of them may satisfy the condition.

Wait, no. For each b, I need to count the number of a's that satisfy the condition, given that a is from 1 to n.

So, perhaps not all a's for a given b satisfy the condition.

Wait, in my earlier reasoning, I concluded that for each b, the number of a's is floor(n / b).

But according to the sample input 3, this would give 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 5, but the output is 4.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

Therefore, not all a's that are multiples of b satisfy the condition.

Wait, but according to my earlier derivation, a must be of the form b * p, where p is an integer >=1, and p <= floor(n / b).

But in the sample input 3, this gives 5 pairs, but the output is 4.

So, perhaps some pairs are invalid.

Wait, in the note for the fourth sample input, it lists 14 pairs, but according to my calculation, for n=10, m=8:

floor(10/1)=10

floor(10/2)=5

floor(10/3)=3

floor(10/4)=2

floor(10/5)=2

floor(10/6)=1

floor(10/7)=1

floor(10/8)=1

Total: 10+5+3+2+2+1+1+1=25, but the output is 14.

So clearly, my assumption is wrong.

Therefore, not all multiples of b satisfy the original condition.

I must have made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Let me double-check.

I started by setting d = gcd(a, b) = b, since b divides a.

Then, a + b = b * (k + 1)

And b * gcd(a, b) = b * b = b^2

So, b * (k + 1) must be divisible by b^2, which simplifies to k + 1 must be divisible by b.

Thus, k = b * t - 1 for integer t >=1

Then, a = b * k = b * (b * t - 1) = b^2 * t - b

With a >=1 and <=n

So, 1 <= b^2 * t - b <=n

Solving for t:

(1 + b)/b^2 <= t <= (n + b)/b^2

Since t must be integer >=1, the number of t's is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) + 1

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can compute it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over t from 1 to floor((n + b)/b^2), and see how many t satisfy the condition.

But this still seems inefficient for large n and m.

Let me see if I can find a better way.

Maybe I can consider that for each b, the possible a's are a = b^2 * t - b, for t >=1 such that a <=n.

So, a = b^2 * t - b <=n => t <= (n + b)/b^2

Since t must be integer >=1, the number of valid t's is floor((n + b)/b^2)

But wait, in the sample input 3, n=3, m=5

For b=1: t <= (3 + 1)/1^2 = 4 => t=1,2,3,4 => a=1*1*1 -1=0 (invalid), 1*1*2 -1=1, 1*1*3 -1=2, 1*1*4 -1=3

So a=1,2,3 are valid.

For b=2: t <= (3 + 2)/4 = 1.25 => t=1 => a=4 -2=2, which is <=3, so valid.

For b=3: t <= (3 + 3)/9 = 0.666 => t=1 => a=9 -3=6, which is >3, so invalid.

For b=4: t <= (3 + 4)/16=0.4375, so no t.

For b=5: t <= (3 + 5)/25=0.32, so no t.

Total valid a's: for b=1: a=1,2,3; for b=2: a=2; for b=3: none; b=4: none; b=5: none.

Total pairs: 3 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 =4, which matches the sample output.

So, in this case, floor((n + b)/b^2) gives the number of valid t's, which correspond to valid a's for each b.

Therefore, for each b from 1 to m, the number of valid a's is floor((n + b)/b^2) - 1, because t starts from 1, but we need to ensure a >=1.

Wait, in b=1, floor((3+1)/1)=4, but t=1 gives a=0, which is invalid, so we should subtract 1, giving t from 2 to 4, which are a=1,2,3.

Similarly, for b=2, floor((3+2)/4)=1, t=1 gives a=2, which is valid.

For b=3, floor((3+3)/9)=0, but t=1 gives a=6, which is invalid, so no pairs.

So, the formula seems to be floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((1 + b)/b^2) + 1, but adjusted for validity.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((n + b)/b^2) - floor(b / b^2))

But this seems too convoluted.

An easier way might be to iterate over b from 1 to m, and for each b, compute floor((n + b)/b^2), and subtract the number of invalid t's.

But this still seems inefficient for large n and m.

Let me see if I can find a better approach.

Perhaps I can consider that a = b^2 * t - b <=n => t <= (n + b)/b^2

And t >=1, but t must be such that a >=1, i.e., b^2 * t - b >=1 => t >= (b + 1)/b^2

So, t starts from ceil((b + 1)/b^2) to floor((n + b)/b^2)

Therefore, for each b, the number of t's is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b + 1)/b^2) + 1

But since b >=1, (b + 1)/b^2 can be less than or equal to 1.

For b=1: (1 + 1)/1 = 2, so ceil(2) =2, floor((n +1)/1)=n+1

So, number of t's is (n +1) -2 +1 = n

But earlier, for b=1, n=3, we have t from 2 to4, which is 3 values, which matches n=3.

But in the sample input 3, for b=1, n=3, we have a=1,2,3, which are 3 pairs.

For b=2, n=3, (n + b)/b^2 = (3 +2)/4=1.25, floor=1; ceil((2 +1)/4)=ceil(0.75)=1

So, number of t's is 1 -1 +1=1, which matches a=2.

For b=3, (3 +3)/9=0.666, floor=0; ceil((3 +1)/9)=ceil(0.444)=1

So, 0 -1 +1=0, which matches no pairs.

Similarly for higher b.

So, this seems to work.

Therefore, for each b from 1 to m, the number of valid a's is floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b +1)/b^2) +1, but only if floor((n + b)/b^2) >= ceil((b +1)/b^2).

Otherwise, it's zero.

But implementing this directly would require iterating over each b from 1 to m, which is up to 2*10^6, and with t up to 10^4, this would be too slow.

I need a way to optimize this.

Let me see if I can find a mathematical formula or find patterns in b.

Let me consider the expression floor((n + b)/b^2)

Let me write it as floor((n + b)/b^2) = floor((n/b^2) + (b/b^2)) = floor(n/b^2 + 1/b)

Since b >=1, 1/b <=1, and n/b^2 can be anything.

But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for large b, b^2 is large, so floor((n + b)/b^2) is small.

Maybe I can group b's based on the value of floor((n + b)/b^2)

But this seems similar to the method used in counting the number of divisors or similar problems.

Wait, perhaps I can use the idea of hyperbola method or divisor summation techniques to optimize the calculation.

In problems involving summing floor(n/i), we can group terms with the same value of floor(n/i) to reduce the number of computations.

Similarly, here, for each b, we have floor((n + b)/b^2), which is similar to floor(n/b^2) + floor(b/b^2)

Wait, no.

Wait, (n + b)/b^2 = n/b^2 + b/b^2 = n/b^2 + 1/b

So, floor(n/b^2 + 1/b)

For b >=1, 1/b <=1, so floor(n/b^2 + 1/b) is either floor(n/b^2) or floor(n/b^2) + 1, depending on the fractional part.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each b, floor((n + b)/b^2) is the integer part of (n + b)/b^2.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently for all b from 1 to m.

Given that n and m can be up to 2*10^6, and t up to 10^4, I need an O(m log m) or better solution.

Let me think about the range of b.

For b=1, floor((n +1)/1)=n+1

For b=2, floor((n +2)/4)

...

Up to b=m.

I need to compute sum over b=1 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b +1)/b^2) +1, but only if floor((n + b)/b^2) >= ceil((b +1)/b^2))

But this seems too slow for large m.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute some values.

Wait, let's consider that for b >= sqrt(n), b^2 >= n, so (n + b)/b^2 <= (n + b)/n < 2/n, which for large b approaches zero.

Wait, but b is up to 2*10^6, and n up to 2*10^6, so for b >= sqrt(n), b^2 >= n, so (n + b)/b^2 <= (n + b)/n = 1 + b/n <=1 +1 =2 (when b >=n)

But I need to be careful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over b and group terms with the same floor((n + b)/b^2)

This is similar to the method used in calculating the sum of floor(n/i) efficiently.

In such methods, we observe that floor(n/i) can take on only a limited number of distinct values, and we can find ranges of i where floor(n/i) is constant.

Similarly, here, for each b, floor((n + b)/b^2) can be treated similarly.

So, perhaps I can find all b such that floor((n + b)/b^2) remains constant, and compute the contribution of these b's in one go.

Let me try to implement this idea.

First, for a given b, floor((n + b)/b^2) is equal to some integer k.

I need to find the range of b where floor((n + b)/b^2) remains equal to k.

Let me solve for b in terms of k.

floor((n + b)/b^2) = k

Which implies that k <= (n + b)/b^2 < k +1

Multiplying by b^2 (assuming b >0, which it is):

k * b^2 <= n + b < (k +1) * b^2

This can be written as:

k * b^2 - b <= n < (k +1) * b^2 - b

Wait, no.

Wait, k * b^2 <= n + b < (k +1) * b^2

So, k * b^2 - b <= n < (k +1) * b^2 - b

This seems a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can solve for b in terms of k.

Let me consider that for a fixed k, the values of b where floor((n + b)/b^2) = k.

So, k <= (n + b)/b^2 < k +1

Which is equivalent to:

k * b^2 <= n + b < (k +1) * b^2

Rearranging:

k * b^2 - b <= n < (k +1) * b^2 - b

This still seems complicated.

Maybe I can consider solving for b in terms of k.

Let me consider the inequality:

k * b^2 - b - n <= 0

And

(k +1) * b^2 - b - n >0

These are quadratic inequalities in terms of b.

I can solve these quadratics to find the range of b for each k.

But this seems too involved for my current purpose.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider that for each b, floor((n + b)/b^2) is equal to floor(n/b^2 + 1/b)

Since b >=1, 1/b <=1, so floor(n/b^2 + 1/b) is either floor(n/b^2) or floor(n/b^2) +1, depending on whether n/b^2 + 1/b >= floor(n/b^2) +1

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over possible k values and find the range of b where floor((n + b)/b^2) =k

But this also seems too time-consuming.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should implement the initial approach where for each b from 1 to m, I compute floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b +1)/b^2) +1, but optimize it by grouping terms with the same floor((n + b)/b^2)

This way, I can reduce the number of operations.

Alternatively, since the sum is over floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b +1)/b^2) +1 for each b, and given that n and m are large, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute the sum of floor((n + b)/b^2) for b from 1 to m, and subtract the sum of ceil((b +1)/b^2) for b from 1 to m, plus m.

But this still requires iterating over b from 1 to m.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and m up to 2*10^6, the total time would be around 2*10^10 operations, which is way too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that for b=1, floor((n +1)/1)=n+1

For b=2, floor((n +2)/4)

For b=3, floor((n +3)/9)

...

Up to b=m.

I need to compute sum over b=1 to m of floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b +1)/b^2) +1

But perhaps there's a mathematical formula or a pattern that can be exploited here.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the sum using integrals, but that seems too imprecise for exact counts.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for large b, floor((n + b)/b^2) is approximately floor(n/b^2)

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix t, and find all b such that t <= (n + b)/b^2

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate over t and find the range of b where floor((n + b)/b^2) >= t

But this seems similar to the earlier idea and may not be efficient.

Given time constraints, perhaps I should accept that an O(m) per test case solution is acceptable, given that m can be up to 2*10^6 and t up to 10^4, with the sum of m over all test cases up to 2*10^6.

So, in total, it's about 2*10^6 operations, which should be acceptable.

Therefore, I can proceed with iterating over each b from 1 to m and compute floor((n + b)/b^2) - ceil((b +1)/b^2) +1, and sum them up.

But I need to handle the ceil function correctly.

Ceil((b +1)/b^2) can be computed as ceil(1/b + 1/b^2)

But since b >=1, 1/b <=1 and 1/b^2 <=1, so ceil(1/b + 1/b^2) =1 for b >=1.

Wait, is that correct?

For b=1: ceil((1 +1)/1)=2

For b=2: ceil((2 +1)/4)=ceil(0.75)=1

For b=3: ceil((3 +1)/9)=ceil(0.444)=1

For b=4: ceil((4 +1)/16)=ceil(0.3125)=1

So, for b >=1, ceil((b +1)/b^2) is 2 for b=1 and 1 for b >=2.

Therefore, I can handle b=1 separately.

For b=1, ceil((1 +1)/1)=2

For b >=2, ceil((b +1)/b^2)=1

Therefore, for b >=2, the number of a's is floor((n + b)/b^2) -1 +1 = floor((n + b)/b^2)

For b=1, it's floor((n +1)/1) -2 +1 = floor(n +1) -1 = n +1 -1 =n

But in the sample input 1:

n=1, m=1

For b=1: floor((1 +1)/1)=2 -2 +1=1, which matches.

In sample input 2:

n=2, m=3

For b=1: floor((2 +1)/1)=3 -2 +1=2

For b=2: floor((2 +2)/4)=1 -1 +1=1

For b=3: floor((2 +3)/9)=0 -1 +1=0

Total: 2 +1 +0=3, which matches.

In sample input 3:

n=3, m=5

For b=1: floor((3 +1)/1)=4 -2 +1=3

For b=2: floor((3 +2)/4)=1 -1 +1=1

For b=3: floor((3 +3)/9)=0 -1 +1=0

For b=4: floor((3 +4)/16)=0 -1 +1=0

For b=5: floor((3 +5)/25)=0 -1 +1=0

Total: 3 +1 +0 +0 +0=4, which matches.

In sample input 4:

n=10, m=8

For b=1: floor((10 +1)/1)=11 -2 +1=10

For b=2: floor((10 +2)/4)=3 -1 +1=3

For b=3: floor((10 +3)/9)=1 -1 +1=1

For b=4: floor((10 +4)/16)=1 -1 +1=1

For b=5: floor((10 +5)/25)=0 -1 +1=0

For b=6: floor((10 +6)/36)=0 -1 +1=0

For b=7: floor((10 +7)/49)=0 -1 +1=0

For b=8: floor((10 +8)/64)=0 -1 +1=0

Total:10 +3 +1 +1 +0 +0 +0 +0=15, but the note says 14 pairs.

Wait, discrepancy here.

In the note for the fourth sample input, it lists 14 pairs, but according to this calculation, it's 15.

So, perhaps there's an error.

Wait, in b=1, floor((10 +1)/1)=11 -2 +1=10, but according to the note, there are only 13 pairs for b=1.

Wait,
