Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there's a game being played on a tree structure with n nodes, and it's given that the tree has exactly two leaves, which makes it sort of like an array. There are t rounds, but in this easy version, t is always 1, so I only need to handle one round. Each round starts with a stone on one node, and players take turns moving the stone to an inactive neighbor until no moves are left. Ron goes first, then Hermione, and so on. The player who can't make a move loses.

First, I need to understand the tree structure. Since it's a tree with exactly two leaves, it should be a linear structure, like a linked list or a path graph. That means each node, except the two leaves, has degree 2, and the leaves have degree 1.

So, the tree is essentially a straight line of nodes. That simplifies things because I don't have to deal with branches or complex structures.

Now, the game is about moving the stone along this path, activating nodes as we go. Ron starts first, and they alternate moves until no more moves can be made.

I need to determine, for a given starting node, who wins the game if both players play optimally.

Given that the tree is linear, I can think of this as a game on a line, where each player can move the stone to an adjacent unvisited node.

This sounds similar to games like Nim or other impartial games where the concept of "Nimbers" or "xor" might be applicable, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me try to model this game.

Let's consider the tree as a line of nodes, say n=5:

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5

Suppose the starting node is node 3.

Ron moves first. He can move to either node 2 or node 4.

If he moves to node 2, then Hermione can move to node 1 or node 3.

But node 3 is already active, so she can only move to node 1.

Then Ron can't move anymore, so Hermione wins.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic. Let me see another example.

Take n=3:

2 - 3 - 1

Starting at node 3.

Ron can move to node 2 or node 1.

If he moves to node 2, Hermione moves to node 1, and Ron can't move.

If he moves to node 1, Hermione moves to node 2, and Ron can't move.

So, in both cases, Hermione wins.

But according to the first sample input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

Output: Ron

Wait, that's contradictory to what I just thought.

Wait, let's look at the sample input again.

n=3, t=1

Edges: 2-3 and 3-1

So the tree is 1-3-2

Starting at node 3.

According to the sample output, Ron wins.

But in my earlier reasoning, it seems like Hermione should win.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the definition of "active" nodes is different.

Let me read the problem again.

"Move consists of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there (thus activating this neighbor)."

So, only the nodes that the stone has been moved to are activated.

Wait, no. It says "activating this neighbor". So, when you move the stone to a new node, that node becomes active.

But, the node that the stone is currently on is already active.

Wait, re-reading: "picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the stone there (thus activating this neighbor)."

So, you can only move to inactive neighbors, and when you move there, that neighbor becomes active.

So, in the tree with n=3: 1-3-2

Start at node 3.

Ron's possible moves: to node 1 or node 2.

Say he moves to node 1.

Now, Hermione can only move to node 2 (since node 3 is already active).

Then, Ron can't move anymore, so Hermione wins.

But according to the sample, Ron wins.

So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the player who moves last wins, but according to the problem statement:

"The player that cannot make a move loses the round."

So, the last mover wins.

In the sample, starting at node 3, Ron moves to node 1, Hermione moves to node 2, then Ron can't move, so Hermione wins. But sample output says "Ron".

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the tree.

Wait, the edges are 2-3 and 3-1, which is indeed 1-3-2.

Starting at 3, Ron moves to 1, Hermione moves to 2, Ron can't move, so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the parity of the distance or something like that.

Let me look at another sample.

n=5, t=1

Edges: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5

Starting at node 5.

According to the sample output, "Hermione".

So, starting at node 5, Ron moves to node 4, Hermione moves to node 3, Ron moves to node 2, Hermione moves to node 1, Ron can't move, so Hermione wins.

Which matches the sample output.

But according to the first sample, starting at node 3, Ron wins, but according to my earlier logic, Hermione should win.

Wait, maybe I'm miscounting the moves.

Let me try again with n=3, starting at node 3.

Ron moves to node 1.

Hermione moves to node 2.

Ron can't move. So Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

Wait, maybe the problem is that the player who cannot make a move loses, so the last mover wins.

In the first sample, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's turn, so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of moves made.

In the first sample, starting at node 3.

Ron moves to node 1.

Hermione moves to node 2.

Ron cannot move. So Hermione made the last move, so she wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of moves possible.

In a tree with n nodes, the total number of moves is n-1, since starting from one node, you can move to n-1 other nodes.

Wait, but in the first sample, n=3, so total moves possible is 2.

Ron moves first, then Hermione, so Ron moves first, Hermione moves second, then Ron can't move.

So Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, but sample output is "Ron".

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting.

Wait, maybe the total number of moves is n-1, and if n-1 is odd, then Hermione makes the last move, so she wins.

In the first sample, n=3, n-1=2, which is even, so Ron makes the last move, so he wins.

Wait, that makes sense.

Wait, let's see.

n=3, n-1=2 moves.

Ron moves first (move 1), Hermione moves second (move 2), then no more moves.

So, Hermione makes the last move, but according to the problem, "the player that cannot make a move loses".

So, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's move, so he loses, but sample output is "Ron".

Wait, that's contradictory.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the total number of moves is n-1, and the player who makes the last move wins, but the problem says "the player that cannot make a move loses".

So, if you cannot make a move, you lose, meaning the other player won.

So, in the first sample, Ron cannot move after Hermione's move, so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the parity of the distance from the starting node to the leaves.

Wait, maybe I need to model this game more carefully.

Let me think about the game in terms of game theory.

This is an impartial game, meaning that the set of moves available depends only on the position, not on which player is moving.

In such games, the concept of the "Nimber" or "xor" can be used to determine the winner.

But perhaps there's a simpler way since the tree is a path.

Let me consider the length of the path from the starting node to each leaf.

Since the tree has exactly two leaves, it's a simple path.

Let me denote the length of the path from the starting node to each leaf.

Suppose the path lengths are l1 and l2.

Then, perhaps the game can be modeled as a game of Nim with two heaps of sizes l1 and l2.

In Nim, the winner is determined by the xor of the heap sizes.

If xor is 0, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.

But in this problem, since t=1, I need to see who wins starting from the given node.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of moves each player can make.

In a path of length l, starting from a node, the number of moves is l-1.

But I'm getting more confused.

Let me try to simulate the game for n=3, starting at node 3.

- Ron moves to node 1.

- Hermione moves to node 2.

- Ron cannot move. So Hermione wins.

But sample output is "Ron", which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misreading the sample input.

Wait, in the first sample input:

3 1

2 3

3 1

3

So, n=3, t=1

Edges: 2-3 and 3-1

Starting node: 3

Sample output: Ron

But according to my simulation, Hermione should win.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the game ends when the stone cannot be moved, meaning that there are no inactive neighbors.

In the first move, Ron moves from 3 to 1.

Now, Hermione can move from 1 to 2 (since 3 is already active).

Then, Ron cannot move because the only remaining node is 2, which is already active.

So, Ron cannot make a move, meaning Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the game ends when the current player cannot make a move.

In the first sample, Ron moves first, then Hermione moves, then Ron cannot move, so Ron loses, meaning Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "the player that cannot make a move loses".

So, if Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's turn, then Ron loses, so Hermione wins.

But sample output is "Ron", which suggests that Ron wins.

This inconsistency suggests that maybe I'm misinterpreting the game rules or the sample input.

Wait, maybe the tree is different than I thought.

Wait, edges are 2-3 and 3-1, so indeed 1-3-2.

Starting at 3.

Ron moves to 1.

Hermione moves to 2.

Ron cannot move.

So, Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the starting node is active at the beginning.

Wait, re-reading the problem: "The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated."

So, at the start of each round, there is one active node, which is the starting node.

Moves consist of moving the stone to an inactive neighbor, thus activating it.

The game ends when the current player cannot make a move.

The player who cannot make a move loses.

In the first sample:

n=3, t=1

Edges: 2-3 and 3-1

Starting node: 3

Initial active node: 3

Ron moves to 1, activates it.

Now active nodes: 1,3

Hermione moves to 2, activates it.

Now active nodes: 1,2,3

Ron cannot move because all neighbors are active.

So, Ron loses, Hermione wins.

But sample output is "Ron", which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the moves.

Wait, maybe the player who moves last wins.

In this case, Hermione made the last move, so she wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the player who cannot make a move loses, meaning the previous player wins.

In this case, Ron cannot make a move after Hermione's move, so Hermione wins.

But sample output is "Ron", which suggests that Ron wins.

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the tree structure or the rules.

Wait, maybe the tree is not 1-3-2, but something else.

Wait, in the first sample, edges are 2-3 and 3-1, which indeed forms a path 1-3-2.

Starting at 3.

Ron moves to 1.

Hermione moves to 2.

Ron cannot move.

So, Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the starting node is considered active, and moves can be made to any inactive neighbor.

Wait, perhaps Ron can choose to move to either node 1 or node 2.

If he moves to node 1, then Hermione moves to node 2, and Ron cannot move.

If he moves to node 2, then Hermione moves to node 1, and Ron cannot move.

In both cases, Hermione wins.

But sample output is "Ron", which suggests that Ron wins.

This is confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the game is different based on the parity of the distance.

Wait, perhaps I need to model this game differently.

Let me consider the entire path length.

In a path graph, the game can be modeled as a game of Nim on two heaps corresponding to the distances from the starting node to each leaf.

Wait, perhaps it's about the xor of the distances.

Wait, in the first sample, starting at node 3, distance to leaf 1 is 1, distance to leaf 2 is 1.

1 xor 1 = 0, which would indicate that the second player wins, meaning Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This contradicts.

In the second sample, n=5, starting at node 5.

Distance to leaf 5 is 0 (since it's a leaf), and distance to leaf 1 is 4.

0 xor 4 = 4, which is non-zero, so first player wins, meaning Ron wins, but sample output is "Hermione".

This is inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I calculate the distances.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of moves each player can make.

In the first sample, starting at node 3, total moves possible are 2 (Ron moves to 1, Hermione moves to 2).

Since the number of moves is even, Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, but sample output is "Ron".

In the second sample, starting at node 5, total moves possible are 4 (Ron moves to 4, Hermione moves to 3, Ron moves to 2, Hermione moves to 1).

So, Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, which matches the sample output.

But according to this logic, in the first sample, Hermione should win, but sample output is "Ron".

This suggests that my logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the counting of moves is incorrect.

In the first sample, starting at node 3:

- Ron moves to node 1.

- Hermione moves to node 2.

- Ron cannot move.

So, total moves: 2, which is even, so Hermione makes the last move, so she wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Wait, maybe the problem is that Ron wins if the number of moves is odd, and Hermione wins if it's even.

In the first sample, moves: 2 (even), so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

In the second sample, moves: 4 (even), Hermione wins, which matches the sample output.

This suggests that perhaps the sample output is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the starting move counts as the first move.

Wait, in the first sample:

- Starting at node 3 (already active).

- Ron moves to node 1 (move 1).

- Hermione moves to node 2 (move 2).

- Ron cannot move.

Total moves: 2, which is even, so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps the problem counts the starting position differently.

Wait, maybe the starting position is considered move 0, and then Ron makes move 1, Hermione move 2, etc.

In that case, if the total number of moves is even, Hermione makes the last move, so she wins.

But sample output says "Ron", which contradicts this.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the code provided and see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

from collections import defaultdict

def func():

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

lst = defaultdict(list)

rev = defaultdict(list)

for _ in range(x - 1):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

lst[a].append(b)

rev[b].append(a)

z = int(input())

tmp = z

one = True

while lst[tmp] != []:

one = not one

tmp = lst[tmp].pop()

two = True

tmp = z

while rev[tmp] != []:

two = not two

tmp = rev[tmp].pop()

print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')



So, the code is using two while loops: one following the forward edges and another following the reverse edges.

It seems like it's trying to determine something about the path from the starting node to the leaves.

But I'm not sure exactly what it's doing.

Wait, it's toggling a boolean value 'one' and 'two' each time it moves to a neighboring node.

Starting from the starting node, it follows the forward edges until it can't, counting the number of moves (or something similar).

Then it does the same following the reverse edges.

Then, based on the final state of 'one' and 'two', it decides who wins.

But I don't understand the logic behind it.

Perhaps it's trying to calculate the parity of the path lengths to the two leaves.

Given that the tree has exactly two leaves, and it's a path, the two paths from the starting node to each leaf should have certain parity that determines the winner.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the xor of the two path lengths.

In impartial game theory, the xor of the heap sizes determines the winner.

If xor is 0, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.

In this case, the two path lengths could be considered as two heaps.

In the first sample:

n=3, starting at node 3.

Path lengths to leaves: 1 (to node 1) and 1 (to node 2).

1 xor 1 = 0, so second player wins, which is Hermione, but sample output is "Ron".

In the second sample:

n=5, starting at node 5.

Path lengths to leaves: 0 (to node 5 itself, since it's a leaf) and 4 (to node 1).

0 xor 4 = 4, which is non-zero, so first player wins, which is Ron, but sample output is "Hermione".

This contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust how I calculate the path lengths.

If the starting node is a leaf, then one path length is 0, and the other is n-1.

In the first sample, starting at node 3, which is not a leaf, path lengths are 1 and 1.

In the second sample, starting at node 5, which is a leaf, path lengths are 0 and 4.

According to the Nim game rule, xor of path lengths:

Sample 1: 1 xor 1 = 0, second player wins (Hermione), but sample output is "Ron".

Sample 2: 0 xor 4 = 4, first player wins (Ron), sample output is "Hermione".

This doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to subtract 1 from the path lengths.

In sample 1: (1-1) xor (1-1) = 0 xor 0 = 0, second player wins (Hermione), but sample output is "Ron".

In sample 2: (0-1) xor (4-1) = (-1) xor 3, which is unclear since xor for negative numbers doesn't make sense in this context.

This isn't working.

Perhaps the xor of the path lengths is not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the number of moves each player can make.

In sample 1: n=3, starting at node 3, total moves: 2 (even), so Hermione wins.

Sample output is "Ron", which is incorrect according to this logic.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Looking back at the code:

It has two while loops:

1. Following forward edges from the starting node until no more moves.

2. Following reverse edges from the starting node until no more moves.

Then, it prints "Hermione" if both 'one' and 'two' are True, else "Ron".

In the first while loop, it toggles 'one' each time it moves to a neighboring node following forward edges.

Similarly, it toggles 'two' following reverse edges.

But I'm not sure what 'one' and 'two' represent.

Perhaps they represent the parity of the path lengths to the two leaves.

If both path lengths are even or both are odd, then Hermione wins; otherwise, Ron wins.

In sample 1: path lengths are both 1 (odd), so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

Contradiction.

In sample 2: path lengths are 0 (even) and 4 (even), both even, so Hermione wins, which matches the sample output "Hermione".

So, perhaps the code is incorrectly implementing this logic.

Wait, perhaps 'one' and 'two' are indicating whether the path lengths are odd.

If both are odd, Hermione wins; else, Ron wins.

In sample 1: both odd, so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron", which contradicts.

Wait, maybe it's checking if both are True, meaning both paths are odd, then Hermione wins; otherwise, Ron wins.

But in sample 1, both are odd, so Hermione should win, but sample output is "Ron".

This suggests that the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is intended to check if both paths are even, then Hermione wins; else, Ron wins.

In sample 1: both odd, so Ron wins.

In sample 2: both even, so Hermione wins.

This matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the logic is:

- If both path lengths are even, Hermione wins.

- Otherwise, Ron wins.

But in the first sample, both path lengths are odd, which would mean Ron wins, as per the sample output.

Wait, but according to the Nim game rule, xor of two odd numbers is even, which would suggest second player wins, which is Hermione, but sample output is "Ron".

This is confusing.

Perhaps the code is correct, and my earlier simulation was wrong.

Let me try to think differently.

Since the tree is a path with two leaves, the game is equivalent to a game on a line.

The starting position is some node on the line, and players take turns moving the stone towards one of the leaves.

Each move must be to an adjacent unvisited node.

The game ends when a player cannot move, meaning all adjacent nodes have been visited.

In such a game, the winner is determined by the parity of the number of moves that can be made.

If the total number of moves is even, the second player wins; if odd, the first player wins.

In the first sample:

n=3, starting at node 3.

Total moves: 2 (even), so second player (Hermione) wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This suggests that either the sample output is incorrect or my logic is wrong.

In the second sample:

n=5, starting at node 5.

Total moves: 4 (even), so second player (Hermione) wins, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting the total moves.

In the first sample:

n=3, starting at node 3.

- Ron moves to node 1.

- Hermione moves to node 2.

- Ron cannot move.

Total moves: 2 (even), so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This suggests that the sample output might be wrong, or there's something I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps the total number of moves is n-1, which is 2 in the first sample.

But in the second sample, n=5, starting at node 5.

- Ron moves to 4.

- Hermione moves to 3.

- Ron moves to 2.

- Hermione moves to 1.

- Ron cannot move.

Total moves: 4 (even), so Hermione wins, which matches the sample output.

So, according to this, in the first sample, moves are 2, which is even, so Hermione wins, but sample output is "Ron".

This suggests that the sample output might be incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the counting includes the
