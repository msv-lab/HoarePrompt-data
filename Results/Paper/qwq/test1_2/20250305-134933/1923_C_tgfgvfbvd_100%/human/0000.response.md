Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an array `c` of length `n`, and each element is positive. Then, there are `q` queries, each asking whether a subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" based on the definition provided.

First, I need to understand what makes a subarray "good." According to the problem, a subarray is good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in the subarray `a` is equal to the sum of elements in `b`.

2. For every index `i`, `a_i` is not equal to `b_i`.

3. All elements in `b` are positive integers.

So, I need to determine for each query whether such an array `b` exists for the given subarray.

Let me try to rephrase this. Given a subarray `a` of length `m`, I need to find another array `b` of length `m` where:

- Sum of `a` equals sum of `b`.

- For every `i`, `a_i != b_i`.

- All `b_i > 0`.

I need to figure out the conditions under which this is possible.

Let's consider some examples to build intuition.

Example 1:

Suppose `a = [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` (from the sample input).

Query 1: subarray from index 1 to 5: [1,2,1,4,5]

Sum is 1+2+1+4+5 = 13.

I need to find `b = [b1,b2,b3,b4,b5]` where:

- b1 + b2 + b3 + b4 + b5 = 13.

- b1 != 1, b2 != 2, b3 != 1, b4 != 4, b5 != 5.

- All b_i > 0.

Is this possible? Yes, for example, b = [2,1,2,3,5]. Sum is 13, all b_i > 0, and none match the corresponding a_i.

Another possible b: [2,3,2,4,2]. Sum is 13, all positive, and no matches.

So, for this query, the answer is YES.

Query 2: subarray from index 4 to 4: [4]

Sum is 4.

Need b = [b1] where:

- b1 = 4.

- b1 != 4.

- b1 > 0.

This is impossible because b1 cannot be equal to 4, but it must sum to 4. So, only b1=4 would satisfy the sum, but it must be different. Hence, NO.

Query 3: subarray from index 3 to 4: [1,4]

Sum is 5.

Need b = [b1,b2] where:

- b1 + b2 = 5.

- b1 != 1, b2 != 4.

- b1 > 0, b2 > 0.

Possible b: [2,3]. Sum is 5, both positive, and neither equals their corresponding a_i. Another option: [3,2]. Sum is 5, both positive, and no matches.

Hence, YES.

Query 4: subarray from index 1 to 3: [1,2,1]

Sum is 4.

Need b = [b1,b2,b3] where:

- b1 + b2 + b3 = 4.

- b1 != 1, b2 != 2, b3 != 1.

- All b_i > 0.

Is this possible? Let's see:

Option 1: [2,1,1]. Sum is 4, but b2 = 1, which matches a2 = 2 (wait, no, a2=2, b2=1, so it's different). Similarly, b1=2 != a1=1, b3=1 != a3=1. So, this should be acceptable. But looking back at the sample output, it's NO. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, in this option, b1=2, b2=1, b3=1. Sum is 4, all positive, and none match their corresponding a_i. So why is the sample output NO? Maybe I made a mistake.

Let me check another option: [1,2,1]. Sum is 4, but b1=1==a1=1, which violates the condition. Not acceptable.

Wait, but earlier I thought [2,1,1] is acceptable, but sample output is NO. Maybe there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires that b_i > 0 and b_i != a_i for all i, and the sum must be equal to the sum of a.

But in my earlier example, [2,1,1] seems valid. Maybe the sample input has different values.

Wait, in the sample input, n=5, q=4, array is [1,2,1,4,5], queries are [1-5,4-4,3-4,1-3].

Sample output is YES, NO, YES, NO.

But according to my earlier reasoning, query 4 should be YES, but sample output is NO. Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me think of another approach.

Suppose I have a subarray of length m, with sum S.

I need to find another array b of length m, with sum S, b_i > 0, and b_i != a_i for all i.

I can think of it as adjusting each a_i to b_i, with the constraints that b_i != a_i and b_i > 0, and the total sum remains S.

Since b_i != a_i, and b_i > 0, one way to approach this is to try to adjust each a_i by either increasing or decreasing it, ensuring that the total sum doesn't change.

Wait, but that seems vague. Maybe I need a better strategy.

Let me consider the minimal and maximal possible sums for b.

Since b_i > 0 and b_i != a_i, the minimal b_i is max(1, a_i - 1), because if a_i > 1, b_i can be a_i - 1, else if a_i == 1, b_i must be at least 2.

Wait, no. Since b_i > 0 and b_i != a_i, if a_i == 1, b_i can be 2 or more. If a_i > 1, b_i can be anything except a_i, but must be positive.

But to minimize the sum, b_i should be as small as possible, given these constraints.

Similarly, to maximize the sum, b_i can be arbitrarily large, as long as b_i != a_i.

But in this problem, since the sum of b must equal the sum of a, I need to ensure that the adjustments I make to each a_i to get b_i don't change the total sum.

This seems tricky. Maybe there's a smarter way to look at it.

Let me consider the differences between a_i and b_i.

Since sum(b) = sum(a), and b_i != a_i for all i, I need to adjust each a_i to some b_i != a_i, such that the total sum remains the same.

This implies that the sum of (b_i - a_i) over all i should be zero.

Also, b_i > 0, and b_i != a_i.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can look for necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a b.

Let me consider the minimal possible sum of b, given the constraints.

For each a_i, the minimal possible b_i is either a_i - 1 (if a_i > 1), or 2 (if a_i == 1).

Wait, no. Since b_i must be positive and different from a_i.

So, if a_i == 1, b_i can be >=2.

If a_i > 1, b_i can be either >= a_i +1 or <= a_i -1, but must be >0.

So, the minimal b_i is:

- If a_i == 1, b_i >=2.

- If a_i > 1, b_i >=1, but not equal to a_i.

Wait, but b_i must be >0 and != a_i.

So, for a_i >1, b_i can be from 1 to a_i-1 or a_i+1 to infinity.

But to minimize the sum, we'd choose b_i as small as possible, which is max(1, a_i-1).

Wait, but if a_i ==1, b_i >=2.

If a_i ==2, b_i can be 1 or 3,4,5,...

So minimal b_i is 1.

Wait, but if a_i ==2, b_i can be 1 or >=3.

So minimal b_i is 1.

Similarly, if a_i ==1, minimal b_i is 2.

Wait, but if a_i ==1, b_i >=2.

If a_i >1, b_i can be 1 or >= a_i +1.

So, for each a_i, the minimal b_i is:

- If a_i ==1, b_i =2.

- If a_i >1, b_i =1.

But wait, if a_i >1, b_i can be 1, which is allowed since b_i != a_i.

Unless a_i ==1, in which case b_i >=2.

So, in general, for each a_i:

- If a_i ==1, b_i >=2.

- If a_i >1, b_i >=1.

But b_i != a_i.

Wait, but if a_i >1, b_i can be 1, which is allowed.

So, the minimal b_i is:

- If a_i ==1, b_i =2.

- If a_i >1, b_i =1.

So, the minimal possible sum of b is sum of these minimal b_i's.

Now, for the sum of b to equal the sum of a, the sum of a should be at least this minimal sum of b.

But in addition, since b_i != a_i for all i, there might be more constraints.

Wait, but if the sum of a is equal to the sum of these minimal b_i's, and we set b_i to the minimal b_i for each i, then b_i != a_i for all i, and sum(b) = sum(a), so it should be acceptable.

But in the earlier example, for query 4: subarray [1,2,1], sum(a)=4.

Minimal sum of b:

- For a_i=1, b_i=2.

- For a_i=2, b_i=1.

- For a_i=1, b_i=2.

So, sum(b)=2+1+2=5, which is greater than sum(a)=4.

Wait, but in this case, sum(b)=5 > sum(a)=4, which doesn't satisfy sum(b)=sum(a).

But according to the earlier sample output, it's NO.

Wait, but according to my earlier thought, since minimal sum of b is 5, which is greater than sum(a)=4, it's impossible to have sum(b)=4 while setting b_i >= minimal b_i.

Hence, the answer is NO.

Ah, I see. So, in general, for the subarray to be good, the sum of a should be at least the sum of minimal b_i's.

But in this case, sum(a)=4 < sum(minimal b_i's)=5, hence impossible.

Similarly, in query 1: [1,2,1,4,5], sum(a)=13, sum(minimal b_i's)=2+1+2+1+1=7, which is less than 13, so it's possible.

Wait, but earlier I thought sum(minimal b_i's)=2+1+2+1+1=7, which is less than sum(a)=13, but actually, for sum(b)=sum(a)=13, and minimal sum of b_i's is 7, which is less than 13, so it's possible to adjust b_i's to reach sum=13.

But in query 4: sum(a)=4 < sum(minimal b_i's)=5, hence impossible.

Wait, but in query 3: [1,4], sum(a)=5, sum(minimal b_i's)=2+1=3, which is less than 5, so it's possible.

Indeed, in the sample output, it's YES.

And query 2: [4], sum(a)=4, sum(minimal b_i's)=1 (since a_i=4, minimal b_i=1), which is less than 4, but is 1 !=4? Yes, but sum is not equal.

Wait, sum(b)=1 != sum(a)=4.

So, in this case, sum(a)=4, sum(minimal b_i's)=1, but to have sum(b)=4, while b_i >= minimal b_i's.

But b_i can be larger than minimal b_i's.

Wait, in this case, for a single element a_i=4, b_i can be any positive integer except 4.

So, b_i >=1, b_i !=4.

To have sum(b)=4, b_i=4 is not allowed, so it's impossible.

Hence, the condition sum(a) >= sum(minimal b_i's) is necessary, but not sufficient.

Because in query 2, sum(a)=4 >= sum(minimal b_i's)=1, but it's still impossible because b_i cannot be equal to a_i.

So, perhaps there's a different approach needed.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a subarray of length m.

I need to change each a_i to some b_i != a_i, b_i >0, and sum(b) = sum(a).

One way to approach this is to adjust some a_i's up and some down, such that the total sum remains the same.

But since b_i != a_i, for each a_i, b_i can be either less than a_i or greater than a_i.

But b_i must be positive.

So, for each a_i:

- If a_i ==1, b_i >=2.

- If a_i >1, b_i >=1, but b_i != a_i.

So, for a_i ==1, b_i >=2.

For a_i >1, b_i can be from 1 to a_i-1, or a_i+1 to infinity.

Now, to make sum(b) = sum(a), I need to ensure that the adjustments I make to each a_i cancel each other out.

Wait, more precisely, the sum of (b_i - a_i) over all i should be zero.

Given that, and the constraints on b_i, it's similar to finding a set of adjustments delta_i = b_i - a_i, where delta_i !=0, and sum(delta_i)=0, and b_i >0.

But this seems a bit too general.

Maybe I can look for sufficient conditions.

One idea is that if there are at least two elements in the subarray that can be adjusted in opposite directions, then it might be possible.

Wait, for example, if there are elements that can be increased and elements that can be decreased, then I can balance them to keep the sum the same.

But in the case where all elements are 1, for example, subarray [1,1,1], sum(a)=3.

Then, minimal sum of b is 2+2+2=6, which is greater than sum(a)=3.

Hence, impossible.

Similarly, if subarray is [2], sum(a)=2.

Minimal b_i=1, but sum(b)=1 < sum(a)=2, so impossible.

But if subarray is [3], sum(a)=3.

Minimal b_i=1, but 1 !=3, so b_i=1 is allowed.

But sum(b)=1 < sum(a)=3.

So, I need to set b_i=3, but b_i cannot be equal to a_i.

Hence, impossible.

Wait, but b_i can be greater than a_i.

So, for a_i=3, b_i can be 1,2,4,5,...

To have sum(b)=3, I can set b_i=1+ some positive integers, but since m=1, it's impossible.

Hence, NO.

Another example: subarray [1,2], sum(a)=3.

Minimal sum of b is 2+1=3.

So, sum(b)=3=sum(a), and b_i !=a_i for both i.

Hence, YES.

Similarly, subarray [1,1], sum(a)=2.

Minimal sum of b is 2+2=4, which is greater than sum(a)=2.

Hence, impossible.

Wait, but in this case, sum(a)=2 < sum(minimal b_i's)=4.

Hence, NO.

Another example: subarray [1,2,1], sum(a)=4.

Minimal sum of b is 2+1+2=5 >4.

Hence, NO.

Which matches the sample output.

Wait, but earlier I thought [2,1,1] is acceptable, but actually, sum is 4, which is less than the minimal sum of b_i's, which is 5.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust b_i's differently.

Wait, if I set b=[2,1,1], sum is 4, which matches sum(a)=4, and b_i !=a_i for all i.

But according to the minimal sum approach, sum(b)=4 < sum(minimal b_i's)=5, which suggests it's impossible.

But I have an example where it's possible.

Wait, maybe there's a flaw in this approach.

Let me think again.

In the case of [1,2,1], sum(a)=4.

Possible b=[2,1,1], sum=4, b_i !=a_i for all i.

So, it seems possible.

But according to the minimal sum approach, sum(minimal b_i's)=2+1+2=5 >4, which suggests it's impossible.

But in reality, [2,1,1] is a valid b.

Hence, the minimal sum approach is not correct.

So, perhaps I need a different condition.

Let me consider the difference between a_i and b_i.

Since sum(b) = sum(a), then sum(b_i - a_i) =0.

Also, for each i, b_i - a_i !=0, and b_i >0.

So, for each i:

- If a_i ==1, b_i >=2, so b_i - a_i >=1.

- If a_i >1, b_i can be from 1 to a_i-1 or a_i+1 to infinity.

So, b_i - a_i can be from 1 - a_i (if b_i=1) up to infinity.

But b_i - a_i !=0.

So, for a_i >1, b_i - a_i can be from 1 - a_i to -1 or from 1 to infinity, skipping 0.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different condition.

Let me consider the number of elements that can be decreased and those that can be increased.

For each a_i:

- If a_i >1, I can decrease it to b_i=1, which reduces the sum by a_i -1.

- If a_i ==1, I can increase it to b_i=2, which increases the sum by 1.

So, for each a_i:

- If a_i >1, I can reduce the sum by up to a_i -1.

- If a_i ==1, I can increase the sum by at least 1.

So, I can model this as a flow network, where I can either decrease the sum by up to a_i -1 for each a_i >1, or increase it by at least 1 for each a_i ==1.

And I need the total sum of adjustments to be zero.

But this seems too involved for an online programming problem.

Maybe there's a simpler condition.

Let me consider the minimal number of increases and decreases needed.

Suppose I have k elements with a_i ==1, and m - k elements with a_i >1.

For each a_i ==1, I need to increase b_i by at least 1 (from 1 to at least 2).

For each a_i >1, I can decrease b_i by up to a_i -1.

To balance the sum, the total increase should equal the total decrease.

So, the total increase is at least k (since each a_i==1 must be increased by at least 1).

The total decrease is at most sum(a_i -1) over all a_i >1.

Hence, for the subarray to be good, the total increase should be less than or equal to the total decrease.

That is, k <= sum(a_i -1) over all a_i >1.

But wait, in the earlier example [1,2,1], k=2 (a_i==1), sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1) = (2-1) =1.

So, k=2 > sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=1, which suggests it's not good, which matches the sample output of NO.

In query 3: [1,4], k=1, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=4-1=3.

So, k=1 <=3, hence YES.

In query 1: [1,2,1,4,5], k=2, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=(2-1)+(4-1)+(5-1)=1+3+4=8.

So, 2 <=8, hence YES.

In query 2: [4], k=0, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=4-1=3.

So, 0 <=3, but in this case, it's a single element, so it's impossible as discussed earlier.

Wait, but according to this condition, it should be YES, but in reality, it's NO.

Hence, this condition is not sufficient.

So, perhaps I need a stricter condition.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the total increase is less than or equal to the total possible decrease, and also consider the length of the subarray.

Wait, perhaps if the subarray has only one element, it's impossible unless certain conditions are met.

Wait, in query 2: [4], k=0, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=3.

So, 0 <=3, but since it's only one element, it's impossible to have b_i != a_i and sum(b)=sum(a).

Hence, maybe I need to add a condition that the subarray has at least two elements.

So, the condition is:

- If m >=2, then k <= sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1).

- If m ==1, then it's impossible.

Is that it?

Let's check with the sample queries.

Query 1: m=5 >=2, k=2 <=8, YES.

Query 2: m=1, NO.

Query 3: m=2 >=2, k=1 <=3, YES.

Query 4: m=3 >=2, k=2 <=8-3=?(wait, no, earlier calculation was k=2, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=1, which is 2 >1, so NO.

Wait, but in query 4, [1,2,1], sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=(2-1)=1, k=2 >1, hence NO.

Hence, this condition seems to hold.

So, the general condition is:

- If m ==1, then NO.

- If m >=2, then k <= sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1), where k is the number of a_i ==1.

If this condition is satisfied, then the subarray is good, else not.

This seems to work for the sample inputs.

Let me verify with some more examples.

Example 1: subarray [1,2,1,4,5], m=5 >=2, k=2, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=1+3+4=8, 2 <=8, YES.

Example 2: [4], m=1, NO.

Example 3: [1,4], m=2 >=2, k=1, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=3, 1 <=3, YES.

Example 4: [1,2,1], m=3 >=2, k=2, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=1, 2 >1, NO.

Another example: [2,2], m=2 >=2, k=0, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=1+1=2, 0 <=2, YES.

Possible b: [1,3], sum=4, which equals sum(a)=2+2=4, and b_i !=a_i for both i.

Another example: [3,1], m=2 >=2, k=1, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=2, 1 <=2, YES.

Possible b: [2,2], sum=4, which equals sum(a)=3+1=4, and b_i !=a_i for both i.

Seems correct.

Another example: [1,1], m=2 >=2, k=2, sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1)=0, 2 >0, NO.

Indeed, sum(a)=2, minimal sum of b=2+2=4 >2, impossible.

Hence, this condition seems sufficient and necessary.

So, in code, for each query, I need to:

- Check if m >=2.

- Count k, the number of a_i ==1.

- Compute sum(a_i -1) for all a_i >1.

- Check if k <= sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1).

- If yes, print YES; else, NO.

This should be efficient enough, given the constraints.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())

l = list(map(int, input().split()))

p = [0]

c = [0]

(i, j) = (0, 0)

for x in l:

if x == 1:

j += 1

i += x

p.append(i)

c.append(j)

else:

i += x

p.append(i)

c.append(j)

for _ in range(m):

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())

i = c[b] - c[a - 1]

s = p[b] - p[a - 1]

if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

It seems to be implementing prefix sums for the count of 1's and the sum of the array.

Let's see:

- p is the prefix sum of the array.

- c is the prefix count of 1's in the array.

Then, for each query, it computes:

- i = c[b] - c[a-1], which is the number of 1's in the subarray from a to b.

- s = p[b] - p[a-1], which is the sum of the subarray from a to b.

Then, it checks if (b - a +1) >1 and s - (b - a +1) >= i.

Wait, s - (b - a +1) is the same as sum(a_i -1 for all a_i in the subarray).

Because sum(a_i) - number of elements = sum(a_i -1 for all a_i).

But in our condition, we have k <= sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1).

But in the code, it's checking s - (b - a +1) >= i, which is sum(a_i -1 for all a_i) >= number of 1's in the subarray.

But sum(a_i -1 for all a_i) = sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1) + sum(a_i -1 for a_i ==1).

But sum(a_i -1 for a_i ==1) = sum(0 for a_i ==1) =0.

Wait, no, a_i ==1, a_i -1 =0.

So, sum(a_i -1 for all a_i) = sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1) + sum(0 for a_i ==1) = sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1).

Hence, s - (b - a +1) = sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1).

And i is the number of 1's in the subarray.

So, the condition s - (b - a +1) >= i is equivalent to sum(a_i -1 for a_i >1) >= k.

Which matches our earlier condition.

Additionally, it checks that m >=2 (b - a +1 >1).

Hence, the condition in the code is correct.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{Correctness: True}}\]
