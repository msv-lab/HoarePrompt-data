Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, such that when I add y to the greatest common divisor of x and y, I get the maximum possible value. And I have to do this for multiple test cases.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x, y) is. GCD stands for Greatest Common Divisor, which is the largest positive integer that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6, 4) is 2, as you mentioned.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x, y) + y. I need to find y (1 ≤ y < x) that makes this sum as large as possible.

Let me think about how gcd(x, y) behaves. If y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is equal to y. Because y divides x perfectly. So, in that case, gcd(x, y) + y would be y + y = 2y.

If y is not a divisor of x, then gcd(x, y) is some smaller number that divides both x and y.

So, if y is a divisor of x, the sum is 2y. If y is not a divisor of x, the sum is less than 2y because gcd(x, y) would be less than y.

Therefore, to maximize gcd(x, y) + y, it seems beneficial to choose y as a divisor of x, so that the sum is 2y.

But wait, y has to be less than x, so y can't be equal to x.

So, among all divisors of x that are less than x, the largest y would give the maximum sum of 2y.

Therefore, the optimal y should be the largest divisor of x that is less than x.

Let me test this idea with an example.

Take x = 10.

Divisors of 10 that are less than 10 are: 1, 2, 5.

The largest is 5.

So, y = 5.

gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10.

Is there any y less than 10 that can give a larger sum?

Let's try y = 6.

gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8, which is less than 10.

y = 7.

gcd(10, 7) + 7 = 1 + 7 = 8.

y = 1.

gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, indeed, y = 5 gives the maximum sum.

Another example: x = 7.

Divisors less than 7: 1.

So, y = 1.

gcd(7, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2.

Is there a better y?

y = 6.

gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7.

Wait, that's larger than 2.

So, in this case, y = 6 gives a larger sum than y = 1.

But 6 is not a divisor of 7, so gcd(7, 6) is 1.

So, sum is 1 + 6 = 7.

Is there any y that gives more than 7?

y = 2.

gcd(7, 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3.

y = 3.

gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4.

y = 4.

gcd(7, 4) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5.

y = 5.

gcd(7, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6.

y = 6.

gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7.

So, y = 6 is the best choice.

Wait, but 6 is not a divisor of 7.

So, my initial assumption that y should be the largest divisor of x less than x is not always correct.

In this case, y = 6 is better than y = 1.

So, perhaps I need to consider not only divisors but all y less than x.

But in the case of x = 10, y = 5 (a divisor) is better than y = 6 (not a divisor).

Wait, y = 5 gives 10, y = 6 gives 8.

Wait, no, earlier I thought y = 5 gives 10, but in the example output, y = 5 for x = 10.

Wait, but in the second example, x = 7, y = 6 gives 7, which is larger than y = 1 giving 2.

But according to the problem, for x = 7, the output is 6.

Wait, but in the sample input, for x = 7, the output is 6.

Wait, no, looking back at the sample input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

And the corresponding output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

So, for x = 7, y = 6 is chosen, which makes sense because it gives gcd(7,6)+6 = 1+6=7, which is larger than choosing y=1.

For x=10, y=5 is chosen, which gives gcd(10,5)+5=5+5=10, which is larger than y=6 giving 2+6=8.

So, in some cases, choosing y as a divisor is better, in others, choosing a non-divisor is better.

Wait, but in x=7, y=6 is better than y=1, which is the only divisor less than x.

In x=10, y=5 (a divisor) is better than y=6 (not a divisor).

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose y such that gcd(x,y) is as large as possible, but y is as large as possible.

Wait, but gcd(x,y) is at most x, but y has to be less than x.

Wait, no, gcd(x,y) is at most the greatest common divisor, which is x if y is x, but y has to be less than x.

So, gcd(x,y) is at most x/2, but not necessarily.

Wait, for example, x=10, y=5, gcd=5.

x=7, y=6, gcd=1.

x=21, y=18, gcd=3.

Wait, in x=21, y=18, gcd(21,18)=3, so sum is 3+18=21.

Is there a better y for x=21?

Let's see:

y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, sum=21.

y=20: gcd(21,20)=1, sum=21.

Wait, 1+20=21, same as y=18.

y=19: gcd(21,19)=1, sum=1+19=20.

So, y=18 and y=20 both give sum=21, which is the maximum.

But in the sample output, y=18 is chosen for x=21.

So, any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

So, perhaps the strategy is to choose y as large as possible such that gcd(x,y) is maximized.

Wait, but in x=7, y=6 gives gcd=1, which is not the maximum possible gcd.

Because, for x=7, the possible gcd with y less than 7 are only 1, since 7 is prime.

So, in that case, y=6 gives gcd=1, which is the only option.

For x=10, y=5 gives gcd=5, which is better than y=6 giving gcd=2.

Wait, but in x=100, y=98 gives gcd(100,98)=2, sum=2+98=100.

Is there a better y?

y=50: gcd(100,50)=50, sum=50+50=100.

y=75: gcd(100,75)=25, sum=25+75=100.

y=25: gcd(100,25)=25, sum=25+25=50.

So, y=50 gives sum=100, same as y=98.

So, multiple y can achieve the maximum sum.

In the sample output for x=100, y=98 is chosen.

So, it's acceptable to choose any y that achieves the maximum sum.

So, the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum.

Now, to generalize, what is the maximum possible sum?

Well, from the examples, it seems that the maximum sum is equal to x + gcd(x, y), because gcd(x, y) + y ≤ x + gcd(x, y), but y < x, so it's less than x + gcd(x, y).

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think differently.

Let’s consider that for any y, gcd(x, y) divides x and y.

So, gcd(x, y) divides y, and y < x.

So, gcd(x, y) is a divisor of x.

Let’s denote d = gcd(x, y).

Then, y = k * d, where k is some integer greater than or equal to 1.

Since y < x, k < x / d.

Also, since d divides x, x = m * d for some integer m.

So, y = k * d, with k < m.

So, y can be any multiple of d that is less than x.

Now, the sum gcd(x, y) + y = d + k * d = d(k + 1).

We need to maximize d(k + 1), given that k < m = x / d.

So, for a fixed d, the maximum k is m - 1.

So, the sum is d(k + 1) ≤ d(m - 1 + 1) = d * m = x.

Wait, but y < x, so y cannot be equal to x.

So, the sum is less than x + d.

But, since d divides x, and d ≤ x, the sum is less than or equal to x + d - d = x.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Let me try another approach.

Let’s consider that for any y, gcd(x, y) + y ≤ x + gcd(x, y) - d, since y < x.

But this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should look back at the sample inputs and see if there's a pattern.

Sample inputs:

x=10, y=5, sum=10

x=7, y=6, sum=7

x=21, y=18, sum=21

x=100, y=98, sum=100

x=2, y=1, sum=2

x=1000, y=750, sum=750 + gcd(1000,750)=750 + 250=1000

x=6, y=3, sum=3 + 3=6

So, in these cases, the sum is equal to x when x is prime (like x=7, sum=7), and equal to x when x is composite.

Wait, x=10, sum=10; x=7, sum=7; x=21, sum=21; x=100, sum=100; x=2, sum=2; x=1000, sum=1000; x=6, sum=6.

Wait, actually, in all these cases, the sum equals x.

Wait, no, for x=10, y=5 gives sum=10; x=7, y=6 gives sum=7; x=21, y=18 gives sum=21; x=100, y=98 gives sum=98 + 2=100; x=2, y=1 gives sum=1 + 1=2; x=1000, y=750 gives sum=750 + 250=1000; x=6, y=3 gives sum=3 + 3=6.

So, in all these cases, sum equals x.

Is this always the case?

Let me check for x=8.

Possible y values:

y=1: gcd=1, sum=2

y=2: gcd=2, sum=4

y=3: gcd=1, sum=4

y=4: gcd=4, sum=8

y=5: gcd=1, sum=6

y=6: gcd=2, sum=8

y=7: gcd=1, sum=8

So, the maximum sum is 8, achieved by y=4, y=6, and y=7.

So, sum equals x again.

Another example: x=9.

Possible y values:

y=1: sum=2

y=2: sum=1+2=3

y=3: sum=3+3=6

y=4: sum=1+4=5

y=5: sum=1+5=6

y=6: sum=3+6=9

y=7: sum=1+7=8

y=8: sum=1+8=9

So, maximum sum is 9, achieved by y=6 and y=8.

Again, sum equals x.

Hmm, seems like in all these cases, the maximum sum is equal to x.

Is this always true?

Let me see for x=4.

Possible y values:

y=1: sum=1+1=2

y=2: sum=2+2=4

y=3: sum=1+3=4

So, maximum sum is 4.

Another example: x=5.

Possible y values:

y=1: sum=1+1=2

y=2: sum=1+2=3

y=3: sum=1+3=4

y=4: sum=1+4=5

So, maximum sum is 5.

Seems consistent.

Wait, is there a general rule that the maximum sum is equal to x?

Let me think.

If I choose y such that y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Wait, let's consider y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Then, gcd(x, y) = gcd(x, x - d) = gcd(x, d) = d.

So, sum is d + (x - d) = x.

So, for y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, the sum is x.

And since y < x, y = x - d is valid for any divisor d of x except d=x.

So, for any x, there are multiple y that satisfy sum = x.

Therefore, the maximum possible sum is x.

And any y that is y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will achieve this sum.

So, to solve the problem, I can choose any y that is y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

In the sample inputs:

x=10, y=5: 10-5=5, which is a divisor of 10.

x=7, y=6: 7-6=1, which is a divisor of 7.

x=21, y=18: 21-18=3, which is a divisor of 21.

x=100, y=98: 100-98=2, which is a divisor of 100.

x=2, y=1: 2-1=1, which is a divisor of 2.

x=1000, y=750: 1000-750=250, which is a divisor of 1000.

x=6, y=3: 6-3=3, which is a divisor of 6.

So, this strategy works for all the sample inputs.

Therefore, a general approach is to find any divisor d of x, calculate y = x - d, and output y.

But, to maximize the sum, which is x, any y = x - d where d is a divisor of x will work.

So, I can choose any d that divides x, then y = x - d.

For example, for x=10, d=5, y=5.

For x=7, d=1, y=6.

For x=21, d=3, y=18.

And so on.

So, in the program, I can find any divisor d of x (for example, d=1), then y = x - 1.

But in some cases, like x=7, y=6 is acceptable.

But, to make it efficient, perhaps choosing d=1 always is acceptable, because d=1 always divides x.

So, y = x - 1.

But, in some cases, y = x - 1 might not be the best choice in terms of gcd, but since the sum is x regardless, any y = x - d where d divides x is acceptable.

But to simplify, choosing d=1 always works, as 1 divides every x, and y = x - 1.

So, y = x - 1 is always a valid choice.

For example:

x=10, y=9, but 9 does not divide 10, but y=9 would give gcd(10,9)=1, sum=10.

Which is the same as y=5 giving sum=10.

So, y=9 is acceptable, but in the sample, y=5 is chosen.

But since any y that achieves the sum=x is acceptable, choosing y=x-1 is always acceptable.

So, in the program, I can simply set y = x - 1 and output y.

But, in the given program, it's iterating through all possible y and calculating gcd(x,y)+y to find the maximum.

Is this necessary?

Well, according to my reasoning, I can simply set y = x - 1, since d=1 always divides x, and y = x - 1 will give sum = x.

But, perhaps for some x, y = x - 1 is not the best choice in terms of gcd, but as per the problem, any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

So, y = x - 1 is always acceptable.

Therefore, the program can be simplified to read x, set y = x - 1, and print y.

But, the given program is iterating through all y from 1 to x-1, calculating gcd(x,y)+y, and keeping track of the y that gives the maximum sum.

This is correct, but not necessary, since we can directly compute y = x - 1.

But, since the constraints are small (x ≤ 1000 and t ≤ 1000), the given program will run efficiently enough.

But, it's redundant work.

So, the given program is correct, but not optimal.

But, as per the problem, it's acceptable.

Now, looking at the given program:

from math import gcd

def func():
n: int = int(input(''))
for _ in range(n):
x: int = int(input(''))
max = -1
argmax_y = -1
for y in range(1, x):
eq = gcd(x, y) + y
if eq > max:
max = eq
argmax_y = y
print(argmax_y)

So, it reads n, the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads x, then iterates y from 1 to x-1, computes gcd(x,y) + y, and keeps track of the y that gives the maximum sum.

Finally, prints that y.

This is correct, as per the problem requirements.

But, as per my earlier reasoning, it's unnecessary to iterate through all y, since y = x - 1 is always acceptable.

But, the given program correctly finds the y that maximizes gcd(x,y) + y.

So, it's correct.

Therefore, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for a given integer \( x \).

## Approach
1. **Understanding GCD**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.
2. **Maximizing the Expression**: To maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \), we need to consider values of \( y \) that are less than \( x \) and give a high GCD with \( x \).
3. **Optimal Choice of \( y \)**: It turns out that choosing \( y = x - d \), where \( d \) is a divisor of \( x \), maximizes the expression because \( \gcd(x, y) = d \) and \( y = x - d \), leading to \( \gcd(x, y) + y = d + (x - d) = x \).
4. **Simplification**: Since \( d = 1 \) always divides \( x \), choosing \( y = x - 1 \) is always acceptable and ensures the sum is \( x \).

## Solution Code
```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    n = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(input(''))
        max_sum = -1
        argmax_y = -1
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_sum = gcd(x, y) + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                argmax_y = y
        print(argmax_y)

# To run the function, uncomment the following line
# func()
```

## Explanation
1. **Reading Input**: The function first reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( x \).
   - Initializes variables to keep track of the maximum sum and the corresponding \( y \).
3. **Iterating Through Possible \( y \)**:
   - For each \( y \) from 1 to \( x-1 \), it calculates \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If this sum is greater than the current maximum sum, it updates the maximum sum and records the value of \( y \).
4. **Output**: For each test case, it prints the \( y \) that gives the maximum sum.

This approach ensures that we find the correct \( y \) for each \( x \) that maximizes the given expression.
