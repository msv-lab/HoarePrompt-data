Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle with dimensions a by b, both integers. He wants to cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a single cut parallel to one of its sides. After cutting, he can rotate and move these two smaller rectangles around and try to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

First, I need to understand what it means for two rectangles to be different. The problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same. For example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle. So, essentially, the rectangles are considered unique based on their sorted dimensions.

Okay, so the task is to determine whether, after cutting the original rectangle into two smaller ones, Bob can rearrange them to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering the rotation equivalence.

Let me think about the process step by step.

1. **Cutting the Rectangle:**

   - Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides. So, if the rectangle is a x b, he can either cut along the length a or along the length b.

   - If he cuts parallel to side a, he'll get two rectangles of size (a x c) and (a x (b - c)), where c is some integer between 1 and b-1.

   - Similarly, if he cuts parallel to side b, he'll get two rectangles of size (d x b) and ((a - d) x b), where d is some integer between 1 and a-1.

2. **Forming a New Rectangle:**

   - From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can arrange them in different ways to form a new rectangle.

   - He can place them side by side or one above the other, and he can rotate them by 90 degrees.

   - The goal is to see if he can form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, meaning its dimensions, when sorted, are not equal to the sorted dimensions of the original rectangle.

Let me consider some examples to understand this better.

**Example 1:**

- Input: 1 1

- This is a 1x1 square. If Bob tries to cut it, he can only get two 1x0.5 rectangles, but since dimensions must be integers, he can't make a cut. So, he can't form any new rectangle. Hence, "No".

**Example 2:**

- Input: 2 1

- He can cut it into two 1x1 rectangles. Then, he can arrange them to form either a 2x1 rectangle or a 1x2 rectangle, which are considered the same. Since this is the same as the original, he can't get a different rectangle. Hence, "No".

**Example 3:**

- Input: 2 6

- He can cut it into two 1x6 rectangles. Then, he can arrange them to form a 2x6 rectangle or a 6x2 rectangle, which are the same as the original. Alternatively, he can cut it into two 2x3 rectangles and arrange them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 (or 6x2). Hence, "Yes".

**Example 4:**

- Input: 3 2

- He can cut it into two 1.5x2 rectangles, but dimensions are integers, so he can't cut it that way. Alternatively, cut into two 3x1 rectangles. Then, arranging them can form a 3x2 (same as original) or a 6x1 rectangle, which is different. Hence, "Yes".

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that for 2x1, he can't form any different rectangle. So, perhaps I need to consider only integer cuts.

Wait, the problem says "cut into two rectangles with integer sides". So, all dimensions must be integers.

So, in the 3x2 case, he can cut it into two 3x1 rectangles, and then arrange them to form a 6x1 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x2.

Similarly, in the 2x6 case, cutting into two 2x3 rectangles and arranging them to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

Okay, so the key is to see if there's any way to cut the rectangle into two smaller integer-sided rectangles and then arrange them into a new rectangle that, when considering rotation, is different from the original.

Let me try to generalize this.

First, observe that the area of the original rectangle is a*b. After cutting into two smaller rectangles, the total area remains a*b. When rearranging them into a new rectangle, the area is still a*b, but the dimensions can be different.

Given that, the new rectangle must have dimensions x and y such that x*y = a*b, and (x, y) is different from (a, b) when sorted.

But, the problem is not just to check if there exists any x and y such that x*y = a*b and (x, y) != (a, b), because that would always be possible unless a*b is a prime number or something. But, in this problem, it's more constrained because the new rectangle must be formed from exactly two smaller rectangles obtained by a single cut.

So, I need to consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle and then arrange the two pieces to form a new rectangle.

Let's consider the possible cuts:

- Cutting parallel to side a: This would result in two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where c is an integer between 1 and b-1.

- Cutting parallel to side b: This would result in two rectangles of size d x b and (a - d) x b, where d is an integer between 1 and a-1.

Then, Bob can rotate these rectangles and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Let's consider the possible arrangements:

- Placing them side by side horizontally.

- Placing them side by side vertically.

- Rotating one or both of them by 90 degrees before arranging.

Wait, but rotation is already considered equivalent, so maybe I need to consider unique configurations up to rotation.

Wait, no. The problem is about forming a new rectangle that is different from the original, considering rotation equivalence.

So, for each way of cutting and arranging, check if the resulting rectangle, considering its sorted dimensions, is different from the sorted dimensions of the original rectangle.

Let me try to find a general condition for when this is possible.

First, note that if both a and b are odd integers, then a*b is odd. In this case, the only way to cut the rectangle is to have one dimension remain the same and the other be split into two integers.

Wait, but if both a and b are odd, then any cut parallel to one side will result in rectangles with at least one even dimension.

Wait, no. If a and b are both odd, and I cut parallel to side a, I get two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where c and b - c are both integers. But a is odd, c and b - c can be odd or even.

Wait, but the problem is about whether I can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Let me consider that.

Suppose both a and b are odd. Then, any cut will result in rectangles with at least one even dimension, because if I cut an odd-sized side, the parts will have sizes that are either both even or both odd, but their sum is odd.

Wait, no. If I have an odd-sized side, say b is odd, and I cut it into c and b - c, then c and b - c can both be odd or one even and one odd, but their sum is odd.

Wait, actually, if b is odd, then c and b - c cannot both be even, because that would imply that c and b - c are both even, but their sum would be even, which contradicts b being odd. So, if b is odd, then c and b - c must both be odd.

Similarly, if a is odd, then any cut parallel to side a will result in two rectangles with odd dimensions in one side and possibly even or odd in the other side.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if both a and b are odd, then the only way to cut the rectangle is to have cuts that result in rectangles with at least one even dimension, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, actually, dimensions are integers, and cuts are also integer, so if a and b are both odd, and I cut parallel to side a, I get two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where c and b - c are integers. Since a is odd, and c and b - c can be either odd or even, but their sum is b, which is odd.

Similarly, if I cut parallel to side b, I get two rectangles of size d x b and (a - d) x b, where d and a - d sum to a, which is odd.

Now, when I try to arrange these two smaller rectangles into a new rectangle, I need to see if their combined area can form a rectangle with dimensions different from the original, up to rotation.

Wait, but the combined area is a*b, same as the original, so the new rectangle must have dimensions x and y such that x*y = a*b, and (x, y) != (a, b) when sorted.

So, the number of possible new rectangles is determined by the divisors of a*b, but we need to exclude the original dimensions.

But, in this problem, it's more constrained because we have to form the new rectangle using exactly two smaller rectangles obtained by a single cut.

So, perhaps I need to consider the possible ways to arrange the two smaller rectangles.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have two rectangles with dimensions (p, q) and (r, s).

I can arrange them in several ways:

1. Place them side by side horizontally: forming a rectangle of width (p + r) and height max(q, s).

2. Place them side by side vertically: forming a rectangle of height (q + s) and width max(p, r).

3. Place one above the other: similar to vertical placement.

4. Rotate one or both rectangles before arranging.

But, since rotation is allowed and considered equivalent, I need to consider unique configurations up to rotation.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the area again.

The area of the new rectangle must be a*b, same as the original.

So, possible dimensions for the new rectangle are pairs (x, y) where x*y = a*b, and x <= y.

Similarly, the original rectangle has dimensions (a, b) with a <= b, assuming we sort them.

So, if I can form any rectangle (x, y) where x*y = a*b and (x, y) != (a, b), then the answer is "Yes".

But, I need to ensure that such a rectangle can be formed by arranging the two smaller rectangles obtained from a single cut.

So, perhaps I need to find if there exists a way to cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and arrange them to form a rectangle with dimensions (x, y), where x*y = a*b and (x, y) != (a, b).

This seems too vague. Let's try to find a pattern or a mathematical condition.

Looking back at the examples:

- For 1x1: Can't be cut, so "No".

- For 2x1: Can be cut into two 1x1, but arranging them forms 2x1 or 1x2, which is the same as original, so "No".

- For 2x6: Can be cut into two 2x3, arranging them forms 4x3, which is different from 2x6, so "Yes".

- For 3x2: Can be cut into two 3x1, arranging them forms 6x1, which is different from 3x2, so "Yes".

- For 2x2: Can be cut into two 1x2, arranging them forms 1x4, which is different from 2x2, so "Yes".

- For 2x4: Can be cut into two 2x2, arranging them forms 4x2 (same as original) or 1x8, which is different, so "Yes".

- For 6x3: Can be cut into two 6x1.5, but dimensions are integers, so can't cut into half. Wait, but in integer dimensions, can cut into two 6x1 and 6x2, but arranging them can only form 6x3 (original) or 3x6 (same), or 12x1, which is different, but in this case, the answer is "No". Wait, in the sample output, it's "No". So, perhaps in this case, it's not possible.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for 6x3, the answer is "No". But according to my earlier logic, it should be "Yes". Hmm.

Wait, maybe my earlier logic is flawed.

Let me think again.

In the 6x3 case:

- If I cut it into two 6x1 and 6x2 rectangles.

- Then, arranging them:

  - Place 6x1 and 6x2 side by side horizontally: width 6 + 6 = 12, height max(1,2) = 2, so 12x2.

  - Place them vertically: height 1 + 2 = 3, width 6, so 6x3 (same as original).

  - Rotate 6x1 to 1x6 and place with 6x2: placing 1x6 and 6x2 side by side horizontally: width 1 + 6 = 7, height max(6,2) = 6, so 7x6.

  - Place them vertically: height 6 + 2 = 8, width 1, so 1x8.

  - Other arrangements may lead to different dimensions.

Now, among these, 12x2, 7x6, and 1x8 are possible new rectangles, none of which are the same as the original 6x3 (or 3x6).

But according to the sample output, it's "No". So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is that some of these new rectangles are considered the same as the original if their sorted dimensions are equal.

Wait, but 12x2 is different from 6x3, 7x6 is different from 6x3, and 1x8 is different from 6x3.

So, why is the answer "No" for 6x3?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample input and output. Let me check the sample input again.

Sample Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Sample Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

Wait, for 6x3, the output is "No", but according to my earlier reasoning, it should be "Yes". So, perhaps my reasoning is incorrect.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the condition is that if either a or b is even, then it's "Yes", else "No".

Looking at the sample inputs:

- 1 1: a and b both odd -> "No"

- 2 1: a even, b odd -> "No"

- 2 6: both even -> "Yes"

- 3 2: a odd, b even -> "Yes"

- 2 2: both even -> "Yes"

- 2 4: both even -> "Yes"

- 6 3: a even, b odd -> "No"

Wait, this seems to suggest that if both a and b are even, or one is even and the other is odd, it's "Yes", otherwise "No". But, in the sample input, 2 1 is "No", which contradicts this.

Wait, 2 1 is "No", but 3 2 is "Yes", 2 4 is "Yes", 2 2 is "Yes".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even, and "No" if both are odd.

But in the sample input, 2 1 is "No", which contradicts this.

Wait, maybe it's "Yes" if both a and b are even, or if one is even and the other is odd, but the even one is divisible by 4.

Wait, that might fit the sample input:

- 1 1: both odd -> "No"

- 2 1: one even (2), one odd (1) -> "No"

- 2 6: both even -> "Yes"

- 3 2: one odd (3), one even (2) -> "Yes"

- 2 2: both even -> "Yes"

- 2 4: both even -> "Yes"

- 6 3: one even (6), one odd (3) -> "No"

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If both a and b are even, then "Yes"

- If one is even and the other is odd, then "Yes" if the even one is divisible by 4, else "No"

But in the sample input, 2 1 is "No", and 3 2 is "Yes". So, perhaps it's just that if at least one of them is even, it's "Yes", except for the case when one is even and the other is odd, and the even one is exactly divisible by 2 but not by 4, like 2 1.

Wait, 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 4, so "No". While 3 2 is "Yes", but 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 4.

Wait, but in 3 2, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), and 2 is divisible by 2 but not by 4, and the answer is "Yes". So, my previous assumption is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.

If GCD(a, b) is even, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, for 1 1: GCD=1 (odd) -> "No"

2 1: GCD=1 (odd) -> "No"

2 6: GCD=2 (even) -> "Yes"

3 2: GCD=1 (odd) -> "Yes" (but according to sample, it's "Yes")

Wait, no, 3 and 2 have GCD=1, which is odd, but the sample output is "Yes". So, this doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on whether a*b is divisible by 4.

If a*b is divisible by 4, then "Yes", else "No".

Let's check:

- 1 1: 1*1=1 not divisible by 4 -> "No"

- 2 1: 2*1=2 not divisible by 4 -> "No"

- 2 6: 2*6=12 divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 3 2: 3*2=6 not divisible by 4 -> "Yes" (contradiction)

- 2 2: 2*2=4 divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 2 4: 2*4=8 divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

- 6 3: 6*3=18 not divisible by 4 -> "No"

Hmm, this doesn't match because in 3 2, a*b=6 not divisible by 4, but the answer is "Yes".

So, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even.

Let's check:

- 1 1: both odd -> "No"

- 2 1: a even -> "No" (but according to this, it should be "Yes")

Wait, contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even, except for the cases where one is even and the other is odd, and the even one is 2.

In the sample input:

- 2 1: a=2 (even), b=1 (odd) -> "No"

- 3 2: a=3 (odd), b=2 (even) -> "Yes"

- 2 2: both even -> "Yes"

- 2 4: both even -> "Yes"

- 6 3: a=6 (even), b=3 (odd) -> "No"

So, it's "Yes" if at least one is even, except when the even one is 2 and the odd one is 1.

Wait, but in 3 2, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), and it's "Yes".

In 2 1, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), and it's "No".

So, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one is even, except when the even one is 2 and the odd one is 1.

But in 6 3, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd), and it's "No". But 6 is even, and 3 is odd, similar to 2 1, but in 2 1 it's "No", and in 6 3 it's also "No".

Wait, but in 3 2, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even), and it's "Yes". So, perhaps the position matters.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify order, so (a,b) is the same as (b,a).

I need to find a general condition.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must be able to be arranged in a way that their combined dimensions form a new rectangle with different sorted dimensions.

Given that, perhaps the key is to see if the two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form a rectangle with dimensions that are divisors of a*b, excluding the original dimensions.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the possible new dimensions that can be formed.

Let me consider that after cutting, I have two rectangles with dimensions (p, q) and (r, s).

When arranging them, I can place them side by side horizontally or vertically, or rotate them.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I need to think in terms of the least common multiple or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the possible new widths and heights that can be formed.

Let me consider that when arranging two rectangles side by side horizontally, the new width is the sum of their widths, and the height is the maximum of their heights.

Similarly, when arranging them vertically, the new height is the sum of their heights, and the width is the maximum of their widths.

Given that, I need to see if there's any way to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with dimensions (x, y), where x*y = a*b and (x, y) != (a, b) when sorted.

Let me try to formalize this.

Suppose I have two smaller rectangles with dimensions (p, q) and (r, s).

Then, if I place them side by side horizontally, the new dimensions are (p + r, max(q, s)).

If I place them vertically, the new dimensions are (max(p, r), q + s).

Additionally, I can rotate the smaller rectangles, so (p, q) can be rotated to (q, p), and similarly for (r, s).

So, there are multiple possibilities for arranging them.

Now, I need to check if any of these arrangements result in a rectangle with dimensions (x, y), where x*y = a*b and (x, y) != (a, b) when sorted.

This seems complicated, but maybe there's a pattern or a mathematical condition that can simplify this.

Let me consider the possible values of p, q, r, s.

Given that the original rectangle is a x b, and I'm cutting it into two smaller rectangles, there are two ways to cut:

1. Cut parallel to side a: results in two rectangles of size a x c and a x (b - c), where 1 <= c <= b-1.

2. Cut parallel to side b: results in two rectangles of size d x b and (a - d) x b, where 1 <= d <= a-1.

So, in the first case, the two smaller rectangles are (a, c) and (a, b - c).

In the second case, they are (d, b) and (a - d, b).

Now, when arranging these, I can place them side by side horizontally or vertically, and rotate them.

Let me consider the first case: cutting parallel to side a, resulting in (a, c) and (a, b - c).

If I place them side by side horizontally:

- Width: a + a = 2a

- Height: max(c, b - c)

So, new dimensions: 2a x max(c, b - c)

If I place them vertically:

- Width: max(a, a) = a

- Height: c + (b - c) = b

So, a x b, which is the same as the original.

If I rotate one or both of them:

- Rotate (a, c) to (c, a) and (a, b - c) to (b - c, a)

Then, placing them side by side horizontally:

- Width: c + (b - c) = b

- Height: max(a, a) = a

So, b x a, which is the same as the original.

Placing them vertically:

- Width: max(c, b - c)

- Height: a + a = 2a

So, max(c, b - c) x 2a

Now, for this to be different from the original, we need to have max(c, b - c) x 2a != a x b.

But, if I choose c such that max(c, b - c) != b and 2a != a, which would require a != 0, which is always true, but this seems too vague.

Wait, 2a != a only if a != 0, which is always true since a >=1.

But, in terms of sorted dimensions, (a, b) and (2a, max(c, b - c)) need to be different.

So, unless 2a = b and max(c, b - c) = a, which would require b = 2a and c = a.

But, if c = a, then the two smaller rectangles are (a, a) and (a, b - a).

Wait, but b = 2a, so b - a = a, so both smaller rectangles are (a, a).

Then, arranging them side by side horizontally: 2a x a, which is different from a x 2a (same as original).

Wait, but a x 2a is the same as 2a x a, considering rotation.

Wait, no, they are the same rectangle, just rotated.

So, in this case, it's the same as the original.

Similarly, placing them vertically: a x 2a, same as original.

So, in this specific case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

Wait, but according to the sample input, for 2x6, which is a=2, b=6, which is b=3a, and they can form a different rectangle.

Wait, in this case, a=2, b=6, cutting parallel to side a, c can be from 1 to 5.

If c=3, then the two smaller rectangles are (2,3) and (2,3).

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 4x3, which is different from 2x6.

So, in this case, it's "Yes".

Similarly, for a=3, b=2, cutting parallel to side b, d can be from 1 to 2.

If d=1, two rectangles are (1,2) and (2,2).

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 3x2 (same as original).

Placing them vertically: max(1,2)=2 x (2+2)=4, so 2x4, which is different from 3x2.

Hence, "Yes".

Similarly, for a=6, b=3, cutting parallel to side a, c can be from 1 to 2.

If c=1, two rectangles are (6,1) and (6,2).

Arranging them side by side horizontally: 6x2 (same as original), or 6x1 and 6x2 arranged to form 12x1, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that the new rectangle cannot be obtained by rotating the original.

In the case of 6x3, rotating it gives 3x6, which is the same as 6x3.

So, to form a different rectangle, the new dimensions must not be equal to the original dimensions when sorted.

In the arrangement where I have 12x1, which is different from 6x3.

But perhaps in this case, it's still considered "No". Maybe because there's no way to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form a rectangle that is different from the original, considering rotation.

Wait, maybe it's because the only possible new rectangle is 12x1, which has an area of 12, same as 6x2, but in the original rectangle is 6x3, area 18.

Wait, no, 6x3 has area 18, so any new rectangle must have area 18.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the possible arrangements.

If I have two rectangles of (6,1) and (6,2), arranging them side by side horizontally: width 6 + 6 = 12, height max(1,2) = 2, so 12x2, area 24, which is not equal to the original area of 18. So, that's invalid.

Wait, but the area should remain a*b=18.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the area of the new rectangle is a*b.

In this case, 12x2 has area 24, which is not equal to 18.

Wait, what's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the arrangement.

When arranging two rectangles to form a new one, their areas should add up to a*b.

Wait, no, the area of the new rectangle should be a*b, same as the original.

But in reality, when arranging two rectangles side by side, their areas remain the same, but their combined area is the sum of their individual areas.

Wait, I think I'm confusing tiling with forming a single rectangle.

Actually, when arranging two rectangles to form a new rectangle, their areas are combined, so the new rectangle should have area equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller rectangles, which is a*b.

So, in the case of 6x3, cutting into (6,1) and (6,2), their areas are 6*1=6 and 6*2=12, sum to 18, which matches a*b=18.

Now, arranging them side by side horizontally: width 6 + 6=12, height 2, area 24.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the actual arrangement.

If I have two rectangles, (6,1) and (6,2), and I place them side by side horizontally, the new width is 6 + 6=12, and the height is the maximum of 1 and 2, which is 2, so the new rectangle is 12x2, area 24.

But, this is larger than the original area, which is 18.

So, perhaps this arrangement is invalid because it doesn't form a rectangle with area 18.

Wait, but the combined area of the two smaller rectangles is 6 + 12=18, but the new rectangle has area 24, which means there's overlapping or something.

Wait, perhaps I need to arrange them without overlapping, but with their sides touching.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to consider that the new rectangle's dimensions must be such that they can be tiled by the two smaller rectangles.

In other words, the new rectangle must be able to be divided into the two smaller rectangles without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Given that, perhaps the new rectangle's dimensions must be multiples of the dimensions of the smaller rectangles in some way.

This seems too involved for this problem.

Let me look for a simpler condition.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs:

- 1 1: "No"

- 2 1: "No"

- 2 6: "Yes"

- 3 2: "Yes"

- 2 2: "Yes"

- 2 4: "Yes"

- 6 3: "No"

I need to find a pattern here.

Looking at the greatest common divisor (GCD):

- 1 1: GCD=1 -> "No"

- 2 1: GCD=1 -> "No"

- 2 6: GCD=2 -> "Yes"

- 3 2: GCD=1 -> "Yes"

- 2 2: GCD=2 -> "Yes"

- 2 4: GCD=2 -> "Yes"

- 6 3: GCD=3 -> "No"

Hmm, it's not directly related to GCD being even or odd.

Wait, perhaps it's related to whether GCD is greater than 1.

In this case:

- GCD=1: "No" in some cases, "Yes" in others

- GCD=2: "Yes"

- GCD=3: "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a or b is divisible by 3.

But, in 3 2, GCD=1, and it's "Yes"; in 6 3, GCD=3, and it's "No".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even, and a*b is not divisible by the square of the smallest side.

Wait, that seems too convoluted.

Let me consider the mathematical condition for being able to form a different rectangle.

Suppose we have the original rectangle with area a*b.

We cut it into two smaller rectangles with areas p*q and r*s, where p*q + r*s = a*b.

Then, we arrange them to form a new rectangle with area a*b, and dimensions x and y, where x*y = a*b, and (x, y) != (a, b) when sorted.

So, the question reduces to whether there exists a way to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form a rectangle with dimensions x and y, where x*y = a*b and (x, y) != (a, b).

But, this seems too broad. There must be a better way.

Let me consider that in order to form a new rectangle, the two smaller rectangles must fit perfectly into the new rectangle without overlapping or gaps.

Given that, perhaps the new rectangle's dimensions must be such that one dimension is a multiple of one dimension of the smaller rectangles, and the other dimension is a multiple of the other dimension.

This is getting too complicated for the time being.

Let me consider that in the cases where the answer is "Yes", there exists a way to arrange the two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

From the sample inputs, it seems that as long as at least one of a or b is even, it's "Yes", except for specific cases like 2 1 and 6 3.

Wait, in 2 1, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd) -> "No"

In 6 3, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd) -> "No"

In 3 2, a=3 (odd), b=2 (even) -> "Yes"

In 2 6, a=2 (even), b=6 (even) -> "Yes"

In 2 2, both even -> "Yes"

In 2 4, both even -> "Yes"

So, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even, except when both are even and a/b is 2/1 or something.

Wait, in 2 1, a=2 (even), b=1 (odd) -> "No"

In 6 3, a=6 (even), b=3 (odd) -> "No"

In 4 2, a=4 (even), b=2 (even) -> "Yes"

Wait, but 6 3 is similar to 4 2 in terms of ratio, but in 4 2, it's "Yes", in 6 3, it's "No".

Wait, no, in 6 3, it's "No", but in 4 2, it's "Yes".

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" if at least one of a or b is even, and a/b is not 2/1.

In 2 1, a/b = 2/1 -> "No"

In 6 3, a/b = 2/1 -> "No"

In 4 2, a/b = 2/1 -> "Yes"

Wait, that doesn
