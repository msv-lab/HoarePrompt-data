Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces. The catch is that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they're considered the same. I need to help Bob figure out if he can get a different rectangle from the one he started with.

First, I need to understand the cutting part. He can cut the rectangle either horizontally or vertically, right? So, if he cuts parallel to the width (a), he'd get two rectangles of size (a/2) by b, assuming a is even. Similarly, if he cuts parallel to the height (b), he'd get two rectangles of size a by (b/2), again assuming b is even.

Wait, but the problem says "cut into two rectangles with integer sides." So, a and b have to be even for the cut to result in integer dimensions. Or, more precisely, whichever side he cuts parallel to must be even, because dividing it by 2 should give an integer.

But actually, no. If a is even, say a=4 and b=3, then cutting parallel to a would give two rectangles of 2x3 each. That's fine, sides are integers. Similarly, if b is even, say a=3 and b=4, cutting parallel to b would give two rectangles of 3x2 each. Again, integer sides.

So, the cut is always possible as long as at least one of the sides is even, because only then can you divide that side by 2 and still have an integer.

But the problem is not just about making the cut, but about forming a new rectangle from the two pieces. And this new rectangle should be different from the original one, considering that rotations don't count as different.

Let me look at the examples to understand better.

In the first test case, 1x1. You can't cut it because both sides are odd, so you can't make a cut that results in integer sides. So, no new rectangle can be formed. Output is "No."

Second test case, 2x1. Let's see. a=2, b=1. If he cuts parallel to a, which is even, he gets two 1x1 rectangles. From these two 1x1 rectangles, he can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1 rectangle because of rotation. So, no new rectangle. Output "No."

Third test case, 2x6. Cutting parallel to a (2 is even), gives two 1x6 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different from 2x6. So, "Yes."

Alternatively, cutting parallel to b (6 is even), gives two 2x3 rectangles. From these, he can form a 3x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x6. So, again, "Yes."

Fourth test case, 3x2. Cutting parallel to b (2 is even), gives two 3x1 rectangles. From these, he can form a 1x6 rectangle, which is different from 3x2. So, "Yes."

Fifth test case, 2x2. Cutting parallel to a or b, both are even. Cutting parallel to a gives two 1x2 rectangles, which can be formed into a 1x4 rectangle, different from 2x2. So, "Yes."

Sixth test case, 2x4. Cutting parallel to a (2 is even), gives two 1x4 rectangles, which can be formed into a 1x8 rectangle, different from 2x4. Cutting parallel to b (4 is even), gives two 2x2 rectangles, which can be formed into a 2x4 rectangle, same as original, or a 4x2 which is the same considering rotations. So, in this case, "Yes" because at least one way leads to a different rectangle.

Seventh test case, 6x3. Cutting parallel to a (6 is even), gives two 3x3 rectangles, which can be formed into a 3x6 rectangle, same as original considering rotations. Cutting parallel to b (3 is odd, can't cut). So, no new rectangle, "No."

From these examples, it seems that if at least one of the sides is even, and cutting parallel to that side results in two rectangles that can be rearranged into a new rectangle that is different from the original (not considering rotations), then the answer is "Yes." Otherwise, "No."

So, the key is to check if there's at least one way to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle that isn't the same as the original, considering rotations.

Let me try to generalize this.

Given a rectangle a x b, with a <= b without loss of generality.

Case 1: a is even.

He can cut it into two rectangles of (a/2) x b.

Then, he can arrange these two rectangles either side by side horizontally or vertically.

- If he puts them side by side horizontally, he gets a rectangle of (a/2 + a/2) x b = a x b, which is the same as the original.

- If he puts them side by side vertically, he gets a rectangle of a/2 x 2b.

Now, this new rectangle a/2 x 2b should be compared to the original a x b.

If a/2 x 2b is the same as a x b considering rotations, then it's not a different rectangle.

So, when does a/2 x 2b equal a x b considering rotations?

Well, two rectangles are the same considering rotations if one can be rotated by 90 degrees to match the other.

So, a/2 x 2b can be rotated to become 2b x a/2.

We need to check if 2b x a/2 is equal to a x b or b x a.

So, 2b = a and a/2 = b, or 2b = b and a/2 = a.

Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, actually, if you have a rectangle of sides x and y, and another of m and n, they are the same considering rotations if either x=m and y=n, or x=n and y=m.

So, for a/2 x 2b to be different from a x b, we need to check if neither a/2 == a and 2b == b, nor a/2 == b and 2b == a.

But a/2 == a implies a=0, which isn't possible since a >=1.

So, only need to check if a/2 == b and 2b == a.

If a/2 == b, then a = 2b.

And if 2b == a, which is the same as a=2b.

So, in this case, a/2 x 2b is equal to b x a, which is the same as a x b considering rotations.

Therefore, in this specific case where a=2b, the new rectangle is the same as the original considering rotations.

But in other cases, a/2 x 2b is different from a x b.

For example, in the 2x6 case, a=2, b=6. a/2=1, 2b=12. So, new rectangle is 1x12, which is different from 2x6.

In the 2x4 case, a=2, b=4. a/2=1, 2b=8. New rectangle is 1x8, different from 2x4.

In the 3x2 case, a=2, b=3. a/2=1, 2b=6. New rectangle is 1x6, different from 2x3.

In the 2x2 case, a=2, b=2. a/2=1, 2b=4. New rectangle is 1x4, different from 2x2.

In the 6x3 case, a=3, b=6. a/2=1.5, but a must be even, so can't cut parallel to a. Only can cut parallel to b.

Wait, a=3 is odd, so can't cut parallel to a. b=6 is even, so can cut parallel to b.

Cutting parallel to b gives two rectangles of 3x3.

From these, can form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original considering rotations.

So, no different rectangle.

Hence, in this case, "No."

So, generalizing, if a is even, and a/2 x 2b is different from a x b considering rotations, then "Yes."

Similarly, if b is even, and 2a x b/2 is different from a x b considering rotations, then "Yes."

But need to make sure that at least one of these conditions is met.

Also, need to consider that if both a and b are even, there might be multiple ways to cut, and need to check all of them.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, cutting parallel to a gives 1x2 and 1x2, which can be arranged into 1x4, different from 2x2.

Cutting parallel to b gives 2x1 and 2x1, which can be arranged into 2x2 or 4x1, which is the same as 2x2 considering rotations.

So, in this case, "Yes," because at least one way leads to a different rectangle.

Similarly, in the 6x3 case, only can cut parallel to b, which gives 3x3 and 3x3, which can be arranged into 3x6, same as original.

Hence, "No."

So, the condition seems to be: if at least one of the sides is even, and cutting parallel to that side results in a new rectangle that is different from the original considering rotations, then "Yes." Else, "No."

But in the 2x1 case, a=2, b=1.

Cutting parallel to a: two 1x1 rectangles, which can be arranged into 1x2, which is the same as 2x1 considering rotations. So, no different rectangle.

Hence, "No."

In the 1x1 case, can't cut at all, so "No."

So, seems like the rule is: if at least one side is even, and cutting parallel to that side results in a new rectangle different from the original considering rotations, then "Yes." Else, "No."

Now, to implement this, I need to check:

- If a is even:

- Cut parallel to a: two (a/2)x b rectangles.

- Arrange them to form a (a/2)x 2b rectangle.

- Check if this new rectangle is different from the original a x b considering rotations.

- Similarly, if b is even:

- Cut parallel to b: two a x (b/2) rectangles.

- Arrange them to form a 2a x (b/2) rectangle.

- Check if this new rectangle is different from the original a x b considering rotations.

- If either of these conditions is met, output "Yes." Else, "No."

Now, to check if the new rectangle is different from the original considering rotations:

- For the new rectangle to be different, it must not be equal to the original rectangle or its rotation.

- So, for the new rectangle formed by arranging the two pieces, check if its dimensions are not equal to the original dimensions or their swapped versions.

For example:

- Original: a x b

- New: (a/2) x 2b

- Check if (a/2) != a or 2b != b, and (a/2) != b or 2b != a.

- Similarly for the other way around.

Wait, more precisely:

- Two rectangles are considered the same if one can be rotated by 90 degrees to match the other.

- So, rectangles p x q and m x n are the same if either (p==m and q==n) or (p==n and q==m).

- Hence, to check if the new rectangle is different from the original, check if neither (new_p == original_a and new_q == original_b) nor (new_p == original_b and new_q == original_a).

So, for the new rectangle formed by arranging the two pieces, check if it's different from the original in both orientations.

Now, in code, for each test case, given a and b:

- If a is even:

- Compute new dimensions: (a/2) x 2b

- Check if (a/2 != a or 2b != b) and (a/2 != b or 2b != a)

- Similarly, if b is even:

- Compute new dimensions: 2a x (b/2)

- Check if (2a != a or b/2 != b) and (2a != b or b/2 != a)

- If either of these conditions is true, output "Yes." Else, "No."

Wait, but in the 2x1 case, a=2, b=1.

- a is even, so new dimensions: (1, 2)

- Check if (1 != 2 or 2 != 1) and (1 != 1 or 2 != 2)

- First part: 1 != 2 or 2 !=1 → true

- Second part: 1 !=1 or 2 !=2 → false

- So, overall, "Yes." But in the example, it's "No." Hmm, contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the logic.

Wait, in the 2x1 case, the new rectangle is 1x2, which is the same as 2x1 considering rotations. So, it should be "No."

But according to my earlier logic, it would output "Yes," which is incorrect.

So, my condition is flawed.

I need to refine the condition.

Let me think again.

Given original rectangle a x b.

After cutting parallel to a (a even), new rectangle is (a/2) x 2b.

I need to check if this new rectangle is different from the original a x b and b x a.

So, check if (a/2 != a or 2b != b) and (a/2 != b or 2b != a).

But in the 2x1 case, a=2, b=1.

a/2 =1, 2b=2.

Check:

- 1 !=2 or 2 !=1 → true

- 1 !=1 or 2 !=2 → false

- Overall, false, so "No."

Wait, in my earlier thought, I mistakenly thought it would output "Yes." But actually, according to this, it's "No." So, perhaps my initial logic was correct.

Wait, but in the 2x6 case, a=2, b=6.

a/2=1, 2b=12.

Check:

- 1 !=2 or 12 !=6 → true

- 1 !=6 or 12 !=2 → true

- Overall, true, so "Yes."

In the 3x2 case, a=2, b=3.

a/2=1, 2b=6.

Check:

- 1 !=2 or 6 !=3 → true

- 1 !=3 or 6 !=2 → true

- Overall, true, so "Yes."

In the 2x2 case, a=2, b=2.

a/2=1, 2b=4.

Check:

- 1 !=2 or 4 !=2 → true

- 1 !=2 or 4 !=2 → true

- Overall, true, so "Yes."

In the 2x4 case, a=2, b=4.

a/2=1, 2b=8.

Check:

- 1 !=2 or 8 !=4 → true

- 1 !=4 or 8 !=2 → true

- Overall, true, so "Yes."

In the 6x3 case, a=3, b=6.

a is odd, so can't cut parallel to a.

b is even, so can cut parallel to b.

New rectangle: 2a x (b/2) = 6 x3.

Check:

- 6 ==6 and 3 ==3 → true

- 6 ==3 and 3 ==6 → false

- So, same as original, "No."

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

So, in code, for each test case:

- If a is even:

- Compute new dimensions: (a/2) x 2b

- Check if this new rectangle is different from a x b and b x a

- If different, output "Yes."

- Else, check if b is even:

- Compute new dimensions: 2a x (b/2)

- Check if this new rectangle is different from a x b and b x a

- If different, output "Yes."

- Else, output "No."

But in the 2x2 case, it's "Yes," which is correct because you can form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x2.

Similarly, in the 2x1 case, it's "No," which is correct.

Hence, the condition seems solid.

Now, in code, to implement this efficiently for t test cases, up to t=1e4, and a and b up to 1e9, but since operations are simple, it should be fine.

Edge cases to consider:

- a=1, b=1: can't cut, "No."

- a=1, b=2: can cut parallel to b, giving two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form 1x2, same as original, "No."

- a=2, b=2: can cut parallel to a or b.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 1x2 rectangles, which can form 1x4, different from 2x2, "Yes."

- a=2, b=3: can cut parallel to a or b.

- Cutting parallel to a: two 1x3 rectangles, which can form 1x6, different from 2x3, "Yes."

- Cutting parallel to b: two 2x1 rectangles, which can form 2x2 or 4x1.

- 2x2 is different from 2x3, so "Yes."

- Wait, but earlier I thought about 3x2 case, which is similar.

Wait, no, in the 3x2 case, cutting parallel to b gives two 3x1 rectangles, which can form 3x2 (same as original) or 6x1 (different).

But 6x1 is different from 3x2, so overall "Yes."

But according to the problem statement, in the 3x2 case, it's "Yes."

So, seems like as long as at least one way leads to a different rectangle, it's "Yes."

Hence, in code, for each test case, check both possibilities if possible, and if any one leads to a different rectangle, output "Yes."

Otherwise, "No."

Now, to optimize, since t can be up to 1e4, and operations are O(1) per test case, it's acceptable.

Now, to handle large a and b, up to 1e9, but since we're just checking parity and doing some multiplications, it's fine.

Implementing the checks as per above logic should work.

Hence, the given program seems to be implementing this logic correctly.

In the program:

- For each test case:

- Read a and b.

- If a is even:

- Compute a1 = a/2, a2 = a/2.

- Check if a1 != b, then print "Yes" and continue.

- If b is even:

- Compute b1 = b/2, b2 = b/2.

- Check if b1 != a, then print "Yes" and continue.

- Else, print "No."

This seems to align with the logic I derived.

For example, in the 2x1 case:

- a=2 even.

- a1=1, a2=1.

- Check if 1 !=1 → false.

- Then, check if b=1 is even → not.

- Hence, "No."

In the 2x2 case:

- a=2 even.

- a1=1, a2=1.

- Check if 1 !=2 → true, "Yes."

In the 3x2 case:

- a=2 even.

- a1=1, a2=1.

- Check if 1 !=3 → true, "Yes."

Hence, seems correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from his original rectangle of size \( a \times b \) by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Approach

1. **Cutting the Rectangle**:
   - Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides if that side is even. This ensures the resulting rectangles have integer dimensions.
   - If he cuts parallel to side \( a \), he gets two rectangles of size \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \).
   - If he cuts parallel to side \( b \), he gets two rectangles of size \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \).

2. **Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - From the two smaller rectangles, Bob can form a new rectangle by arranging them differently.
   - We need to check if this new rectangle is different from the original one, considering that rotations do not count as different.

3. **Checking for Differences**:
   - For cuts parallel to side \( a \), the new rectangle would be \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \).
   - For cuts parallel to side \( b \), the new rectangle would be \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \).
   - We need to verify if either of these new rectangles is different from the original \( a \times b \) rectangle, considering rotations.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                (a1, a2) = (a // 2, a // 2)
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                (b1, b2) = (b // 2, b // 2)
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).

2. **Check for Even Sides**:
   - If side \( a \) is even:
     - Compute the new dimensions after cutting: \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \).
     - Check if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \), indicating a different rectangle can be formed.
   - If side \( b \) is even:
     - Compute the new dimensions after cutting: \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \).
     - Check if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \), indicating a different rectangle can be formed.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - Print "Yes" if a different rectangle can be formed from the original.
   - Print "No" otherwise.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine whether Bob can obtain a different rectangle for each test case by considering the parity of the sides and the resulting dimensions after cutting and rearranging.
