Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play again with the remaining numbers. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For a sequence of numbers, the XOR is the bitwise XOR of all of them.

Given that each number in the sequence is at most 4, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But wait, the problem says each integer is at most 4, and the input provides the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence. So, 0 is not included in the input counts.

Wait, in the input description, it says "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, the sequence consists only of 1, 2, 3, and 4, no 0s.

But in the problem statement, it says "a sequence of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4." Does that include 0? Maybe I should confirm whether 0 is possible in the sequence.

Looking back, it says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," but in the input description, it's "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours." So, it seems that the sequence only contains 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Wait, but in programming problems, sometimes 0 might be included, but based on the input description, it's only ones, twos, threes, and fours. So, no 0s.

Alright, so the sequence contains only 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, they check if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero or not. If it's zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. So, Eve chooses which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

I need to find, for each test case, the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and for each test case, p_i can be up to 200, I need an efficient solution, probably O(t * something small).

First, I need to understand how the XOR of the sequence changes as Eve removes numbers.

Let me consider the initial XOR of the entire sequence. If this XOR is zero, then initially, Bob wins. If it's non-zero, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, and we check the XOR of the remaining numbers.

I need to see how removing a number affects the XOR.

Let’s recall that XOR is associative and commutative.

So, the XOR of the sequence is a ^ b ^ c ^ ... ^ n.

If we remove one number, say a, then the new XOR is b ^ c ^ ... ^ n, which is equal to (a ^ b ^ c ^ ... ^ n) ^ a.

In general, removing a number x from the sequence changes the XOR from xor_all to xor_all ^ x.

So, if the current XOR is xor_curr, after removing x, the new XOR will be xor_curr ^ x.

Now, Bob wins when the XOR is zero.

So, Eve wants to choose which number to remove in such a way that the resulting XOR is zero as often as possible.

Wait, but Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, they play with the remaining numbers.

Wait, more precisely, the sequence starts with n numbers, they play once, then Eve removes one number, plays with n-1 numbers, removes another, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

So, there are n games in total: one with n numbers, one with n-1, ..., down to one number, and finally empty sequence.

But, in the problem, it says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it's n games in total: from n numbers down to 1 number, and finally 0 numbers.

But, in each step, Eve chooses which number to remove.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

I need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

This seems a bit tricky. Let's think about the properties of XOR.

First, XOR is associative and commutative, and x ^ x = 0, x ^ 0 = x.

Given that, perhaps I can think about the XOR of the entire sequence and see how removing different numbers affects the XOR.

Let’s denote xor_all as the XOR of all n numbers.

Then, after removing a number x, the new XOR is xor_all ^ x.

Similarly, after removing another number y, the new XOR is xor_all ^ x ^ y, and so on.

Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

So, for each subset of removed numbers, Bob wins if xor_all ^ (XOR of removed numbers) == 0, which implies that the XOR of the removed numbers equals xor_all.

Wait, but Eve is removing one number at a time, and after each removal, we check if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

So, for each step from n down to 0, we have a XOR value, and we want to maximize the number of times this XOR is zero.

But Eve can choose which number to remove at each step.

This seems like a dynamic process where Eve chooses which number to remove to maximize Bob's wins.

Given that the sequence can be up to 200 numbers (since p_i <= 200 for each i), and t up to 10^4, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps I can precompute some properties of the sequence.

Given that each number is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we have counts p1, p2, p3, p4.

First, let's think about the XOR of the entire sequence.

Since each number is small (1,2,3,4), their binary representations are:

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

4: 100

So, XOR of the sequence is the bitwise XOR of these numbers.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of parity of counts of each bit.

Let's consider the binary representation:

- Bit 0: 1 has 1, 2 has 0, 3 has 1, 4 has 0.

- Bit 1: 1 has 0, 2 has 1, 3 has 1, 4 has 0.

- Bit 2: 1 has 0, 2 has 0, 3 has 0, 4 has 1.

So, the XOR of the sequence can be determined by the parity (even or odd) of the counts of numbers that set each bit.

Wait, but since XOR is associative and commutative, maybe I can compute the total XOR by XOR-ing the counts times the number.

Wait, no, because XOR is not linear in that way.

Wait, actually, since XOR is equivalent to addition modulo 2 in each bit, perhaps I can think in terms of linear algebra over GF(2).

But that might be too complicated for this problem.

Let me think differently.

Given that each number is small, perhaps I can precompute the XOR for small sequences.

But with n up to 200, that's not feasible.

Wait, but n is up to 200, and t is up to 10^4, so I need an O(t * something small) solution.

Perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula based on the counts p1, p2, p3, p4.

Let me consider the total XOR of the sequence.

Let me compute the XOR of all numbers in the sequence.

Given that, xor_all = (1 ^ 1 ^ ... ^1 (p1 times)) ^ (2 ^ 2 ^ ... ^2 (p2 times)) ^ (3 ^ 3 ^ ... ^3 (p3 times)) ^ (4 ^ 4 ^ ... ^4 (p4 times))

Now, since XOR is associative and commutative, and x ^ x = 0, x ^ 0 = x.

So, for each number, if it appears an even number of times, its contribution to the XOR is 0; if it appears an odd number of times, its contribution is the number itself.

Therefore, xor_all is equal to the XOR of all numbers that appear an odd number of times.

So, if p1 is odd, contribute 1; p2 odd, contribute 2; p3 odd, contribute 3; p4 odd, contribute 4.

So, xor_all = (1 if p1 % 2 == 1 else 0) ^ (2 if p2 % 2 == 1 else 0) ^ (3 if p3 % 2 == 1 else 0) ^ (4 if p4 % 2 == 1 else 0)

Wait, but 4 is 100 in binary, 3 is 011, 2 is 010, 1 is 001.

So, xor_all is the XOR of these numbers based on the parity of their counts.

Wait, but in the problem, it's given that each number doesn't exceed 4, and p_i is the count of each number.

Given that, perhaps I can represent the sequence as a multiset with counts p1, p2, p3, p4.

Now, Eve removes numbers one by one, and after each removal, we check if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times the XOR becomes zero.

This seems like a game where Eve tries to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Given that, perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Wait, maybe I need to think recursively.

Let’s consider that at each step, Eve chooses a number to remove, and based on that, the XOR changes.

Eve wants to choose the number that leads to a zero XOR as often as possible.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula.

Let me consider small examples to see if I can find a pattern.

Take the first example:

1 1 1 0

So, p1=1, p2=1, p3=1, p4=0

So, the sequence is 1,2,3.

xor_all = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0.

So, initially, with n=3, xor_all=0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers: 2,3. xor=2^3=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining number: 3. xor=3, Alice wins.

Finally, remove 3, empty sequence, xor=0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice.

But in the example output, it's 1.

Wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, the problem says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, in the first step, with n numbers, they play once.

Then, Eve removes one number, n-1 numbers left, play again.

And so on, until the sequence is empty.

So, total number of games is n.

In the first example, n=3, so 3 games.

But Bob wins only once.

Wait, in my earlier simulation, Bob wins twice.

Wait, maybe I need to re-simulate.

Initial sequence: 1,2,3. xor=1^2^3=0, Bob wins.

Eve removes 1, sequence: 2,3. xor=2^3=1, Alice wins.

Eve removes 2, sequence: 3. xor=3, Alice wins.

Eve removes 3, sequence: empty. xor=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins two times.

But the sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps Eve can choose to remove numbers in a way that minimizes Bob's wins, but the problem says Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins.

Wait, but in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, initially, with n numbers, Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, Alice wins.

Then, removing another number, Alice wins.

Then, removing the last number, Bob wins again.

But in the sample output, it's only 1.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem.

Wait, the problem says "Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

Wait, perhaps the counting starts after the first removal.

Wait, let's look again.

"After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, first, they play with n numbers, then Eve removes one, play with n-1, and so on.

So, in the first step, with n numbers, they play once.

Then, Eve removes one number, play with n-1, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

In the first example, n=3.

So, games are played with 3 numbers, then 2, then 1, then 0.

So, 4 games in total.

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, with 3 numbers, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers: 2,3. xor=2^3=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining number: 3. xor=3, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes 3, empty sequence, xor=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the sample output is 1.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts only the games where the sequence is non-empty.

Looking at the sample input and output:

Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Output:

1

1

3

3

12

For the first test case, 1 1 1 0, output is 1.

But in my simulation, Bob wins twice.

Wait, maybe the problem counts only the games where the sequence is non-empty.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it includes the empty sequence as well.

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, perhaps the empty sequence is not considered in the counting.

Wait, but in my earlier simulation, with n=3, we have games with 3,2,1,0 numbers.

But maybe the problem doesn't consider the empty sequence as a game.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, it seems that the empty sequence is also considered as a game.

But perhaps in the problem, the empty sequence does not count as a win for Bob.

Wait, no, in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, with n=3, Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, Alice wins.

Then, removing another number, Alice wins.

Then, removing the last number, empty sequence, Bob wins.

But sample output is 1, which contradicts my earlier simulation.

Wait, perhaps the empty sequence does not count as a game.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my simulation.

Let me try again.

Initial sequence: 1,2,3. xor=0, Bob wins.

Eve removes 1, sequence: 2,3. xor=1, Alice wins.

Eve removes 2, sequence: 3. xor=3, Alice wins.

Eve removes 3, sequence: empty. xor=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but sample output is 1.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a game.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts only the games with at least one number.

Looking at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

But it says "play with n-1 numbers", "play with n-2 numbers", and so on, until "the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, perhaps the empty sequence is considered as a game where Bob wins.

But in the sample, output is 1, which would correspond to only one Bob win, likely the initial game with n numbers.

Maybe the problem counts only the games where the sequence is non-empty.

But in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, with n=3, Bob wins once.

Then, with n=2, Alice wins.

With n=1, Alice wins.

With n=0, Bob wins.

But sample output is 1, so perhaps only the non-empty sequence games are considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts only the games where the sequence is non-empty, and in the first example, Bob wins only once, with n=3.

Wait, but in my simulation, with n=3, Bob wins; with n=2, Alice wins; with n=1, Alice wins; with n=0, Bob wins.

If the problem counts only non-empty sequence games, then n=3, n=2, n=1, which are 3 games, with Bob winning once.

Hence, output is 1.

Wait, but in my simulation, with n=3, Bob wins; with n=2, Alice wins; with n=1, Alice wins.

So, only one Bob win.

Wait, why did I think there are 4 games? The problem says "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

But in the simulation, with n=3, remove one to get n=2, then n=1, then n=0.

So, games with n=3, n=2, n=1, and n=0.

But perhaps the problem considers only n>=1 games, i.e., sequences with at least one number.

Looking at the sample input and output, it seems that Bob wins only once in the first test case.

Hence, likely, the problem counts only the games with at least one number.

Wait, but in the note, it says "In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet."

So, with n=3, Bob wins.

Then, after removing one number, with n=2, Alice wins.

With n=1, Alice wins.

So, only one Bob win.

Hence, output is 1.

Similarly, in the second test case, output is 1.

In the third test case, output is 3.

Wait, in the third test case, p=2 2 2 0, which sums to n=6.

So, 6 games, with Bob winning 3 times.

Likely, in this case, Bob wins with n=6, n=4, n=2, or something like that.

But in the first test case, only one Bob win.

So, perhaps the number of Bob wins is equal to the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, and Eve chooses optimally to maximize this.

Now, I need to find a way to compute this efficiently for each test case.

Given that t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 200 (since p_i <= 200), I need an O(t * something small) solution.

Let me think about the properties of XOR and how it changes as numbers are removed.

Given that xor_all is the XOR of all numbers, and removing a number x changes the XOR to xor_all ^ x.

Then, Bob wins if xor_all ^ x == 0, which means x == xor_all.

So, in each step, Bob wins if the current xor_all is equal to the number removed.

Wait, no.

Wait, let's think carefully.

Current xor is xor_curr.

After removing x, the new xor is xor_curr ^ x.

Bob wins if xor_curr ^ x == 0, which implies x == xor_curr.

So, Bob wins if Eve removes the number that equals the current xor.

But Eve can choose which number to remove.

So, Eve can choose to remove x == xor_curr to make Bob win, or choose another number to make Alice win.

Eve wants to maximize the number of Bob's wins, so she will choose to remove x == xor_curr as much as possible.

But, she has to remove one number at a time, and after each removal, the current xor changes.

This seems like a recursive process, where at each step, Eve chooses to remove a number that either makes Bob win or not, depending on her choice.

But with n up to 200 and t up to 10^4, I need a smarter way to compute this.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the parity of the counts of each number.

Given that each number is small, and their counts are up to 200, maybe I can represent the sequence as a multiset with counts p1, p2, p3, p4.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the total number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, given optimal choices.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the XOR equals a particular value.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider the total number of games, which is n.

Out of these n games, some number of them will have XOR zero, which are Bob's wins.

Eve wants to maximize the number of Bob's wins.

So, Eve will choose to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, based on the counts p1, p2, p3, p4.

Given that, perhaps I can find a formula based on the parities of p1, p2, p3, p4.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the XOR of the sequence based on the parity of the counts.

Given that, xor_all = (1 if p1 % 2 == 1 else 0) ^ (2 if p2 % 2 == 1 else 0) ^ (3 if p3 % 2 == 1 else 0) ^ (4 if p4 % 2 == 1 else 0)

So, xor_all is determined by the numbers that appear an odd number of times.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, the XOR changes.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove to maximize the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the current xor is equal to one of the numbers in the sequence.

Because, if the current xor equals one of the numbers, Eve can remove that number to make the XOR zero.

Wait, more precisely, if the current xor is x, and x is in the sequence, then Eve can remove x to make the new xor zero.

So, if x is in the sequence, Eve can choose to remove x and make Bob win.

Otherwise, Eve has to remove another number, and Bob doesn't win.

So, the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the current xor is equal to one of the numbers in the sequence.

But Eve can choose to remove x if x is in the sequence to make Bob win, or choose to remove another number to make Alice win.

But Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she will choose to remove x whenever possible.

So, the number of Bob's wins is equal to the number of times the current xor is equal to one of the numbers in the sequence.

Wait, but as Eve removes numbers, the sequence changes, so the current xor changes.

This seems too vague.

Perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the sequence is a multiset of numbers, and I need to find the number of subsets whose XOR is zero.

But no, it's not about subsets, it's about the sequence with numbers being removed one by one.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion or some combinatorial approach can be used.

But with n up to 200, that's not feasible.

Wait, but n is up to 200, and t is up to 10^4, so I need something faster.

Let me consider that the numbers are small (1,2,3,4), and their XOR has only a few possible values (0,1
