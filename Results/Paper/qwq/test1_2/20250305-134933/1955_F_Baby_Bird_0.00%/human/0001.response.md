Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about.

So, there are n integers in a sequence, each not exceeding 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. After each game, Eve removes one number from the sequence, and they play again with the reduced sequence. This continues until there are no numbers left. I need to figure out the maximum number of times Bob can win, given that Eve removes numbers optimally.

First, I need to understand the XOR operation. XOR is a bitwise operation where the result is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For a sequence of numbers, the XOR is the bitwise XOR of all of them.

The problem states that the numbers don't exceed 4, which means the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But in the input, we're given the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Wait, so 0 is not included in the input? Or is it implied?

Looking back, the problem says "a sequence of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4." It doesn't specify that 0 is excluded, so 0 could be present. But in the input, it only provides counts for 1, 2, 3, and 4. Maybe 0 is handled differently.

Wait, looking at the input description: "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, it's p_i for i=1 to 4, representing counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. What about 0? If 0 is present, it's not accounted for in p_i.

But in the problem statement, it says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," which includes 0. So, perhaps the sequence can contain 0, but it's not represented in p_i. That seems confusing.

Looking at the example input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

In the first test case, p = [1,1,1,0], which means one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4's. So, the sequence is [1,2,3]. The XOR of these is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, so Bob wins when no number is removed. Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence becomes [2,3], XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins. Remove another number, say 2, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins. Remove the last number, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins. So, Bob wins twice in this case.

But according to the example output, it's 1. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, empty sequence XOR is 0, Bob wins. Sequence with one number has XOR equal to that number, which is non-zero, Alice wins. Sequence with two numbers, XOR could be zero or non-zero depending on the numbers. Sequence with three numbers, as in the first example, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins when no numbers are removed (XOR of all is 0) and when one number is removed (sequence has two numbers, XOR could be zero or non-zero), but in the example output, it's 1, meaning Bob wins only once. Wait, maybe I need to re-examine.

Wait, in the first example, with sequence [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins. Then Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence [2,3], XOR is 1, Alice wins. Then removes another, say 2, sequence [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins. Then removes 3, sequence empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins. So, Bob wins twice: once with all three numbers and once with no numbers.

But the output is 1, which contradicts this. So, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the problem counts only the games where Bob wins, and Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

Looking back, perhaps Eve removes numbers in a way that minimizes Alice's wins, but the problem says to maximize Bob's wins.

Wait, the problem says: "Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally."

So, Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins. In the first example, Bob wins when no numbers are removed and when the sequence is empty. But in the output, it's 1, meaning Bob wins only once. So, perhaps Eve can't arrange for Bob to win both times.

Wait, maybe Bob can only win once in that scenario, and the other win is not possible due to the way XOR works.

I need to think differently. Maybe there's a pattern or a property of XOR that can be exploited here.

First, note that XOR is associative and commutative, so the order of operations doesn't matter.

Also, XOR has the property that x XOR x = 0, and x XOR 0 = x.

Given that the numbers are only 0,1,2,3,4, and p_i represents the count of each number, we can consider the XOR of the entire sequence based on these counts.

Wait, but in the input, p_i are given for 1,2,3,4, but not for 0. So, perhaps the count of 0 is implied by n minus the sum of p_i.

Wait, no, if 0 is allowed in the sequence, it should be accounted for separately. But in the input, only p1 to p4 are given. Maybe the count of 0 is not directly given, but perhaps it can be inferred.

Looking back at the problem statement: "the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game." So, p1, p2, p3, p4 are given, but what about 0? If 0 is present, it's not included in p_i.

Wait, but the problem says "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," which includes 0. So, it's possible to have 0 in the sequence, but it's not represented in p_i.

This is confusing. Maybe the sequence only contains numbers from 1 to 4, and 0 is only considered in the XOR operation when the sequence is empty.

Wait, in the problem, it's specified that "each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4," but it doesn't explicitly exclude 0. So, perhaps the sequence can contain 0.

But in the input, only p1 to p4 are given, so maybe p0 is implicitly given by n - (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4), but n is not provided directly.

Wait, actually, n is not directly given; it's inferred from p1 to p4.

Wait, no, n is equal to p1 + p2 + p3 + p4, assuming that's the total count of numbers in the sequence.

Wait, but in the first test case, p = [1,1,1,0], so n = 3.

Then, in the second test case, p = [1,0,1,2], so n = 4.

So, n is the sum of p1 to p4.

But if the sequence can contain 0, why isn't p0 given? Maybe the sequence only contains numbers from 1 to 4, and 0 is only considered in the XOR when the sequence is empty.

Let's assume that the sequence only contains numbers from 1 to 4, and p0 is the count of 0, which is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the sequence is empty or not.

Wait, but 0 is a possible number in the sequence, as it doesn't exceed 4. So, perhaps p0 is given separately, but in the input, only p1 to p4 are provided.

Maybe I need to consider that p0 is not provided, and if the sequence contains 0, it's treated differently.

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should look at the problem differently.

Let me consider that the sequence contains integers from 0 to 4, and p1 to p4 are given, but p0 is not. Perhaps p0 is implicitly determined.

Wait, perhaps the sequence only contains numbers from 1 to 4, and 0 is only considered in the XOR when the sequence is empty.

In that case, n = p1 + p2 + p3 + p4.

Then, the XOR of the sequence is the XOR of p1 ones, p2 twos, p3 threes, and p4 fours.

I need to compute the XOR of the entire sequence, and then the XOR after removing one number, and so on, until the sequence is empty.

Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the XOR is zero.

So, I need to find, for each subset of the sequence obtained by removing some numbers, whether the XOR is zero, and Eve removes numbers to maximize the number of times this happens.

But that sounds too computationally intensive, especially since n can be up to the sum of p_i, which can be up to 200*4 = 800 per test case, and t can be up to 10^4.

So, there must be a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

First, XOR is associative and commutative, so the order doesn't matter.

Also, XOR has the property that x XOR x = 0, and x XOR 0 = x.

Given that, perhaps I can find a pattern based on the counts of each number.

But the numbers are only up to 4, so there are only a few possible values.

Let me list the XOR values for sequences of different lengths.

For example, in the first test case: [1,2,3], XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0.

Then, after removing one number, sequences are [2,3], [1,3], [1,2], with XORs 1, 2, 3 respectively.

Then, removing another number, sequences are [3], [2], [1], with XORs 3, 2, 1 respectively.

Finally, empty sequence has XOR 0.

So, in this case, Bob wins when the sequence is [1,2,3] and when it's empty, i.e., twice.

But the output is 1, which contradicts this. So, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps Bob can only win once per game, meaning that in each game, only one winner is determined, and Eve chooses which game to make Bob win.

But that doesn't make sense because in each step, after removing a number, they play again, and Bob can win multiple times.

Wait, but in the first test case, according to my earlier reasoning, Bob should win twice, but the output is 1.

So, perhaps I need to consider that Eve removes numbers in a way that maximizes Bob's wins, but some games are inevitable for Alice to win.

Maybe there's a dependency on the parity of the counts or something.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have the initial sequence with n numbers, and I need to find out for each k from 0 to n, whether the XOR of some subset of size k is zero.

But that sounds too slow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute the XOR of all possible subsets and see how many times the XOR is zero.

But again, that's not feasible for larger n.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the binary representation of the numbers involved.

The numbers are 0,1,2,3,4.

In binary:

0: 000

1: 001

2: 010

3: 011

4: 100

So, the XOR of any subset will be the bitwise XOR of these binary representations.

I need to find subsets whose XOR is zero.

This is equivalent to finding the linear dependencies among these vectors in GF(2).

But that sounds complicated.

Maybe I can look at the problem in terms of linear algebra over GF(2).

Let me consider the counts of each number and how they contribute to the overall XOR.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But that still seems too involved.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem in terms of the parity of the counts.

Let me consider the XOR of the entire sequence.

If the XOR of the entire sequence is zero, then Bob wins in the initial game.

Then, Eve removes one number, and the XOR changes based on the number removed.

Specifically, removing a number x flips the XOR from s to s XOR x, where s is the previous XOR.

Wait, no. Actually, removing a number x means the new XOR is s XOR x.

So, if the current XOR is s, and we remove x, the new XOR is s XOR x.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see: if the current XOR is s, and we remove x, then the new XOR should be s XOR x, because we're essentially undoing the XOR of x.

Wait, actually, that makes sense.

So, if the current XOR is s, and we remove x, the new XOR is s XOR x.

Therefore, the sequence of XORs forms a graph where each step, we can remove a number and XOR it out.

But this seems too general.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the entire sequence of games.

Starting with n numbers, XOR is s.

Then, remove one number, XOR becomes s XOR x1.

Then, remove another number, XOR becomes (s XOR x1) XOR x2, and so on.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated.

Perhaps I need to consider the parity of the counts of each number.

Wait, let's consider the XOR of the entire sequence.

XOR = p1*1 XOR p2*2 XOR p3*3 XOR p4*4.

Wait, but since XOR is associative and commutative, and XORing a number with itself an even number of times cancels out, I can consider the XOR as the XOR of the numbers appearing an odd number of times.

So, if a number appears an even number of times, it contributes 0 to the XOR; if it appears an odd number of times, it contributes its value to the XOR.

Therefore, the initial XOR is the XOR of all numbers appearing an odd number of times.

Similarly, when Eve removes a number, she can choose which number to remove to affect the XOR in a certain way.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the XOR is zero after some removals.

So, Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to try to make the XOR zero for as many steps as possible.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about smaller cases.

Suppose n=1. Then, sequence has one number, which is non-zero, so Alice wins. Then, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins. So, Bob wins once.

Wait, but in the first test case, n=3, and output is 1.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, Bob should win twice in that case.

So, perhaps there is a constraint on how Eve removes the numbers.

Wait, maybe Eve cannot choose to remove a number that would lead to Alice winning; that is, Eve wants to maximize Bob's wins, so she would avoid removing numbers that lead to Alice winning.

But that doesn't make sense because Eve has to remove one number at each step.

Wait, perhaps Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, in the first test case, with [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, sequence is [2,3], XOR is 1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Then, removes 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the output is 1, which contradicts this.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem counts only the games where Bob wins, excluding the last empty sequence.

But in the first test case, output is 1, which could be only the initial game.

But in the fourth test case, output is 3, which seems higher.

Wait, perhaps Eve cannot choose to remove a number that would lead to another Bob's win.

But in the first test case, if Eve removes 2 instead of 1, sequence becomes [1,3], XOR is 1 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, again, Bob wins only once.

Wait, unless Eve removes 3 first, sequence becomes [1,2], XOR is 1 XOR 2 = 3, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, sequence is [2], XOR is 2, Alice wins.

Remove 2, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Still, Bob wins only once.

So, perhaps in the first test case, Bob can win only once, and I was mistaken earlier.

Therefore, the output is 1.

Similarly, in the second test case, p = [1,0,1,2], so sequence is [1,3,4,4], XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 3 = 2, so Alice wins initially.

Then, Eve removes one number to try to make XOR zero.

If she removes 1, sequence is [3,4,4], XOR is 3 XOR 4 XOR 4 = 3 XOR 0 = 3, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence is [4,4], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Remove 4, sequence is [4], XOR is 4, Alice wins.

So, Bob wins once.

Alternatively, if Eve removes 4, sequence is [1,3,4], XOR is 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 6, which is non-zero, Alice wins.

Then, remove 1, sequence is [3,4], XOR is 3 XOR 4 = 7, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence is [4], XOR is 4, Alice wins.

Remove 4, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Then, remove the last 4, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, again, Bob wins once.

Hence, output is 1.

In the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one number, say 1, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 1, sequence is [2,2,3,3], XOR is 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

Remove 2, sequence is [2,3,3], XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 2 XOR 0 = 2, Alice wins.

Remove 2, sequence is [3,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Remove 3, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins four times.

But the output is 3, which contradicts this.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a win for Bob.

But in the first test case, it seems to count it.

Wait, perhaps I need to read the problem again carefully.

"The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, for each subset, from n down to 0, they play a game, and Eve removes one number at each step.

But Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

So, perhaps Eve can choose which number to remove to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

In the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number to try to make the next XOR non-zero, but she wants to maximize Bob's wins.

Wait, but Bob wins when XOR is zero.

So, Eve would want to remove a number such that the next XOR is zero.

Wait, but removing a number changes the XOR to s XOR x, where s is the current XOR.

In this case, s=0, so removing x makes the new XOR x.

Since x is one of 1,2,3,4, which are all non-zero, the next XOR is non-zero, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, from the remaining sequence, and so on.

So, in this case, Bob can only win initially and when the sequence is empty.

But in my earlier counting, Bob wins four times, but the output is 3.

So, perhaps Bob wins only three times.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a win for Bob.

But in the first test case, output is 1, which could be only when the sequence is empty.

Wait, no, in the first test case, Bob wins twice: initially and when empty.

But output is 1, so perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a win for Bob.

Wait, but in the first test case, output is 1, which would correspond to Bob winning only once, perhaps when the sequence is empty.

But in the third test case, output is 3, which would be Bob winning three times.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a pattern based on the counts.

Looking at the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 0.

Then, remove one number, say 1, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1.

Remove another number, say 1, sequence is [2,2,3,3], XOR is 0.

Remove 2, sequence is [2,3,3], XOR is 2.

Remove 2, sequence is [3,3], XOR is 0.

Remove 3, sequence is [3], XOR is 3.

Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0.

So, Bob wins when the sequence is [1,1,2,2,3,3], [2,2,3,3], [3,3], and [].

That's four times, but the output is 3.

So, perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a win for Bob.

In that case, Bob wins three times.

But in the first test case, output is 1, which would correspond to only the empty sequence.

But in the first test case, sequence is [1,2,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Then, remove one number, say 1, sequence is [2,3], XOR is 1, Alice wins.

Remove another number, say 2, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice, but output is 1.

So, perhaps the problem doesn't count the initial game as a win for Bob, only the subsequent ones.

But in the first test case, output is 1, which would correspond to only the empty sequence.

Wait, perhaps Bob only wins when the sequence is empty, and not when XOR is zero with non-empty sequence.

But in the third test case, output is 3, which would correspond to wins at [2,2,3,3], [3,3], and [].

But in that case, it's three wins.

Wait, perhaps Bob wins only when the sequence is empty and XOR is zero.

But that can't be, because in the first test case, output is 1, which would correspond to only the empty sequence.

But in the third test case, Bob wins at [2,2,3,3], [3,3], and [].

So, perhaps Bob wins when XOR is zero, regardless of the sequence being empty or not.

But in the first test case, Bob wins at [1,2,3] and [], totaling two wins, but output is 1.

So, perhaps the problem doesn't count the initial game as a win for Bob.

Wait, perhaps Bob can only win once per game, meaning that in each step, only one winner is determined.

But that doesn't make sense because in each step, after removing a number, they play again, and Bob can win multiple times.

This is getting confusing.

Let me look at the fourth test case: p = [3,3,2,0], sequence is [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1, so Alice wins initially.

Then, Eve removes one number to try to make XOR zero.

If she removes 1, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 2, Alice wins.

Remove another 1, sequence is [1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 2 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 2 = 3, Alice wins.

Remove 2, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 0 XOR 0 = 1, Alice wins.

Remove 2, sequence is [1,2,3,3], XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 1 XOR 2 XOR 0 = 1 XOR 2 = 3, Alice wins.

Remove 1, sequence is [2,3,3], XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 3 = 2 XOR 0 = 2, Alice wins.

Remove 2, sequence is [3,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Remove 3, sequence is [3], XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the output is 3, which suggests Bob wins three times.

So, perhaps there are other opportunities for Bob to win.

Wait, maybe Eve can choose different removal sequences to maximize Bob's wins.

For example, starting with [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1.

Eve removes 1, sequence is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1.

Remove another 1, sequence is [1,2,2,2,3,3], XOR is 3.

Remove 2, sequence is [1,2,2,3,3], XOR is 1.

Remove 2, sequence is [1,2,3,3], XOR is 3.

Remove 1, sequence is [2,3,3], XOR is 2.

Remove 2, sequence is [3,3], XOR is 0, Bob wins.

Remove 3, sequence is [3], XOR is 3.

Remove 3, sequence is empty, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins three times: at [1,1,2,2,2,3,3] (if XOR is zero, but in this case, it's 1), [3,3], and [].

Wait, but in this sequence, [1,1,2,2,2,3,3] has XOR 1, which is Alice's win.

So, perhaps I need to consider different removal sequences.

Wait, maybe Eve can arrange to have Bob win at [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3], [1,1,2,2,2,3,3], [3,3], and [].

But in this case, XOR of [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3] is 1, which is Alice's win.

Wait, perhaps I need to find all possible subsets where XOR is zero.

But that would be too time-consuming.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the parity of the counts.

Given that, for XOR to be zero, the numbers appearing an odd number of times must XOR to zero.

So, if I have counts p1, p2, p3, p4, I can consider only the numbers that appear an odd number of times.

If p1 is odd, include 1; if p2 is odd, include 2; and so on.

Then, the XOR of these included numbers should be zero for Bob to win.

So, in the first test case, p = [1,1,1,0], which are all odd, so XOR is 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, Bob wins.

In the second test case, p = [1,0,1,2], p1=1 (odd), p2=0 (even), p3=1 (odd), p4=2 (even), so XOR is 1 XOR 3 = 2, which is non-zero, Alice wins.

In the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], all even, so XOR is 0, Bob wins.

In the fourth test case, p = [3,3,2,0], p1=3 (odd), p2=3 (odd), p3=2 (even), p4=0 (even), so XOR is 1 XOR 3 = 2, Alice wins.

In the fifth test case, p = [0,9,9,9], p1=0 (even), p2=9 (odd), p3=9 (odd), p4=9 (odd), so XOR is 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 7, which is non-zero, Alice wins.

But this is only for the initial game.

I need to consider all subsets obtained by removing numbers one by one.

This seems too involved.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

So, at each step, Eve can choose to remove a number that makes the XOR zero for the next game.

Wait, but removing a number changes the XOR to s XOR x, where s is the current XOR and x is the removed number.

So, if the current XOR is s, and Eve wants the next XOR to be zero, she needs to remove x such that s XOR x = 0, which implies x = s.

So, if s is present in the sequence, Eve can remove s to make the next XOR zero.

Otherwise, she has to remove another number, and the next XOR will be s XOR x.

So, Eve can strategically choose which number to remove to maximize Bob's wins.

This seems like a game theory problem.

But it's getting too complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample outputs.

In the first test case, output is 1.

In the second, 1.

In the third, 3.

In the fourth, 3.

In the fifth, 12.

Looking at the fifth test case, p = [0,9,9,9], so n=27.

Eve removes numbers one by one, and Bob wins 12 times.

I need to find a general formula or approach to compute the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Wait, perhaps Bob can win floor((n+1)/2) times.

In the first test case, n=3, floor(4/2)=2, but output is 1.

Wait, no.

In the third test case, n=6, floor(7/2)=3, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, n=8, floor(9/2)=4, but output is 3.

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of times the XOR is zero.

But I need a better approach.

Let me consider that Bob wins when the XOR is zero.

Given that, I need to maximize the number of times the XOR of the current sequence is zero.

Eve can choose which number to remove at each step to maximize Bob's wins.

So, Eve wants to choose a removal that leads to the next XOR being zero, if possible.

This seems like a dynamic programming problem, where at each step, Eve chooses the removal that maximizes the number of future Bob's wins.

But with t up to 10^4 and n up to 800 per test case, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the sequence of XORs forms a graph where each step is connected to the next via the removal of a number.

But this is too involved.

Let me think about the parity of the counts again.

Given that, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But that's still too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem in terms of linear algebra over GF(2).

Given that the numbers are small, I can represent each number as a vector in GF(2)^3, since 4 in binary is 100.

Then, the XOR of a subset is the sum of the vectors in GF(2)^3.

The number of subsets with XOR zero is 2^{n - r}, where r is the rank of the matrix formed by the vectors.

But in this problem, the sequences can be large, and computing the rank for each test case might be too slow.

Moreover, I need to consider the removal of numbers step by step.

This seems too complicated.

Let me look for a different approach.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps there's a pattern based on the counts p1 to p4.

In the first test case, p = [1,1,1,0], output is 1.

In the second, p = [1,0,1,2], output is 1.

In the third, p = [2,2,2,0], output is 3.

In the fourth, p = [3,3,2,0], output is 3.

In the fifth, p = [0,9,9,9], output is 12.

I need to find a formula that maps p1, p2, p3, p4 to the number of times Bob can win.

Looking at the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], which sums to 6, and output is 3.

Similarly, in the fourth test case, p = [3,3,2,0], which sums to 8, and output is 3.

In the fifth test case, p = [0,9,9,9], which sums to 27, and output is 12.

So, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is related to the number of subsets with XOR zero.

But computing that directly is not feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Given that, and Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins, perhaps there's a way to compute this based on the counts.

Let me consider that Eve can choose to remove numbers in a way that toggles the XOR to zero as often as possible.

Given that, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the cumulative XOR is zero.

But I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the sequence of XORs forms a path, and Eve can choose which number to remove to affect the next XOR.

This is getting too involved.

Let me consider that the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the XOR of the sequence is zero, considering the removals.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of times the XOR of the sequence is zero, plus the number of times the XOR of the sequence with one number removed is zero, and so on.

But that seems too slow.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that the XOR of the sequence is a function of the counts of each number.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute the number of subsets with XOR zero based on the counts.

But this seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps I can look at the problem in terms of the binary representations and find a pattern.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the floor of (number of pairs + 1)/2.

But that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of times the XOR is zero in the sequence.

But I need to find a general formula.

Let me consider that for each subset of the sequence, Bob wins if the XOR is zero.

But Eve is removing one number at a time, so it's not about all subsets, but about a specific sequence of removals.

This is too complicated.

Let me consider that Eve can arrange the removals in a way that the XOR is zero as often as possible.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the cumulative XOR is zero in a specific removal order.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that the problem can be reduced to finding the number of times the cumulative XOR is zero in a specific removal sequence chosen by Eve to maximize this count.

Given that, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the XOR is zero in the sequence of cumulative XORs.

But I need a way to compute this without simulating all possible removal sequences.

This seems too involved.

Let me look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the problem can be solved by considering the parity of the counts of each number.

Given that, perhaps I can find a way to compute the number of times Bob can win based on the parity of p1, p2, p3, p4.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps there's a pattern there.

In the first test case, p = [1,1,1,0], output is 1.

In the second test case, p = [1,0,1,2], output is 1.

In the third test case, p = [2,2,2,0], output is 3.

In the fourth test case, p = [3,3,2,0], output is 3.

In the fifth test case, p = [0,9,9,9], output is 12.

Looking at p1, p2, p3, p4, perhaps I can consider the sum of floor(pi / 2) for each pi.

In the third test case, floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the output.

In the fourth test case, floor(3/2) + floor(3/2) + floor(2/2) + floor(0/2) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the output.

In the fifth test case, floor(0/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) + floor(9/2) = 0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12, which matches the output.

In the first test case, floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, but the output is 1.

Wait, that doesn't match.

In the second test case, floor(1/2) + floor(0/2) + floor(1/2) + floor(2/2) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1, which matches the output.

So, perhaps it's sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus something else.

In the first test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, but output is 1.

In the third test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3, which matches the output.

So, perhaps there's an additional condition.

Looking back, perhaps it's sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus whether the initial XOR is zero.

In the first test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 0, and initial XOR is zero, so output is 0 + 1 = 1.

In the second test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 1, initial XOR is non-zero, so output is 1.

In the third test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 3, initial XOR is zero, but output is 3, so perhaps it's not plus one in this case.

Wait, perhaps it's sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus the number of times the cumulative XOR is zero.

But I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of pairs of numbers, plus something.

But that doesn't seem to fit.

Let me consider that Bob can win when the XOR is zero, which happens when the numbers appearing an odd number of times XOR to zero.

Given that, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of subsets where the XOR of the numbers appearing an odd number of times is zero.

But this is too broad.

I need to find a pattern or formula that can be computed efficiently.

Looking back at the sample inputs and outputs, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus some adjustment based on the parity of the counts.

In the first test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 0, and perhaps an adjustment of +1 because the initial XOR is zero.

In the second test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 1, and no adjustment since initial XOR is non-zero.

In the third test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 3, and no additional adjustment.

In the fourth test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 3, and perhaps an adjustment based on the initial XOR.

In the fifth test case, sum(floor(pi / 2)) = 12, which matches the output.

So, perhaps the general formula is sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus 1 if the initial XOR is zero and the number of numbers is even.

In the first test case, n=3 (odd), initial XOR is zero, sum(floor(pi / 2))=0, output=1.

In the second test case, n=4 (even), initial XOR is non-zero, sum(floor(pi / 2))=1, output=1.

In the third test case, n=6 (even), initial XOR is zero, sum(floor(pi / 2))=3, output=3.

In the fourth test case, n=8 (even), initial XOR is non-zero, sum(floor(pi / 2))=3, output=3.

In the fifth test case, n=27 (odd), initial XOR is non-zero, sum(floor(pi / 2))=12, output=12.

So, perhaps the formula is sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus 1 if n is even and initial XOR is zero.

Wait, in the third test case, n=6 (even), initial XOR is zero, sum(floor(pi / 2))=3, output=3, which doesn't match sum(floor(pi / 2)) + 1 = 4.

So, perhaps it's different.

Wait, perhaps it's sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus the number of times the initial XOR is zero when n is even.

In the third test case, n=6 (even), initial XOR is zero, so sum(floor(pi / 2)) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4, but output is 3.

So, that doesn't hold.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to sum(floor(pi / 2)) plus an additional term based on the parity of the counts.

Looking back, perhaps it's sum(floor(pi / 2
