Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of this sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if I have a sequence [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence such that no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. Since the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the constraints on n are up to 10^6, it seems like the sequence should be carefully chosen to cover all the sums from 1 to n except for k.

One approach that comes to mind is to use a combination of powers of 2 and adjust for k. Powers of 2 are useful because they can represent any number through their sums, due to the binary representation of numbers.

Let's consider the sequence consisting of powers of 2: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...]. With these, I can make any sum up to the sum of the sequence. For example, with [1, 2, 4, 8], I can make any number from 1 to 15.

But in this problem, I need to exclude the sum k while being able to make all other sums from 1 to n.

So, if I take the sequence of powers of 2 up to some point, I can cover a range of sums. However, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.

One idea is to include all powers of 2 up to a certain point, and then adjust for k by either excluding it or including an element that makes k unachievable.

Wait, but I need to cover all sums except k. So, perhaps I can include elements that allow me to make all sums except k.

Let me think differently. Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k. One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k, while all other sums are possible.

This seems tricky. Maybe I can use the fact that with powers of 2, I can generate any sum uniquely. But I need to modify this to exclude k.

Another approach is to include elements that cover all sums except k. For example, if I have elements that cover sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n, that would be ideal.

But how do I ensure that k cannot be formed?

Let me consider the binary representation. Since any number can be represented as a sum of powers of 2, perhaps I can modify the sequence to exclude k.

Wait, but if I include all powers of 2 up to n, I can form any number up to n. So, I need to exclude the possibility of forming k.

One way to do this is to exclude one of the powers of 2 that is used in the binary representation of k and include another element that helps to cover other sums.

But this might not be straightforward. Let's think of an example.

Take the first sample input:

n=2, k=2

One possible sequence is [1]. With this sequence, I can form sum 1, and not 2.

So, it satisfies the condition.

Another sample input:

n=6, k=1

Sequence: [2,3,4,5,6]

Here, no subsequence sums to 1, which is k, and all other sums from 2 to 6 can be formed by single elements.

Okay, so in this case, since k=1, and all elements are greater than 1, no subsequence can sum to 1.

So, a general strategy could be:

- If k=1, then all elements in the sequence should be greater than or equal to 2. This way, no subsequence can sum to 1.

- For other k, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k, while being able to sum to all other v from 1 to n except k.

Wait, but in the first sample, when n=2 and k=2, the sequence is [1], which can sum to 1, but not 2. So, even when k is not 1, I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

Another sample input:

n=8, k=8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Here, any subsequence sum is at most 7, so 8 cannot be formed, and all sums from 1 to 7 can be formed by selecting the appropriate number of 1's.

So, for k=n, I can just use elements that sum to less than n.

Wait, but in this case, m can be up to 25, and elements can be up to 10^9, so I have flexibility in choosing the elements.

Another sample input:

n=9, k=3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Here, no subsequence sums to 3, but all other sums from 1 to 9, except 3, can be formed.

Let's verify:

- 1: 1

- 2: 1+1

- 4: 4

- 5: 4+1

- 6: 7-1 (but sequences can't have negative numbers, so maybe 7-1 is not allowed. Wait, perhaps 1+4+1-7= -1, but that's not relevant. We're only considering sums of subsets.

Wait, perhaps I need to check all possible subsets:

Possible subsets and their sums:

- []: 0

- [7]:7

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [1]:1

- [7,1]:8

- [7,4]:11

- [7,1]:8

- [1,4]:5

- [1,1]:2

- [7,1,4]:12

- [7,1,1]:8

- [1,4,1]:6

- [7,1,4,1]:13

So, sums possible: 0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,11,12,13

Excluding 3, which is what we want.

Another sample input:

n=10, k=7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Possible subsets:

- []:0

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [8]:8

- [3]:3

- [1,2]:3

- [1,8]:9

- [1,3]:4

- [2,8]:10

- [2,3]:5

- [8,3]:11

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,8,3]:12

- [2,8,3]:13

- [1,2,8,3]:14

So, sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Missing 7, which is k.

So, this sequence works.

From these examples, it seems like the strategy is to choose elements such that k cannot be formed as a sum of any subset, but all other v from 1 to n can be formed.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such a sequence with at most 25 elements.

Given that m <=25, and elements can be up to 1e9, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

One approach could be to use a combination of small numbers to cover the lower sums and larger numbers to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But this seems vague. Let's think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This is similar to being able to generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modifying the sequence to exclude the possibility of forming k.

One way to do this is to find a minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then adjust the sequence to make k unachievable.

Wait, but I need to ensure that k cannot be formed, while all other sums can be formed.

This sounds similar to the concept of a minimal generating set in group theory, but I need to exclude one specific sum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the idea of a complete subset sum, and then modify it to exclude k.

I recall that if I have a set where each element is greater than the sum of all previous elements, then the subsets form distinct sums. For example, [1, 2, 4, 8,...] where each element is double the previous one.

In this case, each subset sum is unique, and I can form any sum up to the total sum of the set.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, maybe I can take the binary representation approach, but adjust it to skip k.

Wait, but if I take powers of 2, I can form any sum uniquely. So, to exclude k, I need to exclude the subset that sums to k.

But I need to modify the sequence itself to make it impossible to reach k, while still being able to reach all other v from 1 to n.

Another idea: Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I remove or adjust one element to make k unachievable.

But removing an element might affect other sums as well.

Alternatively, perhaps I can include an element that blocks the sum k, without affecting other sums.

Wait, maybe I can include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but other sums can.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with a minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n.

- Then, modify the set to make k unachievable.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Let's consider the properties required.

I need a set S such that:

- The subset sums of S cover all v from 1 to n except k.

- No subset of S sums to k.

Given that, I need to construct such a set S with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 1e6, and m <=25, it suggests that the elements can be large enough to cover the sums efficiently.

Wait, but the elements can be up to 1e9, which is fine.

Let me think about the maximum sum that can be formed with 25 elements, each up to 1e9. It's 25 * 1e9 = 2.5e10, which is way larger than n=1e6, so I have plenty of room.

But I need to cover sums up to n=1e6, except for k.

One straightforward way is to include elements that can generate all sums except k.

One idea is to include small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the minimal set that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- Use a greedy approach to select elements that cover the required sums.

But I need to ensure that k is not achievable.

Another idea: Since m <=25, and 2^25 = 33,554,432, which is much larger than n=1e6, I can afford to have redundancy in the elements to cover the sums.

Wait, but I need to ensure that k is not achievable, which complicates things.

Let me consider the following plan:

1. Identify the sums that need to be covered: all v from 1 to n except k.

2. Construct a set S of at most 25 elements such that the subset sums of S cover exactly the required sums.

This seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle or some form of dynamic programming to select the elements, but with m<=25, it's manageable.

But dynamic programming might be too slow for n up to 1e6.

Wait, but n can be up to 1e6, and t up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases up to 1e7, so I need an efficient solution.

I need a smarter way to construct the sequence.

Let me think about the properties of the sequence.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and s >= n.

But I need to ensure that k is not among the subset sums.

Wait, but in the sample input where n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can generate sums from 0 to 7, so 8 cannot be formed, which is what we want.

Similarly, in n=9 and k=3, the sequence [7,1,4,1] can generate sums up to 13, but not 3.

So, perhaps I can choose elements such that the maximum sum is at least n, but specifically exclude k.

Wait, but in the first sample, n=2 and k=2, sequence [1], which can't sum to 2.

Similarly, in n=6 and k=1, sequence [2,3,4,5,6], which can't sum to 1.

So, in cases where k=1, I can choose elements all greater than or equal to 2.

Similarly, for k=n, I can choose elements that can't sum to n.

But I need a general approach.

Let me consider the following plan:

- If k=1, then choose elements all >=2, and make sure that sums cover all v from 2 to n.

- If k>1, then include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This still feels too vague.

Let me think about the binary representation again.

If I take the sequence of powers of 2: [1,2,4,8,16,...], I can generate any sum from 1 to the sum of the sequence.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the element that corresponds to the binary representation of k.

Wait, but that might not be sufficient.

Let me take an example.

Suppose n=10, k=7.

Binary representation of 7 is 111, which is 4+2+1.

If I exclude one of these, say 4, then I can't form 7, but I might not be able to form other sums as well.

Wait, in the sample input, for n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3].

Let's see:

- 1: 1

- 2: 2

- 3: 1+2

- 4: not directly, but 8-4, but we can't have negative numbers. Wait, perhaps 8-5, but that's not how subset sums work.

Wait, in subset sums, we can only add elements, not subtract them.

Wait, in the sequence [1,2,8,3], sums possible are:

- 1

- 2

- 8

- 3

- 1+2=3

- 1+8=9

- 1+3=4

- 2+8=10

- 2+3=5

- 8+3=11

- 1+2+8=11

- 1+2+3=6

- 1+8+3=12

- 2+8+3=13

- 1+2+8+3=14

So, sums are: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Missing 7, which is k.

So, in this case, by choosing [1,2,8,3], we cover all sums except 7.

How did they choose these elements?

Well, 1 and 2 allow sums up to 3, then adding 3 allows sums up to 6, and adding 8 allows sums up to 14.

But 7 is skipped.

So, perhaps the idea is to have elements that cover the sums up to n, except for k, by carefully choosing the elements.

Another way to think about it is to have the sequence cover all sums except k, by ensuring that k cannot be formed.

One possible strategy is:

- Include elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- To exclude k, perhaps include elements that cannot sum to k.

But this is still too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a sequence that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude k.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can remove an element that is necessary to form k, but ensure that all other sums can still be formed.

But this might not always be possible, as removing an element might affect other sums as well.

Another idea: Include elements in such a way that k cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

Let me consider that in the sequence, I include elements that allow me to generate all sums except k.

One possible way is to include elements that cover the sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

But how do I ensure that k cannot be formed?

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums except k by ensuring that no combination of elements sums to k.

This seems tricky.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums of S should cover all v from 1 to n except k.

This is what I need.

But how to construct such a set S with at most 25 elements.

Given that m <=25, and n can be up to 1e6, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

Let me consider using a combination of small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

Wait, but I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Start with the binary representation, i.e., include powers of 2 up to a certain point.

- Adjust the sequence to exclude k.

But I need to make sure that k cannot be formed, while all other sums can be formed.

Another idea: Use the fact that with m elements, I can have up to 2^m -1 different non-empty subset sums.

With m=25, that's over 33 million possible sums, which is way more than n=1e6.

So, I have plenty of subsets to cover the required sums.

But I need to select the elements such that the subset sums cover exactly the required sums, excluding k.

This seems too broad.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements needed to cover all sums from 1 to n except k.

Given that m <=25, it's feasible.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with m elements, I can cover up to 2^m -1 sums.

But I need to cover n-1 sums (all v from 1 to n except k).

So, I need 2^m -1 >= n-1.

With m=25, 2^25 -1 is about 33 million, which is much larger than n=1e6.

So, it's possible.

But I need to choose the elements such that the subset sums cover exactly the required sums.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Suppose I take the sequence consisting of all 1's.

For example, m=n-1, with all elements being 1.

Then, subset sums range from 0 to m= n-1, covering all sums from 1 to n-1.

If k=n, this would work, as k cannot be formed.

But m could be up to n-1, which for n=1e6 is too large, since m <=25.

So, this isn't efficient.

I need a better way to cover the sums with fewer elements.

Another idea: Use larger elements to cover larger sums efficiently.

For example, include elements like 1,2,4,8,..., up to a certain point, and then adjust for k.

But I need a systematic way.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to s, where s >= n, but I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can choose S such that the subset sums cover [1,s] \ {k}.

Wait, but s only needs to be at least n, since I only need sums up to n.

But in some cases, n might be less than s.

Wait, no, s should be at least n, because I need to cover sums up to n.

But I need to make sure that k is not included in the subset sums.

This is getting too tangled.

Let me look back at the sample inputs.

In the first sample, n=2, k=2, sequence [1].

- Sums: 0,1

- Missing 2, as required.

In the second sample, n=6, k=1, sequence [2,3,4,5,6].

- Sums: 2,3,4,5,6,2+3=5,2+4=6,2+5=7,2+6=8,3+4=7,3+5=8,3+6=9,4+5=9,4+6=10,5+6=11, and so on.

- Missing 1, as required.

In the third sample, n=8, k=8, sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

- Sums: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7

- Missing 8, as required.

In the fourth sample, n=9, k=3, sequence [7,1,4,1].

- Sums: 1,2 (1+1),3 (1+1+1, but in this sequence, 1+1=2, and 1+1+1=3 is not directly possible, but 1+2=3),4,5 (4+1),6 (7-1, but subset sums are only addition),7,8 (7+1),9 (7+1+1), etc.

- Missing 3, but in this sequence, 1+1+1=3, but in the sample, they have only two 1's and one 4 and one 7.

Wait, in the sequence [7,1,4,1], the subsets that sum to 3 are:

- [1,1,1] sums to 3, but there are only two 1's, so [1,1] sums to 2, and [1,1,1] is not possible.

Wait, but in the sample, they have two 1's, one 4, and one 7.

So, possible sums are:

- [1]:1

- [1]:1

- [4]:4

- [7]:7

- [1,1]:2

- [1,4]:5

- [1,7]:8

- [1,4]:5 (duplicate)

- [1,7]:8 (duplicate)

- [4,7]:11

- [1,1,4]:6

- [1,1,7]:9

- [1,4,7]:12

- [1,4,7]:12 (duplicate)

So, sums are: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12

Missing 3, which is k.

So, in this case, even though there are two 1's, I can't make 3, because there are only two 1's.

Hence, k=3 cannot be formed, while other sums can be formed.

This gives me an idea.

If I include elements such that the number of 1's is less than k, then k cannot be formed by 1's alone.

For example, if k=3, and I have only two 1's, then I can't make 3 by using 1's alone.

But I might still be able to make 3 by combining with other elements.

So, I need to ensure that no combination of elements sums to k.

In the sample, with [7,1,4,1], there is no subset that sums to 3.

Even though [1,1,1] would sum to 3, but there are only two 1's, so it's impossible.

Similarly, other combinations don't sum to 3.

So, by limiting the number of 1's, I can prevent k from being formed.

This seems like a useful strategy.

So, perhaps I can include a certain number of 1's, less than k, and then include other elements to cover the remaining sums.

Wait, but in the first sample, n=2, k=2, sequence [1], which has one 1, less than k=2.

In the fourth sample, n=9, k=3, sequence [7,1,4,1], which has two 1's, less than k=3.

So, a general strategy could be:

- Include (k-1) ones, so that k cannot be formed by 1's alone.

- Then, include other elements to cover the remaining sums.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, even if combining different elements.

So, just limiting the number of 1's might not be sufficient.

For example, if k=3, and I have two 1's and a 2, then [1,2] sums to 3, which is k.

So, in that case, k can be formed.

Hence, I need to be careful about the combination of elements.

In the sample, for n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1].

Here, [1,1,1] would sum to 3, but there are only two 1's, so 3 cannot be formed.

Also, there is no other element that can be combined to make 3.

So, in this case, k=3 cannot be formed.

Hence, a possible strategy is:

- Include (k-1) ones.

- Then, include other elements that can cover the remaining sums without allowing k to be formed.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This seems tricky.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to construct S with at most 25 elements.

Given that, perhaps I can use the fact that with m elements, I can cover a certain range of sums.

Wait, but m can be up to 25, which is small compared to n=1e6.

So, I need to choose elements that can cover the sums efficiently.

Let me consider that the elements should be chosen such that their subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

This is similar to a minimal test cover problem, but I need an efficient way.

Another idea: Use the fact that with elements being powers of 2, I can cover all sums uniquely.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the element corresponding to the binary representation of k.

But as I saw earlier, that might not work, because other combinations could still sum to k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that correspond to the binary representation, but adjust for k.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me look for another approach.

Let me consider that I can include elements that allow me to generate all sums except k.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that no subset sums to k.

To do this, I can include elements that are not multiples of k or something similar.

But this seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have elements that are multiples of some number, I can control which sums are possible.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I have elements that are all greater than or equal to k, then sums cannot be less than k.

But in the sample input where n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which are all greater than or equal to 2, so no subset can sum to 1.

Similarly, in n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum up to at most 7, so 8 cannot be formed.

So, in cases where k=1, choose elements >=2, and for k=n, choose elements <n.

But for general k, I need a different strategy.

Wait, perhaps, for general k, I can choose elements such that the maximum subset sum is n, and ensure that k cannot be formed.

But this still doesn't give me a clear path.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix m=25, and choose elements a1,a2,...,a25.

I need to ensure that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

This is equivalent to saying that the subset sums of S are exactly {1,2,...,n} \ {k}.

Given that, I need to find a set S with m <=25 elements that satisfies this condition.

Given that n can be up to 1e6, and m=25, I need to choose elements that can cover a large range of sums.

One way to maximize the number of sums covered is to choose elements that are powers of 2, as they can generate any sum through their combinations.

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can modify the set of powers of 2 to exclude k.

Wait, but simply excluding the element corresponding to k in binary representation might not work, because k could be formed by other combinations.

For example, if k=3, and I have [1,2,4], then [1,2] sums to 3.

So, excluding 2 won't help, because [1,2] still sums to 3.

Hence, I need a different approach.

Let me consider that if I can cover all sums except k, I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, while being able to sum to all other v from 1 to n.

This sounds similar to the concept of a complete set of residues modulo some number, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of generating functions.

The generating function for the subset sums is the product of (1 + x^a) for each a in S.

I need this generating function to have coefficients 1 for all v from 1 to n except k, where the coefficient should be 0.

This is a complex condition, and I need a way to choose S to satisfy it.

Given the time constraints, I need a more practical approach.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can choose elements to cover the sums efficiently.

One possible strategy is:

- Include small elements to cover the lower sums, up to k-1.

- Include elements larger than k to cover higher sums, up to n.

- Ensure that k cannot be formed by any subset.

But I need to make sure that no combination of elements sums to k.

To do this, I can:

- Include elements that cannot be combined to sum to k.

- For example, if k is small, include elements larger than k, and adjust smaller elements accordingly.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are multiples of some number, I can control which sums are possible.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I include elements that are all greater than or equal to some value, I can skip certain sums.

But in the sample input where k=8 and n=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can sum up to at most 7, thus excluding 8.

Similarly, in n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which cannot sum to 3.

So, perhaps for k > n/2, I can choose elements that sum to less than k.

But for k <= n/2, I need a different approach.

This seems too convoluted.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix k, and think about how to construct S such that k cannot be formed, but all other v from 1 to n can be formed.

One way to ensure that k cannot be formed is to make sure that no subset sums to k.

To do this, I can choose elements that are not compatible with forming k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then S must satisfy that the subset sums cover exactly the required sums.

This seems too abstract.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that since m <=25, and n can be up to 1e6, I need to choose elements that can cover a large range of sums efficiently.

One way to do this is to include elements that are powers of 2, as they can generate any sum through their combinations.

But I need to adjust for k.

Wait, perhaps I can include powers of 2 up to a certain point, and then adjust the sequence to exclude k.

For example, include powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to n, and then adjust for k.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude the element corresponding to the highest set bit in k, and include other elements to cover the remaining sums.

This might work.

Let me try with an example.

Suppose n=10, k=7.

Binary representation of 7 is 111, which is 4 + 2 + 1.

If I exclude 4, then I can't form 7 with the remaining elements [1,2].

But with [1,2], I can form sums 1,2,3.

If I include other elements, like 8, but that won't help in forming sums beyond 3.

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=10 and k=7, the sequence is [1,2,8,3].

In this sequence, [1,2,3,8], and their subsets can form sums up to 14, except 7.

But in this case, how does excluding 7 work?

Well, in that sequence, there is no subset that sums to 7.

But if I include 1,2,3,8, then:

- [1,2,3,8]:14

- [1,2,3]:6

- [1,2,8]:11

- [1,3,8]:12

- [2,3,8]:13

- [1,2]:3

- [1,3]:4

- [1,8]:9

- [2,3]:5

- [2,8]:10

- [3,8]:11

- [1]:1

- [2]:2

- [3]:3

- [8]:8

So, sums are:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Missing 7.

So, by choosing elements carefully, I can exclude 7.

But how to generalize this?

Another idea: If I include elements that can cover all sums from 1 to n except k, I can start by including elements that cover sums up to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are all congruent to some modulus, but I'm not sure.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums of S should be exactly the required sums.

But I need a way to construct such a set S efficiently.

Given that m <=25, and n can be up to 1e6, I need to choose elements that can cover the sums efficiently.

Perhaps I can use a combination of small elements to cover the lower sums and larger elements to cover the higher sums, while ensuring that k cannot be formed.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that if I include elements that are powers of 2, I can cover all sums uniquely.

But I need to exclude k.

So, perhaps I can exclude the element corresponding to the highest set bit in k and adjust the sequence accordingly.

Wait, but in the earlier example, excluding 4 didn't prevent me from forming 7, because [1,2,4] can still form 7.

Wait, no, [1,2,4] sums to 7, which is k.

So, if I exclude 4, then I can't form 7 with [1,2], which sums to 3.

But then, I need to include other elements to cover the higher sums.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude the element that is necessary to form k and include other elements to cover the missing sums.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k, then I can't form k, but I need to ensure that all other sums can still be formed.

But I'm not sure.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude k.

To do this, I can remove an element that is necessary to form k, and adjust the sequence to cover the other sums.

But this might not always work, as removing an element might affect other sums as well.

Another idea: Include elements that can generate all sums except multiples of k.

But that's not what's required; I need to exclude only k, not all multiples of k.

This is getting too complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different strategy.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can choose elements to cover the required sums efficiently.

One possible way is to include elements that are powers of 2, up to 2^24, which is 16,777,216, which is way larger than n=1e6.

So, with m=25, I can cover sums up to 2^25 -1 = 33,554,431, which is more than enough for n=1e6.

But again, I need to exclude k.

Wait, perhaps I can include powers of 2 up to a certain point, and then adjust for k.

But I need to ensure that k cannot be formed.

Wait, perhaps I can exclude the element that corresponds to the highest set bit in k and include other elements to cover the missing sums.

But in the earlier example, excluding 4 from [1,2,4] didn't prevent k=7, because [1,2,4] sums to 7.

Wait, no, if I exclude 4, then [1,2] sums to 3, and I need to adjust other elements to cover the higher sums.

But I'm getting stuck in the same loop.

Let me consider that if I exclude the element that is equal to k, then no subset can sum to k.

But if k is not a power of 2, and I exclude that specific element, it might not prevent k from being formed by other combinations.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix k and n, and think about the minimal set of elements that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

Given that m <=25, I need an efficient way to cover the sums.

Perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select elements that cover as much of the required sums as possible without allowing k to be formed.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that I start with an empty set S.

I need to select elements to include in S such that:

- No subset of S sums to k.

- All other v from 1 to n, except k, can be formed by some subset of S.

To ensure that no subset sums to k, I can iteratively select elements that do not allow any subset to sum to k.

This sounds like building a set where the subset sums avoid k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

One possible way is to use dynamic programming to select elements that maximize the coverage of the required sums without including k.

But with n up to 1e6, this might be too slow.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let me consider that if I have a set S that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then I can think of it as S being able to generate all sums from 1 to k-1 and from k+1 to n.

So, perhaps I can split the problem into two parts: generating sums up to k-1 and generating sums from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that these two parts don't combine to form k.

Wait, that might not make sense.

Another idea: If I have a set S1 that generates sums from 1 to k-1, and a set S2 that generates sums from k+1 to n, then their union S = S1 U S2 would generate all sums from 1 to n except k, provided that no subset of S sums to k.

But I need to ensure that no subset of S sums to k.

However, if S1 and S2 are disjoint, and neither can sum to k, then their union also cannot sum to k.

Wait, but S1 can sum to some value less than k, and S2 can sum to some value greater than or equal to k+1, but their combination might still sum to k if S1's sum plus S2's sum equals k.

Wait, no, because S2's sums are at least k+1, and S1's sums are at most k-1, so their sum would be at least (k+1) + 0 = k+1, which is greater than k.

Hence, no subset of S can sum to k.

Wait, but subsets can include elements from both S1 and S2, so their sums would be at least k+1, which is greater than k.

Hence, no subset sums to k.

But S1 can generate sums from 1 to k-1, and S2 can generate sums from k+1 to n.

Hence, their union can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

This seems promising.

So, a possible strategy is:

- Choose S1 to generate sums from 1 to k-1.

- Choose S2 to generate sums from k+1 to n.

- Ensure that S1 and S2 are disjoint.

- Then, S = S1 U S2 will generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

- Additionally, ensure that no subset of S sums to k.

Given that, I need to choose
