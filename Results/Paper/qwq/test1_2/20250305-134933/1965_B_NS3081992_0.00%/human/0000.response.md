Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and I need to find a sequence of non-negative integers with at most 25 elements. This sequence should satisfy two conditions:

1. There should be no subsequence of the sequence that sums up to k.

2. For every integer v from 1 to n, except k, there should be a subsequence that sums up to v.

Also, it's guaranteed that a solution exists under the given constraints, and I need to output the sequence for each test case.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is obtained by removing some elements from the sequence without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if my sequence is [1, 2, 3], then [1, 3] is a subsequence, but [3, 1] is not, because the order is changed.

Now, the problem is to create a sequence where no subsequence sums to k, but for every other v between 1 and n (excluding k), there is a subsequence that sums to v.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence. Let's consider some small examples to get an intuition.

Take the first example from the input:

2 2

Here, n=2 and k=2. So, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 2, but there should be a subsequence that sums to 1.

A possible sequence is [1], as given in the sample output. Indeed, the only possible subsequence is [1], which sums to 1, so it doesn't sum to 2, and it does sum to 1, which is the only v in the range [1,2] except k=2.

Another example:

6 1

Here, n=6 and k=1. So, I need a sequence where no subsequence sums to 1, but there should be subsequences that sum to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

A possible sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], as given in the sample output. Let's verify:

- Subsequences:

- [2] sums to 2

- [3] sums to 3

- [4] sums to 4

- [5] sums to 5

- [6] sums to 6

- [2,3] sums to 5

- [2,4] sums to 6

- And so on.

None of these subsequences sum to 1, which is good.

Another example:

8 8

Sequence: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1]

Here, n=8 and k=8. So, no subsequence should sum to 8, but there should be subsequences summing to 1 through 7.

With seven 1's, any subsequence sum is from 1 to 7, and the sum of all seven is 7, which is less than 8, so no subsequence sums to 8.

Wait, but 1+1+1+1+1+1+1=7, which is less than 8, so indeed, no subsequence sums to 8, and all sums from 1 to 7 are possible.

Another example:

9 3

Sequence: [7,1,4,1]

Let's check:

Possible subsequences:

- [7] sums to 7

- [1] sums to 1

- [4] sums to 4

- [1] sums to 1

- [7,1] sums to 8

- [7,4] sums to 11

- [7,1,1] sums to 9

- [1,4] sums to 5

- [1,1] sums to 2

- [1,4,1] sums to 6

So, sums possible: 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9

Missing 3, which is k, as required.

Another example:

10 7

Sequence: [1,2,8,3]

Possible sums:

- [1] =1

- [2]=2

- [8]=8

- [3]=3

- [1,2]=3

- [1,8]=9

- [1,3]=4

- [2,8]=10

- [2,3]=5

- [8,3]=11

- [1,2,8]=11

- [1,2,3]=6

- [1,8,3]=12

- [2,8,3]=13

- [1,2,8,3]=14

So, sums: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Missing 7, as required.

From these examples, I can see that the sequences provided in the sample outputs satisfy the conditions.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such sequences for any given n and k.

First, I need to ensure that for all v from 1 to n, except k, there exists a subsequence that sums to v.

Second, I need to ensure that no subsequence sums to k.

Given that the sequence can have at most 25 elements, and the elements can be up to 10^9, but in the sample inputs, they are much smaller.

I need to think about how to construct such a sequence efficiently.

One approach is to use the concept of subset sums. The subset sum problem is to find a subset of a given set of integers that sums to a given value.

In this problem, I need to construct a set where the subset sums cover all values from 1 to n, except k.

This seems tricky because I need to exclude only one specific sum, k, while including all others.

I need to think about how to achieve this.

One idea is to include certain elements that allow me to generate sums up to n, but exclude k.

I recall that with a set of elements that are powers of 2, I can generate any sum up to the sum of all elements.

For example, [1,2,4,8,...] can generate any sum up to 1+2+4+8+... .

But in this problem, I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can modify the set of powers of 2 to exclude k.

But powers of 2 might not be sufficient because I have to exclude only one sum, and it's not clear how to do that.

Another idea is to include elements that allow me to generate all sums except k.

One way to ensure that no subsequence sums to k is to make sure that any subset that would sum to k is invalid.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have a set whose subset sums cover all numbers from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude k.

I recall that with a set whose subset sums cover a certain range, I can exclude a specific sum by adjusting the elements.

But how?

Another approach is to use the fact that if I have a set whose subset sums cover all numbers up to a certain value, and I add a new element, it will cover new sums.

So, maybe I can start with a set that covers all sums up to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

But it's not clear how to exclude only one specific sum.

Let me consider the following:

If I have a set A that can generate sums from 1 to n, and another set B that can generate sums from 1 to m, then the union of A and B can generate sums that are sums from A plus sums from B.

But this is not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle.

If I have a set that generates all sums from 1 to n, and another set that generates sums that can cancel out k, but I'm not sure.

This seems complicated.

Let me think about the sample inputs again.

In the first sample, n=2 and k=2, sequence [1].

It can generate 1, but not 2.

In the second sample, n=6 and k=1, sequence [2,3,4,5,6].

All sums are from 2 to 6, excluding 1.

In the third sample, n=8 and k=8, sequence [1,1,1,1,1,1,1].

Sums from 1 to 7, excluding 8.

In the fourth sample, n=9 and k=3, sequence [7,1,4,1].

Sums from 1 to 9, excluding 3.

In the fifth sample, n=10 and k=7, sequence [1,2,8,3].

Sums from 1 to 10, excluding 7.

So, in some cases, they used multiple small numbers, and in others, a combination of small and large numbers.

I need to find a general method.

Let me consider that if I have a set whose subset sums can generate all numbers from 1 to n, and then I modify it to exclude k.

One way to exclude k is to remove some elements that would otherwise sum to k.

But this might not be straightforward.

Another idea: If I can find a set where the only way to sum to k is by including a specific element, then I can adjust that element to prevent the sum from being k.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that cover all sums except k by carefully choosing elements that don't allow the sum k to be formed.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I need to ensure that for every v from 1 to n, v != k, there exists a subset of A that sums to v, and no subset sums to k.

I need to find such a set A with at most 25 elements.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t can be up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7, I need an efficient way to construct A.

Let me consider the binary representation.

If I take the first m powers of 2, I can generate any sum from 1 to 2^m - 1.

For example, [1,2,4,8] can generate any sum from 1 to 15.

But I need to exclude one specific sum, k.

So, perhaps I can take the powers of 2 up to some m, and then adjust by including or excluding certain elements to exclude k.

But it's still not clear.

Wait, maybe I can take the powers of 2 up to m, and then adjust by including an element that prevents the sum k from being formed.

For example, if k is 5, and I have [1,2,4], which can form 5 (1+4), I can remove 4 or 1 to prevent 5 from being formed.

But if I remove 4, then I can't form sums that require 4.

So, that might not work.

Alternatively, maybe I can include an element that makes some sums unreachable.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem in terms of generating functions.

The generating function for the subset sums is the product of (1 + x^a) for each a in the set.

I need this product to have coefficients of x^v for v from 1 to n, except v = k, where the coefficient should be 0.

This seems complex, but maybe I can find a way to construct such a set.

Another idea: Since it's guaranteed that a solution exists, and m is at most 25, perhaps I can construct a set with m=25 elements that can generate all sums except k.

But 25 elements can generate up to 2^25 - 1 sums, which is over 33 million, way more than n can be (n <= 10^6).

But I need to exclude only one specific sum, k.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with m elements, I can generate up to 2^m - 1 distinct sums.

But I need to ensure that among these sums, k is excluded, and all other v from 1 to n are included.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, 2^25 is about 33 million, which is more than enough to cover n up to 10^6.

But again, excluding only one specific sum is tricky.

Let me consider the following approach:

Start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

For example, start with the first m powers of 2, which can generate all sums from 1 to 2^m - 1.

Then, adjust the set to exclude k.

But how?

One idea is to remove an element that is part of the sum that makes k.

For example, if k is 5, and I have [1,2,4], which can make 5 (1+4), I can remove 4, but then I can't make sums that require 4.

Alternatively, I can replace an element with another value that prevents k from being formed.

But this seems too ad hoc.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I split the set into two parts: one that can generate sums up to k-1, and another that can generate sums from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

This seems promising.

So, I can have one subset that covers sums up to k-1, and another that covers sums from k+1 to n, and ensure that no combination of these subsets sums to k.

But how to achieve this?

Wait, maybe I can have one subset that covers sums up to some value, and another that covers higher sums, with a gap at k.

But it's not clear.

Another idea: Use the fact that if I have two disjoint subsets, their sums can be combined in certain ways.

But again, it's not clear how to apply this here.

Let me look at the constraints again.

The sequence can have at most 25 elements, and each element can be up to 10^9.

n can be up to 10^6, and t can be up to 1000, with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^7.

Given that, I need an efficient way to construct the sequence for each test case.

Time constraints are important here, but since m is small (at most 25), and n can be up to 10^6, I need an intelligent way to construct the sequence.

Let me consider that with m elements, I can represent up to 2^m - 1 distinct sums.

With m=25, that's over 33 million, which is more than n=10^6.

But I need to exclude only one specific sum, k, while including all others up to n.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and m=25 can represent sums up to much larger than 10^6.

So, perhaps I can limit the sums up to n, excluding k.

But how?

Let me consider that the sum of the first m powers of 2 is 2^{m+1} - 1, which is much larger than n=10^6 for m=25.

So, perhaps I can cap the sums at n, but I need to ensure that k is not achievable.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, except k.

I can try to find such a set A.

One way to do this is to start with a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

But how?

Another idea: If I have a set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I add an element that is larger than n, then no new sums below n are created.

But adding a large element won't help in excluding k.

Wait, maybe I can add an element that makes some sums unreachable.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I have a set A, and I add an element x to it, then the new sums are the sums of A plus the sums of A with x added.

So, if x is larger than n, then it won't affect sums below x.

But again, I need to exclude only k.

This seems too indirect.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate sums from 1 to s, and I want to exclude k, perhaps I can choose x such that x + y = k is not possible for any y in A.

But this seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a set A, and I want to exclude k, I can choose A such that for no subset sum y in A, y + x = k for any x in A.

But this might not be sufficient.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I fix k, and n.

I need to create a set A with at most 25 elements, such that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

Let me consider that A can be divided into two parts: one that covers sums up to k-1, and another that covers sums from k+1 to n.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

Wait, perhaps I can have two disjoint subsets: one that covers sums up to k-1, and another that covers sums from k+1 to n, and ensure that no combination of these subsets sums to k.

But how to achieve this?

Let me consider that if I have two disjoint subsets A and B, where A covers sums up to a, and B covers sums up to b, then the combined subset sums are the sums of A and the sums of B, as well as the sums of a + b for a in A and b in B.

So, if A covers 1 to a, and B covers 1 to b, then the combined sums cover 1 to a + b.

But I need to exclude k.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about another approach.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k.

I can try to find such a set A.

One way is to start with the full set that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and then modify it to exclude k.

But how?

Another idea: If I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element x from A, then the sums that are no longer possible are the sums that included x.

So, if x is such that x = k, or x is part of the sum that makes k, then removing x would exclude k.

But this might also exclude other sums that included x.

This could be a way, but it's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I can remove an element x that is part of the sum that makes k, but adjust the set to still cover other sums.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I replace an element x with y, such that y is chosen so that k cannot be formed.

But this is still too vague.

I need a more concrete approach.

Let me consider that if I have a set A with elements a1, a2, ..., am, and I want to ensure that no subset sums to k, while being able to sum to all other v from 1 to n.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums of A should cover all v from 1 to n except v = k.

Given that, perhaps I can look for a minimal set A that can generate all v except k.

But minimal in terms of what? The number of elements?

But the problem allows up to 25 elements, so minimality might not be necessary.

Wait, but n can be up to 10^6, and m is at most 25, so with 25 elements, I can cover up to 2^25 - 1 sums, which is more than enough for n=10^6.

But again, excluding only one specific sum is tricky.

Let me think about the problem in terms of the subset sum problem.

The subset sum problem is NP-complete, but since m is small (at most 25), and n is up to 10^6, it's manageable.

But I need an efficient way to construct the set A for each test case, given that t can be up to 1000, and the sum of n over all test cases is up to 10^7.

So, I need an approach that is efficient both in terms of time and space.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can represent up to 2^25 subsets, which is about 33 million subsets.

Given that n can be up to 10^6, and t up to 1000, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^7, I need an approach that can handle this within time limits.

But perhaps there is a smarter way to construct the set A without brute-forcing.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums should cover all v from 1 to n except v = k.

I need to ensure that no subset sums to k, while ensuring that for all other v, there exists a subset that sums to v.

This seems like a classic subset sum problem with a twist.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of linear independence or some other mathematical property to construct such a set.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I choose elements that are powers of 2, I can generate any sum up to the sum of all elements.

But then excluding one specific sum, k, is difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that allow me to generate all sums except k by carefully choosing their values.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I want to modify it to exclude k.

One way is to remove an element x from A such that x is part of the subset that sums to k.

But removing x might also exclude other sums that included x.

So, this might not be sufficient.

Another idea is to include an element that is equal to k, but that wouldn't help because then the subset consisting of that single element would sum to k, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the problem states that the sequence consists of non-negative integers, and k is at least 1, so including k itself is allowed, but in this case, it would violate the condition since the subset consisting of k would sum to k.

So, I need to avoid including k in the sequence.

But that alone might not be sufficient, as other subsets might still sum to k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are less than k and greater than k, but ensure that no combination sums to k.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I have elements that are all greater than k, then no subset can sum to k, because the smallest element is larger than k.

But in this case, I can't generate sums less than the smallest element, which might be necessary for v < k.

Wait, but in the second sample input, n=6 and k=1, the sequence is [2,3,4,5,6], which are all greater than k=1, and they can generate sums from 2 to 6, excluding 1, which matches the requirements.

So, in this case, since k=1, and all elements are greater than 1, no subset sums to 1, and all other v from 2 to 6 are covered.

Similarly, in the third sample input, n=8 and k=8, the sequence is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which can generate sums from 1 to 7, excluding 8.

So, in this case, all elements are less than k=8, and their total sum is 7, which is less than 8, so no subset sums to 8.

Similarly, in the fourth sample input, n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can generate sums from 1 to 9, excluding 3.

Wait, but 7 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 13, which is greater than n=9, but the problem only requires sums up to n.

But in this case, with elements [7,1,4,1], the possible sums are 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9, as listed in the sample explanation, excluding 3.

So, it's possible to construct such a set.

Now, I need a general method to construct such a set for any n and k.

Let me consider different cases based on the value of k.

Case 1: k = 1

In this case, I need a sequence where no subset sums to 1, but all subsets sum to v from 2 to n.

To prevent any subset from summing to 1, I can choose all elements to be greater than or equal to 2.

Then, the smallest sum is 2, and I can generate higher sums accordingly.

For example, [2,3,4,...] would work.

This seems straightforward for k=1.

Case 2: k = n

In this case, I need a sequence where no subset sums to n, but all subsets sum to v from 1 to n-1.

One way to achieve this is to choose elements such that their total sum is less than n.

For example, if I choose all elements to be less than k=n, and their sum is less than n, then no subset can sum to n.

For example, [1,1,1,...] with sum less than n.

But in this case, I might not be able to generate all sums from 1 to n-1.

Wait, for example, if n=8 and k=8, the sample output is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], which sums to 7, covering sums from 1 to 7, excluding 8.

This works because the total sum is 7 < 8.

But in general, if I set all elements to be less than k, and their total sum is less than k, then no subset can sum to k, and all subsets can sum to v from 1 to k-1.

But I need to ensure that all v from 1 to n are covered, except k.

Wait, but in this case, n=8 and k=8, so v from 1 to 7 are covered, which is fine.

But what if n is larger than the sum of all elements?

In that case, I need to include larger elements to cover higher sums.

Wait, but in the sample input where n=9 and k=3, the sequence is [7,1,4,1], which can sum up to 13, covering up to n=9.

So, in this case, I need to cover sums up to 9, excluding 3.

So, it's not just about making the total sum less than k; I need a more general approach.

Case 3: 1 < k < n

In this case, I need to exclude only k, but include all other sums from 1 to n.

This seems the most challenging.

One idea is to include elements that can generate all sums except k.

But how?

Another idea is to include elements that can generate sums up to k-1, and then include elements that can generate sums from k+1 to n, without allowing any subset to sum to k.

But I need to ensure that no subset sums to k.

Wait, perhaps I can include elements that are enough to generate all sums except k, by carefully choosing their values.

But this is still too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I want to modify it to exclude k.

One way is to find a subset of A whose sum is k, and then adjust A to exclude that subset.

But this seems too indirect.

Another idea is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle to ensure that k is excluded.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I have a set A, and I want to ensure that no subset sums to k, I can iterate through all possible subsets and ensure that none sum to k.

But with m=25, there are 2^25 subsets, which is about 33 million, which is too slow for t=1000 test cases.

So, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to check if a set can generate all v except k.

But again, with t=1000 and m=25, time constraints are tight.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that with m=25, I can represent up to 2^25 subsets, which is more than enough to cover n=10^6.

But I need to ensure that k is not achievable.

Perhaps I can construct the set A such that the subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

But how?

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I remove an element x from A such that x is part of the subset that sums to k.

But this might also exclude other sums that include x.

This seems too error-prone.

Another idea: If I can find a set A where the minimal subset sum is greater than k, or something like that.

But in this case, I need to cover sums up to n, which might be larger than k.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem in terms of the minimal number of elements needed to cover all sums except k.

Given that m can be up to 25, and n can be up to 10^6, perhaps there is a way to cover all sums up to n with 25 elements, excluding only k.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then perhaps I can start with a set that can generate all sums up to n, and then adjust it to exclude k.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to s, and I add an element x > s + 1, then the new sums will be from 1 to s + x.

But in this case, I need to exclude only k.

This seems too indirect.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then perhaps I can split the sums into two parts: sums up to k-1 and sums from k+1 to n.

Then, I can try to find subsets that cover these two parts without allowing any subset to sum to k.

But I need to ensure that no combination of subsets sums to k.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to k-1, and another set B that can generate sums from k+1 to n, and ensure that no subset of A union B sums to k.

But I need to make sure that no subset of A and B together sums to k.

This seems promising, but I need to find a way to construct such sets A and B.

Wait, perhaps I can choose A to generate sums up to k-1, and B to generate sums from k+1 to n, and ensure that the sums from A and B do not combine to k.

But I need to ensure that no subset of A and B together sums to k.

This seems tricky.

Another idea: If I choose A such that no subset of A sums to k, and the sums of A cover all v from 1 to k-1, and then choose B such that the sums of B cover v from k+1 to n, and ensure that no subset of B sums to k, and no combination of A and B sums to k.

But this seems too vague.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then perhaps I can choose A to include elements that allow generating all v != k.

But this is too broad.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I fix k and n, and try to find a set A with at most 25 elements that can generate all v from 1 to n except k.

Given that, perhaps I can use a greedy approach to select elements that cover the required sums.

But greedy approaches can be tricky in subset sum problems.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to select elements that cover the required sums, excluding k.

But with m=25 and n=10^6, this might not be efficient enough.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then the subset sums of A should be all v from 1 to n except v = k.

Given that, perhaps I can look for a minimal set A that can generate all v except k.

But minimality might not be necessary since m can be up to 25.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that with m=25, I can cover up to 2^25 - 1 sums, which is more than enough for n=10^6.

But again, excluding only one specific sum is tricky.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then perhaps I can choose A to include elements that are necessary to generate all v != k.

But I need a more concrete plan.

Wait, perhaps I can use the following approach:

- Start with an empty set A.

- For each v from 1 to n, except k, ensure that there exists a subset of A that sums to v.

- While ensuring that no subset sums to k.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about the problem differently.

Suppose I have a set A, and I want to check if its subset sums cover all v from 1 to n except k.

But checking all subsets is not feasible due to time constraints.

I need a better way.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n except k, then perhaps I can use some mathematical properties to construct A.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that if I have a set A that can generate all sums from 1 to n, and I modify it to exclude k, perhaps by adjusting one of the elements.

But I need a concrete method.

Let me consider that if I have a
