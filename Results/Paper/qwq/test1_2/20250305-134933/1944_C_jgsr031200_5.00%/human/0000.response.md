Alright, I have this problem to solve. It involves a game between Alice and Bob on an array of integers, and I need to determine the final score of the game when both play optimally. The score is defined as the MEX of the array that Alice constructs.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for Minimum EXcludant, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 1] is 2 because 0 and 1 are present, but 2 is not. The MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3] is 4, as all numbers from 0 to 3 are present.

Now, the game is played in turns, with Alice starting first. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from the array 'a', appends it to her array 'c', and deletes it from 'a'. On Bob's turn, he picks an element from 'a', deletes it from 'a', but does not add it to 'c'. The game ends when 'a' is empty, and the score is the MEX of 'c'.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. Both play optimally, meaning they make the best possible moves to achieve their goals.

I need to find the final score, given that both play optimally.

Let's consider the example provided:

Input:

3

4

0 0 1 1

4

0 1 2 3

2

1 1

Output:

2

1

0

In the first test case, with array [0, 0, 1, 1], the output is 2. This matches the example in the problem statement where c = [1, 0], and MEX is 2.

In the second test case, [0, 1, 2, 3], the output is 1. Wait, but the MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3] is 4. However, Alice can choose elements in such a way that the MEX is minimized or maximized based on her and Bob's actions.

Wait, I need to think differently. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to have as many low numbers as possible in her array 'c', up to the point where higher numbers are missing.

But Bob wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from having low numbers in her array.

So, in each turn, Alice picks an element to add to 'c', and Bob picks an element to remove from 'a'.

Given that Alice starts first, and they alternate turns, with Alice making the first move, I need to simulate their optimal plays.

Let me think about the game mechanics:

- Total number of elements in 'a' is 'n'.

- Alice's turns: she picks one element to add to 'c' and deletes it from 'a'.

- Bob's turns: he picks one element to delete from 'a'.

- The game ends when 'a' is empty.

- The number of turns is equal to 'n', with Alice and Bob alternating, Alice starting first.

- If 'n' is odd, Alice has one more turn than Bob.

- If 'n' is even, they have an equal number of turns.

Wait, no. Since Alice starts and they alternate, Alice will always have ceil(n/2) turns, and Bob will have floor(n/2) turns.

Because Alice goes first, she gets to make one more move than Bob if 'n' is odd.

Wait, let's confirm:

- If n is odd, Alice makes (n+1)//2 moves, Bob makes n//2 moves.

- If n is even, both make n/2 moves.

Yes, that's correct.

So, in terms of the number of elements in 'c', it will be equal to the number of Alice's moves, which is ceil(n/2).

But, in reality, since Alice picks elements to add to 'c', and Bob picks elements to delete from 'a', but not add to 'c', the final 'c' will have exactly ceil(n/2) elements, but which elements depend on their choices.

Wait, no. Alice picks elements to add to 'c' and deletes them from 'a', and Bob picks elements to delete from 'a'. So, in total, 'a' is being reduced by one element per turn, just like in any turn-based game where players remove elements.

Wait, no. On Alice's turn, she picks an element from 'a', adds it to 'c', and deletes it from 'a'. On Bob's turn, he picks an element from 'a', deletes it from 'a'. So, each turn reduces the array 'a' by one element, and the game continues until 'a' is empty.

Therefore, the total number of turns is 'n', with Alice making ceil(n/2) moves and Bob making floor(n/2) moves.

Now, the goal is to find the MEX of 'c' at the end of the game, assuming both play optimally.

I need to find a way to determine what elements Alice can get into 'c' despite Bob's attempts to minimize the MEX.

Let me consider that Alice wants to maximize the MEX, which means she wants to have as many low numbers in 'c' as possible, while Bob wants to minimize the MEX, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from having low numbers in 'c'.

Wait, actually, MEX is the smallest missing number in 'c', so to maximize MEX, Alice wants to have as many low numbers as possible in 'c', up to the point where some higher number is missing.

Conversely, Bob wants to minimize MEX, meaning he wants to ensure that some low number is missing from 'c'.

So, in the game, Alice will try to include low numbers in 'c', and Bob will try to prevent her from doing so by removing certain elements.

I need to model their optimal strategies.

Let me consider that both players have perfect information and play optimally.

I need to find a way to simulate their moves or find a pattern that allows me to determine the final MEX.

Let me consider small examples to get an idea.

Example 1:

n = 4

a = [0, 0, 1, 1]

As per the sample input, the output is 2.

One possible game is:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

- Bob picks 0, a = [0, 1]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1, 0], a = [1]

- Bob picks 1, a = []

So, c = [1, 0], MEX is 2.

But I need to confirm if this is indeed the optimal play.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 0, c = [0], a = [0, 1, 1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0, 1]

- Alice picks 1, c = [0, 1], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

So, c = [0, 1], MEX is 2.

Another possible game:

- Alice picks 1, c = [1], a = [0, 0, 1]

- Bob picks 1, a = [0, 0]

- Alice picks 0, c = [1, 0], a = [0]

- Bob picks 0, a = []

So, c = [1, 0], MEX is 2.

It seems that in all these scenarios, the MEX is 2.

Is it possible to get a higher MEX? Let's see.

Suppose Alice tries to get MEX = 3, which would require having 0, 1, and 2 in 'c'. But in the given array, there is no 2. So, MEX would be at least 2.

Wait, but in the sample input, the output is 2, which matches.

In the second test case:

n = 4

a = [0, 1, 2, 3]

Output: 1

Wait, but if Alice can get both 0 and 1 in 'c', then MEX would be 2.

But the output is 1, which suggests that Bob can prevent Alice from getting both 0 and 1 into 'c'.

Let me think about it.

Total elements: 4

Alice makes 2 moves, Bob makes 2 moves.

Alice's goal: maximize MEX, meaning she wants to have as many low numbers as possible in 'c'.

Bob's goal: minimize MEX, meaning he wants to prevent Alice from having low numbers in 'c'.

In this case, with a = [0,1,2,3], and n=4, Alice can pick two elements, and Bob can pick two elements.

Suppose Alice picks 0 first, then Bob can pick 1, then Alice picks 2, and Bob picks 3.

So, c = [0,2], MEX is 1, because 1 is missing.

Alternatively, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

Then c = [1,2], MEX is 0, since 0 is missing.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose the maximum possible MEX among all possible optimal plays.

Wait, no. I need to find the MEX of 'c' when both play optimally.

Given that Alice wants to maximize MEX and Bob wants to minimize it, I need to find the MEX when both play optimally.

In this case, it seems that Bob can force the MEX to be 1.

Another way to look at it: the MEX is determined by the smallest missing number in 'c'.

To maximize MEX, Alice needs to include as many low numbers as possible in 'c'.

Bob, to minimize MEX, will try to prevent Alice from including low numbers in 'c'.

So, in the second test case, with a = [0,1,2,3], and n=4, Alice makes two picks, Bob makes two picks.

Bob can strategize to ensure that at least one of 0 or 1 is not in 'c'.

For example:

- Alice picks 0, Bob picks 1, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

Then c = [0,2], MEX is 1.

- Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

Then c = [1,2], MEX is 0.

- Alice picks 2, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 3.

Then c = [2,1], MEX is 0.

- Alice picks 3, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 1, Bob picks 2.

Then c = [3,1], MEX is 0.

So, in this case, the best MEX Alice can achieve is 1, by choosing 0 and 2, making MEX=1.

Wait, in one of the sequences, MEX is 1, and in others, it's 0.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

So, perhaps the optimal play leads to MEX=1.

Wait, but in one of the sequences, MEX is 1, and in others, it's 0.

But since Alice wants to maximize MEX, she would aim for the highest possible MEX, which is 1 in this case.

Hence, the output is 1.

In the third test case:

n=2

a=[1,1]

Output:0

Alice picks one 1, Bob picks the other 1.

c=[1], MEX=0, since 0 is missing.

Alternatively, if Alice picks one 1, Bob picks the other 1.

c=[1], MEX=0.

So, in all cases, MEX is 0.

Hence, the output is 0.

From these examples, I need to find a general strategy.

I need to find a way to determine the MEX of 'c' when both players play optimally.

Let me think about the frequency of each number in the array.

Let's consider counting the frequency of each number in 'a'.

Let's sort the numbers and see how many times each number appears.

Then, Alice and Bob will be picking elements, with Alice trying to include certain elements in 'c' and Bob trying to prevent that.

I need to model their optimal strategies.

Perhaps I can think in terms of who has the control over including or excluding certain elements.

Since Alice picks elements to include in 'c', and Bob picks elements to remove from 'a', Bob can influence which elements Alice can pick by removing certain elements.

Wait, but Bob cannot directly prevent Alice from picking a specific element; he can only remove elements from 'a'.

So, if Bob removes an element that Alice would have picked, then Alice has to pick from the remaining elements.

But it's more nuanced because the order of picks matters.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of available copies of each number and how Alice and Bob can manipulate the selection process.

Let me consider that the game is about selecting elements for 'c', with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

I need to find a way to determine the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve despite Bob's attempts to minimize it.

Wait, no. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

So, in game theory terms, this is like a minimax game, where the final score is the MEX of 'c', and Alice is trying to maximize it, while Bob is trying to minimize it.

I need to find the value of the game, which is the MEX of 'c' when both play optimally.

This seems complex, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a way to compute it efficiently.

Let me consider that the MEX is determined by the smallest missing number in 'c'.

So, to maximize MEX, Alice needs to include as many low numbers as possible in 'c'.

Bob, to minimize MEX, will try to prevent Alice from including low numbers in 'c'.

I need to find out which numbers Alice can ensure to include in 'c', despite Bob's interference.

Let me consider that for each number 'x', I can determine whether Alice can ensure that 'x' is included in 'c'.

If Alice can ensure that 'x' is in 'c', then 'x' is not part of the MEX.

If Bob can prevent 'x' from being in 'c', then 'x' is missing, and MEX could be 'x'.

So, for each 'x', starting from 0 upwards, I need to check if Alice can ensure that 'x' is in 'c'.

If she can, then 'x' is not missing.

If she cannot, then 'x' is missing, and that's the MEX.

So, the problem reduces to determining, for each 'x', whether Alice can ensure that 'x' is in 'c'.

How can I determine that?

Let's consider that the number of times 'x' appears in 'a' is 'freq[x]'.

Alice and Bob take turns picking elements.

Alice picks first.

Each time Alice picks an element, she can choose to pick 'x' if available, to include it in 'c'.

Bob can try to prevent Alice from picking 'x' by picking 'x' himself, thereby removing it from 'a'.

But Bob doesn't add elements to 'c', only Alice does.

So, if Bob picks 'x', he removes it from 'a', but it doesn't go to 'c'.

Alice can pick 'x' and add it to 'c'.

I need to see how many 'x's are available and how many turns are left.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of available 'x's and the number of moves Alice has left.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the unique elements in 'a' in increasing order.

Then, for each 'x' in this order, I can determine if Alice can ensure that 'x' is in 'c'.

To do that, I need to see how many 'x's are available and how many moves Alice has left.

But it's not that straightforward because Bob can also pick 'x's, removing them from 'a'.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a game where Alice and Bob are playing with the frequencies of each 'x'.

Let me consider that.

Suppose I have the frequency of each 'x'.

Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she wants to include as many 'x's as possible in 'c'.

Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he wants to prevent Alice from including 'x's in 'c'.

Each time Alice picks an 'x', she includes it in 'c'.

Each time Bob picks an 'x', he removes it from 'a', making it unavailable for Alice.

So, for each 'x', the number of times Alice can include 'x' in 'c' is the number of 'x's in 'a' minus the number of times Bob picks 'x'.

Bob will try to minimize the number of 'x's that Alice can include in 'c'.

So, for each 'x', the number of 'x's that Alice can include is max(freq[x] - Bob's picks of 'x', 0).

But Bob can choose which elements to pick.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the total number of picks Alice has and the frequency of each 'x'.

Let me consider that Alice has 'k' moves, where 'k' is ceil(n/2), and Bob has 'n - k' moves.

Alice needs to include as many low 'x's as possible in 'c'.

Bob needs to prevent that.

I need to find the smallest 'x' such that Alice cannot ensure that 'x' is in 'c'.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of available 'x's and the number of moves Alice has.

If for 'x', freq[x] > 0, and Alice has moves left, she can pick 'x' and include it in 'c'.

But Bob can try to reduce freq[x] by picking 'x's.

So, for each 'x', the number of 'x's that Alice can include in 'c' is freq[x] minus the number of times Bob picks 'x'.

Bob will try to minimize freq[x] - number of times he picks 'x'.

Wait, this seems confusing.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can choose to pick any remaining 'x' in her turn, and Bob can choose to pick any remaining 'x' in his turn.

I need to see who can control the inclusion of 'x' in 'c'.

Let me consider that for each 'x', the number of times it appears is freq[x].

Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements.

Alice starts first.

Each time Alice picks an 'x', she includes it in 'c'.

Each time Bob picks an 'x', he removes it from 'a'.

I need to see how many 'x's Alice can include in 'c' given that Bob is trying to minimize that number.

This seems like a game where Alice and Bob are competing over the freq[x] of each 'x'.

I recall that in such games, the number of times Alice can include 'x' is ceil((freq[x] + 1 - Bob's moves affecting 'x')) / 2).

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick 'x' before Bob can remove all remaining 'x's.

Let me consider that for each 'x', the number of times Alice can include 'x' in 'c' is the ceiling of freq[x] / 2.

Because for every two turns (one Alice, one Bob), Alice can include one 'x' if freq[x] >= 2, but Bob can remove one 'x'.

Wait, perhaps.

Let me think.

Suppose freq[x] = 1:

- Alice picks it, includes it in 'c'.

- Or Bob picks it, removes it.

So, Alice can include it in 'c' only if she picks it before Bob does.

Since Alice picks first, if freq[x] = 1, Alice can include it in 'c'.

Because she picks first, she can choose to pick 'x', include it in 'c', and Bob cannot prevent it.

Wait, no. Bob can pick 'x' in his turn, but only if 'x' is still available.

Wait, no. If freq[x] = 1, and Alice picks 'x', then 'x' is included in 'c'.

If Alice doesn't pick 'x', then Bob can pick 'x', removing it from 'a', and Alice cannot include it in 'c'.

So, for freq[x] = 1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' only if she picks it before Bob does.

Since Alice picks first, she can choose to pick 'x' and include it in 'c'.

If she chooses not to, Bob can pick 'x' and remove it.

So, Alice can decide whether to include 'x' in 'c' or not.

But since she wants to maximize MEX, she would want to include as many low 'x's as possible.

Wait, but Bob wants to minimize MEX, so he would want to prevent Alice from including low 'x's.

So, for freq[x] = 1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' if she picks it first.

Bob can remove 'x' if Alice doesn't pick it first.

So, for freq[x] = 1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' by picking it first.

For freq[x] = 2:

- Alice can pick one 'x', include it in 'c'.

- Bob can pick the other 'x', removing it.

- Or Bob can pick something else.

So, Alice can include one 'x' in 'c' if she picks one 'x', and Bob picks the other 'x'.

Or, if Bob picks something else, Alice can pick both 'x's.

Wait, no. Since each pick removes one element from 'a', and Alice picks first.

Suppose a = ['x', 'x'].

- Alice picks one 'x', includes it in 'c', removes it from 'a'.

- Now a = ['x'].

- Bob picks 'x', removes it from 'a'.

So, c = ['x'], with freq[x] = 1 in 'c'.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 'x', includes it in 'c', removes it from 'a'.

- Bob picks something else (if available), but in this case, only 'x' is left.

- So Bob picks 'x', removes it.

So, c = ['x'].

Or, if there are other elements:

- Suppose a = ['x', 'y'].

- Alice picks 'x', includes it in 'c', removes it from 'a'.

- a = ['y'].

- Bob picks 'y', removes it.

- c = ['x'], MEX depends on what 'x' and 'y' are.

But in terms of freq[x], for freq[x] = 2, Alice can include one 'x' in 'c', because Bob can remove one 'x'.

Similarly, for freq[x] = 3:

- Alice picks 'x', includes it in 'c', removes it from 'a'.

- a = ['x', 'x'].

- Bob picks 'x', removes it.

- a = ['x'].

- Alice picks 'x', includes it in 'c', removes it.

- c = ['x', 'x'].

Wait, but Alice can only include one 'x' in 'c', since duplicates don't change the MEX.

But in terms of counting, MEX looks for the smallest missing number, so duplicates don't matter.

Wait, but in 'c', duplicates are allowed, but for MEX, only the presence of numbers matters, not their frequency.

So, for MEX, having multiple 'x's in 'c' is the same as having one 'x'.

So, for each 'x', Alice wants to ensure that at least one 'x' is in 'c'.

Bob wants to ensure that no 'x' is in 'c'.

So, for each 'x', the frequency freq[x] determines how many times Alice can include 'x' in 'c', considering Bob's interference.

From the above, for freq[x] = 1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' by picking it first.

For freq[x] = 2, Alice can include one 'x' in 'c', as Bob can remove one 'x'.

For freq[x] = 3, Alice can include two 'x's in 'c', but since MEX only cares about presence, it's the same as including one 'x'.

Wait, but in terms of strategy, higher frequencies might allow Alice to include 'x' more securely.

Wait, but for MEX, only the presence matters.

So, for each 'x', if freq[x] > 0, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' if she can pick it before Bob removes all 'x's.

So, for freq[x] >= 1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' if she picks it before Bob removes all 'x's.

Wait, but Bob can remove 'x's, making them unavailable for Alice.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the number of 'x's that Alice can save from Bob's removal.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking items, and one includes and the other excludes.

I need to find a way to determine for each 'x', if Alice can include it in 'c'.

Let me consider that for each 'x', the number of times Alice can include 'x' in 'c' is ceil(freq[x] / 2).

Because for every two turns, Alice can include one 'x', as Bob can remove one 'x'.

Wait, let's see:

- freq[x] = 1: ceil(1 / 2) = 1, so Alice can include it.

- freq[x] = 2: ceil(2 / 2) = 1, so Alice can include one 'x'.

- freq[x] = 3: ceil(3 / 2) = 2, but since MEX only cares about presence, it's the same as one 'x'.

- freq[x] = 4: ceil(4 / 2) = 2, again, same as one 'x' for MEX.

So, in general, for freq[x] >= 1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' if ceil(freq[x] / 2) >= 1.

Which is always true for freq[x] >= 1.

Wait, but this seems too simplistic.

Because in the second test case, with a = [0,1,2,3], freq of each is 1.

So, for each 'x' in [0,1,2,3], freq[x] = 1, ceil(1 / 2) = 1, so Alice can include each 'x' in 'c'.

But in reality, she can only include two elements in 'c', as n=4, k=2.

So, according to this, she can include two elements, but the sample output suggests that the MEX is 1, meaning that she cannot include both 0 and 1 in 'c'.

So, my previous assumption is flawed.

I need a better way to model this.

Let me consider that the total number of elements Alice can include in 'c' is k = ceil(n / 2).

In the second test case, n=4, k=2.

So, Alice can include 2 elements in 'c'.

Bob can remove 2 elements.

Alice wants to include as many low 'x's as possible in 'c'.

Bob wants to prevent that.

So, in the second test case, a = [0,1,2,3], freq of each is 1.

Alice can include any two elements in 'c'.

Bob can remove any two elements.

Bob can choose to remove elements in such a way that Alice cannot have both 0 and 1 in 'c'.

For example:

- Alice picks 0, includes in 'c'.

- Bob picks 1, removes it.

- Alice picks 2, includes in 'c'.

- Bob picks 3, removes it.

So, c = [0,2], MEX = 1.

Alternatively:

- Alice picks 1, includes in 'c'.

- Bob picks 0, removes it.

- Alice picks 2, includes in 'c'.

- Bob picks 3, removes it.

So, c = [1,2], MEX = 0.

In this case, Bob can force the MEX to be 1 by removing 1 when Alice picks 0.

Wait, but in the second scenario, Bob removes 0 when Alice picks 1, resulting in MEX=0.

But according to the sample output, it's 1.

So, perhaps the optimal play leads to MEX=1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it.

So, in this case, Bob can force the MEX to be 1 by removing 1 when Alice picks 0.

Hence, the MEX is 1.

So, in general, for each 'x', starting from 0 upwards, Alice tries to include 'x' in 'c', and Bob tries to prevent it.

I need to find the smallest 'x' for which Alice cannot include 'x' in 'c', despite trying to.

To model this, perhaps I can iterate through 'x' from 0 upwards, and for each 'x', check if Alice can include 'x' in 'c', given the remaining moves and the frequency of 'x'.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's sort the unique elements in 'a' in increasing order.

Initialize a counter for Alice's moves left, which is k = ceil(n / 2).

Then, for each 'x' in sorted order:

- If freq[x] > 0, and Alice has moves left, she can include 'x' in 'c'.

- Bob can try to prevent this by removing 'x's.

But I need a better way to model this.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of 'x's that Alice can save from Bob's removal.

For each 'x', the number of 'x's that Alice can include in 'c' is max(freq[x] - floor(freq[x] / 2), 0).

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, in terms of the game, for each 'x', Alice can include ceil(freq[x] / 2) 'x's in 'c'.

Because for every two 'x's, Alice can include one, as Bob can remove one.

So, ceil(freq[x] / 2) represents the number of 'x's Alice can include in 'c'.

But since MEX only cares about presence, Alice can include 'x' in 'c' if ceil(freq[x] / 2) >= 1.

Which is equivalent to freq[x] >= 1.

But earlier examples show that this is not sufficient.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the total number of moves Alice has.

Let me consider that Alice has k moves, and she needs to include as many low 'x's as possible in 'c'.

Bob will try to prevent Alice from including low 'x's by removing them or by forcing Alice to include higher 'x's.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through 'x' from 0 upwards, and for each 'x', check if Alice can include it in 'c' with her remaining moves.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize k = ceil(n / 2)

Sort the unique 'x's in ascending order.

For each 'x' in sorted order:

if freq[x] > 0:

if ceil(freq[x] / 2) >= 1:

include 'x' in 'c'

k -= 1

else:

'MEX' is 'x'

break

else:

'MEX' is the next integer after all 'x's

But this seems similar to my earlier flawed approach.

Wait, in the second test case, a = [0,1,2,3], freq[x] = 1 for each 'x'.

So, for 'x' = 0, ceil(1 / 2) = 1 >=1, include 0, k=1

for 'x' =1, ceil(1 / 2) =1 >=1, include 1, k=0

for 'x' =2, ceil(1 / 2) =1 >=1, but k=0, cannot include 2

So, c = [0,1], MEX=2

But the sample output is 1.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when Alice includes 'x' in 'c', she uses one of her moves, and Bob can use his moves to remove 'x's, affecting Alice's ability to include them.

So, perhaps I need to model the game as a sequence of moves where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements, and Alice decides which elements to include in 'c'.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for an alternative approach.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times Alice can pick an 'x' before Bob can remove all remaining 'x's.

For each 'x', the number of times Alice can include 'x' in 'c' is the ceiling of (freq[x] / 2).

Because for every two 'x's, Alice can include one, as Bob can remove one.

Wait, but in the second test case, for 'x' =0, freq=1, ceil(1/2)=1, so Alice can include it.

Similarly for 'x' =1, freq=1, ceil(1/2)=1, include it.

So, c=[0,1], MEX=2, but sample output is 1.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Alice can include 'x' only if ceil(freq[x]/2) <= moves left.

But in the second test case, with k=2, and for 'x'=0 and 'x'=1, ceil(1/2)=1 <=2, so include both, MEX=2, which contradicts the sample output.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Alice can include floor((freq[x]+1)/2) copies of 'x' in 'c'.

This is because for freq[x] elements, Alice can include floor((freq[x]+1)/2) elements in 'c', as she picks first.

For freq[x] =1: floor((1+1)/2)=1, include 1

freq[x]=2: floor((2+1)/2)=1, include 1

freq[x]=3: floor((3+1)/2)=2, include 2

But for MEX, only presence matters, so include 'x' if floor((freq[x]+1)/2) >=1.

In the second test case, for each 'x', floor((1+1)/2)=1, so include all 'x's, but sample output is 1, which contradicts.

Hence, this approach is also incorrect.

I need to find another way.

Let me consider simulating the game.

Initialize a list of available elements.

Initialize c as empty.

While a is not empty:

- Alice picks an element from 'a', includes it in 'c', removes it from 'a'.

- If 'a' is not empty, Bob picks an element from 'a', removes it from 'a'.

This continues until 'a' is empty.

Alice wants to maximize MEX of 'c', Bob wants to minimize it.

Both play optimally.

So, in simulation, Alice would choose elements that help maximize MEX, and Bob would choose elements that help minimize MEX.

But simulating this for up to 2e5 elements per test case is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that Alice wants to include as many low numbers as possible in 'c', and Bob wants to prevent that.

So, perhaps I can iterate through the numbers in increasing order and see which ones Alice can include in 'c'.

Let me sort the unique elements in 'a' in increasing order.

Then, for each 'x' in sorted order, check if Alice can include 'x' in 'c'.

To do that, I need to see how many moves Alice has left and how many 'x's are available.

But I need to consider that Bob can remove 'x's, affecting Alice's ability to include them.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of 'x's that Alice can save from Bob's removal.

For each 'x', the number of 'x's that Alice can include in 'c' is max(freq[x] - floor(freq[x]/2),0).

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the number of 'x's that Alice can include in 'c' is ceil(freq[x]/2).

Because for every two 'x's, Alice can include one, as Bob can remove one.

Similarly, for freq[x] odd, Alice can include (freq[x]//2 +1) 'x's.

Wait, no.

Wait, for freq[x] =1: Alice can include 1 'x' (picks it first).

For freq[x]=2: Alice can include 1 'x' (picks one, Bob removes the other).

For freq[x]=3: Alice can include 2 'x's (picks two, Bob removes one).

For freq[x]=4: Alice can include 2 'x's (picks two, Bob removes two).

But for MEX, only the presence matters, so as long as Alice can include at least one 'x', it's considered included.

So, for freq[x] >=1, Alice can include 'x' in 'c'.

But in the second test case, with freq[x]=1 for each 'x', and k=2, Alice can include two 'x's, meaning she can include 0 and 1, but the sample output suggests MEX=1, meaning that 1 is not included.

Wait, but according to this, she can include both 0 and 1.

But according to the sample output, it's 1, which corresponds to MEX=1, meaning that 1 is missing from 'c'.

This contradicts.

Hence, my assumption is wrong.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Bob can prioritize removing low 'x's to prevent Alice from including them in 'c'.

So, in the second test case, Bob can remove 1 to prevent Alice from including it in 'c'.

Hence, Alice can include 0 and 2, but not 1, leading to MEX=1.

So, in general, Bob can choose to remove low 'x's to minimize the MEX.

Alice needs to counter that by including low 'x's before Bob can remove them.

So, perhaps I need to iterate through 'x's in increasing order and see if Alice can include them before Bob removes them.

Let me try to implement this idea.

Initialize a counter for Alice's moves left, k = ceil(n / 2)

Sort the unique 'x's in ascending order.

Initialize a set to store the elements included in 'c'.

For each 'x' in sorted order:

if freq[x] > 0:

if k > 0:

include 'x' in 'c'

k -=1

freq[x] -=1

else:

Bob can choose to remove 'x' if he wants to prevent Alice from including it.

So, if k ==0, and Bob can remove 'x', then 'x' is not included in 'c'.

But this seems too simplistic.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can choose to remove 'x's that Alice wants to include.

So, for each 'x', if Alice wants to include 'x', she needs to include it before Bob removes all 'x's.

So, for each 'x', the number of 'x's that Alice can include is the ceiling of (freq[x] / 2).

Wait, but earlier examples show that this doesn't hold.

I need to find another way.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

First test case:

n=4

a=[0,0,1,1]

Output:2

Alice can include 0 and 1 in 'c', MEX=2.

Second test case:

n=4

a=[0,1,2,3]

Output:1

Alice can include 0 and 2 in 'c', MEX=1.

Third test case:

n=2

a=[1,1]

Output:0

Alice includes one 1 in 'c', MEX=0.

So, in the first test case, with two 0's and two 1's, Alice can include both 0 and 1.

In the second test case, with one of each 0,1,2,3, Alice can include two of them, but Bob can force the MEX to be 1.

In the third test case, only two 1's, Alice includes one 1, MEX=0.

So, perhaps the general idea is that for each 'x', if freq[x] >=1, Alice can include it in 'c' if she has moves left.

But in the second test case, she has moves to include two 'x's, but Bob can force her to include only two out of four, and choose which two.

Wait, perhaps I need to iterate through 'x's in order, and for each 'x', if freq[x] >0 and k>0, Alice includes 'x' in 'c', k -=1, freq[x] -=1.

Then, Bob can remove any remaining elements, but since we're only interested in which 'x's Alice includes, this might suffice.

So, in code:

sort unique 'x's in ascending order

k = ceil(n / 2)

for x in sorted_x:

while freq[x] >0 and k >0:

include x in c

k -=1

freq[x] -=1

Then, find MEX of 'c'.

In the second test case, a=[0,1,2,3], freq[x]=1 for each.

k=2

Include 0, k=1

Include 1, k=0

So, c=[0,1], MEX=2, but sample output is 1.

Hmm, discrepancy.

So, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps Bob can choose to remove low 'x's to force higher MEX.

Wait, in the second test case, if Alice picks 0, Bob can pick 1, then Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

So, c=[0,2], MEX=1.

Alternatively, if Alice picks 1, Bob picks 0, Alice picks 2, Bob picks 3.

c=[1,2], MEX=0.

So, the minimal MEX that Alice can achieve is 0, but according to the sample output, it's 1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "Find game's final score if both players play optimally."

So, Alice wants to maximize MEX, Bob wants to minimize it.

So, the final score is the MEX that Alice achieves despite Bob's attempts to minimize it.

In the second test case, Bob can force the MEX to be 1 by removing 1 when Alice picks 0.

Hence, the output is 1.

So, perhaps in the approach above, when Alice includes 'x', Bob can choose to remove 'x'+1 or other elements to maximize the MEX.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Bob can remove elements that Alice wants to include.

So, perhaps for each 'x', Bob can choose to remove 'x' to prevent Alice from including
