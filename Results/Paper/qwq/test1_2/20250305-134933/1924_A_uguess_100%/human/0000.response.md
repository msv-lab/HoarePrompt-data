Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given two integers, n and k, and a string s. I need to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of s. If not, I have to provide one such string that doesn't occur as a subsequence in s.

First, I need to understand what a subsequence is. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. So, for example, if s is "abcde", then "ace" is a subsequence, but "aec" is not.

Now, the problem is asking me to check if all possible strings of length n made from the first k letters of the alphabet are subsequences of s. If they are, I should print "YES"; if not, "NO" and provide one such string that isn't a subsequence.

Let me think about how to approach this. The total number of possible strings of length n using k letters is k^n. That can be pretty large, especially since k can be up to 26 and n up to 26. But m can be up to 1000 per test case, and t can be up to 10^5, but the sum of m and n over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^6. So, I need an efficient way to check this without generating all possible strings.

I need a smarter way to determine if s contains all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters.

One way to think about this is to consider the concept of a universal string. A universal string for a given n and k is a string that contains all possible strings of length n from k symbols as subsequences. The shortest such string is known, but I don't need to construct it; I just need to check if s is universal for the given n and k.

But checking directly whether s contains all possible subsequences of length n would be inefficient because there are k^n possibilities, which is too much.

I need a better approach.

Wait, maybe I can think about the minimal requirements for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n.

For example, if n=1, then s must contain all k letters at least once, because all possible strings of length 1 are just the individual letters.

If n=2, s must contain all possible pairs of letters in order, not necessarily consecutively.

This seems tricky. Is there a pattern or a property I can exploit here?

Let me consider the number of times each letter needs to appear in s to ensure that all possible subsequences are covered.

I recall that for n=1, s must contain all k letters at least once.

For n=2, s must contain all possible pairs of letters in order, meaning that for any two letters a and b, there must be a subsequence a followed by b somewhere in s.

Generalizing, for any n, s must contain all possible sequences of n letters in order.

This seems too vague. I need a more concrete approach.

Perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent states of the subsequence being built, and edges represent the addition of a new character.

This sounds like a finite automaton or a suffix tree, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of state machines. I can build a state machine where each state represents how much of a particular subsequence has been matched so far.

But building such a machine for all possible subsequences would be impractical due to the large number of subsequences.

I need to find a way to check this efficiently.

Let me consider the minimal length that s needs to have to contain all possible subsequences.

For n and k, the minimal length of s that guarantees all possible subsequences is known, but I don't remember the exact formula. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another idea: if I can find, for each possible subsequence of length n, a set of indices in s that correspond to that subsequence, then I need to make sure that for every possible combination, such a subsequence exists in s.

But again, this seems too slow.

I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the positions of each character in s and see how they can be combined to form the required subsequences.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look at the example provided.

In the first test case:

n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abba"

Possible strings of length 2 from a and b: aa, ab, ba, bb.

Checking if each of these is a subsequence of "abba":

- aa: positions 1 and 3 (a at index 1, a at index 3)

- ab: positions 1 and 2 (a at index 1, b at index 2)

- ba: positions 2 and 3 (b at index 2, a at index 3)

- bb: positions 2 and 4 (b at index 2, b at index 4)

All are present, so the answer is "YES".

In the second test case:

n=2, k=2, m=3, s="abb"

Possible strings:

- aa: is not a subsequence in "abb" because there is only one a at position 1, and we need two a's in order, which isn't possible.

- ab: positions 1 and 2 (a at 1, b at 2)

- ba: positions 2 and 3 (b at 2, a at 3)

- bb: positions 2 and 3 (b at 2, b at 3)

Since aa is missing, the answer is "NO" and then "aa" is provided.

In the third test case:

n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Possible strings: all combinations of a, b, c of length 3, total 27.

I need to check if all 27 are present as subsequences in s.

But this seems time-consuming to check manually.

From these examples, I need to find a pattern or a method to generalize this check.

Let me consider that for n=1, it's straightforward: s must contain all k letters at least once.

For n=2, s must contain all possible pairs of letters in order as subsequences.

Similarly, for n=3, s must contain all possible triples in order as subsequences, and so on.

But checking each possible combination separately is not feasible for large n and k.

I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the number of times each letter appears in s and ensure that there are enough repetitions to cover all possible combinations.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the minimal number of times each letter must appear in s to cover all possible subsequences.

For example, for n=2 and k=2, as in the first test case, s="abba":

- a appears twice, at positions 1 and 3

- b appears twice, at positions 2 and 4

In this case, all combinations are covered.

In the second test case, s="abb":

- a appears once, at position 1

- b appears twice, at positions 2 and 3

Here, aa is not possible because there's only one a.

So, perhaps for n=2, to cover all possible combinations, each letter must appear at least n times.

Wait, but in the first test case, a appears twice, which matches n=2, and b appears twice.

But in the third test case, for n=3 and k=3, s="aabbccabab":

- a appears 4 times

- b appears 5 times

- c appears 2 times

But the answer is "NO" and "ccc" is provided, meaning that "ccc" is not a subsequence in s.

Indeed, in s, c appears only twice, so "ccc" cannot be a subsequence.

So, in this case, since c appears only twice, any string requiring three c's in order cannot be a subsequence.

Hence, for n=3, if any letter appears less than n times, then the string consisting of that letter repeated n times is not a subsequence in s.

Therefore, one way to check is to count the frequency of each letter in s, and if any letter appears less than n times, then the answer is "NO" and we can provide that letter repeated n times as the missing subsequence.

But wait, this seems too simplistic. Is this always sufficient?

In the first test case, both a and b appear at least twice, and all combinations are covered.

In the second test case, a appears only once, which is less than n=2, so "aa" is missing.

In the third test case, c appears only twice, which is less than n=3, so "ccc" is missing.

This seems to hold.

But is this always enough? Are there cases where each letter appears at least n times, but some combinations are still missing?

Let me think about that.

Suppose n=2, k=2, m=3, s="aba"

- a appears twice (positions 1 and 3)

- b appears once (position 2)

Possible strings:

- aa: positions 1 and 3

- ab: positions 1 and 2

- ba: positions 2 and 3

- bb: not present, since there's only one b

So, even though a appears twice and b appears once, which is less than n=2, bb is missing.

So, in this case, my previous approach would correctly identify that b appears only once, which is less than n=2, and thus "bb" is missing.

But what if all letters appear at least n times, but some combinations are still missing?

Let's consider n=2, k=2, m=4, s="abab"

- a appears twice (positions 1 and 3)

- b appears twice (positions 2 and 4)

Possible strings:

- aa: positions 1 and 3

- ab: positions 1 and 2

- ba: positions 2 and 3

- bb: positions 2 and 4

All are present.

Now, let's modify s to "aabb"

- a appears twice (1 and 2)

- b appears twice (3 and 4)

Possible strings:

- aa: positions 1 and 2

- ab: positions 1 and 3

- ba: positions 2 and 3

- bb: positions 3 and 4

All are present.

Is there a case where each letter appears at least n times, but some combination is missing?

Let's try n=2, k=2, m=4, s="aabb"

All combinations are present as above.

Another example: n=2, k=2, m=5, s="ababb"

- a appears twice (1 and 3)

- b appears three times (2,4,5)

Possible strings:

- aa: positions 1 and 3

- ab: positions 1 and 2, or 1 and 4, etc.

- ba: positions 2 and 3

- bb: positions 2 and 4, or 2 and 5, etc.

All are present.

It seems that as long as each letter appears at least n times, all combinations are present.

Wait, but is this always true?

Let me consider n=2, k=2, m=4, s="aabb"

All combinations are present.

What if s="aaab"?

- a appears three times (1,2,3)

- b appears once (4)

Possible strings:

- aa: positions 1 and 2, or 1 and 3, etc.

- ab: positions 1 and 4, 2 and 4, 3 and 4

- ba: not possible, since b only appears once at position 4, and there's no a after it.

- bb: not possible, only one b.

So, in this case, ba and bb are missing, even though a appears three times and b appears once.

But according to my earlier approach, since b appears only once, which is less than n=2, I would correctly identify that "bb" is missing.

But "ba" is also missing, which my approach doesn't directly catch, because a appears enough times, but the order prevents "ba" from being a subsequence.

So, my earlier approach might miss some cases where the order of appearance prevents certain combinations, even if each letter appears at least n times.

Hence, simply checking if each letter appears at least n times might not be sufficient.

I need a better way.

Let me think about building the subsequence step by step.

For a given target subsequence of length n, I can iterate through s and try to match the characters in order.

But again, doing this for all possible k^n subsequences is not efficient.

I need a way to check if there exists at least one missing subsequence without generating all of them.

Is there a way to find a subsequence that is definitely missing based on some property of s?

One idea is to find the longest increasing subsequence or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the number of times each letter appears and ensure that there are enough "gaps" between them to form all possible combinations.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider the problem in terms of state progression.

I can model this as a finite state machine where each state represents the progress towards forming a particular subsequence.

But again, building such a machine for all possible subsequences is not practical.

I need a different angle.

Let me consider the minimal number of times each letter must appear to ensure that all combinations are possible.

For example, for n=3 and k=3, if each letter appears at least three times, does that guarantee that all possible combinations of length 3 are present as subsequences?

From the earlier example, in the third test case, c appears only twice, so "ccc" cannot be a subsequence, hence the answer is "NO" with "ccc" as the missing subsequence.

So, in general, if any letter appears fewer than n times, then the string consisting of that letter repeated n times is missing, and hence the answer is "NO" with that string as the missing subsequence.

This seems to cover many cases.

But is there a case where each letter appears at least n times, but some combination is still missing?

Let me try to construct such a case.

Suppose n=2, k=2, m=4, s="aabb"

All combinations are present as shown earlier.

What if n=3, k=2, m=6, s="aaabbb"

- a appears three times (1,2,3)

- b appears three times (4,5,6)

Possible strings:

- aaa: positions 1,2,3

- aab: positions 1,2,4

- abb: positions 1,4,5

- bbb: positions 4,5,6

- aba: positions 1,4,3 (is this valid? position 3 comes after position 4? No, positions must be in increasing order.)

Wait, positions must be in increasing order for subsequences.

So, aba: position 1 (a), position 4 (b), position 3 (a) – this is invalid because position 3 comes after position 4.

So, aba cannot be formed as a subsequence in "aaabbb".

Similarly, bab: positions 2 (a), 4 (b), 5 (b) – positions 2,4,5 are in increasing order, so bab is present.

But aba seems to be missing.

So, in this case, even though each letter appears at least three times, the combination aba is missing because the second a appears before the b in s.

Hence, my earlier approach would say that both a and b appear at least three times, so it should be "YES", but in reality, "aba" is missing, so it should be "NO".

Therefore, my earlier approach is insufficient.

I need a better way to check for the presence of all possible subsequences.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can precompute all possible subsequences and check if any are missing, but that's not feasible for large n and k.

An alternative idea: use the concept of a sliding window or dynamic programming to keep track of how many of the possible subsequences have been covered.

But this still seems too slow.

Let me consider that for s to contain all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters, s must be rich enough in terms of the occurrences and ordering of these letters.

But I need a concrete method.

Wait, maybe I can think about the problem in terms of the number of times each letter appears and ensure that there are enough overlapping sequences to cover all combinations.

But I'm still stuck.

Let me look back at the code provided and see if I can understand the logic behind it.

The code is as follows:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())

s = input()

cnt = 0

cur = 0

ans = ''

for ss in s:

cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')

if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:

cur += 1 << cur_ss

if cur == (1 << k) - 1:

cnt += 1

cur = 0

ans += ss

if cnt >= n:

print('YES')

else:

print('NO')

tmp = ''

for i in range(k):

if cur & 1 << i == 0:

tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)

break

ans += tmp

ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)

print(ans)

So, the code processes each test case one by one.

For each test case, it reads n, k, m, and the string s.

Then, it initializes cnt to 0, cur to 0, and ans to an empty string.

It iterates through each character ss in s.

It calculates cur_ss as the ordinal value of ss minus that of 'a', which gives the zero-based index of the letter in the alphabet.

Then, it checks if the bit corresponding to cur_ss in cur is not set (i.e., cur & (1 << cur_ss) == 0). If not set, it sets that bit in cur by adding 1 << cur_ss to cur.

Then, it checks if cur is equal to (1 << k) - 1, which is a bitmask where the first k bits are set. If so, it increments cnt and resets cur to 0, and appends ss to ans.

Finally, if cnt is greater than or equal to n, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO", constructs a string tmp by finding the first letter (among the first k letters) whose bit is not set in cur, appends it to ans, and then appends 'a' repeated (n - cnt - 1) times, and prints this constructed string.

Now, I need to evaluate if this logic correctly solves the problem.

First, the code seems to be tracking the presence of all k letters in s by using a bitmask cur. When cur equals (1 << k) - 1, it means all k letters have been seen at least once.

It counts how many times this full set of k letters appears in s, and keeps track of this in cnt.

If cnt is greater than or equal to n, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

But I need to check if this correctly determines whether all possible subsequences of length n from the first k letters are present in s.

From my earlier analysis, I saw that for n=2 and k=2, in the first test case, cnt would be 2 because "abba" contains two sets of both letters: positions 1-3 and positions 2-4. Since n=2 and cnt=2, it prints "YES", which matches the expected output.

In the second test case, s="abb", cnt would be 1 because "abb" contains one set of both letters. Since n=2 and cnt=1, which is less than n, it prints "NO" and then tries to construct a missing subsequence.

But in reality, for n=2 and k=2, there are four possible subsequences: aa, ab, ba, bb. In "abb", aa is missing because there's only one 'a'. So, the constructed missing subsequence is "aa", which matches what the code does: it finds that 'a' is already present in cur, so it appends 'a' to ans, and since cnt=1 and n=2, it appends 'a' * (2 - 1 - 1) = 'a' * 0 = "".

So, ans becomes "a" (from the first 'a' in "abb") plus 'a' (from tmp), and since n - cnt - 1 = 0, no additional 'a's are appended. So, the output is "NO" and "aa", which is correct.

In the third test case, n=3, k=3, m=10, s="aabbccabab"

Let's see what cnt would be.

Iterating through s:

- s[0] = 'a': cur = 1

- s[1] = 'a': cur remains 1

- s[2] = 'b': cur = 3

- s[3] = 'b': cur remains 3

- s[4] = 'c': cur = 7

- s[5] = 'c': cur remains 7

- s[6] = 'a': cur remains 7

- s[7] = 'b': cur remains 7

- s[8] = 'a': cur remains 7

- s[9] = 'b': cur remains 7

So, cur reaches 7 (which is 111 in binary), indicating all three letters have been seen. This happens after position 4 ('c'), and again after position 5 ('c'), and so on.

So, cnt would be at least 2 (since it reaches the full mask at least twice).

But in the problem, the answer is "NO" and "ccc" is provided, meaning that "ccc" is not a subsequence in s.

But according to the code, cnt would be at least 2, which is greater than or equal to n=3? Wait, no: cnt is incremented each time cur reaches (1 << k) - 1, which is 7 for k=3.

In s="aabbccabab", cur reaches 7 after position 4 ('c'), and again after position 5 ('c'), and so on.

So, cnt would be at least 2.

But n=3, so cnt=2 is less than n=3, so it would print "NO" and construct a missing subsequence.

The code would construct tmp by finding the first letter not in cur. But since cur=7, all letters are present, so tmp would be empty.

Then, ans would be some part of s, plus tmp (which is empty), plus 'a' * (n - cnt - 1) = 'a' * (3 - 2 - 1) = 'a' * 0 = "".

So, the output would be "NO" and whatever ans is, which might not be "ccc".

This suggests that the code might not be correctly identifying the missing subsequence in this case.

Hence, the code might not be correct.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted cnt.

Let's trace the code step by step for the third test case.

s = "aabbccabab", n=3, k=3, m=10

Initialize cnt=0, cur=0, ans=''

Process each character:

1. 'a': cur_ss=0

   cur & 1<<0 == 0, so cur += 1<<0 -> cur=1

2. 'a': cur & 1<<0 ==1, no change

3. 'b': cur & 1<<1 ==0, so cur += 1<<1 -> cur=3

4. 'b': cur & 1<<1 ==1, no change

5. 'c': cur & 1<<2 ==0, so cur += 1<<2 -> cur=7

   cur == 7 == (1<<3)-1, so cnt +=1 -> cnt=1

   cur =0

   ans += 'c' -> ans='c'

6. 'c': cur & 1<<2 ==0, so cur +=1<<2 -> cur=4

7. 'a': cur & 1<<0 ==0, so cur +=1<<0 -> cur=5

8. 'b': cur & 1<<1 ==0, so cur +=1<<1 -> cur=7

   cur ==7 == (1<<3)-1, so cnt +=1 -> cnt=2

   cur=0

   ans += 'b' -> ans='cb'

9. 'a': cur & 1<<0 ==0, so cur +=1<<0 -> cur=1

10. 'b': cur & 1<<1 ==0, so cur +=1<<1 -> cur=3

After processing all characters, cnt=2, which is less than n=3, so it prints "NO".

Then, it tries to construct a missing subsequence.

It looks for the first letter (among the first k=3 letters) whose bit is not set in cur.

cur=3 (binary 11), which means letters 'a' and 'b' are set, but 'c' is not.

So, tmp='c'

Then, ans += tmp -> ans='cb' + 'c' = 'cbc'

Then, ans += 'a' * (n - cnt -1) = 'a' * (3 - 2 -1) = 'a' * 0 = ''

So, the final ans is 'cbc'

But in the problem, the sample output for the third test case is "NO" and "ccc"

So, the code is producing 'cbc' instead of 'ccc'.

Now, 'cbc' is actually a subsequence in s="aabbccabab":

- 'c' at position 5

- 'b' at position 9

- 'c' at position 6

So, 'cbc' is present, but 'ccc' is not.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it's providing a subsequence that actually exists in s.

Therefore, the code is not correct.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
