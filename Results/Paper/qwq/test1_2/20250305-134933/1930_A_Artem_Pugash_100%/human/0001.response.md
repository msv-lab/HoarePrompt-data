Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are 2n positive integers on a whiteboard, and I need to perform n moves. In each move, I choose two integers, add the smaller one to my score, and erase both from the board. I have to do this n times, and I want to maximize my total score at the end.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. I have a list of 2n numbers, and I need to pair them up in such a way that the sum of the minimums of each pair is as large as possible. Since I have to do this for multiple test cases, efficiency might be important, but given that n can be up to 50, and there are up to 5000 test cases, I need to make sure my solution is optimized.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I sort the list of 2n numbers, maybe that will help. Let's consider the first test case in the example:

Input:

3

1

2 3

2

1 1 2 1

3

1 1 1 1 1 1

Output:

2

2

3

In the first test case, n=1, so 2n=2, and the numbers are 2 and 3. I can only make one move, choosing both numbers, and add the minimum, which is 2, to my score. That matches the first output.

In the second test case, n=2, so 2n=4, and the numbers are 1, 1, 2, 1. The solution says the maximum score is 2. Let's see how that's achieved. One way is to pair (1,1) and add 1, then pair (1,2) and add 1, totaling 2. Another way could be pairing (1,2) and adding 1, then pairing (1,1) and adding 1, again totaling 2. It seems that's the maximum possible.

In the third test case, n=3, so 2n=6, and all numbers are 1. So, pairing any way will add 1 each time, totaling 3, which is straightforward.

From these examples, it seems that sorting the numbers might help in pairing them optimally. If I sort the list in ascending order, I can pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on. By doing this, I ensure that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

Wait a minute, is that correct? Let's think about it. If I sort the list in ascending order, the smallest numbers are paired together, and the larger numbers are paired together. So, for each pair, the minimum would be the smaller number in that pair.

For example, take the second test case: numbers are 1,1,2,1. Sorting them gives 1,1,1,2. Pairing the first two (1,1), minimum is 1, and pairing the next two (1,2), minimum is 1, totaling 2.

Is there a better way? Let's see. If I pair (1,2) and (1,1), the scores are 1 and 1, totaling 2. Or pair (1,1) and (1,2), same thing. Seems like 2 is the maximum possible.

Another way to think about it is to always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest one, ensuring that the minimum in each pair is as large as possible.

Wait, but is this the optimal strategy? Let's consider another example to verify.

Suppose n=2, and the numbers are 1,2,3,4. Sorting them gives 1,2,3,4.

Pairing (1,2) and (3,4), minimums are 1 and 3, totaling 4.

Another pairing could be (1,3) and (2,4), minimums are 1 and 2, totaling 3.

Yet another pairing (1,4) and (2,3), minimums are 1 and 2, totaling 3.

So, the first pairing gives the highest score of 4.

Similarly, in the sorted list, pairing the smallest with the next smallest ensures that the minimums are as large as possible.

Wait, but in this case, pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives a higher total than pairing them differently.

Let me think about the general case.

Suppose I have a sorted list: a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ a2n.

If I pair (a1, a2), (a3, a4), ..., (a_{2n-1}, a_{2n}), then the sum of minimums is a1 + a3 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is this the maximum possible?

Let me consider that in the sorted list, a1 is the smallest, a2 is the next smallest, and so on.

If I pair a1 with a2, the minimum is a1.

If I pair a3 with a4, the minimum is a3, and so on.

So, the sum is a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a_{2n-1}.

Is there a way to get a higher sum?

Suppose I pair a1 with a3, then a2 with a4, etc.

Then, the sum would be min(a1,a3) + min(a2,a4) + ... which is a1 + a2 + a4 + ..., depending on the pairings.

Wait, but a1 is the smallest, so pairing it with a larger number won't help because its minimum will still be a1.

Similarly, pairing a2 with a4 gives min(a2,a4)=a2.

But in the sorted pairing, I get a1 + a3 + a5 + ..., which seems to be less than a1 + a2 + a4 + ..., but in the example above, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) gives 1+3=4, while pairing (1,3) and (2,4) gives 1+2=3, which is less.

Wait, so in that case, pairing (1,2) and (3,4) is better.

Wait, but in the sorted list, pairing (a1,a2), (a3,a4), etc., gives a1 + a3 + ..., which seems to be better than other pairings.

Let me see another example.

Suppose n=3, numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Sorted: 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Pairing (1,2), (3,4), (5,6): sum = 1+3+5=9.

Pairing (1,3), (2,4), (5,6): sum =1+2+5=8.

Pairing (1,4), (2,3), (5,6): sum=1+2+5=8.

Pairing (1,5), (2,4), (3,6): sum=1+2+3=6.

Pairing (1,6), (2,3), (4,5): sum=1+2+4=7.

So, the sorted pairing gives the highest sum of 9.

Similarly, in the earlier examples, it seems that pairing the smallest with the next smallest gives the maximum sum of minimums.

Therefore, the strategy is to sort the list in ascending order and pair the smallest with the next smallest, and so on.

Thus, in the code, sorting the list and then summing every other element starting from the first should give the maximum score.

Looking at the provided program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))

score = 0

for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):

score += l[i]

print(score)

This code does exactly that: it reads the input, sorts the list, and sums every other element starting from the first (index 0), which corresponds to the smallest, third smallest, fifth smallest, etc.

Given that this strategy seems correct based on the examples and the reasoning above, I would say that the program is correct.

Therefore, the answer is True.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to maximize the final score by optimally pairing numbers from a list of 2n integers and summing the smaller number from each pair. 

### Approach
1. **Sort the List:** By sorting the list in ascending order, we can ensure that the smallest numbers are paired together.
2. **Sum Every Other Element:** After sorting, the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list. By summing every other element starting from the first, we effectively sum the smaller numbers from each optimal pair.

### Solution Code
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)

# Call the function to execute
func()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:** The function reads the number of test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Read the value of n.
   - Read the list of 2n integers and sort it.
   - Initialize score to 0.
   - Sum every second element in the sorted list starting from the first element.
3. **Output the Score:** For each test case, print the computed score.

This approach ensures that we are pairing the smallest numbers together, thereby maximizing the sum of the minimum values of each pair. The sorting step is crucial as it allows us to systematically create pairs that yield the highest possible minimum values.
