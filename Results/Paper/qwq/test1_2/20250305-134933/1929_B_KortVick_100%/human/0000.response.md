Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. And he wants to do this by coloring as few cells as possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two main types of diagonals: the main diagonals that go from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonals that go from the top-right to the bottom-left. For an n x n grid, there are a total of 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, making a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Wait, hold on. Actually, that seems off. Let's think about it. For main diagonals, starting from the top-left, the number of diagonals is n + (n - 1) = 2n - 1. Similarly, for anti-diagonals, it's also 2n - 1. But are there overlapping diagonals? Hmm.

Wait, no. In a grid, each diagonal is unique, whether it's a main diagonal or an anti-diagonal. So, indeed, there are 4n - 2 diagonals in total.

Now, the problem is to select the minimum number of cells such that at least k of these diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to minimize the number of colored cells while covering at least k diagonals.

Let me think about how cells relate to diagonals. Each cell belongs to exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal. So, each cell covers two diagonals.

If I color a single cell, it covers two diagonals. So, in the best case, each colored cell covers two previously uncovered diagonals.

If I color m cells, in the best case, I can cover 2m diagonals.

But, there might be overlaps, where a cell covers diagonals that are already covered by other cells.

So, to cover k diagonals, I would need at least ceil(k / 2) cells, because each cell can cover up to two diagonals.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Maybe there are some constraints or special cases where this doesn't hold.

Let me consider some examples.

Take n = 3, k = 4.

From the example, it says that coloring 2 cells can cover 4 diagonals.

So, ceil(4 / 2) = 2, which matches.

Another example: n = 3, k = 10.

The total number of diagonals is 4*3 - 2 = 10. So, to cover all 10 diagonals, the output is 6.

But ceil(10 / 2) = 5, but the output is 6.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier assumption.

Hmm, so maybe my initial approach is missing something.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps, not all pairs of diagonals can be covered by a single cell.

Because a cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, if I have to cover diagonals that don't pair up nicely, I might need more cells.

Let me see for n=3.

The main diagonals are:

- Diagonal 1: cell (1,1)

- Diagonal 2: cells (1,2), (2,1)

- Diagonal 3: cells (2,2), (3,1), (1,3)

- Diagonal 4: cells (2,3), (3,2)

- Diagonal 5: cells (3,3)

Similarly, anti-diagonals:

- Diagonal 1: cell (1,3)

- Diagonal 2: cells (1,2), (2,3)

- Diagonal 3: cells (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)

- Diagonal 4: cells (2,1), (3,2)

- Diagonal 5: cells (3,1)

So, in total, 10 diagonals, as expected.

Now, each cell belongs to one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

For example, cell (1,1) belongs to main diagonal 1 and anti-diagonal 3.

Cell (1,2) belongs to main diagonal 2 and anti-diagonal 2.

And so on.

Now, if I want to cover k diagonals with the fewest cells, I need to select cells such that the union of their covered diagonals has at least k members.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard in general. But since n can be up to 1e8, and t=1000, I need a much faster solution.

Perhaps there's a mathematical pattern or formula that can be derived.

Let me consider the extreme cases.

Case 1: k is small, say k=1.

Then, coloring any single cell would cover two diagonals, which is more than enough. So, minimum cells needed is 1.

Wait, but k is the number of diagonals that must have at least one colored cell. So, if k=1, coloring one cell covers two diagonals, which satisfies the condition.

Similarly, for k=2, coloring one cell covers two diagonals.

But, if k=3, I need to cover three diagonals. Since one cell covers two, I might need two cells to cover up to four diagonals.

Wait, but in reality, with two cells, I can cover up to four diagonals, but it depends on how the diagonals are arranged.

Wait, perhaps not always.

Let me consider n=3, k=3.

According to the sample input, for n=3, k=3, the output is 2.

So, coloring two cells can cover three diagonals.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, output is 5.

But, according to ceil(9/2)=5, which matches.

Wait, but earlier for k=10, it's ceil(10/2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

So, perhaps there's an exception when k is the total number of diagonals.

Wait, in that case, maybe covering all diagonals requires a different approach.

Let me check for n=3, k=10.

Total diagonals are 10.

According to the sample, output is 6.

But ceil(10/2)=5, which is less than 6.

So, clearly, ceil(k/2) is not always sufficient.

Hence, my initial assumption is incorrect.

I need to find a better way to calculate the minimum number of cells.

Let me think about the grid structure.

In an n x n grid, the main diagonals can be indexed by their starting row or column.

Similarly, anti-diagonals can be indexed differently.

But this seems too vague.

Perhaps I should look for a way to cover all required diagonals with the fewest cells.

Each cell covers one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, selecting a cell allows me to cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

If I need to cover certain main and anti-diagonals, I need to select cells that cover those specific diagonals.

This sounds like a bipartite matching problem, where one part is the main diagonals and the other part is the anti-diagonals.

Each cell is an edge between a main diagonal and an anti-diagonal.

But this seems too complex for the time constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to calculate the minimal number based on n and k.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

3 4

3 3

3 10

3 9

4 7

7 11

2 3

Sample Output:

2

2

6

5

4

6

2

Looking at n=3:

- For k=4, output=2

- For k=3, output=2

- For k=10, output=6

- For k=9, output=5

For n=4, k=7, output=4

For n=7, k=11, output=6

For n=2, k=3, output=2

Let me see if I can find a pattern.

First, for n=3:

- Total diagonals: 10

- For k=10, output=6

- For k=9, output=5

- For k=4, output=2

- For k=3, output=2

For n=4, k=7, output=4

For n=7, k=11, output=6

For n=2, k=3, output=2

Wait, for n=2, total diagonals are 4*2 - 2 = 6.

So, for k=3, output=2.

Similarly, for n=3, k=4, output=2.

Wait, for n=3, k=4, output=2.

But ceil(4/2)=2, which matches.

For n=3, k=3, output=2, which is less than ceil(3/2)=2.

Wait, ceil(3/2)=2, and output is 2.

Wait, but for n=3, k=9, output=5, which is equal to ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=3, k=10, output=6, which is more than ceil(10/2)=5.

So, perhaps there's an adjustment when k is large.

Maybe, when k is less than or equal to a certain value, ceil(k/2) is sufficient, but when k is larger, it needs to be adjusted.

Let me see what that adjustment could be.

For n=3, total diagonals=10.

When k=10, output=6, which is ceil(10/2)+1=6.

Wait, ceil(10/2)=5, and output is 6.

Wait, 5 +1=6, perhaps.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, output=5, which is ceil(9/2)=5.

So, perhaps, when k is equal to the total number of diagonals, it's ceil(k/2)+1, else ceil(k/2).

But in the sample, for k=10, it's 6, which matches ceil(10/2)+1=6.

For k=9, it's ceil(9/2)=5, which is less than total diagonals, so no addition.

Wait, but in the sample, for k=9, output=5, which matches ceil(9/2)=5.

For k=10, output=6, which is ceil(10/2)+1=6.

Similarly, for n=4, total diagonals=4*4-2=14.

For k=7, output=4, which is ceil(7/2)=4.

For n=7, total diagonals=4*7-2=26.

For k=11, output=6, which is ceil(11/2)=6.

For n=2, total diagonals=6.

For k=3, output=2, which is ceil(3/2)=2.

So, the pattern seems to be:

- If k is less than or equal to 4n-3, then ceil(k/2)

- Else, ceil(k/2)+1

Wait, for n=3, total diagonals=10.

4n-3=4*3-3=9.

So, for k <=9, ceil(k/2)

For k=10, ceil(k/2)+1.

Similarly, for n=4, 4n-3=13.

Total diagonals=14.

For k=7, which is less than 13, ceil(7/2)=4, which matches.

For k=14, it should be ceil(14/2)+1=7+1=8.

But in the sample, for n=4, k=7, output=4.

Wait, but k=14 is not in the sample.

Wait, perhaps it's when k is equal to 4n-2, total diagonals, then it's ceil(k/2)+1.

Otherwise, ceil(k/2).

In the sample, for n=3, k=10 (which is 4*3-2=10), output=6=ceil(10/2)+1=6.

For k=9, which is less than 10, output=5=ceil(9/2)=5.

For n=4, k=7, which is less than 14, output=4=ceil(7/2)=4.

For n=7, k=11, which is less than 26, output=6=ceil(11/2)=6.

For n=2, k=3, which is less than 6, output=2=ceil(3/2)=2.

So, the rule seems to be:

- If k < 4n - 2, then ceil(k / 2)

- Else, ceil(k / 2) + 1

But in the program, it's checking if k == 4n - 2, then print ceil(k / 2) + 1, else ceil(k / 2).

Wait, in the code:

if 4 * n - 2 == k:

print(k // 2 + 1)

else:

print(ceil(k / 2))

So, according to this, when k equals 4n - 2, it prints ceil(k / 2) +1, else ceil(k / 2).

In the sample, for n=3, k=10, which is 4*3 -2=10, output=6, which is ceil(10 / 2) +1=6.

For k=9, which is less than 10, output=5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5.

Seems correct.

Similarly, for n=4, k=14, which is 4*4 -2=14, output should be ceil(14 / 2)+1=8.

But in the sample, for k=7, which is less than 14, output=4=ceil(7 / 2)=4.

For n=7, k=26, which is 4*7 -2=26, output should be ceil(26 / 2)+1=14.

But in the sample, for k=11, which is less than 26, output=6=ceil(11 / 2)=6.

For n=2, k=3, which is less than 6=4*2 -2=6, output=2=ceil(3 / 2)=2.

So, the rule seems consistent with the sample outputs.

Hence, the program seems to be correct.

Therefore, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
