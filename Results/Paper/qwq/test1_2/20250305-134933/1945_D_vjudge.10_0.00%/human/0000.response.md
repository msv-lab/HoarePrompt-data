Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

There are n people in a queue, and Kirill comes late and stands at the end, which is position n+1. He wants to be among the first m people in the queue after performing some operations. He can bribe people ahead of him to swap positions, but it costs him coins based on the values a_i and b_i.

Let me understand the operations he can perform. If Kirill is at position i, he can choose any position j where j < i and swap places with the person at position j. When he does this, he has to pay a_j coins to the person at position j, and for every k between j and i, he has to pay b_k coins to those people.

Kirill can do this operation any number of times, and he wants to minimize the total coins he spends, but he must end up within the first m positions.

First, I need to figure out how Kirill can move forward in the queue by bribing people.

Let me consider the queue positions from 1 to n+1, where position 1 is the front of the queue, and position n+1 is where Kirill starts.

Kirill wants to be in one of the positions from 1 to m.

I need to find the minimum cost for him to reach any position from 1 to m.

This sounds like a path with costs, where Kirill starts at position n+1 and needs to reach position m or less.

But it's a bit tricky because the operations allow him to swap with anyone ahead, and there are costs associated with those swaps.

Let me try to model this.

Let's think of this as a graph where each position is a node, and there are edges from position i to position j (j < i) with a certain cost.

The cost of moving from i to j would be a_j plus the sum of b_k for k from j+1 to i-1.

Wait, no. According to the problem, when swapping with j, he pays a_j and for each k between j and i, he pays b_k.

So, if he swaps with j, the total cost is a_j + sum of b_k from k=j+1 to i-1.

So, the cost to swap from i to j is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

Kirill can perform this operation multiple times, choosing different j each time.

He starts at i=n+1 and wants to reach i<=m.

I need to find the minimum total cost to reach from n+1 to any position <=m.

This seems like a graph where edges are from i to j for j < i, with edge weights a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to find the minimum cost path from n+1 to any node <=m.

But building such a graph explicitly is not feasible because n can be up to 2e5, and that would be O(n^2) edges.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost without building the entire graph.

Let me see if I can find a dynamic programming approach.

Let dp[i] be the minimum cost to reach position i from position n+1.

I need to compute dp[i] for i from 1 to m and then take the minimum among them.

How to compute dp[i]?

To reach position i, Kirill can come directly from position i+1 by swapping with position i, or from any position j > i by swapping to some position between i and j.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that Kirill can perform swaps repeatedly, and I need to find the optimal sequence of swaps to minimize the total cost.

Perhaps I can think of it as moving from position n+1 to position m or less, and at each step, choosing the best position to swap with.

But I need a more structured approach.

Let me consider that Kirill can swap with any position j < i, and the cost is a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to find a way to compute the minimum cost to reach any position <=m.

Maybe I can iterate from position n+1 down to position m, computing the minimum cost to reach each position.

Wait, but Kirill starts at n+1 and wants to reach <=m.

Let me try to iterate from n+1 down to 1, computing dp[i] as the minimum cost to reach position i.

But I need to consider that Kirill can only swap with positions j < i.

Wait, perhaps I should iterate from position m up to n+1, computing the minimum cost to reach each position.

I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think of it differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where 1 <= p <= m.

To reach p, he can perform a series of swaps to move from n+1 to p.

Each swap from i to j costs a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{i-1} b_k.

I need to find the minimum total cost for such a sequence of swaps.

This seems like a shortest path problem, but with a large number of nodes and edges, so I need a more efficient approach.

Maybe I can find a way to compute the minimum cost directly without modeling the graph.

Let me consider that Kirill can effectively "jump" from n+1 to any position <=m, and I need to find the cheapest way to do that.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that Kirill can directly swap from n+1 to any position j <=m, but that's not exactly true because he can only swap with positions j < i.

But maybe I can find a way to compute the cost of moving from n+1 to j in one or more steps.

This is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about the costs involved.

If Kirill wants to move from n+1 to m, he can swap directly to m, which would cost a_m + sum_{k=m+1}^{n} b_k.

Alternatively, he can swap to some position j where m < j < n+1, and then from j swap to m.

But I need to see if that would be cheaper than swapping directly to m.

Wait, maybe it's not beneficial to swap to an intermediate position j; it might be more expensive.

Let me see with an example.

Take the first sample input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So n=4, m=2.

Kirill starts at position 5 (n+1=5).

He wants to be at position 1 or 2.

Option 1: Swap directly from 5 to 2.

Cost: a_2 + sum_{k=3 to 4} b_k = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16.

Option 2: Swap from 5 to 3, then from 3 to 2.

Cost: (a_3 + b_4) + (a_2 + b_3)

= 6 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 22.

That's more expensive than option 1.

Option 3: Swap from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 2.

Cost: (a_4 + b_3 + b_4) + (a_2 + b_3)

= 9 + 8 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 33.

Even more expensive.

Option 4: Swap from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 3, then from 3 to 2.

Cost: (a_4 + b_3 + b_4) + (a_3 + b_4) + (a_2 + b_3)

= 9 + 8 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 8 = 44.

Even worse.

So, swapping directly from 5 to 2 is the cheapest option here, with a cost of 16.

But according to the sample output, it's 14. So maybe I'm missing a better option.

Wait, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me see.

Another option: Swap from 5 to 4, then from 4 to 1.

Cost: (a_4 + b_3 + b_4) + (a_1 + b_2 + b_3)

= 9 + 8 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 40.

Still worse.

Wait, maybe swap from 5 to 3, then from 3 to 1.

Cost: (a_3 + b_4) + (a_1 + b_2 + b_3)

= 6 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 8 = 29.

Better but still not 14.

I must be missing something.

Let me look at the sample input and output again.

Input:

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

Output:

14

So, how to achieve 14?

Maybe swap from 5 to 1 directly.

Cost: a_1 + sum_{k=2 to 4} b_k = 7 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 23.

That's higher than 16.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to optimize the path.

Wait, maybe the problem allows Kirill to perform multiple swaps in a way that reuses some of the costs.

But I'm not seeing it.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose Kirill wants to reach position p, where p <= m.

To reach p, he can perform swaps in such a way that he pays a_j for some j < p and sum of b_k for k between j and p.

But it's getting too tangled.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to reach p is the minimum over all j < p of (minimal cost to reach j) + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k.

This sounds like a dynamic programming approach.

Let me define dp[p] as the minimal cost to reach position p.

Then, dp[p] = min over j < p of dp[j] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k.

But this would be O(n^2), which is too slow for n=2e5.

I need a way to compute this more efficiently.

Perhaps I can find a way to compute dp[p] in O(n) time or O(n log n) time.

Let me see.

I need to optimize this dynamic programming approach.

Looking at the expression dp[p] = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j) + sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k.

I can rearrange this as dp[p] = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j - sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k).

Wait, no, sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k is positive, so it's being added.

I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider precomputing prefix sums of b_k.

Let prefix_b[p] = sum_{k=1 to p} b_k.

Then sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k = prefix_b[p-1] - prefix_b[j].

So, dp[p] = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[p-1] - prefix_b[j]).

This can be rewritten as dp[p] = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[p-1].

Now, dp[p] = min_over_j (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[p-1].

Let me define a variable m = min_over_j (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]).

Then dp[p] = m + prefix_b[p-1].

But m is the minimum over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]).

So, I can compute m as I iterate p from 1 to m, keeping track of the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) for j from 1 to p-1.

This way, I can compute dp[p] efficiently.

I need to iterate p from 1 to m, computing dp[p] = m + prefix_b[p-1], and updating m with dp[p] + a_p - prefix_b[p].

Wait, let's see.

Initialize m = initial value.

For p from 1 to m:

dp[p] = m + prefix_b[p-1]

Then update m = min(m, dp[p] + a_p - prefix_b[p])

But I need to make sure that m is correctly updated.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of it as a sliding window minimum.

Let me think carefully.

Define dp[p] = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j + sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k).

With prefix_b[p] = sum_{k=1 to p} b_k.

Then sum_{k=j+1}^{p-1} b_k = prefix_b[p-1] - prefix_b[j].

So dp[p] = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j + prefix_b[p-1] - prefix_b[j])

= min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) + prefix_b[p-1]

So dp[p] = (min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j])) + prefix_b[p-1]

Let me define min_val = min over j < p of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j])

Then dp[p] = min_val + prefix_b[p-1]

And for the next p, min_val could potentially be updated with dp[p] + a_p - prefix_b[p]

But I need to make sure that I'm taking the minimum only over j < p.

So, as I iterate p from 1 to m, I can keep track of the minimum of (dp[j] + a_j - prefix_b[j]) for j from 1 to p-1.

I can maintain this minimum in a variable m.

So, initialize m appropriately.

Then, for each p from 1 to m:

dp[p] = m + prefix_b[p-1]

Then, compute m = min(m, dp[p] + a_p - prefix_b[p])

Wait, does this work?

Let me check with p=1.

For p=1, there are no j < 1, so min over empty set is undefined.

I need to handle p=1 separately.

Actually, p starts from 1 to m.

Wait, positions are from 1 to n+1, but n+1 is where Kirill starts.

Wait, in the problem, positions are from 1 to n, and Kirill starts at n+1.

But in the code, it seems like positions are from 1 to n, and Kirill starts at n+1, but in the dp approach, I need to consider positions from 1 to m.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the indices.

Let me try to redefine.

Let me consider positions from 1 to n, and Kirill starts at position n+1.

He wants to reach any position from 1 to m.

But in the dp approach, I need to model the cost to reach each position p from n+1.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that Kirill can perform swaps to move from n+1 to any p <=m, considering the costs involved.

This is getting too convoluted.

Let me look at the provided code and see what it's doing.

The code is:

def func():

x = int(input())

custos = []

for i in range(x):

custo = 0

num_fila = 0

max_p = 0

a_values = []

b_values = []

nf = input().split()

num_fila = int(nf[0])

max_p = int(nf[1])

a = input().split()

b = input().split()

for y in a:

a_values.append(int(y))

for y in b:

b_values.append(int(y))

for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):

if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:

custo += a_values[y]

else:

custo += b_values[y]

for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):

if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:

custo += b_values[y]

if y == 1:

custo += a_values[0]

break

else:

custo += a_values[y]

break

custos.append(custo)

for c in custos:

print(c)

So, it processes t test cases.

For each test case:

- Reads n and m

- Reads a_values and b_values arrays, both of size n.

- Initializes custo = 0

- Then, it has two loops:

First loop: from n-1 down to m

For each y in this range:

if a[y] < b[y]:

custo += a[y]

else:

custo += b[y]

Second loop: from m-1 down to 0

For each y in this range:

if a[y-1] + b[y] <= a[y]:

custo += b[y]

if y == 1:

custo += a[0]

break

else:

custo += a[y]

break

Then, it appends custo to custos list.

Finally, it prints each custo in custos.

I need to understand what this code is doing and whether it correctly solves the problem.

Let me try to interpret this code.

First loop: from n-1 down to m-1

For each position y in this range, it adds either a[y] or b[y], depending on which is smaller.

Second loop: from m-1 down to 0

For each position y, it checks if a[y-1] + b[y] <= a[y]

If true, it adds b[y] to custo.

If y == 1, it adds a[0] to custo and breaks.

Else, it adds a[y] to custo and breaks.

This seems like the code is trying to compute the minimal cost by breaking the process into two parts.

First part: moving from n+1 to some position >=m.

Second part: moving from that position to a position <=m.

But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me try to see with the sample input.

Sample input:

4

4 2

7 3 6 9

4 3 8 5

So, n=4, m=2

a = [7,3,6,9]

b = [4,3,8,5]

First loop: y from 3 down to 2

y=3: a[3]=9, b[3]=5; since 9 > 5, custo +=5

y=2: a[2]=6, b[2]=8; since 6 < 8, custo +=6

So, custo=5+6=11

Second loop: y from 1 down to 0

y=1: a[0]=7, b[1]=3; a[0]+b[1]=7+3=10; if 10 <= a[1]=3? 10 <=3 is False, so custo += a[1]=3 and break.

So, custo=11+3=14, which matches the sample output.

Another sample input:

6 2

6 9 7 1 8 3

5 8 8 1 4 1

First loop: y from 5 down to 2

y=5: a[5]=3, b[5]=1; 3 <1 is False, so custo +=1

y=4: a[4]=8, b[4]=4; 8 >4, so custo +=4

y=3: a[3]=1, b[3]=1; 1 <1 is False, so custo +=1

So, custo=1+4+1=6

Second loop: y from 1 down to 0

y=1: a[0]=6, b[1]=8; a[0]+b[1]=6+8=14; if 14 <= a[1]=9? 14 <=9 is False, so custo +=9 and break.

Total custo=6+9=15

But according to the sample output, it should be 22.

Wait, maybe I misread the sample output.

Wait, the sample output is:

14

22

9

3

So, for the second test case, it's 22, not 15.

So, my calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I missed something in the code.

Wait, in the code, the first loop is from num_fila-1 down to max_p-1.

In this case, num_fila=6, max_p=2, so y from 5 down to 1 (since range(5,1,-1)).

So y=5: a[5]=3, b[5]=1; 3 >1, custo +=1

y=4: a[4]=8, b[4]=4; 8 >4, custo +=4

y=3: a[3]=1, b[3]=1; 1 <1 is False, custo +=1

y=2: a[2]=7, b[2]=8; 7 <8, custo +=7

So custo=1+4+1+7=13

Second loop: y from 1 down to 0

y=1: a[0]=6, b[1]=8; a[0]+b[1]=6+8=14; if 14 <= a[1]=9? 14 <=9 is False, so custo +=9 and break.

Total custo=13+9=22, which matches the sample output.

Okay, so my earlier mistake was not including y=2 in the first loop.

Now, I need to understand why this approach works.

It seems that the code is dividing the process into two parts:

1. Moving from position n+1 to some position >=m.

2. Then moving from that position to a position <=m.

In the first loop, it's summing up the minimal costs to move from n+1 to positions m to n.

In the second loop, it's handling the move from position m-1 down to position 1.

But I'm still not entirely sure about the logic behind it.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the code is simulating the process of moving Kirill from position n+1 to position m or less in two steps:

- First, move from n+1 to some position p, where m <= p <=n.

- Then, move from p to a position q, where q <=m.

And it's trying to minimize the cost for this two-step process.

But I need to verify if this is indeed the correct approach.

Wait, maybe it's greedily moving Kirill as far forward as possible with minimal costs.

But I need to ensure that this approach correctly computes the minimal cost for any test case.

Given that the sample inputs and the code's output match the expected output, it seems correct.

But to be thorough, I should test it with some additional test cases.

Let me consider a simple test case.

Test case 1:

n=1, m=1

a=[5]

b=[3]

So, Kirill starts at position 2, and he wants to be at position 1.

Option: Swap directly from 2 to 1, cost: a[1] + sum_{k=2-1 to 1-1} b_k = 5 + 0 =5.

Alternatively, if there are no intermediate steps, that's the only option.

According to the code:

First loop: y from 0 down to 0 (since m=1, max_p-1=0)

y=0: a[0]=5, b[0]=3; 5 >3, so custo +=3

Second loop: y from 0 down to 0

y=0: since y==1 is False, it adds a[y]=5, and breaks.

Total custo=3+5=8, which is higher than the direct cost of 5.

This suggests that the code is incorrect for this test case.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the indices.

Wait, in Python, list indices start from 0, but positions are from 1 to n.

In the code, a_values[0] corresponds to position 1.

So, for n=1, m=1

First loop: y from 0 down to 0

y=0: a[0]=5, b[0]=3; 5 >3, so custo +=3

Second loop: y from 0 down to 0

y=0: a[-1] is invalid, but in Python, a[-1] refers to the last element, which is a[0] in this case.

Wait, no, for y=0, y-1=-1, which refers to a[-1]=a[0] in Python.

But position 0 doesn't exist; positions are from 1 to n.

This seems confusing.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect because it's mishandling the indices.

In the second loop, for y in range(max_p -1, -1, -1):

For n=1, m=1, max_p-1=0

So y=0:

if a[y-1] + b[y] <= a[y]:

But y-1=-1, which refers to a[-1]=a[0], which is position 1.

Wait, this doesn't make sense.

It seems like the code has an off-by-one error in indices.

Perhaps positions are 1 to n, but in the code, they are indexed from 0 to n-1.

But in the second loop, y ranges from max_p-1 down to 0.

For n=1, m=1, it's trying to access y-1=-1, which wraps around to a[0] in Python lists, but it's not logically correct.

This suggests a flaw in the code.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
