Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has an array of integers, and he can perform a specific operation on it any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index i (between 2 and n-1) and modifying the elements at positions i-1, i, and i+1 by subtracting 1, 2, and 1 respectively. The goal is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by applying this operation any number of times.

First, I need to understand the operation clearly. When Rudolf chooses an index i, he's effectively reducing the values of a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1] by 1, 2, and 1 respectively. So, each operation is targeted at three consecutive elements, with the middle one being reduced by 2.

I need to figure out if, by applying such operations strategically, I can zero out the entire array. This sounds like a problem that might involve some kind of system of equations or perhaps looking at the differences between consecutive elements.

Let me think about the implications of the operation. Each operation affects three elements: the one before i, the one at i, and the one after i, with different subtraction amounts. So, if I look at the array as a sequence, each operation is making specific changes to three consecutive terms.

Maybe I can model this as a system where each operation contributes certain amounts to these three positions, and I need to find a combination of operations that sums up to the initial array, effectively canceling everything out to zero.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern or invariant that can help determine whether it's possible to zero out the array without going through a complex system of equations.

Let's consider small examples to get some intuition.

Take the smallest possible array size, n=3. So, array looks like [a, b, c].

If I apply the operation on i=2, it becomes [a-1, b-2, c-1].

To make all elements zero, we need:

a - 1 = 0 => a = 1

b - 2 = 0 => b = 2

c - 1 = 0 => c = 1

So, for n=3, it's only possible if a=1, b=2, c=1.

Wait, but the problem allows multiple operations. Maybe I can apply the operation multiple times.

Wait, but in this case, applying the operation once on i=2 gives [1,2,1], which zeros out. If any of a, b, c are different, it might not zero out.

Wait, but the problem says "any number of times", so maybe there's more flexibility.

Wait, but in this simple case, it seems like only [1,2,1] can be zeroed out with one operation.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider another small array, n=4: [a,b,c,d].

If I apply the operation on i=2, it becomes [a-1, b-2, c-1, d].

If I apply it on i=3, it becomes [a, b-1, c-2, d-1].

So, perhaps by combining these operations, I can adjust the values accordingly.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me look at the differences between consecutive elements.

Suppose I look at the differences between a[i] and a[i+1] for i from 1 to n-1.

How do the operations affect these differences?

When I apply an operation at index i, it changes a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1].

So, the difference a[i] - a[i-1] changes by -1 (since a[i] decreases by 2 and a[i-1] decreases by 1).

Similarly, a[i+1] - a[i] changes by -1 (a[i+1] decreases by 1 and a[i] decreases by 2).

This seems a bit messy. Maybe differences aren't the way to go.

Let me think about the sum of the array.

Each operation reduces the total sum by 1 + 2 + 1 = 4.

So, if the initial sum is S, and I perform K operations, the final sum will be S - 4K.

We want this final sum to be zero, so S must be divisible by 4.

Wait, that's an interesting point. The total sum S needs to be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to zero out the array.

But is this condition sufficient?

Wait, no. Consider the array [2,2,2]. Sum is 6, which is divisible by 4? Wait, 6 is not divisible by 4. So, that can't be.

Wait, 6 is not divisible by 4, but 4 divides 6 doesn't hold since 6 mod 4 is 2.

Wait, but 4K = S, so S needs to be a multiple of 4.

Wait, but in this case, S=6, which is not a multiple of 4, so it shouldn't be possible to zero it out, which makes sense because 6 cannot be expressed as 4K for any integer K.

But let's see if S being a multiple of 4 is sufficient.

Take [0,0,0], sum is 0, which is divisible by 4, and it's already zeroed out.

Take [2,4,2], sum is 8, which is divisible by 4.

Can I zero this out?

Apply operation at i=2: [1,2,1]

Apply operation at i=2 again: [0,0,0]

Yes, it works.

Another example: [1,3,5,5,2], sum is 1+3+5+5+2=16, which is divisible by 4.

According to the example, it's possible to zero it out.

Another one: [2,4,4,5,1], sum is 16, which is divisible by 4, but in the example, it's "NO".

Wait, so sum being divisible by 4 isn't sufficient.

So, there must be another condition beyond just the sum being divisible by 4.

Looking back at the examples:

First test case: [1,3,5,5,2], sum=16, "YES"

Second test case: [2,4,4,5,1], sum=16, "NO"

Third test case: [0,1,3,3,1], sum=8, "YES"

Fourth test case: [5,6,0,2,3,0], sum=16, "NO"

Fifth test case: [1,2,7,2], sum=12, "NO"

Sixth test case: [7,1,0], sum=8, "NO"

Seventh test case: [1,1,1,1], sum=4, "NO"

Wait, in the seventh test case, [1,1,1,1], sum=4, which is divisible by 4, but the output is "NO". So, sum being divisible by 4 isn't sufficient.

So, I need to find additional conditions.

Let me think differently.

Perhaps I can model this as a system of linear equations.

Letâ€™s denote the number of times I apply the operation at each index i as x_i, where x_i is a non-negative integer.

Then, for each position j, the total reduction should equal the initial value a_j.

For j=1: a_1 - x_2 = 0 => x_2 = a_1

For j=2: a_2 - 2x_2 - x_3 = 0

For j=3: a_3 - x_2 - 2x_3 - x_4 = 0

...

For j=n-1: a_{n-1} - x_{n-2} - 2x_{n-1} - x_n = 0

For j=n: a_n - x_{n-1} = 0 => x_{n-1} = a_n

Wait, but in the operation, only indices from 2 to n-1 are chosen, and they affect a_{i-1}, a_i, and a_{i+1}.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up equations for each a_j being reduced to zero based on the operations.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or find necessary conditions for the array to be zeroed out.

Looking back at the first test case:

[1,3,5,5,2]

Apply operation at i=4: a[3] -=1, a[4] -=2, a[5] -=1 => [1,3,4,3,1]

Apply operation at i=3: [1,2,2,2,1]

Apply operation at i=2: [0,0,1,2,1]

Apply operation at i=4: [0,0,0,0,0]

So, it's possible.

But for [2,4,4,5,1], it's "NO".

What's the difference?

Maybe I need to look at the parity of the elements.

Looking at the first element: in the first test case, a[1]=1, which is odd.

In the second test case, a[1]=2, which is even.

Wait, but in the third test case, [0,1,3,3,1], a[1]=0 (even), and it's "YES".

Wait, that doesn't seem consistent.

Wait, maybe look at the differences.

Wait, perhaps cumulative sums or something.

Let me try to think of it as a system where each operation affects three positions.

Maybe I can consider the array as a system where each operation reduces a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to accumulate the operations from left to right or right to left.

Wait, perhaps I can think of it in terms of prefix sums.

Let me try defining prefix sums.

Define p[0] = 0

p[1] = a[1]

p[2] = a[1] + a[2]

...

p[n] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[n]

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, maybe I can look at the array in terms of how operations propagate.

Each operation at i affects a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1].

Maybe I can model this as a system where each operation contributes to certain positions.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the operations in reverse.

Suppose I have the final array as zeros, and I need to build up to the initial array by undoing the operations.

Each undo operation would add 1 to a[i-1], 2 to a[i], and 1 to a[i+1].

Then, I can try to build the array step by step.

But that might not be straightforward.

Let me consider the dual problem.

Suppose I have the zero array and I want to reach the initial array by adding values in a specific pattern.

Each "reverse" operation adds 1 to a[i-1], 2 to a[i], and 1 to a[i+1].

This resembles a kind of convolution or filtering.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Maybe I need to look for invariants.

An invariant is something that remains unchanged by the operations.

Is there something in the array that remains unchanged no matter how many operations I perform?

Wait, since each operation reduces the sum by 4, the sum modulo 4 remains invariant.

Wait, no, the sum changes by -4 each operation, so the sum modulo 4 is not invariant unless the initial sum is divisible by 4.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, even with sum divisible by 4, it was "NO" in some cases.

So, sum being divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient.

I need more conditions.

Let me consider the parity of the elements again.

Looking back at the code provided:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

a = int(input())

b = list(map(int, input().split()))

if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or (b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2):

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

It seems to check if the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first plus 2, or if the last element is odd and the second last is not equal to the last plus 2.

If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO"; otherwise, "YES".

Is this correct?

Looking back at the examples:

First test case: [1,3,5,5,2]

b[0]=1 (odd), b[1]=3 == 1 + 2? 1+2=3, which matches, so condition not triggered.

b[-1]=2 (even), so second part not triggered. So, prints "YES".

Second test case: [2,4,4,5,1]

b[0]=2 (even), so first part not triggered.

b[-1]=1 (odd), b[-2]=5 != 1 + 2 = 3, so condition triggered, prints "NO".

Third test case: [0,1,3,3,1]

b[0]=0 (even), so first part not triggered.

b[-1]=1 (odd), b[-2]=3 != 1 + 2 = 3, but 3 == 3, so condition not triggered, prints "YES".

Wait, b[-2]=3 and b[-1]=1, so b[-2] = 3 and b[-1] + 2 = 3, which matches, so condition not triggered.

Wait, but b[-1] is 1, which is odd, and b[-2]=3 == 1 + 2, so it shouldn't trigger the condition.

Wait, but in the code, it's b[-2] != b[-1] + 2, so 3 != 3 is False, so condition not triggered.

Hence, prints "YES".

Fourth test case: [5,6,0,2,3,0]

b[0]=5 (odd), b[1]=6 != 5 + 2 = 7, so condition triggered, prints "NO".

Fifth test case: [1,2,7,2]

b[0]=1 (odd), b[1]=2 != 1 + 2 = 3, so condition triggered, prints "NO".

Sixth test case: [7,1,0]

b[0]=7 (odd), b[1]=1 != 7 + 2 = 9, so condition triggered, prints "NO".

Seventh test case: [1,1,1,1]

b[0]=1 (odd), b[1]=1 != 1 + 2 = 3, so condition triggered, prints "NO".

Comparing with the expected outputs:

First: YES

Second: NO

Third: YES

Fourth: NO

Fifth: NO

Sixth: NO

Seventh: NO

So, in this case, the code seems to produce the correct outputs for these test cases.

But is this logic generally correct?

I need to verify if this condition is sufficient for the general case.

Let me try to think about why this might work.

The condition checks:

- If the first element is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, then "NO".

- If the last element is odd and the second last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then "NO".

- Otherwise, "YES".

Is there a reason why these conditions ensure that the array can be zeroed out?

Let me consider the operation again.

Each operation reduces a[i-1] by 1, a[i] by 2, and a[i+1] by 1.

So, the operation affects three consecutive elements in a specific way.

If I look at the first element, it can only be reduced by operations performed on i=2.

Each operation on i=2 reduces a[1] by 1 and a[2] by 2 and a[3] by 1.

Similarly, operations on other i's affect their neighboring elements.

So, perhaps the first element can only be reduced by operations on i=2, and similarly, the last element can only be reduced by operations on i=n-1.

Let me consider the first element.

If b[0] is odd, and b[1] != b[0] + 2, then it's "NO".

Wait, why is that?

Suppose b[0] is odd.

Each operation on i=2 reduces b[0] by 1.

So, to make b[0] zero, the number of operations on i=2 must be exactly b[0], assuming b[0] is reduced only by operations on i=2.

But, operations on i=3 would also affect b[2], which in turn affects b[3], and so on.

Wait, perhaps it's about ensuring that the reductions propagate correctly.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of operations needed on each i to satisfy the reductions.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a smaller array where n=3: [a,b,c]

To zero it out:

- Apply operation on i=2: [a-1, b-2, c-1]

- To make a-1=0, a=1

- b-2=0, b=2

- c-1=0, c=1

So, only [1,2,1] can be zeroed out with one operation.

If a=1, b=2, c=1, it works.

If a=1, b=3, c=1, it's impossible because b-2=1, which doesn't match c-1=0.

Wait, but in this case, sum is 5, which is not divisible by 4, so it should be invalid anyway.

Wait, but sum being divisible by 4 is necessary but not sufficient, as seen earlier.

Let me consider another array: [2,4,2]

Sum is 8, which is divisible by 4.

Apply operation on i=2: [1,2,1]

Apply operation on i=2 again: [0,0,0]

So, it works.

Another array: [2,2,2]

Sum is 6, not divisible by 4, so it should be "NO", which matches the earlier thought.

Now, considering the code's condition:

For [1,2,1], b[0]=1 (odd), b[1]=2 == 1+2=3? No, 2 != 3, so condition triggered, should print "NO", but actually it's "YES".

Wait, but in the earlier reasoning with the small example, [1,2,1] can be zeroed out with one operation.

But according to the code, b[1] != b[0] + 2, so it should print "NO", but actually it should be "YES".

Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, b[1]=2 and b[0]+2=3, which are not equal, so the condition is triggered, and it prints "NO", but in reality, it's "YES".

So, this suggests that the code is incorrect for this case.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it seemed to work.

Wait, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the first test case, [1,3,5,5,2], b[1]=3 == b[0]+2=3, so condition not triggered.

Similarly, b[-1]=2 (even), so second condition not triggered, hence "YES".

But in the small example [1,2,1], b[1]=2 != b[0]+2=3, so it should print "NO", but actually it's "YES".

So, the code is incorrect in this scenario.

Wait, but in the provided examples, it seems to work.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the condition is meant to be b[1] == b[0] + 2 for b[0] odd, but in the small example [1,3,1], it should be b[1]=3 ==1+2=3, which matches, so it's "YES".

Wait, but in the small example [1,2,1], it's b[1]=2 !=1+2=3, so it should be "NO", but actually it's "YES".

Wait, but in the small example [1,2,1], with one operation on i=2, it becomes [0,0,0], so it should be "YES".

But according to the code, it would print "NO" because b[1]!=b[0]+2.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps the condition is meant to ensure that the first and last elements can be reduced appropriately.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the entire array and see if there's a consistent way to apply operations to zero it out.

This seems too vague.

Let me look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can model this as a system of linear equations modulo 2.

Since we're dealing with integer operations and reductions, maybe looking at the parity can help.

Let me consider each operation as changing the parity of a[i-1], a[i], and a[i+1].

Each operation flips the parity of a[i-1], decreases a[i] by 2 (same parity), and flips the parity of a[i+1].

Wait, decreasing by 2 keeps the parity the same for a[i].

Wait, no, decreasing by 1 changes parity, decreasing by 2 keeps parity.

So, operation at i changes:

- a[i-1]: parity flips

- a[i]: decreases by 2, parity remains the same

- a[i+1]: parity flips

Wait, but a[i] decreases by 2, which doesn't change parity if a[i] was even, but if a[i] was odd, it remains odd.

Wait, no, decreasing by 2 changes a[i] from even to even or odd to odd.

Wait, 4 is even, 4-2=2, still even; 5 is odd, 5-2=3, still odd.

So, a[i] parity remains the same.

But a[i-1] and a[i+1] have their values decreased by 1, which flips their parity.

So, each operation flips the parity of a[i-1] and a[i+1], and keeps the parity of a[i] the same.

Now, to reach all zeros, which are even, we need to ensure that the parity of each element can be adjusted accordingly.

But this seems a bit too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the parity of the elements in relation to their neighbors.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the differences between consecutive elements.

Let me define d[i] = a[i] - a[i-1] for i from 1 to n, assuming a[0] = 0.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider prefix sums.

Define p[i] = a[1] + a[2] + ... + a[i]

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system where each operation affects a specific pattern, and see if I can solve for the number of operations at each position.

This seems similar to solving a system of linear equations.

Given that, perhaps I can set up equations for each position.

For position 1: a[1] - x[2] = 0 => x[2] = a[1]

For position 2: a[2] - 2*x[2] - x[3] = 0 => x[3] = a[2] - 2*x[2]

...

For position n-1: a[n-1] - x[n-2] - 2*x[n-1] - x[n] = 0

For position n: a[n] - x[n-1] = 0 => x[n-1] = a[n]

Wait, but x[n] is not defined, since operations are only from i=2 to n-1.

Wait, perhaps I need to set up the equations differently.

Let me try to write it in terms of x[i], where x[i] is the number of operations at position i.

Then:

a[1] - x[2] = 0 => x[2] = a[1]

a[2] - 2*x[2] - x[3] = 0 => x[3] = a[2] - 2*x[2] = a[2] - 2*a[1]

a[3] - x[2] - 2*x[3] - x[4] = 0 => x[4] = a[3] - x[2] - 2*x[3] = a[3] - a[1] - 2*(a[2] - 2*a[1]) = a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1] = a[3] + 3*a[1] - 2*a[2]

...

This seems messy, but perhaps there's a pattern.

Let me see for n=4:

x[2] = a[1]

x[3] = a[2] - 2*x[2] = a[2] - 2*a[1]

x[4] = a[3] - x[2] - 2*x[3] = a[3] - a[1] - 2*(a[2] - 2*a[1}) = a[3] - a[1] - 2*a[2] + 4*a[1} = a[3] + 3*a[1] - 2*a[2]

Then, from position 4: a[4] - x[3] - 2*x[4] = 0

But x[3] = a[2] - 2*a[1]

x[4] = a[3] + 3*a[1] - 2*a[2]

So, a[4] - (a[2] - 2*a[1}) - 2*(a[3] + 3*a[1] - 2*a[2}) = 0

Simplify:

a[4] - a[2] + 2*a[1} - 2*a[3] - 6*a[1} + 4*a[2} = 0

Combine like terms:

a[4] - 4*a[1} + 3*a[2} - 2*a[3} = 0

This seems complicated, but perhaps it indicates a relationship between the elements that must hold for the array to be zeroed out.

Similarly, for n=5, there would be a similar equation involving a[5], a[4], a[3], a[2], and a[1].

This seems too involved for a programming problem, especially since n can be up to 2e5.

There must be a smarter way to check the possibility without solving a system of equations for each test case.

Let me look back at the code provided.

It only checks the first and last elements' parity and their relationship with their neighbors.

This seems too simplistic, yet it matches the sample inputs and outputs.

But in my earlier small example, [1,2,1], it should be "YES", but according to the code, it would be "NO" because b[1]=2 != b[0]+2=3.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sample inputs, it seems to work.

Perhaps there's something wrong with my small example.

Wait, in the small example [1,2,1], applying one operation at i=2: a[1]-1=0, a[2]-2=0, a[3]-1=0, so it becomes [0,0,0].

So, it should be "YES".

But according to the code, since b[1]=2 != b[0]+2=3, it would print "NO", which is incorrect.

So, the code is wrong.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\boxed{\text{False}}
