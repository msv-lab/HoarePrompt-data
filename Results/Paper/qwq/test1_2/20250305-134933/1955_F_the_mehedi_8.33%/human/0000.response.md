Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, there are n integers in a sequence, each of which is at most 4. Alice and Bob are playing a game where they look at the bitwise XOR of all the numbers in the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. Eve is the judge who removes one number at a time from the sequence, and after each removal, they play again with the remaining numbers. This continues until no numbers are left. Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics. The key here is the bitwise XOR of the sequence. XOR has some properties that are important to consider:

1. XOR is associative and commutative, which means the order in which we XOR the numbers doesn't matter.

2. XOR with itself cancels out to 0 (e.g., 2 XOR 2 = 0).

3. XOR with 0 leaves the number unchanged (e.g., 3 XOR 0 = 3).

Given that each number is at most 4, the possible numbers are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But from the input, it seems 0 is not included since p_i is for ones, twos, threes, and fours. Wait, actually, the input describes the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours, so 0 is not directly present, but since XOR with 0 doesn't change the value, and 0 is not in the sequence, I need to consider how the presence or absence of numbers affects the overall XOR.

Let me think about the XOR of the entire sequence initially. The XOR of all numbers is the combination of XORs of ones, twos, threes, and fours based on their counts.

Given that each number is used multiple times, I need to see how their counts affect the overall XOR.

First, let's compute the XOR of multiple identical numbers:

- 1 XOR 1 = 0

- 1 XOR 1 XOR 1 = 1

- Similarly, for any number x, XOR of even number of x's is 0, and XOR of odd number of x's is x itself.

So, the overall XOR of the sequence is the XOR of the individual numbers, each contributed by their count modulo 2.

Wait, more precisely, since XOR is associative and commutative, the XOR of a list of numbers is equivalent to the XOR of each number appearing an odd number of times.

So, for each number x in the sequence, if it appears an odd number of times, it contributes x to the overall XOR; if even times, it contributes 0.

Therefore, the overall XOR is the XOR of all x where the count of x is odd.

Now, Eve removes one number at a time, and after each removal, they check the XOR of the remaining numbers.

I need to find out, for each step, whether the current sequence has a XOR of 0 (Bob wins) or non-zero (Alice wins), and Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, Eve wants to choose which number to remove at each step to make the remaining sequence have a XOR of 0 as often as possible.

This seems a bit tricky because the choice of which number to remove affects the XOR of the remaining sequence.

Let me think differently. Since XOR is involved, perhaps there is a pattern or a formula that can directly give the number of times Bob can win, based on the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

Let's consider the initial XOR of the full sequence. If it's 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Then, Eve removes one number, and we check the XOR again. This continues until no numbers are left.

Wait, actually, the game starts with n numbers, then n-1, and so on, down to 0. So, there are n+1 games in total: from n numbers down to 0 numbers. But wait, when the sequence is empty, the XOR is 0 (since XOR is associative and 0 is the identity element), so Bob wins again.

Wait, but the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty", which I assume includes the empty sequence as well.

So, total games: from n down to 0, which is n+1 games.

But in the example, with n=3 (since p=[1,1,1,0], total numbers are 1+1+1+0=3), and the output is 1, meaning Bob wins once.

Wait, but with n=3, there are 4 games: with 3 numbers, 2 numbers, 1 number, and 0 numbers.

In the first game (3 numbers), if XOR is 0, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, now 2 numbers left, check XOR again.

Then, remove another, 1 number left, check XOR.

Finally, remove the last one, 0 numbers left, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

In the first game (3 numbers), with p=[1,1,1,0], meaning one 1, one 2, and one 3.

So, XOR of 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers are 2 and 3, XOR is 2 XOR 3 = 1, Alice wins.

Then, remove another number, say 2, remaining number is 3, XOR is 3, Alice wins.

Finally, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR is 0, Bob wins.

So, in this case, Bob wins twice: with 3 numbers and with 0 numbers.

But the output is 1, which seems contradictory to my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "after one game, Eve removes one of the numbers, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, the games are played with n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1, 0 numbers.

But in the first game, with n numbers, Bob wins if XOR is 0.

Then, Eve removes one number, and the next game is with n-1 numbers.

Eve removes another, next game with n-2 numbers, and so on.

So, the number of games is n+1 (including the empty sequence).

But in the first game with n numbers, Bob wins if XOR is 0.

In the example, with p=[1,1,1,0], n=3, and XOR of 1^2^3=0, so Bob wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, say 1, remaining numbers 2 and 3, XOR=1, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes another number, say 2, remaining number 3, XOR=3, Alice wins.

Finally, remove 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice: with 3 numbers and with 0 numbers.

But the output is 1, which suggests that only one of these wins counts.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.

Looking back, "Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence, then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after which Alice and Bob play with n-2 numbers. This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

So, the games are played after each removal, starting from n numbers down to 0 numbers.

In the first game, with n numbers, Bob wins if XOR is 0.

Then, Eve removes one number, and the next game is with n-1 numbers.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, Eve chooses which number to remove to make the remaining sequence have XOR=0 for Bob to win.

Wait, but in the first game, with n numbers, Eve doesn't remove yet; she removes after the first game.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of steps:

1. Start with n numbers, play the game, then Eve removes one number.

2. Play with n-1 numbers, then Eve removes another number.

3. Continue until no numbers are left.

So, in each step, Eve removes one number, and then the remaining numbers are used for the next game.

Eve wants to choose which number to remove at each step to maximize the number of times Bob wins in the remaining games.

This seems a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think recursively or consider the sequence of removals that lead to the maximum number of Bob's wins.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a smarter way to calculate this based on the counts of each number.

Given that the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and their XOR properties, maybe I can find a pattern.

Let me consider the XOR values:

- 1 in binary is 001

- 2 is 010

- 3 is 011 (1^2)

- 4 is 100

So, XOR of any combination will be the bitwise XOR of these binary representations.

Given that, perhaps I can consider the parity of the counts of each number to determine the overall XOR.

Wait, as I thought earlier, the overall XOR is determined by the numbers that appear an odd number of times.

So, if a number x appears an odd number of times, it contributes x to the XOR; if even, it contributes 0.

Therefore, the overall XOR is the XOR of all x where count[x] is odd.

Now, Eve wants to remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has XOR=0 as often as possible.

So, for each removal step, Eve chooses which number to remove to maximize the number of times the remaining sequence has XOR=0.

This seems like a tricky optimization problem.

Maybe I can think in terms of the total number of games where Bob can win, considering that Eve can choose optimally which number to remove at each step.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a formula based on the counts of each number that can directly give the maximum number of Bob's wins.

Let me look at the example:

Input:

5

1 1 1 0

1 0 1 2

2 2 2 0

3 3 2 0

0 9 9 9

Output:

1

1

3

3

12

Let's analyze the first test case:

p = [1,1,1,0], so one 1, one 2, one 3, and zero 4's.

Total numbers: 3.

Games:

- With 3 numbers: 1^2^3=0, Bob wins.

- Remove one number, say 1, remaining numbers: 2 and 3, XOR=1, Alice wins.

- Remove another number, say 2, remaining number: 3, XOR=3, Alice wins.

- Remove 3, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the output is 1, which contradicts my earlier calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem counts only the wins from the non-empty sequences.

Perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count.

Looking back at the problem statement: "This continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

And "determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally."

In the first test case, with n=3, Bob wins once (when the sequence has 3 numbers), and again when the sequence is empty.

Maybe the empty sequence doesn't count as a game.

Looking back, it says "in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence of n integers", and "this continues until the sequence of numbers is empty."

Probably, the empty sequence is also considered as a game where Bob wins.

But according to the output, it seems only one win for Bob.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the empty sequence is not counted.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, let's look at the second test case:

p = [1,0,1,2], so one 1, zero 2's, one 3, and two 4's.

Total numbers: 1+0+1+2=4.

Games:

- With 4 numbers: 1^3^4^4 = 1^3^0 = 1^3 = 2, Alice wins.

- Remove one number, say 1, remaining numbers: 3,4,4, XOR=3, Alice wins.

- Remove another number, say 3, remaining numbers: 4,4, XOR=0, Bob wins.

- Remove one 4, remaining number: 4, XOR=4, Alice wins.

- Remove the last 4, empty sequence, XOR=0, Bob wins.

So, Bob wins twice.

But the output is 1, which again contradicts my calculation.

Wait, perhaps Bob can win only once in this scenario.

Maybe I need to consider that Eve can only choose removals that lead to one Bob's win.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a constraint on how Eve removes the numbers that affects Bob's wins.

This is getting confusing.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider the total number of games, which is n+1 (including the empty sequence).

Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is 0.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

Given that XOR is 0 when the XOR of the selected numbers is 0.

This seems like a problem related to linear algebra over GF(2), where each number is a vector in GF(2)^2, since the numbers are up to 4, which is 2^2.

Wait, 4 is 100 in binary, which is three bits, but since we're dealing with XOR, perhaps considering the binary representations could help.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of pairing numbers to cancel their XOR.

For example, if I have two identical numbers, their XOR is 0, which could be beneficial for Bob.

But with different numbers, their XOR combines differently.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the total XOR of all numbers and then see how removing numbers affects the XOR.

Let me denote the total XOR of all numbers as X.

Then, after removing one number y, the XOR of the remaining numbers is X ^ y.

So, Bob wins if X ^ y = 0, which implies y = X.

So, in the first removal, Eve can choose to remove y = X to make the remaining XOR 0.

But this only works if X is present in the sequence.

Wait, this seems promising.

So, in the first step:

- If X is present in the sequence, Eve can remove X, making the remaining XOR 0, so Bob wins this step.

- If X is not present, then no matter which number Eve removes, the remaining XOR is X ^ y, which is not 0 (since y != X), so Alice wins.

Then, for the next step, the new sequence has one less number, and Eve removes another number, and so on.

This seems like a recursive process, but it might be too slow for large n.

Given that t can be up to 10^4 and n can be up to 200*4=800, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Perhaps there is a pattern or a formula based on the counts of each number.

Let me consider that the numbers are only 1,2,3,4, and their XOR properties.

First, let's compute the total XOR X of all numbers:

X = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 4 ^ ... according to their counts.

Then, in the first step, if X is present in the sequence, Eve can remove X to make the remaining XOR 0, so Bob wins this step.

Otherwise, Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes one number, and the process continues.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the parity of the counts.

Wait, let's consider that each number contributes to the total XOR based on whether it appears an odd or even number of times.

So, if a number x appears an odd number of times, it is included in the total XOR; if even, it's not.

So, X is the XOR of all x where count[x] is odd.

Now, when Eve removes a number y, the new total XOR becomes X ^ y.

If y was appearing an odd number of times before removal, now it's even, so it's excluded from the XOR, hence X ^ y.

If y was appearing an even number of times before removal, now it's odd, so it's included in the XOR, hence X ^ y.

Wait, no: if y was appearing an odd number of times, removing one makes it even, so it's excluded from the XOR, hence X ^ y.

If y was appearing an even number of times, removing one makes it odd, so it's included in the XOR, hence X ^ y.

So, in both cases, removing y toggles its inclusion in the XOR, which is equivalent to XORing X with y again.

Hence, new XOR is X ^ y.

So, after removal, the XOR becomes X ^ y.

Bob wins if X ^ y = 0, which implies y = X.

So, in each step, if X is present in the sequence, Eve can choose to remove X, making the remaining XOR 0, so Bob wins this step.

Otherwise, Alice wins.

Then, the process repeats with the remaining sequence.

So, the question is, how many times can Eve make y = X in the sequence.

But this seems too simplistic, and it doesn't match with my earlier example where Bob seems to win only once, even though there are multiple opportunities.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that after each removal, the total XOR changes, and X is recalculated for the remaining sequence.

This seems more involved.

Let me try to think of a better way.

An alternative approach is to consider that Bob wins when the XOR of the current sequence is 0.

So, the number of times Bob wins is equal to the number of subsets of the sequence that have XOR = 0.

But no, that's not quite right, because we're considering a specific sequence of removals.

Wait, perhaps it's equal to the number of times the XOR of the sequence is 0 as we remove numbers one by one.

So, it's not about all possible subsets, but a specific path of removals.

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the counts of each number and see how they can be paired or canceled to achieve XOR = 0 at certain steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of times the total XOR is 0 during the process.

Given that, perhaps I can compute how many times the total XOR is 0 as we remove numbers one by one.

But I need to maximize this number by choosing which number to remove at each step.

This seems complicated.

Let me look for a pattern in the sample inputs and outputs.

First test case:

p = [1,1,1,0], n=3

Output: 1

Second test case:

p = [1,0,1,2], n=4

Output:1

Third test case:

p = [2,2,2,0], n=6

Output:3

Fourth test case:

p = [3,3,2,0], n=8

Output:3

Fifth test case:

p = [0,9,9,9], n=27

Output:12

Looking at these, it seems that the output is roughly n/2, but not exactly.

Wait, in the third test case, n=6, output=3; fourth test case, n=8, output=3; fifth test case, n=27, output=12.

So, it's not exactly n/2.

Perhaps it's floor(n/2), but for n=3, floor(3/2)=1, which matches the first test case.

For n=4, floor(4/2)=2, but output is 1.

So, not floor(n/2).

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of pairs of numbers that can be canceled.

Wait, if I have two identical numbers, their XOR is 0, which helps Bob.

So, perhaps for each pair of identical numbers, Bob can win once.

But in the first test case, there are no pairs, so Bob should win only when the total XOR is 0, which happens once (with all three numbers).

In the second test case, p=[1,0,1,2], so one 1, one 3, and two 4's.

Here, the two 4's can be paired to give XOR=0, so perhaps that's one win for Bob.

Then, with the remaining numbers 1,3, another removal can lead to XOR=0 in some way.

But the output is 1, which contradicts this.

Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps Bob can win if the total XOR is 0 at the start, and then again when the sequence is reduced to a certain point.

This is getting too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that Bob can win at most ceil(n/2) times, but that doesn't match the third test case where n=6 and output=3, which is exactly floor(n/2).

Wait, ceil(n/2) for n=6 is 3, which matches.

For n=8, ceil(8/2)=4, but output is 3.

So, not ceil(n/2).

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of times the total XOR is 0 during the process.

But in the first test case, with n=3, the total XOR is 0 only once (at the start with all three numbers), and once with the empty sequence.

But according to the output, it's 1.

So, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count.

Alternatively, maybe Bob can win at most once in sequences where the total XOR is 0 only at the beginning or at the end.

But in the third test case, with n=6, output=3, which suggests multiple wins for Bob.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have counts of 1,2,3,4 as a, b, c, d respectively.

Total numbers n = a + b + c + d.

I need to maximize the number of times Bob wins, i.e., the number of times the XOR of the current sequence is 0.

Given that, perhaps I can group the numbers in such a way that their XOR is 0.

For example, pairing numbers that XOR to 0.

But since the numbers are 1,2,3,4, their XOR pairs are:

- 1 ^ 3 = 2 ^ 4 = 0

- So, pairing 1 with 3 and 2 with 4 gives XOR=0.

So, for each such pair, Bob can win once.

But in the first test case, p=[1,1,1,0], which is one 1, one 2, one 3.

Here, 1 and 3 can be paired to give XOR=0, and 2 is left alone.

So, perhaps Bob can win once.

But according to my earlier analysis, Bob wins twice: with all three numbers and with the empty sequence.

However, the output is 1, which suggests that only one of these counts.

Perhaps the problem doesn't count the empty sequence.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation in the problem statement.

Looking back, the problem says "until the sequence of numbers is empty."

And "print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally."

So, it includes the empty sequence.

But in the first test case, output is 1, which suggests only one win for Bob.

Wait, maybe Bob can win only when the sequence has an even number of elements.

No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Bob can win at most floor((n+1)/2)) times.

For n=3, floor(4/2)=2, but output is 1.

Wait, perhaps not.

Looking at the fifth test case, n=27, floor((27+1)/2)=14, but output is 12.

So, not floor((n+1)/2)).

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of times the XOR is 0, which occurs when the XOR of the selected numbers is 0.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider the XOR properties more carefully.

Let me consider that the XOR of a subsequence is 0 if the XOR of the numbers with odd counts is 0.

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the XOR of the entire sequence and see how removing numbers affects it.

Given that, perhaps the number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times the total XOR is 0 during the process.

But in the first test case, the total XOR is 0 for the full sequence and for the empty sequence, but output is 1, so perhaps only one of them counts.

Maybe the problem doesn't count the empty sequence as a win for Bob.

But in the third test case, n=6, output=3.

If we consider that the empty sequence doesn't count, then perhaps it's floor(n/2).

For n=6, floor(6/2)=3, which matches.

For n=8, floor(8/2)=4, but output is 3.

So, not floor(n/2).

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(n/2) if n is even, and floor(n/2) if n is odd.

But n=3, floor(3/2)=1, matches output=1.

n=4, floor(4/2)=2, but output=1.

Wait, perhaps it's something else.

Let me consider that for each pair of numbers that XOR to 0, Bob can win once.

For example, 1 and 3 XOR to 0, 2 and 4 XOR to 0.

So, for each such pair, Bob can win once.

In the third test case, p=[2,2,2,0], so two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

So, we can pair 1 with 3, and 2 with 4, but there are no 4's, so only one pair of 1 and 3.

Wait, but output is 3, which doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of such pairs plus something else.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of pairs plus the number of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR 0.

This is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in each step, Eve can choose to remove a number that makes the XOR of the remaining sequence 0, if possible.

So, in each step, if the current XOR is present in the sequence, Eve can remove it to make the XOR 0.

Otherwise, she removes any number.

But this seems too simplistic.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let’s denote the sequence S with n numbers.

Let X be the XOR of all numbers in S.

If X is 0, Bob wins this step.

Eve removes one number y from S, and the new sequence has XOR X ^ y.

If X ^ y == 0, Bob wins again.

Otherwise, Alice wins.

This continues until no numbers are left.

Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

So, in each step, Eve should choose y such that X ^ y == 0, i.e., y == X, if possible.

If y == X is in the sequence, Eve removes it, and Bob wins this step.

If not, Eve removes any number, and Bob doesn't win this step.

Then, the process repeats with the new sequence.

Wait, but in the first test case, p=[1,1,1,0], n=3.

X = 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0.

So, Bob wins this step.

Then, Eve removes one number.

Suppose she removes 1.

Remaining numbers: 2 and 3.

X = 2 ^ 3 = 1.

Alice wins.

Then, Eve removes 2.

Remaining number: 3.

X = 3.

Alice wins.

Then, remove 3, empty sequence, X=0.

Bob wins.

So, total Bob wins twice.

But output is 1, which suggests that perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count.

Alternatively, maybe Bob can only win once per connected sequence.

Wait, perhaps Bob can only win once per removal phase.

Wait, perhaps Eve can only make Bob win once.

But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem counts only the non-empty sequence wins.

In that case, in the first test case, Bob wins only once (with all three numbers), and the empty sequence doesn't count.

But in the third test case, p=[2,2,2,0], n=6.

If we consider only non-empty sequences, and Bob wins when XOR=0.

Let's see:

- With 6 numbers: X=1^1^2^2^3^3=0, Bob wins.

- Remove one number, say 1.

- Remaining: 1,2,2,3,3.

- X=1^2^2^3^3=1.

- Alice wins.

- Remove another number, say 1.

- Remaining: 2,2,3,3.

- X=2^2^3^3=0.

- Bob wins.

- Remove another number, say 2.

- Remaining: 2,3,3.

- X=2^3^3=2.

- Alice wins.

- Remove another number, say 2.

- Remaining: 3,3.

- X=3^3=0.

- Bob wins.

- Remove another number, say 3.

- Remaining: 3.

- X=3.

- Alice wins.

- Remove the last 3, empty sequence.

- X=0.

- Bob wins.

So, Bob wins three times: with 6 numbers, with 4 numbers, with 2 numbers.

If the empty sequence doesn't count, then output should be 3, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the empty sequence doesn't count as a win for Bob.

But in the first test case, n=3, Bob wins with 3 numbers and with 0 numbers (empty sequence), but output is 1, which suggests that only the non-empty sequence wins count.

Therefore, perhaps Bob only wins when the non-empty sequence has XOR=0.

But in the third test case, n=6, output=3, which includes wins with 6,4,2 numbers.

So, perhaps it's floor(n/2).

For n=6, floor(6/2)=3, matches.

For n=4, floor(4/2)=2, but output=1 in the second test case.

Wait, perhaps it's floor((n+1)/2).

For n=3, floor(4/2)=2, but output=1.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of pairs that can be made to have XOR=0.

Since 1^3=0 and 2^4=0, pairs of 1 and 3, or 2 and 4, can be removed together to make XOR=0.

So, for each such pair, Bob can win once.

In the third test case, p=[2,2,2,0], so two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

So, we can pair one 1 with one 3, and one 2 with one 4 (but there are no 4's), so only one pair of 1 and 3.

But output is 3, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that pairs can be removed in a specific order.

Wait, perhaps it's the number of times we can make the XOR=0 by removing pairs that XOR to 0.

But this seems too vague.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the number of times we can make the XOR=0 by removing numbers in a way that maximizes Bob's wins.

Given that, perhaps it's equal to the number of pairs of numbers that XOR to 0.

But in this problem, only 1^3=0 and 2^4=0.

So, for each pair of 1 and 3, and each pair of 2 and 4, Bob can win once.

In the third test case, p=[2,2,2,0], so two 1's, two 2's, two 3's.

So, we can make one pair of 1 and 3, and another pair of 1 and 3, but only one pair corresponds to XOR=0.

Wait, 1^3=0, so pairing one 1 with one 3 makes XOR=0.

Similarly, another pairing of 1 and 3 makes XOR=0 again.

But there are two such pairs possible, so Bob can win twice.

But the output is 3, which suggests that there is another win for Bob.

Perhaps I need to consider the empty sequence as well.

Wait, but in the third test case, output is 3, which matches the number of pairs plus something else.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the number of times the total XOR is 0 during the process.

Given that, perhaps it's equal to the number of times the cumulative XOR is a specific value.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for a different pattern.

Looking at the sample inputs and outputs:

Test case 1:

p=[1,1,1,0], n=3

Output:1

Test case 2:

p=[1,0,1,2], n=4

Output:1

Test case 3:

p=[2,2,2,0], n=6

Output:3

Test case 4:

p=[3,3,2,0], n=8

Output:3

Test case 5:

p=[0,9,9,9], n=27

Output:12

Looking at these, perhaps the output is the floor of the sum of the minimum of pairs.

For example, in test case 3, min(a,c)=min(2,2)=2, and min(b,d)=min(2,0)=0, so total 2+0=2, but output is 3.

Wait, perhaps it's the floor of (a+c)/2 + floor(b+d)/2.

In test case 3, floor((2+2)/2)=2 + floor((2+0)/2)=1, total 3, which matches.

In test case 4, p=[3,3,2,0], floor((3+2)/2)=2 + floor((3+0)/2)=1, total 3, matches.

In test case 5, p=[0,9,9,9], floor((0+9)/2)=4 + floor((9+9)/2)=9, total 13, but output is 12.

Wait, doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2).

In test case 3, floor(2/2)=1 + floor(2/2)=1 + floor(2/2)=1 + floor(0/2)=0, total 3, matches.

In test case 4, floor(3/2)=1 + floor(3/2)=1 + floor(2/2)=1 + floor(0/2)=0, total 3, matches.

In test case 5, floor(0/2)=0 + floor(9/2)=4 + floor(9/2)=4 + floor(9/2)=4, total 12, matches.

In test case 1, floor(1/2)=0 + floor(1/2)=0 + floor(1/2)=0 + floor(0/2)=0, total 0, but output is 1.

Doesn't match.

In test case 2, p=[1,0,1,2], floor(1/2)=0 + floor(0/2)=0 + floor(1/2)=0 + floor(2/2)=1, total 1, matches.

So, in test case 1, this approach gives 0, but output is 1.

So, perhaps there is an additional condition.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2) plus some condition when the total XOR is 0.

In test case 1, floor(1/2)=0 + floor(1/2)=0 + floor(1/2)=0 + floor(0/2)=0, total 0, but output is 1.

So, perhaps if the total XOR is 0, add 1.

In this case, p=[1,1,1,0], X=1^2^3=0, so add 1, total 1, matches output.

In test case 3, p=[2,2,2,0], X=1^1^2^2^3^3=0, so add 1 to the previous sum of 3, making it 4, but output is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), and if the total XOR is 0, add 1.

In test case 1, floor sums to 0, plus 1 (since X=0), total 1, matches.

In test case 2, floor sums to 1, plus 0 (since X=1^3^4^4=1^3^0=2, not 0), total 1, matches.

In test case 3, floor sums to 3, plus 1 (since X=0), total 4, but output is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's the minimum of the floor sums and the number of times X=0.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus 1 if the total XOR is 0 and the number of elements is odd.

But in test case 1, n=3 (odd), X=0, so add 1 to floor sums (0), total 1, matches.

In test case 3, n=6 (even), X=0, not sure.

Wait, perhaps only add 1 if n is odd and X=0.

In test case 3, n=6 (even), X=0, so don't add 1, total floor sums=3, matches output=3.

In test case 5, n=27 (odd), X=9*2^0 XOR 9*2^1 XOR 9*2^2 = 1 XOR 2 XOR 3 = 0, so add 1 to floor sums=12, total 13, but output is 12.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's just floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), regardless of the total XOR.

In test case 1, floor sums=0, output=1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus ceil(total_XOR_to_0).

But this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe I need to accept that the correct approach is to calculate floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), and that's the answer.

In test case 1, it gives 0, but output is 1, so it's incorrect.

But in most test cases, it matches.

Wait, perhaps the initial test case is an exception.

But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus 1 if a + c is even and b + d is even.

In test case 1, a + c =1 +1=2 (even), b + d =1 +0=1 (odd), so no additional 1, total 0, but output is 1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus 1 if the total XOR is 0 and the number of elements is odd or something.

This is getting too complicated.

Maybe I need to accept that the correct answer is floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), and that the first test case is an exception due to some reason.

But in the first test case, p=[1,1,1,0], floor sums=0, but output is 1.

Perhaps there is an additional condition when a + c and b + d are both odd.

In this case, a + c =1 +1=2 (even), b + d=1 +0=1 (odd), so perhaps no additional 1.

But output is 1, which doesn't match.

This is too confusing.

Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Let me consider that Eve can choose to remove numbers in such a way as to maximize the number of times the remaining sequence has XOR=0.

Perhaps this can be achieved by removing pairs of numbers that XOR to 0.

For example, removing a 1 and a 3 together, or a 2 and a 4 together.

Each such removal allows Bob to win once.

In the third test case, p=[2,2,2,0], so we can remove one pair of 1 and 3, making XOR=0, then another pair of 1 and 3, making XOR=0 again, and so on.

But in this case, with two 1's and two 3's, we can make two pairs, but output is 3.

Wait, perhaps there is an additional win from the remaining sequence.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus the number of times the remaining sequence has XOR=0 after removing these pairs.

But this seems too vague.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the intended solution is to calculate floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), and that's the answer.

In most test cases, this matches the output.

In the first test case, it gives 0, but output is 1, which suggests that there is an additional condition.

Perhaps, if after removing floor(a/2) pairs of 1 and 3, and floor(b/2) pairs of 2 and 4, the remaining sequence has XOR=0, then add 1.

In the first test case, after removing floor(1/2)=0 pairs of 1 and 3, and floor(1/2)=0 pairs of 2 and 4, the remaining sequence is 1,2,3, which has XOR=0, so add 1, total 1, matches output.

In the third test case, floor(2/2)=1 pair of 1 and 3, and floor(2/2)=1 pair of 2 and 4, but there are no 4's, so only 1 pair of 1 and 3 can be removed.

After removing one pair of 1 and 3, remaining sequence is one 1, two 2's, one 3.

XOR is 1 ^ 2 ^ 2 ^ 3 =1 ^ 0 ^ 3=1 ^ 3=2.

Not zero, so no additional win.

So, total floor sums=1 (from pairs), plus 0, total 1, but output is 3.

Wait, doesn't match.

I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus 1 if the remaining sequence has XOR=0.

But in the third test case, floor sums=1, plus 0 (since remaining XOR !=0), total 1, but output is 3.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the answer is floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus the number of times the remaining sequence has XOR=0 after removing these pairs.

But in the third test case, after removing one pair of 1 and 3, remaining sequence is one 1, two 2's, one 3.

XOR=1^2^2^3=1^0^3=1^3=2 !=0.

So, no additional win.

Hence, total 1, but output is 3.

This suggests that the approach is incorrect.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I should accept that the answer is floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), and that the first test case is an exception due to some reason.

But in that case, in the first test case, p=[1,1,1,0], floor sums=0, but output is 1.

So, perhaps the answer is floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2) + floor(d/2), plus 1 if a + c and b + d are both odd.

In test case 1, a + c =1 +1=2 (even), b + d=1 +0=1 (odd), so no additional 1, total 0, but output is 1.

Doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's floor(a/2) + floor(b/2) + floor(c/2)
