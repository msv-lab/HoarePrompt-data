Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a binary string, which means it only contains '0's and '1's. I need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut this string into, such that I can rearrange these pieces to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string is one where all the '0's come before any '1's. Make sense.

First, I need to understand what a "piece" is. A piece is a contiguous substring of the original string. So, if I have a string like "11010", and I cut it into "11", "0", and "10", those are my pieces, and I can rearrange them in any order to form a sorted string, which would be "0011" in this case.

The goal is to minimize the number of such pieces. So, I need to find the least number of cuts to make these pieces rearrangeable into a sorted string.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to think about it is to identify sections of the string that are already in the desired order or can be grouped together to help achieve the sorted order with minimal cuts.

Let's consider some examples to get a better understanding.

Example 1:

Input: "11010"

Output: 3

Explanation: One possible way is to cut it into "11", "0", and "10". Then, rearrange them as "0", "11", and "10". But wait, "10" needs to be split further to get "0" and "1", so maybe that's not the best way.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of times the string changes from '1' to '0' or vice versa.

Let me look at the string "11010". It goes:

1 -> 1: no change

1 -> 0: change from '1' to '0'

0 -> 1: change from '0' to '1'

1 -> 0: change from '1' to '0'

So, there are two places where it changes from '1' to '0' or '0' to '1'. Maybe the number of such changes indicates the number of cuts needed.

But in the example, the output is 3, which is one more than the number of changes (2). Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to add one to the number of changes to get the number of pieces.

Let's test this hypothesis with other examples.

Example 2:

Input: "00000000"

Output: 1

Explanation: The string is already sorted, so no cuts are needed.

Number of changes: 0

Number of pieces: 1

So, 0 changes + 1 = 1 piece. That matches.

Example 3:

Input: "1"

Output: 1

Explanation: Only one character, so one piece.

Number of changes: 0

0 + 1 = 1 piece. Matches.

Example 4:

Input: "10"

Output: 2

Explanation: Need to cut between '1' and '0' to get "1" and "0", then rearrange to "01".

Number of changes: 1 (from '1' to '0')

1 + 1 = 2 pieces. Matches.

Example 5:

Input: "0001111"

Output: 1

Explanation: Already sorted, so one piece.

Number of changes: 0

0 + 1 = 1 piece. Matches.

Example 6:

Input: "0110"

Output: 2

Number of changes: 1 (from '1' to '0')

1 + 1 = 2 pieces. Matches.

Wait, in the first example, the output is 3, but according to this, it should be 2 (since number of changes is 2, 2 + 1 = 3). But in other examples, it seems to be number of changes plus one.

Wait, maybe I need to count the number of '10' substrings, which indicate a decrease.

In "11010", there are two '10' substrings.

In "10", there is one '10'.

In "0110", there is one '10'.

In "0001111", there are no '10's.

So, perhaps the number of '10' substrings indicates the number of cuts needed.

Wait, in the first example, it's two '10's, and the output is 3.

So, maybe it's number of '10's plus one.

Yes, that matches all the examples above.

Wait, but in "11010", there are two '10's, and output is 3 (2 + 1).

In "10", one '10', output is 2 (1 + 1).

In "0110", one '10', output is 2 (1 + 1).

In "0001111", no '10', output is 1 (0 + 1).

Seems consistent.

So, the formula seems to be: number of '10' substrings plus one.

But let's think about why this works.

A '10' substring indicates a point where a '1' is followed by a '0', which is out of order for a sorted binary string. To fix this, we need to cut here and rearrange the pieces.

Each '10' suggests a separation point where we should cut the string to rearrange the pieces.

However, in the first example, "11010", there are two '10's, and the output is 3, which would mean two cuts to make three pieces.

Wait, but in that case, cutting after the first '1' and after the second '1' would give "1", "10", and "10". Then, rearranging them as "0", "1", "10", which is "0110", which is sorted.

Wait, but "0110" is not sorted because it has '1's after '0's. Wait, no, "0110" is not sorted. Wait, sorted should be all '0's before '1's, like "0011".

So, perhaps my earlier thought is incorrect.

Wait, maybe I need to count the number of times the string goes from '1' to '0', indicating an inversion that needs to be fixed by cutting.

In "11010", there are two such points: between the second '1' and '0', and between '1' and '0' at the end.

So, two cuts are needed to separate these inversions.

But the output is 3, which would correspond to two cuts making three pieces.

So, perhaps the number of '10' substrings indicates the number of cuts needed.

Wait, in "10", there is one '10', and output is 2, which would mean one cut to make two pieces.

In "0110", there is one '10', output is 2.

In "0001111", no '10', output is 1.

In "11010", two '10's, output is 3.

Seems consistent.

So, the number of '10's in the string seems to directly give the number of cuts needed, and hence, the number of pieces is number of '10's plus one.

Because each '10' requires a cut, and the number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts.

Therefore, the formula is: number of '10's in the string plus one.

But let's verify this with another example.

Suppose the string is "101010". This has three '10's.

According to this formula, number of pieces should be 4.

Rearranging, we can cut it into "10", "10", "10", which are three pieces, but to make it sorted, we need to arrange them as "000111", which would require cutting into four pieces: "1", "0", "1", "010". Wait, not sure.

Wait, maybe cutting into "1", "0", "1", "0", "1", "0", and then arrange them as "0 0 0 1 1 1". That would require five pieces, which contradicts the formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is not simply counting '10's plus one.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me think about the problem again.

We need to cut the string into pieces such that we can rearrange these pieces to get a sorted binary string, which means all '0's before '1's.

So, in the final arrangement, all pieces starting with '0' should be before pieces starting with '1'.

Also, within the '0'-starting pieces, their internal order should be maintained, and same for '1'-starting pieces.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the number of times the string switches from '1' to '0' in a way that disrupts the sorted order.

Let me consider the string "11010".

Possible cuts:

- Cut before each '0' that follows a '1'.

So, in "11010", I see '110' and '10'. But that's not optimal.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum number of '1's that come after '0's in a way that requires separation.

This is getting confusing.

Let me look at the provided program and see what it's doing.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, reads the string, and then iterates through the string, counting the number of times '1' is followed by '0' and the number of times '0' is followed by '1'.

It counts cut1 for '10' and cut0 for '01'.

Then, if cut0 is 0, it prints cut1 + 1, else it prints cut0 + cut1.

Wait, in the first example, "11010", it has two '10's and one '01', so cut1 = 2, cut0 = 1, and since cut0 is not 0, it prints cut0 + cut1 = 3, which matches the expected output.

In the second example, "00000000", cut1 = 0, cut0 = 0, so it prints 1, which is correct.

In the third example, "1", cut1 = 0, cut0 = 0, prints 1, correct.

Fourth example, "10", cut1 = 1, cut0 = 0, prints cut1 + 1 = 2, correct.

Fifth example, "0001111", cut1 = 0, cut0 = 0, prints 1, correct.

Sixth example, "0110", cut1 = 1, cut0 = 0, prints cut1 + 1 = 2, which matches.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in "0110", there is one '10', which according to my initial hypothesis would require one cut, resulting in two pieces, which matches the output.

But in "11010", there are two '10's and one '01', totaling three cuts, which matches the output of 3.

So, the program seems to be correctly implementing the logic of counting the number of '10's and '01's and adding them up, with a special case when there are no '01's.

Wait, why is there a special case when cut0 is 0?

Let me think about that.

If cut0 is 0, that means there are no '01's in the string, which implies that all '0's are before any '1's, or there are only '0's or only '1's.

In such cases, the string is already sorted, or can be sorted by just ensuring that any '1's are after '0's.

Hence, in this case, the number of pieces needed is cut1 + 1.

Wait, but in "11010", cut0 is not 0, so it's cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3.

In "0110", cut0 is 0, cut1 is 1, so cut1 + 1 = 2.

Wait, no, in "0110", cut0 should be 0 (since there's no '01'), and cut1 is 1 (since there's one '10'), so it prints 1 + 1 = 2, which is correct.

In "11010", cut0 is 1 (since there's one '01'), and cut1 is 2 (two '10's), so cut0 + cut1 = 3, which is correct.

So, the logic seems sound.

But why add 1 when cut0 is 0?

Because if there are no '01's, it means the string is either already sorted or can be sorted by just separating the '1's from '0's at the point where '1's start.

Hence, the number of pieces needed is cut1 + 1.

For example, in "110", cut1 is 1 (one '10'), cut0 is 0, so pieces needed are 1 + 1 = 2: "11" and "0".

Similarly, in "10", cut1 is 1, cut0 is 0, pieces needed are 2: "1" and "0".

In "0001111", cut1 is 0, cut0 is 0, pieces needed are 1.

In "1", cut1 is 0, cut0 is 0, pieces needed are 1.

In "0", cut1 is 0, cut0 is 0, pieces needed are 1.

Seems consistent.

So, the program seems to be correctly implementing this logic.

Hence, I would say that the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
