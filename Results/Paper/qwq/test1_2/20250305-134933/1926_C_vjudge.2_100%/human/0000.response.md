Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to n on the board and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. After that, I need to find the sum of these new numbers.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. For a given n, I have to calculate the sum of the sums of digits of all numbers from 1 to n. For example, if n is 12, the sum of the digits is 1 + 2 = 3, but wait, no. The problem says he replaces each integer with the sum of its digits, so for each number from 1 to 12, I need to find the sum of its digits and then sum all those up.

Let me take n=12 as an example. The numbers are 1 to 12. Their digit sums are:

1: 1

2: 2

3: 3

4: 4

5: 5

6: 6

7: 7

8: 8

9: 9

10: 1+0=1

11: 1+1=2

12: 1+2=3

Now, summing these up: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3 = 51, which matches the example.

So, the task is to compute the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n, and do this for multiple test cases efficiently, given that n can be up to 2*10^5 and there can be up to 10^4 test cases.

Efficiency is key here because with t=10^4 and n=2*10^5, a naive approach for each test case would be too slow. Calculating digit sums individually for each number in each test case would result in a time complexity of O(t*n), which is 2*10^10 operations, way beyond the time limit.

I need a smarter way to compute this sum quickly. One approach could be precomputing the sum of digit sums up to each possible n and then answering each test case in O(1) time by just looking up the precomputed value.

Let me think about how to precompute this. I can create an array where pd[i] represents the sum of digit sums from 1 to i. Then, for each test case, I can just output pd[n].

To build the pd array efficiently, I need to compute pd[i] for all i from 1 to 2*10^5. I can do this by iterating from 1 to n and for each i, adding the digit sum of i to pd[i-1].

But wait, calculating the digit sum for each i individually in a loop up to 2*10^5 might still be too slow because converting each number to a string and summing its digits could be time-consuming for large n.

I need a faster way to compute the sum of digit sums up to n.

Let me think about the properties of digit sums. The sum of digits of a number is the sum of each of its digits in its decimal representation.

Maybe there's a mathematical formula to compute the sum of digit sums from 1 to n without having to iterate through each number.

I recall that the sum of digits from 1 to n can be calculated using mathematical patterns, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Perhaps I should look for a pattern or derive one.

Alternatively, since n can be up to 2*10^5, and t up to 10^4, I need an approach that is at least O(n) for precomputation and O(1) per test case.

Given that, maybe precomputing is acceptable, but I need to optimize the digit sum calculation.

Let me consider optimizing the digit sum calculation. Instead of converting each number to a string and summing its digits, which is O(log i) per i, maybe there's a way to compute the sum of digit sums more efficiently.

One idea is to iterate through each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) and calculate the contribution of that digit place to the total sum.

For example, for the units place, from 1 to n, the units digits cycle every 10 numbers: 0 through 9, then repeat.

Similarly, for the tens place, the digits cycle every 100 numbers, and so on.

By calculating the contribution of each digit place separately, I can sum them up to get the total sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

This seems promising. Let's try to formalize this.

Letâ€™s define a function that calculates the sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

To do this, we can consider each digit place separately and calculate its contribution to the total sum.

For the units place:

- Every 10 numbers, the units digits sum to 0+1+2+...+9 = 45.

- So, for the first floor(n/10) full cycles, the sum is floor(n/10) * 45.

- Then, for the remaining n % 10 numbers, the sum is 0+1+...+(n%10-1).

Similarly, for the tens place:

- Each digit in the tens place contributes its value multiplied by the number of times it appears.

- In each 100 numbers, the tens digit cycles from 0 to 9, and each digit appears 10 times (e.g., 10-19 have 1 in the tens place).

- So, for the tens place, the sum for full hundreds is floor(n/100) * (0+1+...+9) * 10 = floor(n/100) * 45 * 10.

- Then, for the remaining floor(n/10) % 10 numbers, the tens digit is floor(n/10) % 10, and they appear n%100 +1 times.

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

I found a reference to a similar problem where the sum of digits from 1 to n is calculated by considering each digit place separately and calculating their contributions.

Here's a general approach:

1. For each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.), calculate the sum of digits in that place across all numbers from 1 to n.

2. Sum these contributions for all digit places to get the total sum of digit sums from 1 to n.

To calculate the sum for a specific digit place:

Let's denote:

- place: the current digit place (1 for units, 10 for tens, 100 for hundreds, etc.).

- sum_place: the sum of digits in this place across all numbers from 1 to n.

We can calculate sum_place as follows:

- full_cycles = floor(n / (place * 10))

- sum_full_cycles = full_cycles * (0 + 1 + ... + 9) * (place)

- remainder = n % (place * 10)

- sum_remainder = sum of digits in the current place for the numbers from full_cycles * place * 10 to n

- sum_place = sum_full_cycles + sum_remainder

We need to handle sum_remainder carefully.

This seems a bit involved, but it should be efficient enough for precomputing up to n=2*10^5.

Alternatively, since n is up to 2*10^5, and t is up to 10^4, precomputing the sum of digit sums up to each n and storing it in an array should be feasible, as 2*10^5 is manageable.

Let's consider the memory and time constraints.

- Space: An array of size 2*10^5+1 to store the precomputed sums.

- Time: Precomputing up to 2*10^5, which is acceptable.

Given that, implementing precomputation seems feasible.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1

t = int(input())

pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]

for i in range(1, N):

pd[i] += pd[i - 1]

for j in str(i):

pd[i] += int(j)

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

print(pd[n])

This program precomputes the sum of digit sums from 1 to n and stores it in pd[n]. Then, for each test case, it reads n and prints pd[n].

Let's verify if this approach is correct.

First, pd[0] is 0.

For i from 1 to N-1:

pd[i] = pd[i-1] + sum of digits of i

So, pd[i] accumulates the sum of digit sums from 1 to i.

This seems correct.

Let me check with n=12.

pd[1] = 0 + 1 = 1

pd[2] = 1 + 2 = 3

pd[3] = 3 + 3 = 6

pd[4] = 6 + 4 = 10

pd[5] = 10 + 5 = 15

pd[6] = 15 + 6 = 21

pd[7] = 21 + 7 = 28

pd[8] = 28 + 8 = 36

pd[9] = 36 + 9 = 45

pd[10] = 45 + 1 + 0 = 46

pd[11] = 46 + 1 + 1 = 48

pd[12] = 48 + 1 + 2 = 51

Which matches the example.

So, the precomputation seems correct.

Now, considering the time constraints.

- Precomputing up to 2*10^5:

- For each i from 1 to 2*10^5:

- Convert i to string: O(log i)

- Sum the digits: O(log i)

- Total precomputation time: O(n * log n), which for n=2*10^5 is acceptable.

- Then, for t=10^4 test cases, each answered in O(1) time, which is fine.

Therefore, the program seems correct and efficient enough.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{51} \]
