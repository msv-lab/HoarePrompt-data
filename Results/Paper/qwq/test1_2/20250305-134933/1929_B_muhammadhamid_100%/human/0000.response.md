Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Sasha wants to color some cells in an n by n grid, and he wants at least k diagonals to have at least one colored cell. The goal is to do this with the fewest number of colored cells possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a diagonal in this grid. In a square grid, there are two types of diagonals: the main diagonals that run from the top-left to bottom-right and the anti-diagonals that run from the top-right to bottom-left.

For a grid of size n, the number of main diagonals is n, and the number of anti-diagonals is also n. So, in total, there are 2n diagonals. But wait, the problem says there are 4n - 2 diagonals. That seems off.

Let me think about it. In an n x n grid, the number of diagonals that run from the top-left to bottom-right is equal to 2n - 1, and similarly, the number of diagonals that run from the top-right to bottom-left is also 2n - 1. So, in total, there are 4n - 2 diagonals.

Okay, that makes sense. So, for example, in a 3x3 grid, there would be 4*3 - 2 = 10 diagonals, which matches the example provided.

Now, the problem is to color the minimum number of cells such that at least k of these 4n - 2 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

I need to find a way to select cells to color in such a way that they cover as many diagonals as possible, maximizing the coverage per cell.

Let's consider that each cell lies on exactly one diagonal of each type: one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

So, each cell is part of two diagonals: one main and one anti.

Therefore, coloring a single cell will cover two diagonals: one main and one anti.

Unless the cell is on the main diagonal or the anti-diagonal, in which case it might be part of only one diagonal.

Wait, no. Actually, every cell is part of one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal, regardless of its position.

For example, in a 3x3 grid:

- Cell (1,1) is on main diagonal 1 and anti-diagonal 3.

- Cell (1,2) is on main diagonal 2 and anti-diagonal 2.

- Cell (1,3) is on main diagonal 3 and anti-diagonal 1.

- Cell (2,1) is on main diagonal 2 and anti-diagonal 3.

- And so on.

So, each cell covers exactly two diagonals, except for the cells that are on both main and anti-diagonals, which would cover only one diagonal.

Wait, actually, no. In a square grid, the main diagonal is where row index equals column index, and the anti-diagonal is where row index plus column index equals n+1.

So, only the center cell in odd-sized grids would be on both diagonals.

But in general, most cells are on exactly two diagonals.

So, to maximize the number of diagonals covered, it's best to color cells that cover two diagonals.

However, if we need to cover all diagonals, we might need to color cells that cover only one diagonal, like the center cell in odd-sized grids.

But in this problem, we don't necessarily need to cover all diagonals, just at least k of them.

So, the strategy should be to color cells that cover as many unique diagonals as possible.

Each new cell should cover diagonals that are not yet covered by previously colored cells.

So, the first cell covers two diagonals, the second covers two more, and so on, until we've covered enough diagonals.

Wait, but sometimes coloring a cell might cover diagonals that are already covered by previous cells, so we need to be careful to maximize the unique coverage.

This sounds like a problem that can be modeled using maximum matching or something similar, but that might be too complex for an n up to 1e8.

We need an efficient way to compute the minimum number of cells needed.

Let's think about it differently.

Suppose we have k diagonals that need to be covered.

Each cell can cover at most two diagonals.

So, in the best case, each cell covers two new diagonals.

Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

But wait, is that always possible?

Is there a way to color cells such that each cell covers two previously uncovered diagonals until we've covered k diagonals?

Not necessarily, because there might be dependencies between the diagonals.

For example, if two diagonals intersect at a single cell, then coloring that cell would cover both diagonals at once.

But if the diagonals don't intersect, then we need to color at least two different cells to cover them.

So, it's not always possible to have each cell cover two new diagonals.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let's consider the total number of diagonals: 4n - 2.

We need to cover at least k of them with the fewest cells.

Each cell covers exactly two diagonals, except for cells that lie on both main and anti-diagonals, which would cover only one diagonal.

But in general, most cells cover two diagonals.

So, in the best-case scenario, each cell covers two new diagonals.

Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed would be ceil(k / 2).

But in some cases, this might not be achievable because of overlapping diagonals.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by a certain number of cells.

If I color m cells, what is the maximum number of diagonals they can cover?

Each cell can cover up to two diagonals, so m cells can cover up to 2m diagonals.

But due to overlaps, the actual number might be less.

But in the best case, it's 2m.

So, to cover k diagonals, we need m such that 2m >= k, which implies m >= ceil(k / 2).

Therefore, the minimum number of cells needed is at least ceil(k / 2).

But is this always achievable?

In other words, can we always find a set of ceil(k / 2) cells that cover at least k diagonals?

I think so, but I need to confirm.

Let me consider some examples.

Take n = 3, k = 4.

According to the formula, ceil(4 / 2) = 2.

In the example, it's possible to color 2 cells and cover 4 diagonals.

Another example: n = 3, k = 10.

Ceil(10 / 2) = 5.

But in the example, it outputs 6.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Hmm, so maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Let me check the example again.

For n = 3, k = 10, which is the total number of diagonals, 4*3 - 2 = 10.

The output is 6, not ceil(10 / 2) = 5.

So, in this case, ceil(k / 2) is not sufficient to cover all diagonals.

Therefore, my initial assumption is incorrect.

So, what's the issue here?

Maybe because some diagonals share cells, and therefore, it's not possible to cover all diagonals with just ceil(k / 2) cells.

In the case where k is equal to the total number of diagonals, we need to cover all diagonals.

In the n = 3 case, total diagonals are 10, and the minimum number of cells needed is 6, not 5.

So, my initial approach is insufficient.

I need a better way to calculate the minimum number of cells required.

Let's think about the structure of the grid and the diagonals.

In an n x n grid, there are 2n - 1 main diagonals and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals, totaling 4n - 2 diagonals.

But some of these diagonals may share cells, so covering one diagonal may help cover another.

I need to find a way to select cells such that they cover the required number of diagonals with minimal overlap.

This sounds like a set cover problem, which is NP-hard, but for large n (up to 1e8), we need a more efficient approach.

Perhaps there's a mathematical formula or pattern that can be exploited here.

Let me consider small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.

For n = 2:

Total diagonals: 4*2 - 2 = 6.

Possible k values: 1 to 6.

- k = 1: color 1 cell, covers 2 diagonals.

- k = 2: ceil(2/2) = 1, but 1 cell covers 2 diagonals, which is enough for k=2.

- k = 3: ceil(3/2) = 2.

- k = 4: ceil(4/2) = 2.

- k = 5: ceil(5/2) = 3.

- k = 6: ceil(6/2) = 3.

But according to the sample input, for n=2, k=3, the output is 2.

Wait, in the sample input, n=2, k=3, output is 2.

But according to my calculation, ceil(3/2)=2, which matches.

Wait, but earlier for n=3, k=10, ceil(10/2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, the formula doesn't hold in that case.

Maybe there's an adjustment needed when k is large.

Perhaps when k exceeds a certain threshold, more cells are needed.

Let me think about the maximum number of diagonals that can be covered by m cells.

Each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals, so m cells can cover up to 2m diagonals.

But in reality, due to overlaps, the actual number covered might be less.

So, to cover k diagonals, we need m such that 2m >= k, but sometimes m = ceil(k / 2) is not sufficient.

As in the n=3, k=10 case, ceil(10 / 2)=5, but the sample output is 6.

So, perhaps there is an additional condition or adjustment needed.

Maybe related to the total number of diagonals or the structure of the grid.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula changes based on the value of k relative to n.

Let me consider different ranges of k.

Case 1: k <= 2n - 1

In this case, we might be able to cover k diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells, since each cell can cover 2 diagonals.

Case 2: 2n - 1 < k <= 4n - 2

In this case, covering additional diagonals might require more cells.

Wait, perhaps the formula needs to be adjusted based on whether k is less than or equal to 2n - 1 or greater than that.

Let me check for n=3:

- Total diagonals: 10.

- For k <= 4 (since 2*3 - 1 = 5, but let's see):

- k=4: ceil(4 / 2) = 2, which matches the sample.

- k=5: ceil(5 / 2) = 3.

- k=6: ceil(6 / 2) = 3.

- k=7: ceil(7 / 2) = 4.

- k=8: ceil(8 / 2) = 4.

- k=9: ceil(9 / 2) = 5.

- k=10: ceil(10 / 2) = 5.

But the sample for n=3, k=10, output is 6, which doesn't match ceil(10 / 2)=5.

So, perhaps there's an additional +1 in some cases.

Maybe when k is greater than some value, we need to add an extra cell.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the number of main and anti-diagonals.

Let me consider that there are 2n - 1 main and 2n - 1 anti-diagonals.

So, total diagonals are 4n - 2.

If k is less than or equal to 2n - 1, then we can cover k diagonals with ceil(k / 2) cells, since each cell can cover one main and one anti-diagonal.

But if k > 2n - 1, then we might need to cover some diagonals that are already covered by previous cells, hence requiring more cells.

Wait, perhaps when k > 2n - 1, we need to add extra cells to cover the remaining diagonals.

Let me try to come up with a formula.

Let me denote m as the minimum number of cells needed.

If k <= 2n - 1, then m = ceil(k / 2).

If k > 2n - 1, then m = ceil((k + 1) / 2).

Wait, for n=3, k=10, ceil((10 + 1)/2)=6, which matches the sample output.

Similarly, for n=3, k=9, ceil((9 + 1)/2)=5, which matches the sample output.

For n=3, k=4, ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=3, k=3, ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=4, k=7, ceil((7 + 1)/2)=4, which matches the sample output.

For n=7, k=11, ceil((11 + 1)/2)=6, which matches.

For n=2, k=3, ceil((3 + 1)/2)=2, which matches.

So, it seems that the formula is:

If k <= 2n - 1, then m = ceil(k / 2).

Else, m = ceil((k + 1) / 2).

Wait, but for n=2, k=3, 3 <= 2*2 - 1 = 3, so m = ceil(3 / 2)=2.

For n=3, k=10, 10 > 2*3 - 1=5, so m = ceil((10 + 1)/2)=6.

This seems consistent with the sample inputs.

So, the condition should be if k <= 2n - 1, then m = ceil(k / 2), else m = ceil((k + 1)/2).

Wait, but in the sample input, for n=3, k=9, m=5, which is ceil(9 / 2)=5, but according to the formula, since k > 2n - 1=5, m=ceil((9 + 1)/2)=5, which matches.

Similarly, for k=10, m=6, which is ceil((10 + 1)/2)=6.

For k=4, which is <= 5, m=ceil(4 / 2)=2.

For k=3, which is <=5, m=ceil(3 / 2)=2.

For n=4, k=7, 7 <= 2*4 -1=7, so m=ceil(7 / 2)=4.

For n=7, k=11, 11 > 2*7 -1=13, but wait, 11 <= 13?

Wait, 2n -1 for n=7 is 13, so k=11 <=13, so m=ceil(11 / 2)=6.

But in the sample input, for n=7, k=11, output is 6, which matches.

Wait, but according to my earlier formula, if k <= 2n -1, m=ceil(k / 2), else ceil((k +1)/2).

But for n=7, k=11 <=13, so m=ceil(11 / 2)=6.

If k=14, which is >13, m=ceil((14 +1)/2)=7.

But in the sample inputs, k=11 for n=7 is within the limit, so it's fine.

Another way to think about it is:

The grid has 2n -1 main diagonals and 2n -1 anti-diagonals.

To cover k diagonals, if k <= 2n -1, we can cover them with ceil(k / 2) cells, since each cell covers one main and one anti-diagonal.

But if k > 2n -1, we need to cover some diagonals that are either main or anti-diagonals, but not both.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of bipartite matching, where one part is main diagonals and the other is anti-diagonals.

Each cell connects a main diagonal to an anti-diagonal.

This is getting complicated.

Given the time constraints, perhaps the formula I derived earlier is sufficient.

So, in code, for each test case, read n and k.

If k <= 2n -1, then m = ceil(k / 2).

Else, m = ceil((k +1)/2).

But let's verify this formula with the sample inputs.

Sample Input:

7

3 4 → output 2 → 2 <= 5, ceil(4/2)=2

3 3 → output 2 → 3 <=5, ceil(3/2)=2

3 10 → output 6 → 10 >5, ceil(11/2)=6

3 9 → output 5 → 9 >5, ceil(10/2)=5

4 7 → output 4 → 7 <=7, ceil(7/2)=4

7 11 → output 6 → 11 <=13, ceil(11/2)=6

2 3 → output 2 → 3 <=3, ceil(3/2)=2

All match.

So, the formula seems correct.

Now, implement this in code.

We need to handle multiple test cases, read n and k, and output the minimum number of cells m according to the formula.

Edge cases to consider:

- k=1: Should output 1, since ceil(1/2)=1.

- k=2n -1: ceil((2n-1)/2).

- k=4n -2: ceil((4n -2 +1)/2)=ceil(4n -1)/2).

We need to make sure that the formula handles these cases correctly.

Also, since n can be up to 1e8 and t up to 1000, we need an efficient implementation.

Using math.ceil might be acceptable, but we can also use integer operations to compute ceil(k / 2) as (k +1) // 2.

Wait, actually, ceil(k / 2) is equal to (k +1) // 2.

Similarly, ceil((k +1)/2) is ((k +1) +1) // 2 = (k +2) // 2.

So, in code, we can implement it as:

if k <= 2n -1:

m = (k +1) // 2

else:

m = (k +1) // 2

Wait, that's the same as m = (k +1) // 2 in both cases.

But according to earlier examples, for k <= 2n -1, m = (k +1) // 2, and for k > 2n -1, m = (k +1) // 2.

But in the sample input, for n=3, k=10, m=6, which is (10 +1)//2=5.5, rounded up to 6.

Wait, but (10 +1)//2=5.5, but in integer division, (10 +1)//2=5.

Wait, no, in Python, math.ceil(10 / 2)=5, but we need to color 6 cells for k=10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, in Python, (k +1) // 2 gives the ceiling of k/2.

So, for k=10, (10 +1)//2=5.5, but in integer division, it would be 5.

But the sample output is 6.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's m = (k +1) // 2 if k <= 2n -1, else m = (k +1) // 2.

But that doesn't explain the discrepancy in the sample input.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for k <= 2n -1, m = ceil(k / 2), and for k > 2n -1, m = n + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2).

Wait, let's see for n=3, k=10:

2n -1=5.

So, m = 3 + ceil((10 -5)/2)=3 + ceil(5/2)=3 + 3=6, which matches the sample.

For n=3, k=9:

m=3 + ceil((9 -5)/2)=3 + 2=5, which matches the sample.

For n=3, k=4:

m=ceil(4 / 2)=2, which matches.

For n=4, k=7:

2n -1=7, so m=ceil(7 / 2)=4, which matches.

For n=7, k=11:

2n -1=13, which is greater than 11, so m=ceil(11 / 2)=6, which matches.

For n=2, k=3:

2n -1=3, so m=ceil(3 / 2)=2, which matches.

So, the formula is:

if k <= 2n -1:

m = ceil(k / 2)

else:

m = n + ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2)

Wait, but in the else case, ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2) is the extra cells needed beyond the initial 2n -1 diagonals.

And m = n + that.

Wait, for n=3, k=10:

m=3 + ceil((10 -5)/2)=3 + 3=6.

For n=3, k=9:

m=3 + ceil((9 -5)/2)=3 + 2=5.

For n=4, k=7:

Since k <= 7, m=ceil(7 / 2)=4.

This seems consistent.

So, perhaps that's the correct formula.

In code, we can implement it as:

if k <= 2*n -1:

m = (k +1) // 2

else:

m = n + ( (k - (2*n -1)) +1 ) // 2

Simplify the else part:

m = n + ceil((k - (2*n -1)) / 2)

Which in integer division is n + ((k - (2*n -1)) +1) // 2

But let's test this formula with n=3, k=10:

m=3 + ((10 -5) +1)//2=3 + (6)//2=3 +3=6.

For n=3, k=9:

m=3 + ((9 -5) +1)//2=3 + (5)//2=3 +2=5.

For n=4, k=7:

Since k <= 7, m=(7 +1)//2=4.

For n=2, k=3:

m=(3 +1)//2=2.

All match the sample inputs.

So, this seems correct.

Therefore, in code, we can implement this formula.

Also, note that for k=1, m=1, which is correct.

Because ceil(1 / 2)=1.

Wait, but according to the formula, for k=1 <= 2n -1, m=ceil(1 / 2)=1.

Which is correct.

So, this should work.

Now, implement this in code.

We need to handle multiple test cases efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 1e8 and t up to 1000, we need an O(1) per test case solution, which this is.

So, the code should read t, then loop t times, read n and k, compute m according to the formula, and print m.

Implementing ceil(k / 2) as (k +1) // 2.

Similarly, ceil((k - (2n -1)) / 2) as ((k - (2n -1)) +1) // 2.

Also, make sure to handle the else case correctly.

So, in code:

if k <= 2*n -1:

print((k +1) // 2)

else:

extra_k = k - (2*n -1)

extra_cells = (extra_k +1) // 2

m = n + extra_cells

print(m)

This should work.

Let me test this with n=3, k=10:

extra_k=10 -5=5

extra_cells=(5 +1)//2=3

m=3 +3=6, correct.

For n=3, k=9:

extra_k=9 -5=4

extra_cells=(4 +1)//2=2

m=3 +2=5, correct.

For n=4, k=7:

7 <=7, so m=(7 +1)//2=4, correct.

For n=2, k=3:

3 <=3, m=(3 +1)//2=2, correct.

For n=3, k=4:

4 <=5, m=(4 +1)//2=2, correct.

For n=3, k=3:

3 <=5, m=(3 +1)//2=2, correct.

Seems good.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The grid has 4n - 2 diagonals in total, comprising both main and anti-diagonals.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Diagonals**:
   - Main diagonals run from the top-left to bottom-right.
   - Anti-diagonals run from the top-right to bottom-left.
   - Each cell lies on exactly one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal.

2. **Coverage Strategy**:
   - Each colored cell can cover up to two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we aim to maximize the number of unique diagonals covered by each cell.

3. **Formulating the Solution**:
   - If k ≤ 2n - 1, the minimum number of cells required is ceil(k / 2).
   - If k > 2n - 1, additional cells are needed to cover the extra diagonals beyond 2n - 1.

4. **Mathematical Calculation**:
   - For k ≤ 2n - 1:
     - Use ceil(k / 2), which can be computed as (k + 1) // 2.
   - For k > 2n - 1:
     - Calculate extra diagonals (k - (2n - 1)).
     - Compute extra cells needed: ceil((k - (2n - 1)) / 2), which is ((k - (2n - 1)) + 1) // 2.
     - Total cells: n + extra cells.

### Solution Code

```python
import math

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        if k <= 2 * n - 1:
            print((k + 1) // 2)
        else:
            extra_k = k - (2 * n - 1)
            extra_cells = (extra_k + 1) // 2
            m = n + extra_cells
            print(m)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases (t).
  - For each test case, read n and k.

- **Calculating Minimum Cells**:
  - If k ≤ 2n - 1, compute ceil(k / 2) using integer division.
  - If k > 2n - 1:
    - Calculate the number of extra diagonals beyond 2n - 1.
    - Compute the extra cells needed for these extra diagonals.
    - Add these extra cells to n to get the total cells required.

- **Output**:
  - Print the result for each test case directly.

This approach ensures that we handle large values of n efficiently and compute the results in constant time per test case.
