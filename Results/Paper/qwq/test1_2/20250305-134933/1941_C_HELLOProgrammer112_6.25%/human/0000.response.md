Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Rudolf has a string, and he thinks it's ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Otherwise, it's beautiful. My task is to make the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters possible.

First, I need to understand what constitutes an ugly string. It's ugly if it contains either "pie" or "map" as substrings. So, for example, "ppiee" is ugly because it contains "pie", and "mmap" is ugly because it contains "map". Even if there are multiple occurrences, like in "dfpiefghmap", it's still ugly.

My goal is to make it beautiful by removing the least number of characters. That means I need to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map" by removing characters from the string.

The straightforward approach that comes to mind is to count how many times "pie" and "map" appear in the string and sum those counts. That would give me the minimum number of characters to remove, right? Because each occurrence of "pie" or "map" requires removing one character to break the substring.

Wait, but let's think about that. If I have "pie", removing any one character from it will break the substring. Similarly, for "map", removing one character will make it no longer "map". So, for each occurrence of "pie" or "map", I need to remove at least one character.

But what if there's overlap between these substrings? For example, in "mapie", it contains both "map" and "pie", but they overlap. If I remove one character to break "map", it might also break "pie", or vice versa. So, in such cases, removing one character could eliminate both substrings.

My initial approach just counts the number of "pie" and "map" substrings and sums them up, assuming no overlaps. But in reality, overlaps can occur, and in such cases, my approach would overcount the number of removals needed because it doesn't account for the overlap.

Let me look at the sample input and output to see if my approach matches.

First test case:

9

mmapnapie

According to my approach, count of "map" is 1 (positions 1-3: "mma" doesn't contain "map", positions 2-4: "map", positions 3-5: "map", positions 4-6: "apn", so "map" appears twice), and "pie" appears once (positions 7-9: "pie"). So, x = 2, y = 1, total = 3. But the output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't match. So, my approach is overcounting.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted "map". Let's check:

String: mmapnapie

Looking for "map":

- positions 1-3: "mma" ≠ "map"

- positions 2-4: "map" == "map"

- positions 3-5: "map" == "map"

- positions 4-6: "apn" ≠ "map"

So, "map" appears twice.

Looking for "pie":

- positions 7-9: "pie" == "pie"

So, "pie" appears once.

Total according to my approach: 3

But the correct answer is 2. So, there must be overlapping or some other consideration.

Looking at the explanation for the first test case, it says: "For example, you can delete the 4th and 9th characters to make the string beautiful."

Let's see:

Original string: mmapnapie

After removing 4th and 9th characters: mmpnape

Now, check for "map" and "pie":

- "map" appears at positions 2-4: "mpn" ≠ "map"

- "pie" appears at positions 6-8: "pe" ≠ "pie"

So, no "map" or "pie", it's beautiful. So, with 2 removals, it's possible.

But according to my approach, I thought I needed to remove 3 characters, but actually 2 suffice. So, my approach is incorrect.

I need a better way to count the minimum number of removals.

Another approach could be to iterate through the string and keep track of whether "pie" or "map" is forming, and remove characters as needed.

But that might be too slow for large n, since n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 10^4, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^6.

I need an efficient way.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming or some sliding window approach to keep track of the substrings.

Let me think differently. I need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all "pie" and "map" substrings.

This is similar to finding the longest subsequence without these substrings, and then the number of removals would be n minus the length of this subsequence.

So, I need to find the longest subsequence that doesn't contain "pie" or "map".

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem where I keep track of the last few characters to ensure no "pie" or "map" is formed.

But implementing this efficiently might be complex and time-consuming, especially with multiple test cases.

Given the constraints, I need a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can greedily remove characters when I find "pie" or "map".

For example, scan the string and whenever I find "pie" or "map", remove one character from it.

But I need to be careful with overlaps.

Maybe I can merge overlapping occurrences and count the number of removals needed for each group.

Let me think about it.

I can iterate through the string and keep track of the positions where "pie" or "map" occur.

If there are overlapping occurrences, I can group them and determine the minimum number of removals to break all substrings in the group.

For example, in "mapie", "map" and "pie" overlap, so removing one character can break both.

So, in this case, removals = 1.

Another example: "mmap"

Positions:

1: m

2: m

3: a

4: p

So, "map" from positions 2-4.

But "mmap" doesn't have "map" because positions 1-3: "mm a", positions 2-4: "m a p".

Wait, positions 2-4: "map" == "map".

So, "map" appears once.

According to my initial approach, x = 1, y = 0, so removals = 1.

But in the first test case, x = 2, y = 1, but correct removals = 2.

Wait, perhaps it's not just the sum of counts, but the sum of the maximum overlapping groups.

I need to find the maximum number of overlapping occurrences and sum those.

Wait, that might be complicated.

Is there a standard algorithm for this type of problem?

I recall that in some string problems, we can use a sliding window approach to count the number of overlapping substrings.

In this case, perhaps I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of active "pie" or "map" substrings at each position, and sum the maximum number in each overlapping group.

Let me try to formalize this.

I can iterate through the string, and for each position, check if "map" or "pie" starts or ends there.

Maintain a count of the number of active substrings that require removal.

Each time a substring starts, increment the count.

Each time a substring ends, decrement the count.

Then, the total removals needed would be the sum of the counts where count > 0.

Wait, that might not work directly.

Let me think with an example.

Take "mmapnapie":

Indices: 1: m, 2: m, 3: a, 4: p, 5: n, 6: a, 7: p, 8: i, 9: e

Looking for "map" and "pie".

"map" appears at positions 2-4 and 3-5.

"pie" appears at positions 7-9.

So, overlapping occurrences:

- "map" at 2-4

- "map" at 3-5

- "pie" at 7-9

So, from position 2 to 5, there are overlapping "map" substrings.

From position 7 to 9, "pie".

So, in position 2-5, I need to remove at least 2 characters to break both "map" substrings.

In position 7-9, I need to remove 1 character to break "pie".

Total removals: 2 + 1 = 3, but the correct answer is 2.

Wait, but in reality, removing positions 4 and 9 breaks both "map" and "pie".

So, in overlapping groups, perhaps I can remove one character to break multiple substrings.

So, in position 2-5, there are two "map" substrings overlapping.

By removing one character from positions 3, 4, or 5, I can break both "map" substrings.

Similarly, in positions 7-9, removing position 8 breaks "pie".

So, total removals: 1 + 1 = 2.

Hence, in overlapping groups, I need to count the maximum number of overlapping substrings in each group.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the maximum number of overlapping substrings at any point and sum them up.

But I need to be careful with overlaps.

I think this is similar to the interval covering problem, where I need to find the minimal number of removals to cover all intervals.

In interval scheduling, to select the minimal number of items to remove, I can use a greedy approach.

Wait, maybe I need to treat each "pie" and "map" substring as an interval and find the minimal number of points to pierce all intervals.

But that might be too complicated for implementation under time constraints.

Is there a simpler way?

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I can iterate through the string and keep track of the number of overlapping "pie" and "map" substrings.

At each position, I can keep a count of how many substrings are active (i.e., contain that position).

Then, the minimal number of removals would be equal to the maximum number of overlapping substrings.

Wait, but in the first test case, the maximum overlap is 2 ("map" at positions 2-4 and 3-5), and "pie" at 7-9 is separate.

So, removals = 2.

That matches the sample output.

Similarly, in "mapie", "map" and "pie" overlap, so maximum overlap is 2, but removing one character can break both.

Wait, but according to this, removals would be 2, but in reality, one removal suffices.

So, perhaps the minimal number of removals is equal to the size of the maximum overlap group minus the maximum number of substrings that can be broken by a single removal.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I need to model it differently.

An alternative approach is to find all positions where "pie" or "map" occur, treat them as intervals, and find a minimal set of points that intersect all these intervals.

This is known as the interval piercing problem, and the minimal number of points required is equal to the size of the largest clique in the interval graph.

But implementing this efficiently might be too time-consuming.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need a heuristic that works for this problem.

Given that n can be up to 10^6 and t up to 10^4, with sum n up to 10^6, I need an O(n) solution per test case.

Let me try to think of a sweep line approach.

I can collect all start and end positions of "pie" and "map" substrings.

For each "pie" or "map" found in the string, record its start and end positions.

Then, sort these positions and perform a sweep line, keeping track of the number of active substrings.

Whenever the number of active substrings is greater than zero, increment the removals.

But this might overcount.

Wait, actually, in the sweep line approach for interval covering, the minimal number of points needed to cover all intervals is equal to the size of the largest overlap.

In other words, the minimal number of removals is equal to the maximum number of overlapping substrings.

But in the first test case, the maximum overlap is 2, and the answer is 2, which matches.

In "mapie", the maximum overlap is 2 ("map" and "pie" overlapping), but the answer should be 1, which doesn't match.

So, perhaps I need to adjust this approach.

Wait, maybe the minimal number of removals is equal to the ceiling of the total number of substrings divided by the maximum overlap.

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps it's equal to the total number of substrings minus the number of overlaps.

But in the first test case, total substrings = 3 (two "map" and one "pie"), maximum overlap = 2, so 3 - 2 = 1, but the correct answer is 2.

So, that doesn't work.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that each removal can break multiple overlapping substrings.

So, in "mapie", removing position 3 breaks both "map" and "pie".

Hence, in cases where substrings overlap, one removal can handle multiple substrings.

So, the minimal number of removals is equal to the number of maximal groups of overlapping substrings.

In "mmapnapie":

- "map" at positions 2-4 and 3-5 overlap.

- "pie" at positions 7-9.

So, there are two groups: one with two overlapping substrings and one with one substring.

Hence, total removals = 1 for the first group + 1 for the second group = 2.

In "mapie":

- "map" at positions 1-3 and "pie" at positions 2-4.

- They overlap, so they form one group with two overlapping substrings.

- Hence, removals = 1.

This seems consistent with the sample.

So, the task reduces to finding the number of groups of overlapping substrings and, for each group, adding the size of the largest overlap minus the number of substrings that can be broken by a single removal.

Wait, that sounds too vague.

Perhaps more simply, for each group of overlapping substrings, the minimal number of removals required is equal to the size of the largest clique in that group.

In practice, for each group, it's equal to the maximum number of substrings that cannot be broken by removing a single character.

But implementing this efficiently is tricky.

Is there a simpler way to model this?

An alternative approach is to model this as a graph where each substring is a node, and edges connect overlapping substrings.

Then, the minimal number of removals is equal to the number of cliques in the graph.

But this is too time-consuming to implement, especially with large n.

I need a more straightforward method.

Let me consider a greedy approach:

- Iterate through the string and collect all "pie" and "map" substrings.

- Sort them by their end positions.

- Use a greedy algorithm to select the minimal number of removals to cover all substrings.

This is similar to the interval scheduling problem.

In interval scheduling, to select the minimal number of intervals to remove, I can select the interval that ends first.

But in this case, I need to remove characters, not intervals.

Wait, perhaps I need to select the positions that cover the most number of substrings.

This sounds like the interval covering problem.

In the interval covering problem, to cover all intervals with the minimal number of points, I can select points at the end positions of the intervals, greedily choosing the smallest end position each time.

Let's try this approach.

In "mmapnapie":

"map" at positions 2-4 and 3-5, "pie" at 7-9.

Sort by end positions: positions 4, 5, 9.

Select the smallest end position first: position 4.

- This covers "map" at 2-4 and "map" at 3-5.

- So, remove position 4, which breaks both "map" substrings.

Next, "pie" at 7-9.

Select the next smallest end position: position 9.

- Remove position 9, which breaks "pie".

Total removals: 2.

This matches the sample output.

In "mapie":

"map" at 1-3 and "pie" at 2-4.

Sort by end positions: positions 3,4.

Select position 3 first.

- This breaks both "map" and "pie".

Total removals: 1.

Perfect.

So, this greedy approach seems to work.

Hence, the algorithm is:

- Find all substrings "pie" and "map" in the string.

- Record their start and end positions.

- Sort the end positions in ascending order.

- Initialize a variable to keep track of the current end position.

- Iterate through the sorted end positions.

- For each end position, if it's greater than the current end position, increment the removals and set the current end position to that end position.

- Output the total removals.

This is similar to the greedy algorithm for interval scheduling.

Implementing this should give the correct answer.

Now, looking back at the given program:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

a = int(input())

s = input()

x = s.count('map')

y = s.count('pie')

print(x + y)

This program simply counts the number of "map" and "pie" substrings and sums them up, assuming no overlaps.

But as we've seen in the first test case, this overcounts the removals when there are overlaps.

Hence, this program is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
