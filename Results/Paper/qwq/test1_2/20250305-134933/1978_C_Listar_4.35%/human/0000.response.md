Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I need to find a permutation of length n such that the Manhattan value, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each element and its position, equals a given k. If no such permutation exists, I should output "No"; otherwise, "Yes" and the permutation.

First, I need to understand what a permutation is. A permutation of length n is just an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n in any order, without duplicates. For example, for n=3, the permutations are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], and [3,2,1].

The Manhattan value is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between each element and its position in the permutation. So, for a permutation p, it's sum of |p_i - i| for all i from 1 to n.

Given n and k, I need to find if there's a permutation whose Manhattan value is exactly k. If there is, I need to output "Yes" and the permutation; if not, "No".

Looking at the example:

- For n=3 and k=4, the permutation [3,1,2] has Manhattan value |3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

- For n=4 and k=5, it's "No", meaning no permutation exists with Manhattan value 5.

- For n=7 and k=0, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] has Manhattan value 0.

- For n=1 and k=1000000000000, it's "No", likely because the only permutation [1] has Manhattan value 0.

- For n=8 and k=14, there exists a permutation.

- For n=112 and k=777, it's "No".

- For n=5 and k=12, there's a permutation.

- For n=5 and k=2, there's another permutation.

So, I need to figure out a way to either construct such a permutation or determine that it's impossible.

First, I need to understand the possible range of Manhattan values for a given n.

The minimal Manhattan value is 0, which occurs only when the permutation is [1,2,3,...,n]. In this case, each p_i = i, so |p_i - i| = 0 for all i.

The maximal Manhattan value would be achieved when each p_i is as far as possible from i. For example, for n=3, the permutation [3,2,1] has |3-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4, which seems to be the maximum.

For n=4, [4,3,2,1] has |4-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| + |1-4| = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8.

Wait, but in the example, for n=4 and k=5, it's "No". So, maybe 5 is not achievable for n=4.

I need to find a way to calculate the possible Manhattan values for a given n and see if k is among them.

First, let's think about how to maximize the Manhattan value.

Each term |p_i - i| can be at most n-1, when p_i is either 1 or n, depending on i.

But in practice, the maximum sum is achieved when the permutation is the reverse of the identity permutation, i.e., [n, n-1, ..., 1]. In this case, each |p_i - i| = |n+1-i - i| = |n+1 - 2i|.

Wait, maybe I should think differently.

Let me calculate the maximum Manhattan value for general n.

For n even:

n=4: [4,3,2,1] -> |4-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| + |1-4| = 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 8

n=2: [2,1] -> |2-1| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2

n=6: [6,5,4,3,2,1] -> |6-1| + |5-2| + |4-3| + |3-4| + |2-5| + |1-6| = 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 18

Seems like for even n, the maximum Manhattan value is n*(n/2).

Wait, for n=4, 4*(4/2) = 8, which matches.

For n=2, 2*(2/2)=2, matches.

For n=6, 6*(6/2)=18, matches.

For n odd:

n=3: [3,2,1] -> |3-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4

n=5: [5,4,3,2,1] -> |5-1| + |4-2| + |3-3| + |2-4| + |1-5| = 4 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 4 = 12

Seems like for odd n, the maximum Manhattan value is (n^2 - 1)/2.

For n=3: (9-1)/2=4, matches.

For n=5: (25-1)/2=12, matches.

So, the maximum Manhattan value is:

- If n is even: n*(n/2) = n^2 / 2

- If n is odd: (n^2 - 1)/2

Now, given that, I can first check if k is within the possible range, i.e., 0 <= k <= max_manhattan.

If k is greater than the maximum possible, then output "No".

But in the example, for n=1 and k=1000000000000, it's "No", which makes sense because for n=1, the only permutation is [1], and its Manhattan value is 0. So, any k > 0 is impossible.

Similarly, for n=7 and k=0, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] has Manhattan value 0.

For n=8 and k=14, it's possible.

For n=112 and k=777, it's "No".

So, beyond checking if k <= max_manhattan, I need to see if k is achievable.

I need to find a way to construct a permutation that achieves the desired k.

Looking at the code provided:

There's a function func_2() that takes n and k and returns (n, k) if k is even and within the possible range, otherwise (0,0).

Wait, let's look at func_2():

def func_2():

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

if k % 2:

return (0, 0)

if n % 2:

max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2

else:

max_k = n ** 2 // 2

if max_k < k:

return (0, 0)

return (n, k)

So, it first checks if k is even. If k is odd, it immediately returns (0,0), meaning "No".

Then, it calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value based on whether n is even or odd, as I determined earlier.

If k is less than or equal to max_k and is even, it returns (n, k); else, (0,0).

Then, func_4() calls func_2(), and if (n,k) is not (0,0), it calls func_1(n,k) to generate the permutation and prints "Yes" and the permutation; otherwise, "No".

So, the key seems to be that k must be even to have a valid permutation.

Why is that?

Looking back at the examples:

- n=3, k=4: 4 is even.

- n=4, k=5: 5 is odd, "No".

- n=7, k=0: 0 is even.

- n=1, k=1000000000000: k is even, but impossible because max_k=0.

- n=8, k=14: 14 is even.

- n=112, k=777: 777 is odd, "No".

- n=5, k=12: 12 is even.

- n=5, k=2: 2 is even.

So, it seems that k must be even to have a valid permutation.

But why?

Let's think about the sum of |p_i - i|.

Each |p_i - i| is an integer greater than or equal to 0.

The sum of these integers is k.

Under what conditions is this sum even?

Well, the sum is even if and only if the number of odd |p_i - i| is even.

Because:

- Odd + odd = even

- Even + even = even

- Odd + even = odd

So, for the sum to be even, the number of odd terms must be even (including zero).

But in this problem, it seems that k must be even regardless of n.

Wait, but in func_2(), it checks if k is odd, and if so, immediately returns "No".

Is this always true?

Is it always the case that k must be even for any n?

From the examples, it seems so.

But let's verify.

For n=1:

Only permutation is [1], Manhattan value 0, which is even.

For n=2:

Permutations:

[1,2]: |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 + 0 = 0 (even)

[2,1]: |2-1| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 (even)

So, only even k's are possible.

For n=3:

Permutations:

[1,2,3]: 0

[1,3,2]: |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

[2,1,3]: |2-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

[2,3,1]: |2-1| + |3-2| + |1-3| = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4

[3,1,2]: |3-1| + |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4

[3,2,1]: |3-1| + |2-2| + |1-3| = 2 + 0 + 2 = 4

All even.

So, for n=3, only even k's are possible.

Similarly, for n=4:

[1,2,3,4]: 0

[1,2,4,3]: |1-1| + |2-2| + |4-3| + |3-4| = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2

[1,3,2,4]: |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| + |4-4| = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2

...

All sums seem even.

Wait, but according to the problem, for n=4 and k=5, it's "No", which aligns with k being odd.

So, it seems that for any n, k must be even for a permutation to exist.

Is there a mathematical reason for this?

Let's consider that each |p_i - i| is the absolute difference between p_i and i.

Now, p_i and i are both integers from 1 to n.

The parity (evenness or oddness) of |p_i - i| is the same as the parity of p_i - i.

So, sum of |p_i - i| has the same parity as sum of p_i - i.

Now, sum of p_i over i from 1 to n is the same as sum of numbers from 1 to n, which is n(n+1)/2.

Similarly, sum of i from 1 to n is also n(n+1)/2.

Therefore, sum of (p_i - i) over all i is zero.

Hence, sum of |p_i - i| must have the same parity as zero, which is even.

Therefore, k must be even.

Hence, in func_2(), if k is odd, it immediately returns (0,0), meaning "No".

Now, assuming k is even, I need to construct a permutation where the sum of |p_i - i| equals k.

Looking at func_1(n, k):

def func_1(n, k):

k = k // 2

l = list(range(1, n + 1))

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

if k == 0:

return l

if 1 + i > k:

x = l[-1]

l.pop(-1)

l.insert(-k, x)

return l

k = k - i + 1

x = l[-1]

l.pop(-1)

l.insert(0, x)

return l

This function seems to be constructing the permutation by moving elements around based on the value of k.

I need to understand how this works.

First, it sets k = k // 2.

Then, it initializes l as the list [1,2,3,...,n].

Then, it loops from i = n-1 downto 0.

If k == 0, it returns l, which is the identity permutation.

If 1 + i > k, it takes the last element, removes it from the end, and inserts it at position -k.

Otherwise, it subtracts (i + 1) from k and moves the last element to the front.

This seems confusing.

I need to see with an example.

Take n=3, k=4.

First, k = 4 // 2 = 2.

l = [1,2,3]

i=2:

1 + 2 = 3 > 2, so x=3, pop it, insert it at position -2.

So, l becomes [1,3,2].

Wait, inserting 3 at position -2 in [1,2], which is before the last element, so [1,3,2].

Then, since k=2 - 0 (not sure), but it seems to work.

Another example: n=5, k=12.

k=6

l=[1,2,3,4,5]

i=4:

1 + 4 =5 > 6, so x=5, pop, insert at position -6.

But list is [1,2,3,4], so position -6 is out of range.

Wait, maybe it's taking modulo or something.

This seems problematic.

Wait, perhaps the logic is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way to construct the permutation.

Let me think differently.

I need to maximize or minimize the sum of |p_i - i|.

Each |p_i - i| can be thought of as the distance between p_i and i.

To achieve a certain sum k, I need to arrange the elements such that the total distance is k.

One way to approach this is to pair elements where one is above and one is below the diagonal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each swap between two elements can increase or decrease the sum in a certain way.

Alternatively, think in terms of inversions or something similar.

But that might be too slow for large n.

Given that n can be up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but with sum of n over all test cases up to 2e5, it's manageable as long as each test is O(n).

But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Looking back at the code, it seems to try to adjust k by moving elements in the list.

But I'm not fully following it.

An alternative approach:

I can think of the permutation as starting from the identity permutation [1,2,3,...,n], which has sum 0.

Then, I can perform swaps to increase the sum.

Each swap between p_i and p_j will change the sum in a certain way.

Specifically, if I swap p_i and p_j, the change in sum is |p_i - j| + |p_j - i| - |p_i - i| - |p_j - j|.

This can be positive or negative depending on the values.

This seems too involved for large n.

Perhaps a better way is to consider the positions where p_i != i.

For each such position, I can have p_i at some other position, increasing the sum by |p_i - i|.

But ensuring that the total sum is k and that the permutation remains valid is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of assigning each element to a position with a certain difference.

But it's getting complicated.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps the key is to note that the sum of |p_i - i| is equal to twice the number of inversions, or something similar.

Wait, actually, in the code, it divides k by 2, suggesting that each step can increase the sum by 2.

This might be related to swapping two elements.

Wait, suppose I have the identity permutation [1,2,3,...,n].

The sum is 0.

If I swap two elements p_i and p_j, how much does the sum change?

Let's say I swap p_i and p_j.

Then, the change in sum is:

|p_j - i| + |p_i - j| - |p_i - i| - |p_j - j|

Since in the identity permutation, |p_i - i| = 0 and |p_j - j| = 0.

So, the change is |p_j - i| + |p_i - j|.

If p_j > i and p_i < j, this would be (p_j - i) + (j - p_i).

Which is (p_j - p_i) + (j - i).

Hmm.

This seems complicated.

Maybe another approach.

I can consider that each |p_i - i| can be any value between 0 and n-1, but subject to the constraints of the permutation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can build the permutation by deciding for each position how much to deviate from i.

But ensuring that all p_i are distinct and within 1 to n is tricky.

Looking back at the code, it seems to try to adjust k by moving the last element to a certain position.

But I'm not sure if this is correct in all cases.

Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

I recall that in some problems, to achieve a certain sum with constraints, we can use a greedy algorithm.

Maybe here, I can sort the positions and assign the largest possible |p_i - i| without exceeding k.

But again, ensuring that the assignment is a permutation is tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the maximum matching or something similar.

But that seems overkill.

Let me consider small n and see if I can find a pattern.

For n=1:

Only [1], sum=0.

For n=2:

[1,2]: sum=0

[2,1]: sum=2

So, for k=0 and k=2, possible; for k=1, impossible.

For n=3:

[1,2,3]: 0

[1,3,2]: 2

[2,1,3]: 2

[2,3,1]: 4

[3,1,2]: 4

[3,2,1]: 4

So, possible for k=0,2,4; impossible for k=1,3.

For n=4:

[1,2,3,4]: 0

[1,2,4,3]: 2

[1,3,2,4]: 2

[1,3,4,2]: 4

[1,4,2,3]: 4

[1,4,3,2]: 6

[2,1,3,4]: 2

[2,1,4,3]: 4

[2,3,1,4]: 4

[2,3,4,1]: 6

[2,4,1,3]: 6

[2,4,3,1]: 8

[3,1,2,4]: 4

[3,1,4,2]: 6

[3,2,1,4]: 4

[3,2,4,1]: 6

[3,4,1,2]: 8

[3,4,2,1]: 8

[4,1,2,3]: 6

[4,1,3,2]: 8

[4,2,1,3]: 6

[4,2,3,1]: 8

[4,3,1,2]: 8

[4,3,2,1]: 8

So, possible for k=0,2,4,6,8; impossible for odd k.

Hence, it seems that for any n, k must be even and within 0 and max_k.

So, in func_2(), it checks if k is even and <= max_k.

If so, it proceeds to construct the permutation in func_1().

Now, I need to verify if func_1() correctly constructs such a permutation.

Looking back at func_1():

def func_1(n, k):

k = k // 2

l = list(range(1, n + 1))

for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):

if k == 0:

return l

if 1 + i > k:

x = l[-1]

l.pop(-1)

l.insert(-k, x)

return l

k = k - i + 1

x = l[-1]

l.pop(-1)

l.insert(0, x)

return l

This seems a bit convoluted.

Let me try to understand it with n=3, k=4.

k = 4 // 2 = 2

l = [1,2,3]

i=2:

1 + 2 = 3 > 2, so x=3, pop it, insert at position -2.

So, l becomes [1,3,2]

Return l.

Sum is |1-1| + |3-2| + |2-3| = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2, but we need 4.

Wait, that's not right.

Wait, k was 4, but the sum is 2.

So, perhaps it's not working correctly.

Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, in the code, k is divided by 2, so k=2, but in the permutation [1,3,2], sum is 2, not 4.

So, perhaps there's a mistake.

Wait, in the problem, for n=3 and k=4, the permutation [3,1,2] has sum 4.

But according to the code, it's returning [1,3,2] with sum 2.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, for n=3 and k=4, it's "Yes" with [3,1,2].

But according to the code, it's returning [1,3,2], which has sum 2, not 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I misread the code.

Wait, in func_1(n,k), it sets k = k // 2, then loops from n-1 downto 0.

If 1 + i > k, it inserts the last element at position -k.

Otherwise, it subtracts (i + 1) from k and moves the last element to the front.

This seems inconsistent.

In the case of n=3, k=4, after k=2, i=2, 1+2=3 > 2, so it inserts the last element at position -2.

In l=[1,2,3], x=3, insert at -2, which is before the last element, so l becomes [1,3,2].

But this has sum 2, not 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back at the problem, it says:

- For n=3 and k=4, [3,1,2] is a valid permutation with sum 4.

But according to the code, it's returning [1,3,2] with sum 2.

So, it's not generating the correct permutation for k=4.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
