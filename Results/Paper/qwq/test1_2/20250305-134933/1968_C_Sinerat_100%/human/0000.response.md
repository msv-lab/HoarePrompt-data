Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, up to x_n, and I need to find an array a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions. The problem says that if there are multiple possible a arrays, I can output any one of them.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by choosing a value for a_1 and then determine the rest based on that.

But what should a_1 be? The constraints say that each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9, so a_1 should also be in that range.

Let's consider the first test case in the example:

Input:

5

4

2 4 1

3

1 1

6

4 2 5 1 2

2

500

3

1 5

Output:

3 5 4 9

2 5 11

5 14 16 5 11 24

501 500

2 7 5

Looking at the first test case, n=4 and x=[2,4,1]. The output is a=[3,5,4,9].

Let's verify this:

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 3 = 2, which matches x_2=2.

a_3 % a_2 = 4 % 5 = 4, which matches x_3=4.

a_4 % a_3 = 9 % 4 = 1, which matches x_4=1.

So, this seems correct.

Now, how did they come up with a=[3,5,4,9]? Is there a pattern or a formula to determine a from x?

Let me try to find a general way to construct a from x.

Given x_2 to x_n, I need to find a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

One way to think about this is to choose a_{i-1} such that a_i divided by a_{i-1} gives some quotient q with remainder x_i.

In other words, a_i = q * a_{i-1} + x_i.

But I need to choose q such that a_i is within the range [1, 10^9].

To make things simple, I can choose q=1 for all i, which would give a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's see if this works with the first test case.

Start with a_1=3.

Then, a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = 5 + 4 = 9.

a_4 = a_3 + x_3 = 9 + 1 = 10.

But in the example, a_4 is 9, not 10. Hmm, maybe choosing q=1 isn't always the best choice.

Wait, in the example, a_4 is 9, which is a_4 % a_3 = 9 % 4 = 1, which matches x_4=1.

But according to my method, a_4 would be 10, and 10 % 4 = 2, which doesn't match x_4=1.

So my method is incorrect in this case.

Maybe choosing q=1 doesn't always work. Maybe I need to choose q such that a_i is minimized or something.

Alternatively, maybe I can set a_1 to a certain value and then compute the rest based on that.

Let me look at the second test case:

Input:

3

1 1

Output:

2 5 11

Check:

a_2 % a_1 = 5 % 2 = 1, which matches x_2=1.

a_3 % a_2 = 11 % 5 = 1, which matches x_3=1.

So, a_1=2, a_2=5, a_3=11.

If I use the method a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}, then:

a_1=2, a_2=2+1=3, a_3=3+1=4.

But 3%2=1, which matches x_2=1.

4%3=1, which matches x_3=1.

So, a=[2,3,4] also works, but the example output is a=[2,5,11]. So multiple solutions are possible.

Maybe the method a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} works sometimes, but not always.

Looking back at the first test case, using a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}:

a_1=3, a_2=3+2=5, a_3=5+4=9, a_4=9+1=10.

But 10%4=2, which doesn't match x_4=1.

So, this method doesn't always work.

I need a more general approach.

Let me think differently. For each a_i, x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}.

This means that a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some integer k >= 0.

I need to choose k such that a_i is within [1,10^9].

Also, a_i should be greater than or equal to x_i, since x_i is the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}.

Wait, no, a_i can be less than a_{i-1}, but in that case, a_i % a_{i-1} = a_i, so x_i = a_i.

But in the problem, x_i can be from 1 to 500, and a_i can be up to 10^9.

I need to find a sequence where each a_i satisfies a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i.

Let me consider starting from a_1 and building up.

Suppose I set a_1 to some value. Then, for a_2, a_2 % a_1 = x_2.

So, a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2 for some integer k >= 0.

Similarly, a_3 = m * a_2 + x_3 for some integer m >= 0.

And so on.

So, I can choose k, m, etc., to be any non-negative integers, as long as a_i stays within the range.

But with large n, this could lead to a_i becoming too large.

Wait, but the problem allows a_i up to 10^9, which is fine.

But I need to ensure that a_i doesn't exceed 10^9.

One way to keep a_i from growing too large is to choose k=0 for all steps.

That is, set a_i = x_i for each i.

But then, a_i % a_{i-1} should equal x_i.

Wait, if a_i = x_i, then a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i % a_{i-1}, which needs to equal x_i.

This would require that x_i % a_{i-1} = x_i, which implies that a_{i-1} > x_i.

But x_i can be up to 500, and a_{i-1} can be up to 10^9, so it's possible.

But in the first test case, x=[2,4,1], so:

If a_1 = x_1 = 2,

a_2 = x_2 = 4,

a_3 = x_3 = 1.

Then, check:

a_2 % a_1 = 4 % 2 = 0, which should be x_2=4. No, that's not matching.

So, this approach doesn't work.

Alternative idea: set a_{i-1} to be greater than x_i, so that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i implies a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i for some k.

To minimize a_i, I can set k=1, so a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

But in the first test case, this led to a_4=10, which didn't match x_4=1.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust a_1.

Let me try to find a general method.

Suppose I set a_1 to be some value, say a_1 = x_1 + 1.

Then, a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2.

I can choose k=1, so a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

Then, a_3 = m * a_2 + x_3.

Again, choose m=1, so a_3 = a_2 + x_3.

And so on.

But in the first test case, this gives:

a_1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

a_4 = 9 + 1 = 10.

But 10 % 4 = 2, which should be x_4=1. Doesn't match.

So, this method doesn't work.

Maybe I need to choose a_1 larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set a_1 to be greater than all x_i.

Let me try setting a_1 to be larger than the maximum x_i.

In the first test case, x=[2,4,1], so max(x_i)=4.

Set a_1=5.

Then, a_2 = k*5 + 2.

Choose k=1, a_2=7.

a_3 = m*7 + 4.

Choose m=1, a_3=11.

a_4 = p*11 + 1.

Choose p=1, a_4=12.

Now check:

a_2 % a_1 = 7 % 5 = 2, which matches x_2=2.

a_3 % a_2 = 11 % 7 = 4, which matches x_3=4.

a_4 % a_3 = 12 % 11 = 1, which matches x_4=1.

So, a=[5,7,11,12] also works.

But in the example, a=[3,5,4,9] is provided, which also works.

So, choosing a_1 larger than max(x_i) and then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i seems to work.

Wait, in this case, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's see:

a_1=5.

a_2=5+2=7.

a_3=7+4=11.

a_4=11+1=12.

This matches the sequence I just constructed.

But in the first test case, the example output is a=[3,5,4,9], which doesn't follow this pattern.

So, perhaps there are multiple solutions, and I can choose a_1 arbitrarily, as long as it's >=1 and <=10^9.

But I need to find a general method that works for any input within the constraints.

Let me try to generalize the approach.

I can start by setting a_1 to any value between 1 and 10^9, but it's easier to choose a specific value.

From the problem statement, it seems that choosing a_1 to be greater than x_1 might help.

Wait, in the first test case, a_1=3 and x_1=2, so a_1 > x_1.

In the second test case, a_1=2 and x_1=1, a_1 > x_1.

In the third test case, a_1=5 and x_1=4, a_1 > x_1.

In the fourth test case, a_1=501 and x_1=500, a_1 > x_1.

In the fifth test case, a_1=2 and x_1=1, a_1 > x_1.

So, in all examples, a_1 > x_1.

Maybe setting a_1 > x_1 is a good strategy.

If a_1 > x_1, then a_2 % a_1 = x_2 implies a_2 = k*a_1 + x_2 for some k >=1.

To minimize a_2, set k=1, so a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

Then, a_3 = a_2 + x_3.

And so on.

Let's see if this works in general.

Assume a_1 > x_1.

Set a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

Then, a_2 % a_1 = (a_1 + x_2) % a_1 = x_2, which matches.

Similarly, a_3 = a_2 + x_3.

Then, a_3 % a_2 = (a_2 + x_3) % a_2 = x_3.

And so on.

So, this seems to work.

Therefore, a general method is:

1. Set a_1 to any value greater than x_1, say a_1 = x_1 + 1.

2. For each i from 2 to n, set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

This ensures that a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i for all i from 2 to n.

Also, since a_i increases by x_i at each step, and x_i <=500, and n can be up to 500, the maximum a_i would be a_1 + sum of x_i.

Given that a_1 <=10^9 and sum of x_i is at most 500*500=250,000, a_i will stay within 10^9.

Wait, but in the first test case, a_1=3, x=[2,4,1], sum is 7, so a_4=3+2+4+1=10, which is fine.

In the second test case, a_1=2, x=[1,1], sum=2, a_3=2+1+1=4, which matches the example output a=[2,3,4].

But in the first test case, the example output is a=[3,5,4,9], which doesn't follow a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Wait, a_1=3, a_2=5 (which is not equal to a_1 + x_1=3+2=5), a_3=4 (not equal to 5+4=9), a_4=9 (not equal to 4+1=5).

Wait, actually, in the example, a_3=4, which is less than a_2=5, so a_3 % a_2 =4%5=4, which matches x_3=4.

Similarly, a_4=9, which is greater than a_3=4, so a_4 % a_3=9%4=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, in this case, a_i is not strictly increasing, which is fine.

But in my earlier approach, I assumed a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, which makes a_i strictly increasing.

But the problem allows a_i to be any value between 1 and 10^9, so it's acceptable for a_i to be less than a_{i-1}.

But in my earlier approach, setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i ensures that a_i > a_{i-1} if x_i >0, which is true since x_i >=1.

But in the example, a_3=4 < a_2=5, which still satisfies a_3 % a_2 =4%5=4.

So, my approach works, but the example has a different sequence.

Anyway, as long as I can find any a that satisfies the conditions, I can choose a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

Now, let's see what the given program does.

The program is:

def func():

for _ in range(int(input())):

n = int(input())

x = list(map(int, input().split()))

a = [0] * n

a[0] = 1000

for i in range(1, n):

a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]

print(*a)

So, for each test case, it reads n and the array x of size n-1.

It initializes a array of size n with all zeros.

Sets a[0] = 1000.

Then, for i from 1 to n-1, sets a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1].

Finally, prints the a array.

Now, let's see if this is correct.

From my earlier reasoning, setting a_1 to any value greater than x_1 and then setting a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n should work.

In this program, a[0] = 1000, which is greater than x_1, assuming x_1 <=500.

Wait, x is of size n-1, i.e., x_2 to x_n.

But x_1 is x[0].

Wait, no, in the problem, x is x_2 to x_n.

So, x has n-1 elements: x_2, x_3, ..., x_n.

In the code, x = list(map(int, input().split())) reads n-1 integers.

Then, a = [0]*n

a[0] = 1000

a[1] = a[0] + x[0] = 1000 + x_2

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, I set a_1 arbitrarily, then a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

But in the code, a[0] = 1000, a[1] = a[0] + x[0], which would be a_1 + x_2.

Wait, but in the problem, a_1 is a[0], a_2 is a[1], and x[0] is x_2.

So, a[1] = a[0] + x[0], which is a_2 = a_1 + x_2.

Similarly, a[2] = a[1] + x[1] = a_1 + x_2 + x_3.

And so on.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, I set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, starting from a_1 > x_1.

But in this code, a[0] = 1000, which is a_1, and then a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1], which seems correct.

Wait, but in the first test case, x=[2,4,1], so n=4.

Then, a[0]=1000, a[1]=1000+2=1002, a[2]=1002+4=1006, a[3]=1006+1=1007.

Then, check:

a_2 % a_1 =1002 % 1000=2, which matches x_2=2.

a_3 % a_2=1006 % 1002=4, which matches x_3=4.

a_4 % a_3=1007 % 1006=1, which matches x_4=1.

So, this works.

Similarly, in the second test case, x=[1,1], n=3.

a[0]=1000, a[1]=1000+1=1001, a[2]=1001+1=1002.

Check:

1001 % 1000=1, matches x_2=1.

1002 % 1001=1, matches x_3=1.

So, correct.

In the third test case, x=[4,2,5,1,2], n=6.

a[0]=1000, a[1]=1000+4=1004, a[2]=1004+2=1006, a[3]=1006+5=1011, a[4]=1011+1=1012, a[5]=1012+2=1014.

Check:

1004 % 1000=4, matches x_2=4.

1006 % 1004=2, matches x_3=2.

1011 % 1006=5, matches x_4=5.

1012 % 1011=1, matches x_5=1.

1014 % 1012=2, matches x_6=2.

So, correct.

In the fourth test case, x=[500], n=2.

a[0]=1000, a[1]=1000+500=1500.

Check:

1500 % 1000=500, matches x_2=500.

Correct.

In the fifth test case, x=[1,5], n=3.

a[0]=1000, a[1]=1000+1=1001, a[2]=1001+5=1006.

Check:

1001 % 1000=1, matches x_2=1.

1006 % 1001=5, matches x_3=5.

Correct.

So, in all examples, this approach works.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Hence, the answer is Correctness: **True**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: } \text{True}} \]
