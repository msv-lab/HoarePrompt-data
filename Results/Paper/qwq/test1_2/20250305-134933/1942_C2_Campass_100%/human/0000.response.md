Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bessie has a regular polygon with n sides, and she's already chosen x vertices. I need to choose up to y additional vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

First, I need to understand what a regular polygon is and how choosing vertices affects the division into triangles. A regular polygon has all sides and angles equal, and its vertices are evenly spaced. In this problem, the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise manner.

Bessie has chosen x vertices, and I can choose up to y more. The total number of vertices we can use is x + y. The goal is to connect these vertices with non-intersecting diagonals to form as many triangles as possible.

I recall that in a polygon, the number of triangles formed by drawing non-intersecting diagonals is related to the number of sides minus 2. For example, a quadrilateral (4 sides) can be divided into 2 triangles, a pentagon into 3, and so on. But in this problem, not all vertices are necessarily used, only the ones chosen by Bessie and me.

So, if we have k vertices chosen, the number of triangles formed would be k - 2, assuming they form a convex polygon and the diagonals are drawn appropriately. But wait, in this problem, the vertices are on a regular polygon, which is convex, so that should hold.

Given that, if Bessie chooses x vertices and I choose y more, making a total of x + y vertices, the number of triangles should be (x + y) - 2. But the problem mentions that I can choose up to y vertices, so I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing the optimal number of vertices up to y.

However, there's a catch. The vertices are on a polygon, and the diagonals must not intersect inside the polygon. So, the way I choose the vertices and draw the diagonals matters.

Let me think differently. Maybe I need to consider the cycles formed by the chosen vertices. In a convex polygon, choosing any set of vertices and connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals will divide the polygon into triangles and possibly other polygons, but the total number of triangles can be calculated based on the number of vertices.

Wait, there's a formula in polygon triangulation. For a convex polygon with k vertices, the number of triangles formed by triangulation is k - 2. But in this problem, not all vertices are necessarily connected directly.

Perhaps I need to consider the cycles separately. If the chosen vertices form multiple cycles, each cycle can be triangulated separately.

But in a convex polygon, there's only one cycle, the outer boundary. So, maybe I need to consider the number of triangles in the triangulation of the subset of vertices chosen.

Let me try to find a different approach. Maybe I can think in terms of adding vertices one by one and seeing how the number of triangles increases.

Suppose I start with Bessie's x vertices. Let's see how many triangles I can form by adding up to y more vertices.

I need to maximize the number of triangles, so I should aim to maximize the number of vertices used, up to x + y.

But, perhaps there's a smarter way to choose which vertices to add to maximize the number of triangles.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the structure of the polygon and the positions of the chosen vertices.

Let me consider that the polygon is convex, so any diagonal lies entirely inside the polygon.

If I have a set of vertices, the number of triangles I can form by triangulating them is equal to the number of vertices minus 2.

So, if I choose x + y vertices, the number of triangles would be x + y - 2.

But, I need to make sure that the diagonals do not intersect inside the polygon.

Given that the polygon is convex, as long as the diagonals don't cross each other, it should be fine.

So, perhaps the maximum number of triangles is indeed x + y - 2.

But I need to confirm if this is always achievable.

Let me look at an example.

Take the first test case:

n = 8, x = 4, y = 2

Bessie chose vertices: 1, 6, 2, 5

So, total vertices we can use: 4 + 2 = 6

According to the formula, number of triangles would be 6 - 2 = 4.

But in the example, it says the output is 6.

Wait, that doesn't match. So, maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps there's something wrong with my approach.

Let me think again.

Maybe the number of triangles is not just x + y - 2.

Perhaps I need to consider the internal structure.

Let me consider that in a convex polygon, the number of triangles in a triangulation is always n - 2, where n is the number of vertices.

But in this problem, we are choosing subsets of vertices and connecting them with non-intersecting diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed relative to the entire polygon.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of adding ears to the polygon.

In computational geometry, there's the two ears theorem, which says that any convex polygon with at least 3 vertices has at least two ears, and triangulation can be done by iteratively cutting off ears.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Let me consider a different perspective.

Suppose I have a set of vertices, and I want to connect them with non-intersecting diagonals to form as many triangles as possible.

Each triangle uses three vertices and contributes one triangle to the count.

So, to maximize the number of triangles, I need to maximize the number of such triplets of vertices that form triangles without any intersecting diagonals.

But this seems a bit vague.

Perhaps I should look for a way to calculate the maximum number of triangles based on the number of vertices and the way they are connected.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of triangles per cycle.

In a convex polygon, each cycle with k vertices can be triangulated into k - 2 triangles.

So, if all the chosen vertices form one single cycle, then the number of triangles is (x + y) - 2.

But in the first test case, x + y = 6, which would give 4 triangles, but the example output is 6.

So, perhaps there are multiple cycles.

Wait, in the example, maybe there are multiple cycles.

Looking back at the example, with n=8, x=4 (vertices 1,6,2,5), and y=2.

If I choose two more vertices, say 3 and 7, perhaps the chosen vertices form multiple cycles.

But in a convex polygon, with all vertices on the boundary, there should be only one cycle.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Let me consider that when we choose vertices, we can have vertices both on the boundary and inside, but in a convex polygon, all vertices are on the boundary.

Wait, no, in this problem, all vertices are on the boundary since it's a regular polygon.

So, perhaps I need to consider the way the diagonals are drawn.

Maybe the number of triangles is not just (number of vertices) - 2.

Perhaps there's a different way to count it.

Let me try to think recursively.

Suppose I have a set of vertices, and I choose one diagonal, which splits the set into two smaller sets.

Then, the total number of triangles is the sum of triangles in each smaller set minus the triangle formed by the diagonal.

Wait, that seems off.

Let me recall that in a triangulation of a convex polygon with n vertices, the number of triangles is n - 2.

But in this problem, we are choosing a subset of vertices and triangulating them, so perhaps it's similar.

But in the first test case, with x + y = 6, it should be 6 - 2 = 4 triangles, but the example output is 6.

So, clearly, my assumption is wrong.

Maybe I need to consider adding vertices in such a way that maximizes the number of triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that choosing a vertex can split existing regions into more triangles.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I start with the entire polygon, which has n vertices.

If I triangulate it fully, I get n - 2 triangles.

But in this problem, I can only choose x + y vertices to form the triangulation.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is related to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of faces they form.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the Euler formula for planar graphs.

Euler's formula states that V - E + F = 2, where V is the number of vertices, E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces (including the outer face).

In a triangulated planar graph, each face is a triangle, except possibly the outer face.

But in this problem, we are dealing with a convex polygon, so the outer face is the boundary of the polygon.

If I have k chosen vertices, and I triangulate them, the number of triangles should be k - 2.

But again, in the first test case, k = 6, which would give 4 triangles, but the example output is 6.

So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the number of triangles is not just k - 2.

Perhaps I need to consider that some triangles might be formed by choosing vertices in such a way that they create internal triangles.

Let me try to visualize the first test case.

n = 8, x = 4 (vertices 1,6,2,5), y = 2.

So, total vertices we can use: 6.

If I choose vertices 1,2,5,6, plus two more, say 3 and 7.

Now, I need to connect them with non-intersecting diagonals to form as many triangles as possible.

Perhaps I can form more than 4 triangles.

Wait, maybe some triangles are formed by the outer polygon and some by internal diagonals.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that some triangles are formed by the chosen vertices and some by the original polygon's edges.

This is getting complicated.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of connected components formed by the chosen vertices.

In a convex polygon, the chosen vertices form one connected component, so the number of triangles would be x + y - 1.

But in the first test case, that would be 6 - 1 = 5, which still doesn't match the example output of 6.

Hmm.

Perhaps I need to consider that some chosen vertices allow for more triangles to be formed.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of adding vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

Let me consider that each additional vertex I choose can potentially add more triangles.

If I choose a vertex inside an existing polygon, it can split that polygon into more triangles.

But in this problem, all vertices are on the boundary, so perhaps that doesn't apply.

Wait, in a convex polygon, all vertices are on the boundary, so choosing more vertices allows for more diagonals and thus more triangles.

But again, according to the formula, it should be x + y - 2, but the example suggests 6 triangles for x + y = 6.

So, perhaps there's a different way to count it.

Maybe I need to consider that some chosen vertices allow for multiple triangles to be formed around them.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of triangles is related to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle without any other chosen vertex inside.

But that seems too vague.

Let me try to think in terms of the number of ears.

In computational geometry, an ear is a triangle formed by three consecutive vertices in a polygon such that the triangle lies entirely inside the polygon.

The two ears theorem states that any convex polygon with at least three sides has at least two ears.

Triangulating a polygon by repeatedly cutting off ears can lead to a triangulation.

But I'm not sure how to apply this directly to maximize the number of triangles.

Perhaps I need to consider that each time I choose a vertex, I can form more ears.

But this seems too indirect.

Let me try to look for a pattern in the example.

In the first test case, x = 4, y = 2, total vertices = 6, output = 6.

If I have 6 vertices, and I need to form 6 triangles, that suggests that perhaps the way the vertices are connected forms a structure with more triangles than just 6 - 2 = 4.

Maybe there are overlapping triangles or something.

Wait, but the problem says to count the number of triangular pieces of cake, meaning distinct triangles formed by the diagonals.

Perhaps in some configurations, choosing vertices in a certain way allows for more triangles to be formed.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that some triangles are formed by the intersection of diagonals.

But the problem specifies that the diagonals must be non-intersecting inside the polygon.

So, their interiors don't overlap.

Therefore, each triangle is distinct and non-overlapping.

Given that, the total area of the polygon is divided into these triangles.

In that case, the number of triangles should be equal to the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

But again, in the first test case, that would be 6 - 2 = 4, which doesn't match the output of 6.

So, clearly, my understanding is flawed.

Maybe I need to consider that some triangles share edges with the outer polygon.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different when some vertices are chosen and others are not.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the cycles formed by the chosen vertices.

In a convex polygon, the chosen vertices form one convex cycle.

In that case, the number of triangles should still be the number of chosen vertices minus 2.

But again, that doesn't match the example.

Maybe I need to consider that the chosen vertices divide the polygon into multiple parts.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices and the original polygon's edges.

Alternatively, maybe I need to think about the dual graph of the triangulation.

This is getting too complicated.

Let me try to look for a different approach.

Perhaps I can consider that each time I choose a vertex, I can form more triangles.

If I start with x vertices, and add y more, perhaps there's a way to calculate the maximum number of triangles based on how these vertices are distributed.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the gaps between the chosen vertices.

Since the polygon is convex and regular, the vertices are evenly spaced.

If I have x vertices chosen by Bessie, and I can choose y more, I need to select y vertices such that the number of triangles is maximized.

Perhaps I need to maximize the number of small cycles formed.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of triangles by minimizing the sizes of the cycles formed.

In other words, choosing vertices in such a way that the cycles are as small as possible, which would maximize the number of triangles.

But in a convex polygon, the cycles are determined by the chosen vertices, and the smallest cycles are triangles.

So, perhaps I need to maximize the number of triangles by maximizing the number of chosen vertices, up to x + y.

But again, according to the formula, that would be x + y - 2, which doesn't match the example.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that some chosen vertices allow for more triangles to be formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of boundary components.

But in a convex polygon, there's only one boundary component, so it would still be x + y - 1, which still doesn't match the example.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Let me try to look at the second test case.

n = 7, x = 3, y = 1

Chosen vertices: 6,4,3

Total chosen vertices: 4

According to the formula, number of triangles should be 4 - 2 = 2.

But the example output is 5.

Again, doesn't match.

So, clearly, my assumption is incorrect.

Perhaps I need to consider that the number of triangles is not just x + y - 2.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have a convex polygon with n vertices, and I choose k vertices.

I need to connect them with non-intersecting diagonals to form as many triangles as possible.

I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing up to y additional vertices.

I need a formula that, given x and y, tells me the maximum number of triangles I can form.

But since the examples don't match the expected formula, I must be misunderstanding something fundamental.

Maybe I need to consider that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of faces in the triangulation.

Wait, in planar graphs, F = E - V + 2.

But in a triangulation, E = 3F / 2, since each face has 3 edges, but each edge is shared by two faces.

Wait, perhaps I need to derive the number of triangles based on the number of chosen vertices and the number of edges between them.

But this seems too involved.

Let me consider a small example.

Take n = 4, x = 2, y = 2.

Bessie chooses 2 vertices, and I can choose 2 more, totaling 4 vertices.

According to the formula, number of triangles should be 4 - 2 = 2.

And the example output is 2.

Okay, so in this case, it matches.

But in the first two test cases, it doesn't.

Wait, maybe the formula is different when x is less than n.

Wait, in the first test case, x = 4, y = 2, n = 8.

Total chosen vertices: 6.

Number of triangles: 6 - 2 = 4, but example output is 6.

So, it doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of connected components formed by the chosen vertices.

In a convex polygon, all chosen vertices are connected, so it's one connected component.

Thus, number of triangles = x + y - 1.

But in the first test case, that would be 6 - 1 = 5, but the example output is 6.

Still doesn't match.

Perhaps I need to consider that some chosen vertices allow for more triangles by creating internal triangles.

Wait, but all vertices are on the boundary, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that choosing vertices in certain positions allows for more overlapping triangles.

But the problem specifies non-intersecting diagonals, so the triangles don't overlap.

I'm really stuck here.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach altogether.

Let me consider that the number of triangles is equal to the number of chosen vertices minus the number of sides of the outer polygon that are used.

But that seems arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the number of diagonals drawn and relate that to the number of triangles.

I know that in a triangulation, the number of triangles is equal to the number of diagonals plus 1.

Wait, in a convex polygon with n vertices, the number of diagonals in a triangulation is n - 3, and the number of triangles is n - 2.

But again, in this problem, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that for x + y vertices, the number of diagonals is x + y - 3, and the number of triangles is x + y - 2.

But in the first test case, that would be 6 - 2 = 4, but the example output is 6.

This is confusing.

Maybe I need to consider that some diagonals are already present in the polygon, and choosing vertices adds more diagonals.

But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about how triangles are formed.

Each triangle is formed by three chosen vertices connected by diagonals, and these diagonals don't intersect inside the polygon.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices that form a triangle without any other chosen vertex inside.

But in a convex polygon, all triangles are strictly convex, and no triangle contains another chosen vertex inside, since all vertices are on the boundary.

So, perhaps the number of triangles is equal to the number of triples of chosen vertices.

But that can't be right, because not all triples will form a triangle without intersecting other diagonals.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the number of ears in the chosen vertices.

In computational geometry, an ear is a triangle formed by three consecutive chosen vertices that lie entirely inside the polygon.

According to the two ears theorem, any convex polygon with at least three sides has at least two ears.

Triangulating the polygon by iteratively cutting off ears will result in n - 2 triangles.

But again, that brings me back to the same formula.

I'm clearly missing something here.

Maybe I need to consider that the number of triangles is not just x + y - 2, but something else.

Let me look for a different pattern.

In the first test case, output is 6.

In the third test case, n=4, x=2, y=2, output is 2.

In the second test case, n=7, x=3, y=1, output is 5.

Wait, maybe the number of triangles is related to the number of ways to choose triples of vertices minus some adjustment.

But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that each chosen vertex can be part of multiple triangles.

Wait, perhaps I need to maximize the number of triangles by choosing vertices that are surrounded by as many other chosen vertices as possible.

But I'm not sure.

This is really puzzling.

Maybe I need to accept that my initial approach is incorrect and look for a different way to tackle the problem.

Let me consider that the problem is about choosing y vertices to maximize the number of triangles formed with the x vertices already chosen by Bessie.

Perhaps I need to consider the positions of the chosen vertices and see how adding more vertices increases the number of triangles.

But considering that n can be up to 10^9 and x can be up to 2*10^5 per test case, I need an efficient algorithm.

Wait, perhaps I can sort the chosen vertices and calculate the gaps between them.

In a convex polygon, the gaps between chosen vertices can tell me how many additional vertices I can place in those gaps.

Let me try that.

Suppose I have x chosen vertices. I can sort them and calculate the differences between consecutive vertices, considering the polygon is cyclic.

So, for example, in the first test case:

n=8, x=4, y=2

Chosen vertices: 1,6,2,5

Sort them: 1,2,5,6

The gaps are:

between 1 and 2: 1

between 2 and 5: 3

between 5 and 6: 1

between 6 and 1 (wrap around): 2

So, the gaps are [1,3,1,2]

Now, perhaps I can choose to place additional vertices in these gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

Each gap of size c can have up to c vertices placed in it.

Each such vertex added can increase the number of triangles.

But how?

Wait, perhaps each vertex added to a gap of size c can split that gap into two smaller gaps, thereby potentially increasing the number of triangles.

But I need to maximize the number of triangles.

Let me think about how adding a vertex to a gap affects the number of triangles.

Suppose I have a gap of size c between two chosen vertices.

If I add a vertex in that gap, it splits the gap into two smaller gaps, say a and b, where a + b = c - 1.

Then, adding that vertex can potentially create more triangles.

But I need to find a way to maximize the number of triangles by choosing where to place the y vertices in these gaps.

This seems promising.

Perhaps I can model this as placing y vertices into the gaps to maximize some function related to the number of triangles.

But I need to find out what that function is.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each gap of size c can contribute a certain number of triangles based on how many vertices are placed in it.

If I have a gap of size c, and I place k vertices in it, then the number of triangles formed in that gap could be k + 1.

Wait, let's see.

If I have a gap of size c, and I place k vertices in it, then the number of triangles formed in that gap would be k + 1.

Because each vertex added divides the gap and forms one more triangle.

So, for example, with k=0, no vertices, 1 triangle; k=1, 2 triangles; etc.

But in reality, it might be different.

Wait, perhaps for a gap of size c, placing k vertices in it allows for k + 1 triangles in that gap.

If that's the case, then the total number of triangles would be the sum over all gaps of (k_i + 1), where k_i is the number of vertices placed in gap i.

But I need to confirm if this is accurate.

Let me test this with the first test case.

Gaps: [1,3,1,2]

If I place 2 vertices in these gaps, say 1 in the second gap and 1 in the fourth gap, then:

Gap 1: k=0 → 1 triangle

Gap 2: k=1 → 2 triangles

Gap 3: k=0 → 1 triangle

Gap 4: k=1 → 2 triangles

Total triangles: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, which matches the first test case.

Similarly, in the second test case:

n=7, x=3, y=1

Chosen vertices: 6,4,3

Sort them: 3,4,6

Gaps: between 3 and 4: 1

between 4 and 6: 2

between 6 and 3 (wrap around): 4

Gaps: [1,2,4]

Place y=1 vertex in one of these gaps.

If I place it in the gap of size 4, then:

Gap 1: k=0 → 1

Gap 2: k=0 → 1

Gap 3: k=1 → 2

Total: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, but the example output is 5.

Wait, doesn't match.

Alternatively, if I place it in the gap of size 2:

Gap 1: k=0 → 1

Gap 2: k=1 → 2

Gap 3: k=0 → 1

Total: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4, still not 5.

Wait, maybe placing in the gap of size 4 allows for more triangles.

Wait, perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps each gap of size c can have up to floor(c / 2) vertices placed in it without causing intersecting diagonals.

Wait, perhaps that's the constraint.

In each gap of size c, I can place up to floor((c - 1) / 2) vertices.

Then, the number of triangles in that gap would be floor((c + 1) / 2).

Wait, let's see.

If I have a gap of size c, and I place floor((c - 1) / 2) vertices in it, then the number of triangles would be floor((c + 1) / 2).

For example, in a gap of size 1: floor((1 + 1)/2) = 1 triangle

Gap of size 2: floor((2 + 1)/2
