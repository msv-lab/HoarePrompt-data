Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are n signs of the apocalypse, and each sign occurs every a_i years. The signs have to occur sequentially, meaning that after the first sign occurs, we start waiting for the second sign in the next year, and so on, up to the nth sign.

First, I need to understand how these signs occur. Each sign i occurs in years that are multiples of a_i, like a_i, 2*a_i, 3*a_i, and so on. But they have to occur in sequence, where each subsequent sign occurs after the previous one.

So, for example, if n=2 and a=[2, 3], the first sign occurs in years 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Then, after the first sign occurs, say in year 2, we start waiting for the second sign in year 3 onwards. The second sign occurs in years 3, 6, 9, etc. So, in this case, the second sign occurs in year 3, which is after the first sign in year 2. So, the apocalypse would happen in year 3.

Wait, but according to the problem, we need all n signs to occur sequentially. In this example, n=2, so the second sign occurs in year 3, which is after the first sign in year 2. So, the apocalypse happens in year 3.

Another example from the problem:

Input:

3 2 4 5 9 18

5

1 2 3 4 5

5

1 1 1 1 1

6

50 30 711 200 503 1006

Output:

36

2012

Looking at the first test case:

n=6, a=[3,2,4,5,9,18]

The output is 36.

Let me see how they arrived at 36.

Start with year 0.

Wait for the first sign, which occurs in years 3,6,9,...

So, the first sign occurs in year 3.

Then, starting from year 4, wait for the second sign, which occurs in years 2,4,6,...

The second sign occurs in year 4.

Then, starting from year 5, wait for the third sign, which occurs in years 4,8,12,...

Wait, but year 4 has already passed, so the next occurrence is in year 8.

Wait, but according to the note in the problem, for the first test case:

- Wait for the first sign in year 3

- Wait for the second sign in year 4 (since year 2 has already passed)

- Wait for the third sign in year 8 (since year 4 has already passed)

- Wait for the fourth sign in year 10 (since year 5 has already passed)

- Wait for the fifth sign in year 18 (since year 9 has already passed)

- Wait for the sixth sign in year 36 (since year 18 has already passed)

So, it seems that for each sign, we find the smallest year where the sign occurs after the previous sign's year.

So, for sign 1: occurs in year 3

Then, for sign 2: occurs in year 4 (since 2 is already past year 3, so next is 4)

Then, for sign 3: occurs in year 8 (since 4 is after year 4)

Then, for sign 4: occurs in year 10 (since 5 is after year 8)

Then, for sign 5: occurs in year 18 (since 9 is after year 10)

Then, for sign 6: occurs in year 36 (since 18 is after year 18, so next is 36)

Wait, but 18 is equal to the previous year, so it should be the next multiple, which is 36.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- Start from year 0

- For each sign i from 1 to n:

- Find the smallest year where sign i occurs, which is greater than the year where sign i-1 occurs.

- Update the current year to this year.

So, mathematically, for each sign i, find the smallest year y_i such that y_i > y_{i-1} and y_i is a multiple of a_i.

Then, the year when the nth sign occurs is y_n.

So, in code, we can iterate through each sign, and for each sign, calculate the next year when it occurs after the previous year.

Let's think about how to calculate the next year when a sign occurs after a given year.

Given a sign with period a_i, and a starting year y, the next occurrence after y is ceil(y / a_i) * a_i.

For example, if y=3 and a_i=2, then ceil(3/2)=2, 2*2=4.

Similarly, y=8, a_i=4, ceil(8/4)=2, 2*4=8.

If y=9, a_i=5, ceil(9/5)=2, 2*5=10.

This seems correct.

So, in code, for each sign, we can calculate the next year as:

if y % a_i == 0:

next_y = y + a_i

else:

next_y = (y // a_i + 1) * a_i

Then set y = next_y

Do this for all signs, and the final y is the year when the nth sign occurs.

Looking at the provided program:

t = int(input().strip())

test_cases = []

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input().strip())

a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

test_cases.append((n, a))

results = func_1(t, test_cases)

for result in results:

print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):

results = []

for test in test_cases:

(n, a) = test

current_year = 0

for ai in a:

if current_year % ai == 0:

next_year = current_year + ai

else:

next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai

current_year = next_year

results.append(current_year)

return results

This seems to match exactly what I just described.

It iterates through each test case, then for each test case, it initializes current_year to 0, and for each sign's period ai, it calculates the next year when the sign occurs after the current_year, and updates current_year to that next_year.

Finally, it collects all results and prints them.

So, based on my reasoning, this program should correctly solve the problem.

Therefore, the correctness is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
