Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. Rosie has a phone with multiple screens, each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's a 5x3 grid. Each screen can hold icons of two types: some icons are 1x1, meaning they take up one cell, and others are 2x2, meaning they take up a 2x2 square of cells. The goal is to place all the icons on the minimum number of screens possible.

First, I need to figure out how many icons of each type there are. The input gives me the numbers x and y, where x is the number of 1x1 icons and y is the number of 2x2 icons.

Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, so that's 15 cells in total. But since some icons take up more than one cell, I need to account for that.

A 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, but I have to make sure that these 4 cells are arranged in a 2x2 square. Given the grid is 5x3, I need to see how many 2x2 squares can fit into this grid.

Let me visualize the grid:

Rows: 1 2 3 4 5

Columns: A B C

So the cells are:

1A 1B 1C

2A 2B 2C

3A 3B 3C

4A 4B 4C

5A 5B 5C

Now, a 2x2 square can be placed starting at positions:

1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B

So, there are 8 possible positions for 2x2 icons.

But, since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, placing one at, say, 1A would occupy 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B.

Similarly, placing one at 1B would occupy 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C.

And so on.

Now, I need to maximize the number of 2x2 icons on each screen to minimize the number of screens used.

Given that each screen can hold up to 8 possible 2x2 icons, but of course, they can't overlap.

Wait, but in reality, because of the overlapping restrictions, I need to see how many non-overlapping 2x2 squares can fit into the 5x3 grid.

Let me try to count that.

If I place one 2x2 icon at 1A, it occupies 1A,1B,2A,2B.

Then, I can place another at 3A, occupying 3A,3B,4A,4B.

Then, possibly another at 1C, but wait, 1C would overlap with 1B if I already have one at 1A.

Wait, no, 1C is separate from 1B in column C.

Wait, but 1C would be adjacent to 1B, but since the 2x2 icon at 1A occupies 1B and 2B, placing another at 1C would occupy 1C,1B,2C,2B.

Wait, but 1B and 2B are already occupied by the first icon, so I can't place another icon at 1C.

So, perhaps only two 2x2 icons can fit per screen without overlapping.

Wait, let's try to visualize:

- Place one 2x2 at 1A: occupies 1A,1B,2A,2B

- Place another at 3A: occupies 3A,3B,4A,4B

- Place another at 1C: but as we saw, this overlaps with 1B and 2B, which are already occupied.

- Alternatively, place another at 2C: occupies 2C,2B,3C,3B

But 2B and 3B are already occupied by the first two icons.

So, perhaps only two 2x2 icons can fit per screen.

Wait, maybe I need to find a better arrangement.

Let me try:

- Place one 2x2 at 1A: occupies 1A,1B,2A,2B

- Place another at 2C: occupies 2C,2B,3C,3B

Wait, but 2B is already occupied by the first icon, so conflict.

- Alternatively, place second 2x2 at 3A: occupies 3A,3B,4A,4B

- Then, place third at 4C: occupies 4C,4B,5C,5B

This seems possible because there's no overlap.

So, in this arrangement, three 2x2 icons can fit into one screen.

Let me check:

- 2x2 at 1A: 1A,1B,2A,2B

- 2x2 at 3A: 3A,3B,4A,4B

- 2x2 at 4C: 4C,4B,5C,5B

Looks good, no overlapping cells.

Is it possible to fit a fourth 2x2 icon?

Let's see:

- Possible position: 1C: occupies 1C,1B,2C,2B

But 1B and 2B are already occupied by the first and second icons.

- Position 5A: 5A,5B,4A,4B

But 4A and 4B are already occupied by the second icon.

- Position 2C: already tried, conflict with 2B.

- Position 3C: occupies 3C,3B,4C,4B

But 3B and 4B are already occupied.

So, seems like only three 2x2 icons can fit per screen.

Therefore, each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, using up 12 cells (3 icons * 4 cells each = 12 cells), leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

Wait, but 15 - 12 = 3 cells.

So, per screen:

- Up to three 2x2 icons

- Up to three 1x1 icons

Alternatively, if I don't use any 2x2 icons, I can have up to 15 1x1 icons per screen.

Or, any combination in between, as long as the total cells used don't exceed 15.

So, the strategy to minimize the number of screens is to maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, since they occupy more cells.

So, for y 2x2 icons, I need to distribute them across screens, with each screen holding up to three 2x2 icons.

Then, for the remaining cells, I can place 1x1 icons.

Wait, but I also have x 1x1 icons to place.

So, first, I need to see how many screens are needed just for the 2x2 icons.

Since each screen can hold up to three 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons is ceil(y / 3).

Then, for each screen, after placing the 2x2 icons, I can place 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Each screen has 15 cells in total.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells.

So, if I place k 2x2 icons on a screen, I use up 4k cells, leaving 15 - 4k cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen, the number of 1x1 icons that can be placed is 15 - 4k, where k is the number of 2x2 icons on that screen.

Now, to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, up to three per screen.

So, I can calculate the number of screens needed for y 2x2 icons as ceil(y / 3).

Then, for the remaining 1x1 icons, I need to see how many additional screens are required.

But, since each screen can hold some 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons, I need to account for that.

Wait, but in the initial screens used for 2x2 icons, I can also place some 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on all screens are sum over all screens of (15 - 4 * k_screen), where k_screen is the number of 2x2 icons on that screen.

But to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, which is up to three per screen.

So, if I have y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed for them is ceil(y / 3).

Then, on each of these screens, I can place additional 1x1 icons in the remaining cells.

Each screen with k 2x2 icons can hold 15 - 4k 1x1 icons.

So, if I have s screens for the 2x2 icons, and on each screen I place min(x, 15 - 4k) 1x1 icons, then I can reduce the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

This seems a bit complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to model this.

Let me think in terms of total cells.

Each screen has 15 cells.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells.

Each 1x1 icon uses 1 cell.

But, due to the grid structure, I can't just treat them as individual cells because of the way 2x2 icons occupy a square.

So, I need to consider the constraints of placing 2x2 icons in non-overlapping positions.

Earlier, I concluded that per screen, up to three 2x2 icons can be placed without overlapping, using up 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for y 2x2 icons, the number of screens needed is ceil(y / 3).

Then, the total number of cells used by these 2x2 icons is floor(y / 3) * 12 + min(y % 3, 3) * 4.

But, since each screen can hold up to 15 cells, and 3 2x2 icons use 12 cells, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, for each screen used for 2x2 icons, it can hold up to 15 - 4k 1x1 icons, where k is the number of 2x2 icons on that screen.

Wait, but to minimize the number of screens, I should maximize the number of 2x2 icons per screen, i.e., k=3 per screen.

So, per screen: 3*4=12 cells for 2x2 icons, leaving 3 cells for 1x1 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on these screens are s * 3, where s is the number of screens used for 2x2 icons.

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons are x - s*3.

These remaining 1x1 icons need to be placed on additional screens.

Each additional screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons.

So, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - s*3)/15).

Therefore, the total number of screens is s + ceil((x - s*3)/15).

Where s = ceil(y / 3).

But, I need to make sure that s is at least 1 if y > 0.

Also, if y == 0, then s = 0, and the total number of screens is ceil(x / 15).

Wait, but in the initial arrangement, with s screens for 2x2 icons, each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 icons and 3 1x1 icons.

So, total 1x1 icons that can be placed on these s screens is s * 3.

Then, the remaining 1x1 icons are x - s * 3.

If x - s * 3 > 0, then additional screens are needed, which is ceil((x - s * 3)/15).

Hence, total screens = s + ceil((x - s * 3)/15), where s = ceil(y / 3).

But, I need to implement this in code.

Looking at the given code:

def func():

a = int(input())

for i in range(a):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

z = (y + 1) // 2

m = 15 * z - y * 4

if m < a:

z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15

print(z)

Wait, this seems different from what I thought.

Let me try to understand the given code.

First, it reads the number of test cases, a.

Then, for each test case, it reads x and y.

Then, z = (y + 1) // 2

Wait, y is the number of 2x2 icons, and z is ceil(y / 2).

Because (y + 1) // 2 is integer division equivalent to ceil(y / 2).

Then, m = 15 * z - y * 4

This seems to calculate the remaining cells available after placing y 2x2 icons on z screens.

Since each screen has 15 cells, z screens have 15*z cells.

Each 2x2 icon uses 4 cells, so y*4 cells are used.

Thus, m = 15*z - y*4 is the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons.

Then, if m < a:

Wait, a is the number of test cases, which doesn't make sense here.

Probably, it should be m < x, meaning if the remaining cells are less than the number of 1x1 icons.

Then, z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15

This seems to calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Wait, but m is the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons.

So, x - m is the number of 1x1 icons that can't be placed on the initial z screens.

Then, the number of additional screens needed is ceil((x - m)/15).

Which is equivalent to (x - m + 14) // 15.

But in the code, it's (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15, which is (x - m + 14) // 15.

Wait, 15 - 1 = 14.

So, it's (x - m + 14) // 15.

Which is correct for ceil((x - m)/15).

Then, z = z + additional_screens.

Finally, print(z).

But, is this logic correct?

Let me verify with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

Input:

1

1 1

Output:

1

According to the code:

z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1

m = 15*1 - 1*4 = 11

Since m = 11 >= x = 1, so no additional screens needed.

Thus, z = 1, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

7 2

Output:

1

According to the code:

z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1

m = 15*1 - 2*4 = 15 - 8 = 7

x = 7, m = 7, so m >= x, no additional screens needed.

z = 1, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

12 4

Output:

2

According to the code:

z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2

m = 15*2 - 4*4 = 30 - 16 = 14

x = 12, m = 14 >= 12, no additional screens needed.

z = 2, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

0 3

Output:

2

According to the code:

z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2

m = 15*2 - 3*4 = 30 - 12 = 18

x = 0, m = 18 >= 0, no additional screens needed.

z = 2, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

1 0

Output:

1

According to the code:

z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0

m = 15*0 - 0*4 = 0

x = 1, m = 0 < a = 1

So, z = 0 + (1 - 0 + 14) // 15 = 0 + 15 // 15 = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

8 1

Output:

1

According to the code:

z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1

m = 15*1 - 1*4 = 15 - 4 = 11

x = 8 <= 11, no additional screens needed.

z = 1, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

0 0

Output:

0

According to the code:

z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0

m = 15*0 - 0*4 = 0

x = 0, m = 0 >= 0, no additional screens needed.

z = 0, which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

2 0

Output:

1

According to the code:

z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0

m = 15*0 - 0*4 = 0

x = 2 > m = 0

So, z = 0 + (2 - 0 + 14) // 15 = 0 + 16 // 15 = 0 + 1 = 1

Which matches the output.

Another test case:

Input:

1

15 0

Output:

1

According to the code:

z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0

m = 15*0 - 0*4 = 0

x = 15 > m = 0

So, z = 0 + (15 - 0 + 14) // 15 = 0 + 29 // 15 = 0 + 2 = 2

Wait, but the output is 1.

Wait, there's a discrepancy here.

According to the example, input:

15 0

Output:

1

But according to the code, it would output 2.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, but looking back at the example outputs:

Input:

11

1 1

7 2

12 4

0 3

1 0

8 1

0 0

2 0

15 0

8 2

0 9

Output:

1

1

2

2

1

1

0

1

1

2

5

Wait, for input 15 0, output is 1, but according to the code, it would be 2.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

Wait, but maybe I miscounted.

Wait, in the example, for input 15 0, output is 1, but according to the code, it's calculating z = 0 + (15 - 0 + 14)//15 = 0 + 29//15 = 0 + 2 = 2, which doesn't match the example output of 1.

So, the code seems incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I missed something.

Wait, in the earlier reasoning, I assumed that each screen can hold up to 15 1x1 icons if no 2x2 icons are placed.

But in the code, it's calculating z based on the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, and then seeing if the remaining cells can accommodate the 1x1 icons.

But in the example, for input 15 0, output is 1, meaning that one screen can hold all 15 1x1 icons, which makes sense.

So, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the code, for y=0, z=(0+1)//2=0, m=0, and if x=15 > m, then z=0 + (15-0+14)//15=0+29//15=0+2=2, which is different from the example output of 1.

So, the code is wrong.

Hence, Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the application icons given the constraints of screen size and icon sizes.

### Approach

1. **Understanding the Screen Layout:**
   - Each screen is a grid of 5 rows and 3 columns, totaling 15 cells.
   - There are two types of icons: 1x1 icons (occupying one cell) and 2x2 icons (occupying four cells in a square).

2. **Optimal Placement Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of screens, prioritize placing as many 2x2 icons as possible since they occupy more space.
   - Each screen can hold a maximum of three 2x2 icons (using 12 cells) and leave space for three 1x1 icons.

3. **Calculating the Number of Screens:**
   - Calculate the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
   - Calculate the remaining space on these screens for 1x1 icons.
   - Determine additional screens required for any remaining 1x1 icons.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        # Calculate number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_y = (y + 2) // 3  # ceil(y / 3)
        # Calculate remaining cells for 1x1 icons on these screens
        cells_used_by_y = screens_for_y * 4 * (y // screens_for_y)
        remaining_cells = screens_for_y * 15 - cells_used_by_y
        # Calculate remaining x after placing on these screens
        remaining_x = x - remaining_cells
        if remaining_x > 0:
            # Calculate additional screens needed for remaining x
            additional_screens = (remaining_x + 14) // 15  # ceil(remaining_x / 15)
        else:
            additional_screens = 0
        # Total screens
        total_screens = screens_for_y + additional_screens
        print(total_screens)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input:**
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency, especially given the potential for large input sizes.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read the values of `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons).
   
3. **Calculating Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - Calculate the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons using `screens_for_y = (y + 2) // 3` which is equivalent to `ceil(y / 3)`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells for 1x1 Icons:**
   - Determine how many cells are used by the 2x2 icons on these screens.
   - Calculate the remaining cells on these screens available for 1x1 icons.

5. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - Subtract the number of remaining cells used for 1x1 icons from `x` to get `remaining_x`.
   - Calculate additional screens needed for any remaining 1x1 icons using `additional_screens = (remaining_x + 14) // 15` which is equivalent to `ceil(remaining_x / 15)`.

6. **Output the Total Screens:**
   - Sum the screens used for 2x2 icons and any additional screens for 1x1 icons to get the total number of screens required for each test case.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently placing icons to minimize the number of screens used while handling multiple test cases effectively.
