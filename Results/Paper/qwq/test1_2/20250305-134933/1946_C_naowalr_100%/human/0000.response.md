Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I've worked with before, but I need to make sure I understand everything correctly. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least x vertices. My task is to find the maximum possible x that allows me to do this.

Okay, so a tree is an undirected graph with no cycles, and it has exactly n-1 edges for n vertices. That's a crucial point because it means that removing any edge will split the tree into two separate components.

The goal is to remove exactly k edges, and after removal, each resulting connected component should have at least x vertices. I need to maximize x.

I see that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with n, k, and the list of edges. The constraints are quite large: t can be up to 10^4, and n can be up to 10^5 per test case, but the total sum of n across all test cases is up to 10^5. So, I need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) per test case or better.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Since we're dealing with a tree, it's a recursive structure, and DFS (Depth-First Search) seems like a natural fit here.

The problem asks for the maximum x such that after removing exactly k edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This sounds like a binary search problem on x. I can binary search on the possible values of x and check for each x whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

But wait, the problem allows removing exactly k edges, not at most k or at least k. So, it's a bit trickier.

Let me think about the binary search approach.

First, I need to define the range for x. The smallest possible x is 1, and the largest possible x is n, but in practice, I need to find the maximum x where it's possible to remove k edges and have all components have at least x vertices.

So, I can set L = 1 and R = n, and perform a binary search to find the maximum x where the condition holds.

In each step of the binary search, I set x = (L + R) // 2 and check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all components have at least x vertices.

If it's possible, I set L = x + 1, else set R = x - 1.

Wait, no. If it's possible for this x, I can try a larger x, so I set L = x + 1. If it's not possible, I need to decrease x, so set R = x - 1.

But I need to make sure that I'm removing exactly k edges. That is, I need to remove k edges and have all components have at least x vertices.

I need to find the maximum x such that there exists a set of exactly k edges whose removal results in all components having at least x vertices.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe instead of directly removing k edges, I can think about the number of components after removing k edges.

In a tree, removing k edges will result in k + 1 components because a tree with n nodes has n - 1 edges, and removing k edges will increase the number of components by k.

So, after removing k edges, there will be k + 1 components.

I need each of these components to have at least x vertices, and I need to maximize x.

Given that, the total number of vertices is n, so we have:

(k + 1) * x <= n

Because the sum of the sizes of the components must be at least (k + 1) * x, but it's exactly n.

Wait, actually, the sum of the sizes of the components is exactly n, since we're just partitioning the vertices.

So, to have each of the k + 1 components have at least x vertices, we must have (k + 1) * x <= n.

Therefore, a necessary condition is x <= floor(n / (k + 1))

So, x can be at most floor(n / (k + 1)).

But is this always achievable?

I need to check if it's possible to remove k edges such that each of the k + 1 resulting components has at least floor(n / (k + 1)) vertices.

Wait, but the problem might require exactly k edges to be removed, and it might not always be possible to achieve this.

Wait, no, in a tree, removing any k edges will always result in exactly k + 1 components.

So, in a tree, removing k edges always results in k + 1 components.

Therefore, the problem reduces to: is it possible to partition the tree into k + 1 components, each with at least x vertices, by removing exactly k edges.

Given that, and the earlier necessary condition that (k + 1) * x <= n, I can set R = floor(n / (k + 1)) + 1 and L = 1, and perform a binary search within this range.

Wait, but floor(n / (k + 1)) is already the upper bound, so I can set R = floor(n / (k + 1)) and L = 1.

But to maximize x, I can binary search x from 1 to floor(n / (k + 1)).

Wait, but in the sample input, there is a case where n=5, k=1.

So, floor(5 / 2) = 2, and in the sample explanation, x=2 is achievable by removing edge 1-3, resulting in components {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both having at least 2 vertices.

Another sample input has n=2, k=1, which should give x=1, since removing the only edge results in two components, each with 1 vertex.

Another sample has n=6, k=1, which should give x=3, because floor(6 / 2) = 3, and it's achievable by removing an edge that splits the tree into two components of size 3.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 3 for n=6, k=1.

So, seems like floor(n / (k + 1)) is achievable in these cases.

But I need to confirm if this is always achievable in a tree.

In a tree, is it always possible to remove k edges to get k + 1 components, each with at least floor(n / (k + 1)) vertices?

I think so, because trees are minimally connected graphs, and removing edges will always split the tree into exactly k + 1 components.

But I need to confirm this.

Wait, perhaps not always. Consider a star tree, where one central vertex is connected to all others.

If I have n=5, k=1, then floor(5 / 2) = 2.

If I remove an edge from the central vertex to one leaf, I get two components: the central vertex and the removed leaf.

Wait, that would be components of size 1 and 4, which doesn't satisfy x=2.

But according to the sample, x=2 is achievable by choosing another edge.

Wait, in the star tree, if I remove an edge from the central vertex to a leaf, I get one component with the central vertex and the other with the removed leaf.

But in the sample, with n=5 and k=1, x=2 is achievable by removing a different edge.

So, in a star tree, I need to choose the edge that, when removed, results in components that both have at least x vertices.

In the star tree, to achieve x=2, I need to ensure that neither component has only 1 vertex.

So, in that case, perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, but according to the sample, x=2 is achievable in n=5, k=1 by removing a different edge.

So, in the star tree, if I remove an edge from the central vertex to a leaf, I get components of size 1 and 4.

But in the sample, with n=5, k=1, the tree is not a star; it's a path or something else.

Wait, in the sample input, the first test case has n=5, k=1, and the tree is:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

Which is not a star; it's more like a path with a branch.

So, in that case, removing edge 1-3 results in components {1,2} and {3,4,5}, both having at least 2 vertices.

Alternatively, if I remove edge 3-4, I get components {1,2,3} and {4,5}, which also have at least 2 vertices.

So, in this case, x=2 is achievable.

But in a star tree, it might not be possible to achieve x=2 for n=5, k=1.

Wait, in a star tree with n=5, central vertex 1 connected to 2,3,4,5.

If I remove edge 1-2, I get components {1,3,4,5} and {2}, which have sizes 4 and 1.

If I remove edge 1-3, I get {1,2,4,5} and {3}, sizes 4 and 1.

Similarly for edge 1-4 and 1-5.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to have both components with at least 2 vertices by removing only one edge.

But according to the problem statement, x=1 is acceptable, and it's the maximum achievable in this case.

Wait, but the problem says to output the maximum x such that it's possible to remove exactly k edges in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least x vertices.

In the star tree with n=5, k=1, the maximum x is 1, because removing any edge results in one component with 4 vertices and one with 1 vertex.

If I set x=2, it's impossible to have both components with at least 2 vertices by removing only one edge.

Hence, x=1 is the answer.

So, in this case, floor(n / (k + 1)) = floor(5 / 2) = 2, but x=2 is not achievable, so the answer is 1.

Therefore, floor(n / (k + 1)) is just an upper bound, but it's not always achievable.

Hence, I need to perform a binary search on x to find the maximum achievable x.

Now, to implement this, I need an efficient way to check, for a given x, whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

Given that it's a tree, I can perform a DFS and count the number of components that have at least x vertices.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges.

Wait, perhaps I need to count the number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

In other words, find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Then, if this minimal number is less than or equal to k, and the number of components after removal is k + 1, then it's possible.

But this seems a bit involved.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform a DFS on the tree and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for a given x, I can count the number of edges that, if removed, would result in a component with at least x vertices.

Wait, more precisely, I can count the number of edges whose removal would separate a component of at least x vertices from the rest of the tree.

Then, if the number of such edges is at least k, and I can select k of them such that after removal, all components have at least x vertices, then x is achievable.

But this seems complicated.

Maybe I can think in terms of counting the number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

In other words, find the minimal number of edges to remove so that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Then, if this minimal number is less than or equal to k, and the total number of components after removal is k + 1, then x is achievable.

Wait, perhaps I can use the idea of counting the number of components that have fewer than x vertices and determine how many edges need to be removed to merge them into larger components.

But this is getting a bit messy.

Let me look for a different approach.

I recall that in trees, the number of components after removing k edges is k + 1.

So, if I need to have all components of size at least x, and there are k + 1 components, then n must be at least (k + 1) * x.

If n < (k + 1) * x, it's impossible.

So, x <= floor(n / (k + 1))

But as I saw in the star example, even if x <= floor(n / (k + 1)), it might not be achievable.

Hence, I need to perform a binary search to find the maximum x where it's possible.

Now, to implement this, I need a function that, given x, checks if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To implement this efficiently, I can perform a DFS and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for each edge, I can determine if removing it would result in two components, both with at least x vertices.

Then, I can count the number of such edges.

If this number is at least k, then it's possible to remove k such edges and have all components have at least x vertices.

Wait, but this might not be entirely correct because removing one such edge might affect the possibility of other edges.

Wait, perhaps I need to be more careful.

Let me consider the tree structure.

I can perform a DFS and for each node, calculate the size of its subtree.

Then, for each edge connecting a parent to a child, I can check if removing that edge would result in two components: one is the subtree rooted at the child, and the other is the rest of the tree.

So, for the subtree rooted at the child, if its size is >= x, and the size of the rest of the tree is also >= x, then removing that edge is acceptable.

Similarly, for the parent's component.

So, for each edge (parent, child), if size[child's subtree] >= x and (total n - size[child's subtree]) >= x, then this edge can be removed.

Count the number of such edges.

If this count is >= k, then it's possible to remove k such edges.

But I need to ensure that after removing k such edges, all resulting components still have at least x vertices.

Wait, but just counting the number of acceptable edges might not be sufficient because removing one edge affects the components of others.

For example, if I remove one edge, it might make some other components smaller.

Hence, this approach might not work.

I need a better way.

Let me consider the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that all components have at least x vertices.

I can perform a DFS and try to find the minimal number of edges to remove so that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Then, if this minimal number is <= k, and the number of components after removal is k + 1, then x is achievable.

But I need to maximize x such that exactly k edges are removed.

This seems complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of heavy-light decomposition or something similar, but that might be too advanced.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Given that it's a tree, I can choose any k edges to remove, and I need to check if all resulting components have at least x vertices.

But checking all possible combinations of k edges is not feasible due to the large n and k.

Hence, I need a smarter way.

Let me consider the following approach:

- Perform a DFS and calculate the size of each subtree.

- For a given x, try to find the minimal number of edges to remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

- If this minimal number is <= k, then x is achievable.

- To maximize x, perform a binary search on x.

But I need to implement this efficiently.

Let me try to formalize the function to check for a given x.

Define a function possible(x):

- Perform a DFS and for each node, calculate the size of its subtree.

- For each edge (parent, child), check if removing it would result in two components: one with size[child's subtree] >= x and the other with (n - size[child's subtree]) >= x.

- Count the number of such edges that can be removed.

- If this count is >= k, then it's possible to remove k such edges.

But again, this might not guarantee that all resulting components have at least x vertices, because removing one edge might affect the sizes of other potential components.

Wait, maybe I need to think recursively.

When performing DFS, for each subtree, if its size is >= x, then I can potentially remove the edge connecting it to its parent, provided that the remaining tree has at least x vertices.

Moreover, I need to ensure that after removing k such edges, all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems tricky.

Let me look at the reference solution to understand how it's implemented.

Looking at the given code:

def solve():

    global numCuts

    (n, k) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

    adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]

    for i in range(n - 1):

        (a, b) = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))

        adj[a].append(b)

        adj[b].append(a)

    L = 1

    R = int(100000.0 + 1)

    numCuts = 0

    while R - L > 1:

        x = (L + R) // 2

        numCuts = 0

        leftover = dfs(1, 1)

        if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x):

            L = x

        else:

            R = x

    print(L)

def dfs(a, p):

    global numCuts

    vertices = 1

    for b in adj[a]:

        if b != p:

            vertices += dfs(b, a)

    if vertices >= x and a != p:

        numCuts += 1

        return 0

    return vertices

So, it's performing a binary search on x, and for each x, it performs a DFS to count the number of edges that can be removed such that the subtree has at least x vertices.

In the DFS function:

- It calculates the size of the subtree rooted at node a.

- If the size of the subtree is >= x and a != p (meaning it's not the root), then it's a candidate edge to remove.

- It increments numCuts and returns 0 to indicate that this subtree is being separated.

Then, in the solve function:

- It sets L = 1 and R = 100001 (which is larger than n).

- It performs a binary search, setting x = (L + R) // 2.

- It calls dfs(1, 1), starting from node 1 with parent 1.

- It checks if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x).

- If so, set L = x, else set R = x.

- Finally, it prints L.

I need to understand this logic.

First, the binary search is performed on x from 1 to 100001.

In each iteration, it sets x to the midpoint and performs DFS to calculate numCuts, which is the number of edges that can be removed such that each resulting component has at least x vertices.

In the DFS function:

- It calculates the size of the subtree rooted at a.

- If the subtree size is >= x and a != p, then it's a candidate edge to remove, so it increments numCuts and returns 0 to indicate that this subtree is separated.

- Otherwise, it adds the subtree sizes.

So, numCuts counts the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size >= x.

Then, in the solve function, it checks:

- If numCuts > k, meaning that more than k edges can be removed to achieve the condition, so we can try a larger x.

- Or, if numCuts == k and the leftover (which is the size of the remaining tree) is >= x, then it's also acceptable to try a larger x.

Hence, if numCuts > k or (numCuts == k and leftover >= x), set L = x, else set R = x.

Finally, it prints L.

This seems to be a correct implementation of the binary search approach.

In the DFS, by counting the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size >= x, and ensuring that the remaining tree also has at least x vertices, it effectively checks if x is achievable.

By adjusting L and R based on whether numCuts is greater than or equal to k, and considering the leftover size, it converges to the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

Hence, the given program is correct.
