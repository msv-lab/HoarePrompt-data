Alright, I've got this problem to solve. It's about trees in graph theory, which I'm a bit familiar with, but I need to make sure I understand everything correctly. So, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me a tree with n vertices, and I need to remove exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that each remaining connected component has at least x vertices, and I need to find the maximum possible x.

Okay, so a tree is an undirected graph with no cycles, and removing edges from a tree will split it into smaller trees (connected components). My task is to remove k edges to maximize the minimum size of these resulting connected components.

I need to process multiple test cases, up to 10,000 of them, and the total number of vertices across all test cases doesn't exceed 100,000. So, efficiency is crucial here.

Looking at the example, for n=5 and k=1, with a specific tree structure, removing one edge results in two components: one with 2 vertices and another with 3. So, the minimum component size is 2, and apparently, you can't achieve a minimum of 3 with this particular removal.

I need to find a way to maximize this minimum component size across all possible ways of removing exactly k edges.

Hmm, maximizing the minimum component size sounds a lot like a binary search problem. Maybe I can perform a binary search on the possible values of x, and for each x, check if it's possible to remove k edges such that no component has fewer than x vertices.

Let me think about that. In a binary search, I'd set a lower bound L and an upper bound R for x, and iteratively narrow down the range until I find the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

What should be the initial values for L and R? Well, the smallest possible x is 1, because every component must have at least one vertex. The largest possible x would be n, but that's only possible if k=0, because removing any edge will split the tree into smaller components.

But in general, the maximum x will be less than or equal to n divided by the number of components after removing k edges. Since removing k edges will result in k+1 components, x would be at least ceil(n / (k+1)). But I need to maximize x, so I should aim for components as balanced as possible.

Wait, but the problem requires removing exactly k edges, not minimizing or maximizing the number of components. So, I need to remove exactly k edges and ensure that each component has at least x vertices.

Back to the binary search idea: set L=1 and R=n, and for each mid value x, check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

If it is possible, then I can try a larger x by setting L=mid+1. If not, set R=mid-1.

But I need to make sure that when I remove k edges, the number of components is k+1, and each of these components has at least x vertices.

Wait, but in the example, when n=5 and k=1, removing one edge results in two components: one with 2 and one with 3 vertices. So, for x=2, it's possible. But for x=3, is it possible?

If I try to remove a different edge, maybe I can get two components with 1 and 4 vertices, but 1 is less than 3, which doesn't satisfy the condition. So, x=3 is not achievable in this case.

Hence, the maximum x is 2.

So, in the binary search approach, for each x, I need to find the minimum number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and see if that number equals k.

Wait, but I need to remove exactly k edges, not minimize the number of edges removed.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that removing k edges will result in k+1 components. I need to maximize the minimum size of these components.

This sounds like I need to partition the tree into k+1 components by removing k edges, and maximize the smallest component's size.

This resembles the problem of partitioning a tree into k+1 components with as equal sizes as possible.

I recall that in tree partitioning problems, we can use DFS to traverse the tree and calculate the sizes of subtrees.

Let me think about how to implement this.

First, I need to root the tree arbitrarily, say at node 1.

Then, perform a DFS to calculate the size of each subtree.

Given that, for a particular x, I can try to find the number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

Wait, but in a tree, removing an edge splits the tree into two components.

So, if I have a subtree of size s, and s >= x, then I can choose to remove the edge connecting this subtree to its parent, provided that the remaining tree also satisfies the condition.

This seems a bit recursive.

Maybe I can use a greedy approach: always remove edges that separate subtrees of size x from the rest of the tree.

But I need to remove exactly k edges, not more or less.

Alternatively, since I need to remove exactly k edges, resulting in k+1 components, each of size at least x.

To maximize x, I need to make these components as large as possible.

This sounds similar to dividing n items into k+1 groups, each of at least size x.

But in a tree structure, the way components are formed depends on which edges are removed.

I think the binary search approach is still viable.

Set L=1 and R=n, and for each x, check if it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

To implement the check for a given x, I need to find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

If this number is equal to k, then x is achievable.

If the number is less than k, then x is too small because I can remove fewer than k edges to achieve components of at least x vertices, meaning I can set x larger.

If the number is greater than k, then x is too large, and I need to decrease x.

Wait, but in the example, when x=2, number of edges to remove is 1, which equals k=1.

When x=3, number of edges to remove is 0, because removing 0 edges keeps all components with at least 3 vertices, which is not true in the example.

Wait, no. If x=3, and removing 0 edges means the whole tree is one component with 5 vertices, which is greater than 3. But according to the example, x=3 is not achievable because removing one edge results in components of sizes 2 and 3, and 2 is less than 3.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again.

If x=3 and k=1, then after removing one edge, I have two components: one with 2 and one with 3 vertices. Since 2 < 3, this doesn't satisfy the condition.

If I don't remove any edges, the whole tree is one component with 5 vertices, which is >=3. So, in this case, with k=0, x=3 is achievable.

But the problem requires removing exactly k edges, not less.

So, for k=1, x=3 is not achievable because any single edge removal results in a component with fewer than 3 vertices.

Hence, the check should be: is it possible to remove exactly k edges such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

In the binary search approach, for a given x, I need to find the number of edges that must be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

If this number is less than or equal to k, then x is achievable, and I can try a larger x.

If this number is greater than k, then x is too large, and I need to try a smaller x.

Wait, but in the example, for x=3, removing 0 edges satisfies the condition (since the whole tree has 5 >=3), but k=1 requires removing exactly 1 edge, which doesn't satisfy the condition.

So, in this case, for x=3, the number of edges that must be removed is 0, which is less than k=1.

But since the problem requires removing exactly k edges, not fewer, this is a problem.

So, perhaps the condition should be: the number of edges that must be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices is <=k, and after removing k edges, the number of components is >= the required number.

Wait, I need to think differently.

Let me consider that removing an edge splits a component into two smaller components.

I need to choose which k edges to remove such that all resulting components have at least x vertices.

This seems complicated.

Maybe another approach: find the minimal number of edges that need to be removed to ensure all components have at least x vertices, and check if this number equals k.

If it's equal to k, then x is achievable.

If it's less than k, then x is too small, because I can achieve the condition by removing fewer than k edges, meaning I can aim for a larger x.

If it's more than k, then x is too large, and I need a smaller x.

Wait, but in the example, for x=3, removing 0 edges satisfies the condition (whole tree has 5>=3), but k=1 requires removing exactly 1 edge, which doesn't satisfy the condition because one component has 2<3 vertices.

So, in this case, for x=3, the minimal number of edges to remove is 0, which is less than k=1.

But since I need to remove exactly k=1 edge, and any single edge removal results in a component with 2 vertices, which is less than x=3, x=3 is not achievable.

Hence, in this case, even though removing 0 edges satisfies the condition, I need to remove exactly k=1 edge, which breaks the condition.

So, perhaps the condition should be: the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices is <=k, and after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

But this seems tricky to implement.

Let me think about how to compute the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

One way is to perform a DFS and calculate the size of each subtree.

Then, for each subtree of size >=x, I can choose to remove the edge connecting it to its parent, creating a component of that size.

The remaining tree would need to be processed recursively.

This sounds like a greedy approach.

So, in the DFS, for each node, calculate the size of its subtree.

If the subtree size is >=x, then I can choose to remove the edge connecting it to its parent, incrementing the count of edges removed.

Then, I need to do the same for the parent node, considering the remaining tree.

Wait, but this might not always give the minimal number of edges to remove.

Perhaps there's a better way.

I found a similar problem online where the task is to find the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

In that problem, they perform a DFS and for each node, calculate the size of its subtree.

Then, for each subtree of size >=x, they can choose to remove the edge connecting it to its parent.

The total number of edges removed would be the number of such subtrees.

But in our problem, we need to remove exactly k edges, not minimize the number of edges removed.

So, perhaps I can perform a binary search on x, and for each x, compute the minimal number of edges to remove to ensure all components have at least x vertices.

If this number is equal to k, then x is achievable.

If it's less than k, then x is too small, and I can try a larger x.

If it's more than k, then x is too large, and I need to try a smaller x.

Wait, but in the example, for x=3, the minimal number of edges to remove is 0, which is less than k=1, but x=3 is not achievable because removing k=1 edge breaks the condition.

So, perhaps the condition should be: the minimal number of edges to remove is <=k, and after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices.

But this seems inconsistent.

Wait, maybe I need to ensure that after removing k edges, all components have at least x vertices, and that's only possible if the minimal number of edges to remove is <=k, and that removing k edges doesn't create any component smaller than x.

This is getting complicated.

Let me look at the provided code and see how it approaches the problem.

The code defines a function solve() that reads n and k, reads the tree edges, and then performs a binary search between L=1 and R=100001.

In each iteration, it sets x to (L + R) // 2, performs a DFS to count the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size >=x, and checks if this number of cuts is greater than or equal to k.

Then, it adjusts L or R based on whether the number of cuts is greater than or equal to k, and whether the leftover nodes in the main component are >=x.

Wait, I need to carefully analyze the DFS function.

The DFS function seems to traverse the tree, calculate the size of each subtree, and count the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size >=x.

Then, in the solve function, it checks if the number of cuts is greater than k, or if it's equal to k and the leftover nodes are >=x.

If so, it sets L to x; else, it sets R to x.

This seems similar to the binary search approach I was considering.

But I need to verify if this logic is correct.

Let me consider the example again.

n=5, k=1

Tree:

1-2

1-3

3-4

3-5

So, rooted at 1, subtree sizes:

- 1: 5

- 2: 1

- 3: 3

- 4: 1

- 5:1

For x=2:

- Subtree of 3 has size 3 >=2, so can remove edge 1-3, resulting in components {1,2} and {3,4,5}.

- Number of cuts is 1, which equals k=1, and both components have at least 2 vertices.

- So, x=2 is achievable.

For x=3:

- Subtree of 3 has size 3 >=3, so can remove edge 1-3.

- But the remaining component is {1,2}, which has size 2 <3.

- So, x=3 is not achievable.

In the code, for x=2:

- numCuts=1, leftover=2 (component {1,2}), which is >=2, so L=2

For x=3:

- numCuts=1, but leftover=2 <3, so R=3

Then, the loop continues until R - L <=1, and finally prints L=2.

This seems correct for this example.

Let me think about another test case.

n=6, k=1

Tree:

1-2

2-3

3-4

4-5

5-6

For x=3:

- Subtree sizes:

- 1:6

- 2:5

- 3:4

- 4:3

- 5:2

- 6:1

- If x=3, can remove edge 4-5, resulting in components {1,2,3,4} and {5,6}.

- Both have at least 3 vertices.

- So, x=3 should be achievable.

But according to the example output, for n=6, k=1, the answer is 3.

Wait, in the example input, there are 6 test cases, but I need to map them correctly.

Wait, looking back:

Test case 1:

5 1

Edges: 1-2,1-3,3-4,3-5

Answer:2

Test case 2:

2 1

Edges:1-2

Answer:1

Test case 3:

6 1

Edges:1-2,2-3,3-4,4-5,5-6

Answer:3

Test case 4:

3 1

Edges:1-2,1-3

Answer:1

Test case 5:

8 2

Edges:1-2,1-3,2-4,2-5,3-6,3-7,3-8

Answer:1

Test case 6:

6 2

Edges:1-2,2-3,1-4,4-5,5-6

Answer:2

So, for n=6, k=1, answer is 3.

In this case, removing edge 3-4 results in components {1,2,3} and {4,5,6}, both with 3 vertices.

So, x=3 is achievable.

If I try x=4:

- Removing any single edge will result in one component with 4 vertices and another with 2 vertices.

- Since 2 <4, x=4 is not achievable.

Hence, the maximum x is 3.

The code seems to handle this correctly.

Another test case:

n=3, k=1

Edges:1-2,1-3

For x=1:

- Remove any edge, say 1-2, resulting in components {1,3} and {2}, both with at least 1 vertex.

- So, x=1 is achievable.

For x=2:

- Remove edge 1-2, components {1,3} and {2}.

- {2} has size 1 <2.

- So, x=2 is not achievable.

Hence, maximum x is 1, which matches the example output.

Seems correct.

Another test case:

n=6, k=2

Edges:1-2,2-3,1-4,4-5,5-6

For x=2:

- Remove edges 1-2 and 4-5.

- Components: {1,4,5,6} and {2,3}, both with at least 2 vertices.

- So, x=2 is achievable.

For x=3:

- Remove edges 1-2 and 4-5.

- Components: {1,4,5,6} and {2,3}.

- {2,3} has 2 <3 vertices.

- So, x=3 is not achievable.

Hence, maximum x is 2, which matches the example output.

Seems correct.

Now, I need to ensure that the code implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

- It reads t test cases.

- For each test case, reads n and k, reads n-1 edges, builds the adjacency list.

- Then, performs a binary search between L=1 and R=100001.

- In each iteration, sets x=(L+R)//2, performs DFS to count the number of cuts needed.

- If numCuts >k or (numCuts==k and leftover >=x), sets L=x.

- Else, sets R=x.

- Finally, prints L.

In the DFS function:

- It traverses the tree, calculates the size of each subtree.

- If a subtree has size >=x and it's not the root, it increments numCuts and returns 0.

- Else, it returns the subtree size.

This seems to correctly count the number of edges that can be removed to separate subtrees of size >=x.

Then, in the solve function, it checks if numCuts >k or (numCuts==k and leftover >=x).

- If so, sets L=x.

- Else, sets R=x.

This makes sense because:

- If numCuts >k, meaning we need to remove more than k edges to achieve the condition, so x is too large, and we need to decrease it.

- If numCuts ==k and the leftover nodes (the main component) have size >=x, then x is achievable, and we can try a larger x.

- Else, x is too large, and we need to try a smaller x.

Hence, the binary search will converge to the maximum x that satisfies the condition.

Seems correct.

I need to make sure that the DFS function correctly calculates numCuts and returns the subtree sizes.

Also, that the leftover variable correctly represents the size of the main component after removing the specified edges.

Looking at the DFS function:

def dfs(a, p):

global numCuts

vertices = 1

for b in adj[a]:

if b != p:

vertices += dfs(b, a)

if vertices >= x and a != p:

numCuts += 1

return 0

return vertices

This function calculates the size of the subtree rooted at a.

If the subtree size is >=x and it's not the root, it increments numCuts and returns 0, indicating that this subtree is separated as a component.

Else, it returns the subtree size.

So, the sum of subtree sizes returned by the children plus 1 (for node a) gives the total size of the component.

In the solve function, leftover is set to dfs(1,1), which is the size of the main component after separating the subtrees with size >=x.

If numCuts >k or (numCuts ==k and leftover >=x), then L=x.

Else, R=x.

This seems correct.

I think the code implements the correct logic and should work correctly for the given problem.

Hence, the answer is True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
