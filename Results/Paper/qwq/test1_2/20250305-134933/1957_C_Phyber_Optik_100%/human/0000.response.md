Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, it's about an n x n chessboard where I'm placing white rooks and the computer is placing black rooks, alternating turns. The key points are:

1. **Placing Rooks:** I place white rooks, and the computer places black rooks in response by mirroring my move (i.e., if I place at (r, c), the computer places at (c, r)).

2. **No Attacks:** Rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can share the same row or column, regardless of color.

3. **Special Case for Diagonal:** If I place a rook on the diagonal (where r = c), the computer can't mirror it and skips its turn.

4. **Initial Moves:** I've already made k moves, and the computer has mirrored them appropriately. Now, I need to continue the game until no more valid moves are possible and determine how many different final configurations are possible.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Since the number of configurations can be large, I need to output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

First, I need to understand the game mechanics thoroughly.

**Understanding the Game Mechanics:**

- **Rook Placement Rules:**

- Rooks cannot share the same row or column.

- My moves are white rooks, computer's moves are black rooks.

- Computer mirrors my moves by swapping row and column indices.

- If I place on the diagonal (r = c), the computer skips its turn because it can't mirror it.

- **Initial State:**

- The chessboard is initially empty.

- I've already made k moves, and the computer has mirrored them, provided that the mirrors are valid.

- It's guaranteed that the initial k moves and their mirrors are valid.

- **Objective:**

- Continue the game from the current state until no more valid moves are possible and count the number of distinct final configurations.

**Analyzing the Problem:**

- This seems like a problem related to combinatorics and dynamic programming, given the constraints and the need to count configurations.

- The fact that rooks cannot attack each other means that each row and each column can have at most one rook.

- The mirroring action adds a symmetry to the placements.

- The special case for diagonal moves where the computer skips its turn adds a condition that needs to be handled carefully.

**Initial Thoughts on Approach:**

1. **Model the Problem:**

- Think of the chessboard as a grid where rows and columns are distinct.

- Keep track of occupied rows and columns by white and black rooks.

2. **Impact of Initial Moves:**

- The initial k moves by me and the computer's responses affect the available rows and columns for future moves.

- Need to account for these occupied rows and columns.

3. **Counting Configurations:**

- Determine how many ways to place remaining rooks without violating the rules.

- Given the mirroring, some placements might be forced or have symmetries.

**Breaking Down the Problem:**

- **Step 1: Identify Occupied Rows and Columns:**

- From the initial k moves, determine which rows and columns are already occupied by either white or black rooks.

- Keep track of rows and columns occupied by white rooks and those occupied by black rooks.

- Note that if a row is occupied by a white rook, it cannot have any more rooks, similarly for columns.

- For black rooks placed by the computer, the same rules apply.

- **Step 2: Determine Available Rows and Columns:**

- Calculate the number of rows and columns that are still available for placing new rooks.

- Let’s denote:

- `available_rows = n - number of unique rows occupied by white or black rooks`

- `available_cols = n - number of unique columns occupied by white or black rooks`

- However, since both rows and columns are interdependent due to the mirroring, we need a more nuanced approach.

- **Step 3: Handle Diagonal Moves:**

- If any of the initial k moves are on the diagonal (r = c), the computer skips its turn.

- This affects the number of moves made and the state of the board.

- Need to account for these skipped turns in the available moves.

**Refining the Approach:**

- **Observation 1: Symmetry in Placement:**

- Since the computer mirrors my moves, the placements have a certain symmetry across the main diagonal.

- This symmetry can be exploited to reduce the problem's complexity.

- **Observation 2: Independent Placements:**

- After accounting for the initial moves and their mirrors, the remaining placements can be considered in pairs (my move and computer's mirror move) unless placing on the diagonal.

- **Observation 3: Counting Configurations:**

- The number of configurations depends on the number of ways to place pairs of rooks (mine and computer's) without conflicts.

- For each pair of available rows and columns, there are choices to place rooks.

- **Approach:**

- Calculate the number of available rows and columns that are not yet occupied.

- Determine how many of these available positions are above the diagonal, below the diagonal, or on the diagonal.

- Use combinatorics to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining available positions, considering the mirroring constraint.

**Simplifying the Problem:**

- **Key Insight:**

- The problem can be reduced to counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining empty part of the chessboard, considering the mirroring constraint.

- Given the mirroring, each placement above the diagonal corresponds to a placement below the diagonal.

- Placements on the diagonal are special since they don't have mirrors.

- **Reduction to Standard Problem:**

- This resembles counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a chessboard, which is related to permutations or derangements, but with additional constraints due to mirroring.

**Developing a Formula:**

- **Step 1: Determine the Number of Available Rows and Columns:**

- Let’s define:

- `used_rows = set of rows occupied by white or black rooks`

- `used_cols = set of columns occupied by white or black rooks`

- `available_rows = n - len(used_rows)`

- `available_cols = n - len(used_cols)`

- **Step 2: Calculate the Number of Remaining Moves:**

- The number of remaining moves I can make is equal to the number of positions where both the row and column are available.

- However, due to mirroring, some of these moves will be paired.

- **Step 3: Counting Configurations:**

- For each pair of positions (above and below the diagonal), there are choices to place rooks.

- Positions on the diagonal can be placed independently, as their mirrors are invalid.

- The total number of configurations can be expressed in terms of the number of available positions above the diagonal, below the diagonal, and on the diagonal.

**Considering the Mirroring Constraint:**

- **Above the Diagonal:**

- For positions where r < c, placing a rook at (r, c) forces the computer to place a rook at (c, r).

- These placements are paired.

- **Below the Diagonal:**

- Similarly, positions where r > c are mirrors of positions above the diagonal.

- **On the Diagonal:**

- Positions where r = c can be placed independently, as their mirrors are invalid and thus the computer skips its turn.

- **Counting Pairs and Singles:**

- The number of pairs is equal to the number of available positions above the diagonal.

- The number of singles is equal to the number of available positions on the diagonal.

- **Formula for Configurations:**

- For each pair, I have two choices: place a rook in the pair or not.

- For each single, I have two choices: place a rook or not.

- However, this needs to be adjusted for the fact that placing a rook in a pair affects both positions, and placing on the diagonal only affects one position.

**Refining the Formula:**

- **Let’s define:**

- `pairs = number of available positions above the diagonal`

- `singles = number of available positions on the diagonal`

- **Total Configurations:**

- For each pair, I can choose to place rooks in both positions or not place any.

- For each single, I can choose to place a rook or not.

- However, once I place a rook in a pair, it occupies both positions, and similarly for singles.

- This seems similar to choosing subsets of pairs and singles, ensuring no overlaps.

- **Better Approach:**

- Consider that each pair above the diagonal corresponds to two positions, and placing a rook in that pair occupies both positions.

- Each single on the diagonal corresponds to one position.

- The problem then reduces to choosing a subset of these pairs and singles such that no two chosen pairs or singles overlap in rows or columns.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**

- **State Definition:**

- Let’s define dp[i][j], where i is the number of pairs and j is the number of singles.

- However, considering the large constraints (n up to 3e5), a standard DP approach might not be efficient.

- **Optimized Approach:**

- Precompute the number of ways based on the number of available pairs and singles.

- Use combinatorial calculations to determine the number of configurations.

**Considering the Given Program:**

Looking at the provided program:

- It precomputes dp values up to n=300000.

- It uses a function func_1 to compute dp values.

- It reads t test cases, each with n and k, followed by k moves.

- It computes invalid positions based on the k moves and their mirrors.

- It prints dp[n - len(invalid)], or 1 if n - len(invalid) is 0.

- **dp Calculation:**

- dp[1] = 1

- dp[2] = 3

- dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2] modulo 10^9+7

**Analyzing the Given Program:**

- **Invalid Set Calculation:**

- For each move (r, c), it adds r and c to the invalid set.

- This seems to be marking rows and columns as used.

- **dp Array Usage:**

- It uses precomputed dp values to get the number of configurations for n - len(invalid).

- **Potential Issues:**

- Is the dp calculation correct?

- Is the way invalid positions are calculated accurate?

- Does dp[n - len(invalid)] correctly represent the number of configurations for the remaining board?

**Validating the Approach:**

- **DP Recurrence Relation:**

- The dp recurrence given is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2]

- This seems to suggest that for each additional pair, there are 2*(i-1) new configurations.

- Need to verify if this recurrence accurately models the problem.

- **Invalid Set:**

- Adding both r and c to the invalid set for each move (r, c) seems to mark those rows and columns as used.

- However, need to ensure that this correctly accounts for the occupied rows and columns, considering both white and black rooks.

- **Diagonal Moves:**

- If a move is on the diagonal (r == c), the computer skips its turn.

- Need to ensure that such moves are handled correctly in the invalid set.

**Cross-Verification with Example:**

Looking at the first test case:

- n = 4, k = 1

- Move: (1,2)

- Invalid set: {1,2}

- n - len(invalid) = 4 - 2 = 2

- dp[2] = 3, which matches the first output in the example.

This seems consistent.

**General Validation:**

- **Understanding dp[i]:**

- dp[i] seems to represent the number of ways to place rooks on a board with i available pairs.

- Given the recurrence dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2*(i-1)*dp[i-2], it appears to account for placing a rook in one of the pairs and not placing any, or placing in one of the pairs.

- However, need to ensure that this recurrence captures all possible configurations correctly.

- **Considering Pairs and Singles:**

- In the problem, pairs correspond to positions above the diagonal and their mirrors below, while singles are on the diagonal.

- The recurrence seems to handle pairs correctly, but what about singles?

- In the code, it seems to treat n - len(invalid) as the number of available pairs, but this might not be accurate.

**Potential Misconception:**

- **Available Pairs and Singles:**

- The number of available pairs is not directly equal to n - len(invalid).

- Need to calculate the number of available pairs (positions above the diagonal with both row and column available) and the number of available singles (positions on the diagonal with both row and column available).

- Simply using n - len(invalid) might not capture this distinction.

- **Correct Calculation:**

- Let’s denote:

- total available rows and columns: n - len(invalid)

- number of available pairs: (n - len(invalid)) choose 2

- number of available singles: number of available rows (or columns) on the diagonal

- However, this needs to be adjusted based on the actual positions.

**Alternative Approach:**

- **Bipartite Matching:**

- The problem can be modeled as placing non-attacking rooks on a bipartite graph, considering the mirroring constraint.

- However, this might be too time-consuming for large n.

- **Permutations with Restrictions:**

- It's similar to counting the number of permutations with certain restrictions, but again, with the mirroring constraint.

**Revisiting the Given Program:**

- The program seems to simplify the problem by considering only the number of available rows and columns, combined into a single value n - len(invalid), and using precomputed dp values based on that.

- This suggests that the dp array is designed to handle configurations based on the number of available positions, treating pairs and singles collectively.

- Given that the example output matches, it might be correct, but I need to verify it for correctness in general.

**Testing with Another Example:**

Consider n = 1, k = 0.

- No initial moves.

- Only one position: (1,1), which is on the diagonal.

- I can place a white rook at (1,1), and the computer skips its turn.

- No more moves are possible.

- So, there is only one configuration: placing a rook at (1,1).

- According to the program:

- invalid = empty set

- n - len(invalid) = 1 - 0 = 1

- dp[1] = 1, which matches.

Another test case: n = 2, k = 0.

- Positions: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- I can place at (1,2), computer places at (2,1)

- Then no more moves are possible.

- Alternatively, I can place at (1,1), computer skips.

- Then I can place at (2,2), computer skips.

- So, possible configurations:

- (1,2) and (2,1)

- (1,1) and (2,2)

- (1,2), (2,1), (1,1)

- (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)

- Wait, but in the third and fourth configurations, placing (1,1) or (2,2) after (1,2) and (2,1) might not be allowed due to attacks.

- Need to verify the valid configurations.

- Actually, in n=2, after placing (1,2) and (2,1), no more moves are possible because rows and columns are occupied.

- So, only two configurations:

- Place (1,2) and (2,1)

- Place (1,1) and (2,2)

- So, total configurations: 2

- But according to the program:

- invalid set is empty

- n - len(invalid) = 2 - 0 = 2

- dp[2] = 3, which doesn't match my count.

- This suggests a discrepancy.

- Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

- Let's see:

- Configuration 1: Place (1,2) and (2,1)

- Configuration 2: Place (1,1)

- Configuration 3: Place (2,2)

- But in configuration 2 and 3, after placing (1,1), no more moves are possible, as rows and columns are occupied.

- So, total configurations: 3, which matches dp[2] = 3.

- Hence, the program seems correct in this case.

**Conclusion:**

After analyzing the problem and cross-verifying with examples, it seems that the given program correctly computes the number of final configurations by precomputing dp values and using them based on the number of available positions after accounting for the initial moves and their mirrors.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
