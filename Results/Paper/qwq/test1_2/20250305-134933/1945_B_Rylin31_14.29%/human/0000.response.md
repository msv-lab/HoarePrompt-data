Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there are two firework installations, each launching fireworks at regular intervals: one every 'a' minutes and the other every 'b' minutes. Each firework remains visible in the sky for 'm + 1' minutes after it's launched. I need to find out the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time.

First, I need to understand how the timings work. Let's consider the launch times for each installation.

For the first installation, it launches fireworks at times: a, 2a, 3a, and so on.

Similarly, the second installation launches at times: b, 2b, 3b, and so on.

Each firework is visible from its launch time up to m minutes after its launch time, inclusive. So, a firework launched at time t is visible from t to t + m.

I need to find a time when the maximum number of fireworks are visible in the sky.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way is to consider the visibility periods of the fireworks and see how they overlap.

But since the numbers can be up to 10^18, it's impossible to iterate through all possible times. So, I need a smarter way to calculate the maximum number of overlapping fireworks at any given time.

I recall that in similar problems, like finding the maximum number of overlapping intervals, we can sort the start and end times and keep track of the current number of overlapping intervals.

But again, with large time values, sorting all possible fireworks is not feasible.

I need to find a mathematical way to calculate the maximum overlap without iterating through all possible times.

Let me consider the launch frequencies and the visibility duration.

If I can find a time where the launches from both installations have fireworks that are still visible, and possibly overlapping with previous launches, that could give me the maximum overlap.

Let me consider the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b, which would be the time when both installations launch their fireworks simultaneously.

But wait, if a and b are co-prime, their LCM is a*b, which could be very large. But given the constraints, a and b can be up to 10^18, so a*b could be up to 10^36, which is way too big to handle directly.

I need another approach.

Let me think about the visibility periods.

For a given time t, the number of fireworks visible at that time is the number of launches from both installations whose visibility periods include t.

In other words, for the first installation, it's the number of k such that t is in [k*a, k*a + m].

Similarly for the second installation.

So, for each installation, I can calculate how many launches have t within their visibility periods.

To maximize the total number of visible fireworks, I need to choose t such that the sum of these counts is maximized.

Now, for a single installation, the number of launches visible at time t is floor((t)/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Wait, that seems like a way to calculate the number of launches whose visibility includes t.

Let me verify that.

For the first installation, launches at k*a, and each is visible from k*a to k*a + m.

So, for a given t, the launches where k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

This inequality can be rewritten as k*a <= t and t <= k*a + m.

Which implies k <= t/a and t - m <= k*a.

So, floor((t - m)/a) <= k <= floor(t/a)

Therefore, the number of visible fireworks from the first installation at time t is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a)

Similarly, for the second installation, it's floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

So, the total number of visible fireworks at time t is:

floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b)

I need to maximize this expression over all possible t.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to find the maximum value of this expression.

I recall that the function floor(t/x) is piecewise linear and has jumps at multiples of x.

So, the expression floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) is also piecewise constant, with possible changes at multiples of a and points where t - m is a multiple of a.

Similarly for b.

Therefore, the overall expression is piecewise constant, and its maximum value can be found by evaluating it at critical points: multiples of a and b, and points where t - m is a multiple of a or b.

But given the large values, iterating through all possible t is impossible.

I need to find a smarter way.

Let me consider the periodicity of the launches.

Since the launches are periodic with periods a and b, perhaps there is a way to find a common period or something like that.

But given that a and b can be arbitrary large numbers, their LCM might be too large to handle.

Wait, maybe I can consider the time modulo the LCM of a and b.

But again, LCM can be up to 10^36, which is not manageable.

I need another approach.

Let me consider the possible values of t where the expression floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b) changes.

These points are at multiples of a and b, and at t = k*a + m and t = l*b + m for integers k and l.

So, the critical points are multiples of a, multiples of b, and t = k*a + m and t = l*b + m.

Given that, perhaps I can consider evaluating the expression at these critical points and find the maximum among them.

But again, with a and b up to 10^18, there could be a lot of such points.

I need to find a way to calculate the maximum without enumerating all possible t.

Let me consider the behavior of the expression.

As t increases, floor(t/a) increases by 1 every a units, and floor((t - m)/a) increases by 1 every a units, but shifted by m.

Similarly for b.

So, the expression can increase or decrease at these points.

But I need to find its maximum value.

Wait, perhaps I can find an upper bound for the expression and see if it can be achieved.

Let me consider that.

First, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) is at most floor(m/a) + 1, because the difference between floor(t/a) and floor((t - m)/a) is at most floor(m/a) + 1.

Similarly for b.

So, the total is at most floor(m/a) + 1 + floor(m/b) + 1 = floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2

But perhaps this upper bound can be achieved at some t.

But is this always the case?

Let me check with some examples.

Take the first test case:

a = 6, b = 7, m = 4

floor(4/6) + floor(4/7) + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2

And according to the sample output, it's 2.

Another test case:

a = 3, b = 4, m = 10

floor(10/3) + floor(10/4) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7

And the sample output is 7.

Another one:

a = 7, b = 8, m = 56

floor(56/7) + floor(56/8) + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17

Sample output is 17.

So, in these cases, the upper bound is achieved.

Another test case:

a = 5, b = 6, m = 78123459896

floor(78123459896/5) + floor(78123459896/6) + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268628 + 2 = 28645268630

Which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that in these cases, the upper bound is achievable.

But is this always the case?

Let me consider a case where a and b divide m.

For example, a = 2, b = 3, m = 6

floor(6/2) + floor(6/3) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7

Is 7 achievable?

Let's see:

Launch times for a: 2, 4, 6, 8, ...

Visibility: for t=2: [2,7], t=4: [4,9], t=6: [6,11], etc.

For b: 3,6,9,...

Visibility: [3,8], [6,11], [9,14], etc.

At t=6, fireworks from a at t=2,4,6 are visible: t=2 is visible until 7, t=4 until 9, t=6 until 11.

From b: t=3 and t=6 are visible at t=6.

So, total: 3 (from a) + 2 (from b) = 5, but according to the upper bound, it's 7.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, floor(6/2) - floor((6-6)/2) = floor(3) - floor(0) = 3 - 0 = 3

From b: floor(6/3) - floor((6-6)/3) = 2 - floor(0) = 2 - 0 = 2

Total: 5, but the upper bound was 7.

So, in this case, it's not achievable.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the upper bound.

Wait, the upper bound is floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2, but in this case, m=6, a=2, b=3.

floor(6/2) = 3, floor(6/3)=2, plus 2, total 5.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I had floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, but actually, at t=6, it's 3 + 2 = 5.

Wait, perhaps the correct upper bound is floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2, but in this case, m=6, a=2, b=3.

Wait, but floor(m/a) is floor(6/2)=3, floor(m/b)=floor(6/3)=2, so 3 + 2 + 2 =7, but in reality, at t=6, it's only 5.

So, perhaps the upper bound is not always achievable.

Wait, maybe I need to consider if a and b divide m.

In the sample inputs, sometimes a and b divide m, sometimes not.

Wait, in the first sample, a=6, b=7, m=4, which is not divisible by a or b.

But in the third sample, a=7, b=8, m=56, which is divisible by both.

Wait, perhaps when m is divisible by both a and b, the maximum is floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 2, else it's floor(m/a) + floor(m/b) + 1.

But in my previous example, a=2, b=3, m=6, which is divisible by both, but the actual maximum is 5, while floor(m/a)+floor(m/b)+2=3+2+2=7, which is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the least common multiple.

Wait, perhaps the maximum is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m)/b), and I need to maximize this.

But I need a better way to compute it.

Let me look for a mathematical formula to compute floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a)

I recall that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) is equal to floor((t mod a + m)/a)

Wait, let me verify that.

Let t = k*a + r, where 0 <= r < a.

Then floor(t/a) = k + floor(r/a) = k + 0 = k.

floor((t - m)/a) = floor((k*a + r - m)/a) = floor(k + (r - m)/a) = k - floor((m - r)/a)

So, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) = k - (k - floor((m - r)/a)) = floor((m - r)/a)

But floor((m - r)/a) is floor(m/a) if r = 0, else floor((m - r)/a)

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, I can consider that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m)/a) is equal to ceil((t - (t - m)) / a) = ceil((m)/a)

But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a way to compute the number of k such that k*a <= t <= k*a + m.

This is equivalent to floor((t - m)/a) < k <= floor(t/a)

So, the number of k is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me look it up.

The number of multiples of a in the range [t - m, t] is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a)

Similarly for b.

So, the total number of visible fireworks is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m - 1)/b)

I need to maximize this expression.

Now, I need to find t that maximizes this sum.

Given the constraints, I need an efficient way to compute this maximum.

Let me consider that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is at most floor(m + 1 / a) + 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m - 1)/a) is equal to floor((t - (t - m -1)) / a) + something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the difference floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

I recall that this difference is equal to the number of multiples of a in the range [t - m, t].

So, it's equal to floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for b.

So, the total is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

I need to maximize this sum.

Now, I need to find t that maximizes this expression.

Given that a, b, and m can be up to 10^18, I need an efficient way to compute this.

Let me consider the possible values of t.

I need to consider t such that t is in the range where the visibility periods overlap in a way that maximizes the count.

Let me consider the case when t is a multiple of a and b.

Let t be the least common multiple (LCM) of a and b.

But LCM can be up to 10^36, which is too big.

Wait, perhaps I can consider t = LCM of a and b, but that's not necessary.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that for a given t, the number of visible fireworks from a is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

Let me consider that floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x) is equal to floor((t - (t - m -1))/x) = floor((m +1)/x)

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, t - (t - m -1) = m +1

So, floor((m +1)/x) is the number of multiples of x in the interval [t - m -1, t]

But, actually, floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x) is equal to the number of multiples of x in [t - m -1, t]

Which is floor(t/x) - floor((t - m -1)/x)

This can be at most floor(m +1 / x)

Wait, but floor(m +1 / x) is the maximum number of multiples of x in any interval of length m +1

So, the maximum of floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) is floor((m +1)/a)

Similarly for b.

Therefore, the maximum of the sum is floor((m +1)/a) + floor((m +1)/b)

But, is this achievable?

In other words, is there a t where floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) = floor((m +1)/a) and floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b) = floor((m +1)/b)?

If such a t exists, then the maximum is floor((m +1)/a) + floor((m +1)/b)

Otherwise, it's less.

Wait, in the sample input 1:

a=6, b=7, m=4

floor((4 +1)/6) = floor(5/6) = 0

floor((4 +1)/7) = floor(5/7) = 0

So, sum is 0 + 0 = 0, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) can be up to floor((m +1)/a)

But in the sample input 1, floor((m +1)/a) = floor(5/6) = 0, but the sample output is 2, which is greater than 0 + 0 + 2 = 2.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) can be floor((m +1)/a) + something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that if t is a multiple of a, then floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) can be higher.

Wait, let's calculate floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) for t = k*a.

If t = k*a, then floor(t/a) = k

floor((t - m -1)/a) = floor((k*a - m -1)/a) = k - floor((m +1)/a)

So, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) = k - (k - floor((m +1)/a)) = floor((m +1)/a)

Similarly for b.

So, the sum is floor((m +1)/a) + floor((m +1)/b)

But in the sample input 1, floor(5/6) + floor(5/7) = 0 + 0 = 0, but the sample output is 2.

Wait, that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) can be floor((m +1)/a) + 1 in some cases.

Wait, let's check for t = k*a + r, where 0 <= r < a.

Then floor(t/a) = k + floor(r/a) = k

floor((t - m -1)/a) = floor((k*a + r - m -1)/a) = k - ceil((m +1 - r)/a)

So, floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) = k - (k - ceil((m +1 - r)/a)) = ceil((m +1 - r)/a)

Similarly, for b.

So, the sum is ceil((m +1 - r)/a) + ceil((m +1 - s)/b), where s is the remainder when t is divided by b.

I need to maximize this sum.

Given that, perhaps the maximum is ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)

But in the sample input 1, ceil(5/6) + ceil(5/7) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

Wait, earlier I thought floor(5/6) + floor(5/7) = 0 + 0 = 0, but actually ceil(5/6) + ceil(5/7) = 1 + 1 = 2, which matches the sample output.

So, perhaps the correct expression is ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)

Let me verify this with another sample.

Sample input 2: a=3, b=4, m=10

ceil(11/3) + ceil(11/4) = ceil(3.666) + ceil(2.75) = 4 + 3 = 7, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 3: a=7, b=8, m=56

ceil(57/7) + ceil(57/8) = ceil(8.142) + ceil(7.125) = 9 + 8 = 17, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 4: a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

ceil(78123459897/5) + ceil(78123459897/6) = ceil(15624691979.4) + ceil(13020576649.5) = 15624691980 + 13020576650 = 28645268630, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 5: a=1, b=1, m=1

ceil(2/1) + ceil(2/1) = 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Sample input 6: a=1, b=1, m=1000000000000000000

ceil(1000000000000000001/1) + ceil(1000000000000000001/1) = 1000000000000000001 + 1000000000000000001 = 2000000000000000002, which matches the sample output.

So, it seems that the correct formula is ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)

Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time is ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)

Now, in programming terms, to compute ceil(m +1 / x), I can use (m +1 + x -1) // x

Because (m +1 + x -1) // x is equivalent to ceil((m +1)/x)

So, in code, I can compute:

num_a = (m +1 + a -1) // a

num_b = (m +1 + b -1) // b

total = num_a + num_b

And output total for each test case.

But let's check if there are any edge cases where this might not hold.

Consider a=1, b=1, m=1

ceil(2/1) + ceil(2/1) = 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the sample output.

Another case: a=1, b=1, m=0

ceil(1/1) + ceil(1/1) = 1 + 1 = 2

Is that correct?

At t=1, fireworks from both installations are launched and visible from t=1 to t=1.

So, at t=1, both are visible, so total is 2.

Yes, that seems correct.

Another case: a=2, b=2, m=1

ceil(2/2) + ceil(2/2) = 1 + 1 = 2

At t=2, fireworks from both installations are launched and visible from t=2 to t=3.

At t=2, there are two fireworks visible: one from t=2 to t=3 from the first installation and one from t=2 to t=3 from the second installation.

So, total is 2, which matches.

Another case: a=2, b=3, m=3

ceil(4/2) + ceil(4/3) = 2 + 2 = 4

At t=6, fireworks from a: t=2,4,6 (visible from 2-5,4-7,6-9)

Fireworks from b: t=3,6 (visible from 3-6,6-9)

At t=6, fireworks from a at t=2,4,6 are visible.

Fireworks from b at t=3,6 are visible.

So, total: 3 (from a) + 2 (from b) = 5, but according to the formula, it's 4.

Wait, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is not ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b), but something else.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that when a and b are not co-prime, there might be overlapping launches.

Wait, in this case, a=2, b=3, m=3

ceil(4/2) + ceil(4/3) = 2 + 2 = 4

But in reality, at t=6, there are 5 fireworks visible.

So, perhaps the formula is not correct in this case.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the LCM again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but in this case, it's not achievable.

Wait, but in the earlier sample inputs, it was matching.

Maybe in some cases, it's not achievable.

But in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the maximum is achievable.

Wait, perhaps I need to check the problem statement again.

Looking back at the problem, it says "what is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time?"

So, it's possible that in some cases, the theoretical maximum cannot be achieved due to overlapping launch schedules.

But in the sample inputs, it seems that the maximum is achievable.

In my example with a=2, b=3, m=3, perhaps the maximum is 4, and my manual calculation is wrong.

Let's check:

At t=6:

From a: launches at t=2,4,6 (visible from 2-5,4-7,6-9)

From b: launches at t=3,6 (visible from 3-6,6-9)

At t=6, fireworks from t=2 (visible until 5), t=4 (visible until 7), t=6 (visible until 9) from a.

From b: t=3 (visible until 6), t=6 (visible until 9)

So, at t=6:

- Firework from a at t=2: not visible at t=6 (only until t=5)

- Firework from a at t=4: visible from t=4 to t=7

- Firework from a at t=6: visible from t=6 to t=9

- Firework from b at t=3: visible from t=3 to t=6

- Firework from b at t=6: visible from t=6 to t=9

So, at t=6:

- a: t=4 (visible at t=6)

- a: t=6 (visible at t=6)

- b: t=3 (visible at t=6)

- b: t=6 (visible at t=6)

So, total of 4 fireworks visible at t=6.

So, earlier I miscounted; it's actually 4, which matches the formula.

Therefore, the formula ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b) is correct.

Another test case: a=2, b=2, m=1

ceil(2/2) + ceil(2/2) = 1 + 1 = 2

At t=2:

From a: t=2 (visible from 2 to 3)

From b: t=2 (visible from 2 to 3)

So, total of 2 fireworks at t=2.

Wait, but if both installations launch at the same time, are they considered separate fireworks?

Yes, they are from different installations, so they are separate.

Hence, total is 2, which matches the formula.

Another test case: a=1, b=1, m=0

ceil(1/1) + ceil(1/1) = 1 + 1 = 2

At t=1:

From a: t=1 (visible from 1 to 1)

From b: t=1 (visible from 1 to 1)

Total: 2 fireworks at t=1.

Yes, matches the formula.

So, it seems that the formula is correct.

Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time is ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)

In code, this can be implemented as:

num_a = (m +1 + a -1) // a

num_b = (m +1 + b -1) // b

total = num_a + num_b

print(total)

But looking back at the given code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

(a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())

mn = min(a, b) + m

if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):

print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)

else:

print(mn // a + mn // b)

This seems different from what I derived.

Let me analyze this code.

First, it calculates mn = min(a, b) + m

Then, if m is divisible by both a and b and a and b are not 1, it prints mn // a + mn // b + 1

Else, it prints mn // a + mn // b

Wait, mn = min(a, b) + m

So, mn // a is floor((min(a,b) + m)/a)

Similarly for b.

In the sample input 1: a=6, b=7, m=4

mn = 6 + 4 = 10

10 // 6 = 1, 10 // 7 = 1, sum = 2, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 2: a=3, b=4, m=10

mn = 3 + 10 =13

13 // 3 = 4, 13 //4 =3, sum =7, which matches.

In sample input 3: a=7, b=8, m=56

mn =7 +56=63

63 //7=9, 63//8=7, sum=16

But the sample output is 17.

Wait, according to the formula I derived, ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b) = ceil(57/7) + ceil(57/8) = 9 + 8 =17, which matches the sample output.

But according to the code, mn //a + mn //b = 9 + 7=16, which does not match the sample output.

But in the code, there is an if condition:

if m % a ==0 and m % b ==0 and a !=1 and b !=1:

print(mn //a + mn //b +1)

else:

print(mn //a + mn //b)

In this case, m=56, which is divisible by a=7 and b=8, and a and b are not 1, so it would print mn //a + mn //b +1 =9 +7 +1=17, which matches the sample output.

Wait, but 8 does not divide 56 evenly? Wait, 8 divides 56 evenly, 56//8=7.

Wait, 56 %8=0.

Similarly, 56 %7=0.

So, according to the code, it should print mn//a + mn//b +1=9 +7 +1=17, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 1: a=6, b=7, m=4

mn=6+4=10

m=4 is not divisible by a=6 and b=7, so it's mn//a + mn//b=1 +1=2, which matches the sample output.

In sample input 2: a=3, b=4, m=10

mn=3+10=13

m=10 is not divisible by a=3 and b=4, so mn//a + mn//b=4 +3=7, which matches.

In sample input 4: a=5, b=6, m=78123459896

mn=5 +78123459896=78123459901

m=78123459896 is divisible by a=5? 78123459896 %5=1, not 0.

So, mn//a + mn//b=78123459901//5 +78123459901//6=15624691980 +13020576650=28645268630, which matches the sample output.

But according to my formula, ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)=ceil(78123459897/5)+ceil(78123459897/6)=15624691980 +13020576650=28645268630, which matches.

So, in this case, the code outputs the correct answer without adding +1 because m is not divisible by a.

Wait, but in sample input 3, m is divisible by both a and b, so it adds +1.

So, perhaps the code is handling the case when m is divisible by both a and b and a and b are not 1, then add +1.

Wait, but in my earlier example where a=2, b=3, m=3

mn=2+3=5

m=3 is not divisible by a=2, so it's mn//a + mn//b=5//2 +5//3=2 +1=3

But according to the formula, ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)=ceil(4/2)+ceil(4/3)=2 +2=4

But in reality, at t=6, there are 4 fireworks visible.

But according to the code, it would output 3, which is incorrect.

Wait, but in the code, it checks if m % a ==0 and m % b ==0 and a !=1 and b !=1, then add +1.

In this case, m=3 is not divisible by a=2, so it doesn't add +1.

Hence, it outputs 2 +1=3, but according to the formula and reality, it should be 4.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the sample input 3, it worked correctly because m is divisible by both a and b, so it adds +1.

But in my example, m is not divisible by a, so it doesn't add +1, but the formula suggests that it should be ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)=2 +2=4.

So, perhaps the code is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider that mn = min(a,b) + m

Then, mn // a is floor((min(a,b) + m)/a)

Similarly for b.

But, in my earlier example, a=2, b=3, m=3

mn=2+3=5

5//2=2, 5//3=1, sum=3

But according to the formula, ceil((m +1)/a) + ceil((m +1)/b)=ceil(4/2)+ceil(4/3)=2 +2=4

So, the code is giving 3, but it should be 4.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

But in the sample inputs, it's giving the correct output.

So, perhaps the code is correct for the sample inputs but fails in some other cases.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that the maximum is achievable, so perhaps the code is correct.

But in my example, it's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula.

Let me think about it differently.

I need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time t.

Each installation has fireworks launched at multiples of a and b, visible for m minutes after launch.

So, for installation a, the number of visible fireworks at time t is floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a)

Similarly for b.

I need to maximize floor(t/a) - floor((t - m -1)/a) + floor(t/b) - floor((t - m -1)/b)

As t varies, this sum changes.

I need to find the maximum value of this sum.

From earlier analysis, when t is a multiple of LCM(a,b), or something like that.

But given the constraints, I need an efficient way.

Looking back at the code, it seems to be using mn = min(a,b) + m

Then, mn // a + mn // b, and in some cases adding +1.

But in my example, it's not matching.

Hence, perhaps the code is incorrect.

But in all sample inputs, it's giving the correct output.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that when m is divisible by both a and b, and a and b are not 1, then add +1.

In my example, m=3 is not divisible by a=2, so no +1.

Hence, output is mn//a + mn//b=5//2 +5//3=2 +1=3, but according to the formula, it should be 4.

Hence, in this case, the code is incorrect.

But in the sample inputs, it's correct.

So, perhaps the code is correct for the sample inputs but fails in some other cases.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen in the sky at the same time from two installations launching fireworks at regular intervals, given that each firework remains visible for a specified duration.

## Approach

1. **Understanding Visibility**:
   - Each firework launched by the first installation at times that are multiples of `a` minutes remains visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - Similarly, each firework launched by the second installation at times that are multiples of `b` minutes remains visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - The number of fireworks visible from the first installation at any time `t` is given by `floor(t / a) - floor((t - m - 1) / a)`.
   - Similarly, for the second installation, it is `floor(t / b) - floor((t - m - 1) / b)`.

3. **Maximizing Visibility**:
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time `t` is the sum of the visible fireworks from both installations.
   - This can be maximized by considering `t` such that it aligns with the launch times of both installations to maximize overlaps.

4. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - We use the formula `ceil((m + 1) / a) + ceil((m + 1) / b)` to directly compute the maximum number of visible fireworks without iterating over possible times `t`.

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        m = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        num_a = (m + 1 + a - 1) // a
        num_b = (m + 1 + b - 1) // b
        total = num_a + num_b
        print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Reading Input**:
  - Read the entire input at once for efficiency.
  - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, read `a`, `b`, and `m`.

- **Calculating Maximum Visibility**:
  - Use the formula `ceil((m + 1) / a)` which is computed as `(m + 1 + a - 1) // a` to get the number of visible fireworks from the first installation.
  - Similarly, compute `ceil((m + 1) / b)` for the second installation.
  - Sum these values to get the total maximum number of visible fireworks.

- **Output**:
  - Print the total for each test case.

This approach ensures an efficient and correct solution to determine the maximum number of visible fireworks at any given time, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
