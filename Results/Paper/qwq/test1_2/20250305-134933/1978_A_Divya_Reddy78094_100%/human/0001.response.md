Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Alice has n books, each with a certain number of pages, and she wants to divide these books into two non-empty piles. Then, she reads the book with the highest number in each pile and wants to maximize the total number of pages she reads from these two books.

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. She has to divide the books into two piles, each pile must have at least one book, and then from each pile, she reads the book with the most pages. My goal is to help her arrange the books in such a way that the sum of the pages of these two books is as large as possible.

Let me think about how to approach this. If I want the sum to be maximum, I should try to have the two books with the highest number of pages each in separate piles. That way, Alice reads the two most extensive books.

Wait, but she reads the highest book from each pile, and the piles must each have at least one book. So, if I put the two highest books in separate piles, each pile's highest book would be those two highest books, and their sum would be maximized.

For example, suppose she has books with pages 2, 3, 3, 1. The two highest are both 3. If I put one 3 in one pile and the other 3 in another pile, the sum would be 3 + 3 = 6. But in the example given, the output is 4, not 6. Hmm, that doesn't match. Wait, in the second test case, the output is 4 for input 4, followed by 2 3 3 1.

Wait, let's look back at the example:

Input:

5

2

1 1

4

2 3 3 1

5

2 2 3 2 2

2

10 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

2

4

5

13

5

In the second test case, n=4, books are 2,3,3,1. If I put the two 3's in separate piles, sum would be 3+3=6, but the output is 4. So maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, the problem says "reads one book with the highest number in each pile." Does "highest number" refer to the book with the most pages, or the book with the highest index? I think it's about the most pages, but I need to confirm.

Looking back: "each pile, Alice reads the book with the highest number in each pile." And "find the maximum total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

So, it's about the books with the most pages in each pile.

Given that, in the second test case, output is 4, which is 3 + 1, but why not 3 + 3 = 6?

Wait, maybe I need to look at the explanation in the note for the second test case.

In the second test case, Alice puts books 2 and 3 in one pile (which have 3 and 3 pages), and books 1 and 4 in another pile (2 and 1 pages). Then, she reads the highest from each pile: 3 from the first pile and 2 from the second pile, totaling 3 + 2 = 5, but the output is 4. Wait, that doesn't match. There might be a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I misread the example output. Let me check again.

Input:

5

2

1 1

4

2 3 3 1

5

2 2 3 2 2

2

10 3

3

1 2 3

Output:

2

4

5

13

5

So for n=4, books 2 3 3 1, output is 4.

But if she puts two 3's in separate piles, she reads 3 + 3 = 6, which is more than 4. So why is the output 4?

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing. Let's read the problem again.

"Alice divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice wants to maximize the total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

So, she divides the books into two non-empty piles, and from each pile, she reads the book with the most pages, and we want the sum of those two to be as large as possible.

In the second test case, with books 2,3,3,1, if she puts the two 3's in separate piles, she reads 3 + 3 = 6, which is more than 4. But the sample output is 4. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Let me read it carefully again.

"Alice has n books. The 1-st book contains a1 pages, the 2-nd book contains a2 pages, ..., the n-th book contains an pages. Alice does the following:

- She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

- Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice wants to maximize the total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

Wait, maybe "the highest number" refers to the book with the highest index, not necessarily the most pages. Is that possible?

Looking back, it says "the highest number in each pile." Given that the books are labeled with a1, a2, ..., an, and the problem says "the highest number," it's ambiguous whether it's the book with the most pages or the book with the highest index.

But in the note for the second test case, it says:

"In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 1 from the second pile. Then she will read a3 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

Wait, so "the highest number" seems to refer to the book with the highest page count in the pile.

But in that case, if she puts the two 3's in separate piles, she would read 3 + 3 = 6, which is better than 4.

But according to the note, she puts books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another pile, reads a3=3 and a4=1, totaling 4.

But why not put book 2 (a2=3) in one pile and book 3 (a3=3) in another pile, and read 3 + 3 = 6?

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the book indices.

Wait, in the note, it says "books with numbers 2 and 3" and "books with numbers 1 and 4". Does "book number" refer to their position in the input list?

Wait, in the input, the books are listed as a1, a2, a3, a4, etc.

So, book 1 has a1 pages, book 2 has a2 pages, and so on.

In the note, it says "books with numbers 2 and 3" which should be books a2 and a3, which are 3 and 3, and "books with numbers 1 and 4" which are a1=2 and a4=1.

Then, she reads the book with the highest number in each pile. In the first pile, books 2 and 3 have 3 and 3 pages, so the highest is 3. In the second pile, books 1 and 4 have 2 and 1 pages, so the highest is 2. So she reads 3 + 2 = 5 pages.

But according to the sample output, it's 4, not 5.

Wait, perhaps I misread the note.

Wait, in the note, it says "Then she will read a3 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

But according to the pile compositions, she should read a3=3 from the first pile and a1=2 from the second pile, totaling 5, not 4.

There might be a mistake in the note or the sample output.

Wait, perhaps the note is incorrect, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Let me look at the other test cases to see if I can find a pattern.

First test case:

Input: 2 books with 1 and 1 pages. Output: 2.

That makes sense: put one book in each pile, read 1 + 1 = 2.

Third test case:

n=5, books: 2,2,3,2,2. Output:5.

If she puts the book with 3 in one pile and the rest in another pile, she reads 3 + 2 = 5, which matches the output.

Fourth test case:

n=2, books:10 and 3. Output:13.

Put each book in separate piles, read 10 + 3 = 13.

Fifth test case:

n=3, books:1,2,3. Output:5.

Put book 3 in one pile and books 1 and 2 in another pile. Read 3 + 2 = 5.

So, in all these cases, it seems like the strategy is to put the two highest books in separate piles and read them, summing their pages.

But in the second test case, according to the sample output, it's 4, but according to this strategy, it should be 6.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint that the piles must be contiguous or something, but the problem doesn't say that.

Wait, maybe the piles must be contiguous in the input order.

Is that possible? Let me check.

In the second test case, if she divides the books into piles [2,3] and [3,1], the highest in the first pile is 3, in the second pile is 3, total 6.

Or [2,3,3] and [1], highest are 3 and 1, total 4.

Or [2] and [3,3,1], highest are 2 and 3, total 5.

So the maximum would be 6.

But the sample output is 4, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Let me read it again carefully.

"Alice divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile."

So, she divides the books into two piles, each pile has at least one book, and she reads the book with the highest page count in each pile, then sums those two.

So, in the second test case, dividing into [2,3,3] and [1], she reads 3 from the first pile and 1 from the second pile, totaling 4.

But she could divide into [2] and [3,3,1], reading 2 and 3, totaling 5.

Or [2,3] and [3,1], reading 3 and 3, totaling 6.

So why is the sample output 4?

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the note.

Looking back at the note:

"In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the highest number 1 from the second pile. Then she will read a3 + a4 = 3 + 1 = 4 pages."

But according to the input, a3 is 3 and a4 is 1, so sum is 4.

But she could have put book 2 (a2=3) in one pile and book 3 (a3=3) in another pile, and read 3 + 3 = 6.

So why is the output 4?

Wait, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps "one book with the highest number in each pile" means she reads only one book from each pile, but not necessarily the one with the highest pages.

Wait, no, it's about the highest number of pages.

Wait, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the note.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has constraints that the piles must be contiguous in the input order, but the problem doesn't say that.

Given that in the sample input, for n=4, books are 2,3,3,1, and output is 4, but according to the strategy of putting the two highest in separate piles, it should be 6.

This inconsistency is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to select two books such that they are not in the same pile, meaning they are in different piles, and maximize their sum.

But that would be similar to selecting any two books with the highest pages, which would be the two highest books.

But in the second test case, that would be 3 and 3, sum 6, but the output is 4.

This is perplexing.

Wait, maybe there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement regarding "the highest number in each pile."

Perhaps "the highest number" refers to the book with the highest index, not the highest page count.

But that doesn't make sense because in the note, they refer to the highest number as the page count.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the sample input and output.

Given that in the second test case, with books 2,3,3,1, the output is 4, which is a3 + a4 = 3 +1, but that's not the maximum possible.

This suggests that perhaps there is a constraint that the two books read cannot be the two highest books.

But that doesn't make sense because the problem allows any division into two non-empty piles.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to maximize the sum of the two largest distinct values.

But even then, in the second test case, there are two 3's, so sum would be 3 + 3 =6.

But the output is 4, which doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps there is a misinterpretation in the problem statement.

Let me read the problem again.

"Alice has n books. The 1st book contains a1 pages, the 2nd book contains a2 pages, ..., the n-th book contains an pages. Alice does the following:

- She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.

- Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice wants to maximize the total number of pages she can read by dividing the books into two piles."

So, she divides the books into two piles, each with at least one book, and from each pile, she reads the book with the most pages, then sums those two.

Given that, to maximize the sum, she should put the two highest books in separate piles.

In the second test case, with books 2,3,3,1, the two highest books are both 3. So, putting each in separate piles would give sum 3 + 3 =6.

But the sample output is 4, which suggests that perhaps the problem has additional constraints not mentioned.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the sample output.

Given this confusion, perhaps I should look at the provided program to see what it's doing.

The provided program is:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])

So, it reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, reads n, then reads the list of a1 to an, and then prints the sum of the maximum of the first n-1 books plus the last book.

In the second test case, n=4, books are 2,3,3,1.

So, nums = [2,3,3,1]

max(nums[:-1]) is max([2,3,3]) = 3

nums[-1] =1

sum is 3 +1 =4, which matches the sample output.

But as I thought earlier, this isn't the optimal strategy because putting the two highest books in separate piles would give a higher sum.

But according to the sample output, it's expected to be 4.

Given that, perhaps the problem has a constraint that the two books read cannot be the two highest books, or something similar.

But that doesn't make sense because, in the third test case, n=5, books=2,2,3,2,2, output is 5, which is 3 +2.

According to the program, max(nums[:-1]) is max([2,2,3,2])=3, nums[-1]=2, sum=5, which matches.

In the fourth test case, n=2, books=10,3, output=13, which is 10 +3.

According to the program, max(nums[:-1])=10, nums[-1]=3, sum=13, which matches.

Fifth test case, n=3, books=1,2,3, output=5, which is 3 +2.

According to the program, max(nums[:-1])=2, nums[-1]=3, sum=5, which matches.

So, in these cases, the program seems to be correct.

But in the second test case, as per the sample explanation, it's putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in another pile, reading a3=3 and a4=1, sum=4.

But as per my earlier thought, she could put book 2 in one pile and books 3 and 1 in another pile, reading a2=3 and a3=3, sum=6.

But according to the sample output, it's 4.

There seems to be a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a constraint that the two piles must be contiguous subarrays, but the problem doesn't state that.

Given that, perhaps the problem intends for the piles to be contiguous in the input order.

But even then, in the second test case, dividing into [2,3] and [3,1] would give sums of 3 +3=6.

Alternatively, [2] and [3,3,1], sum 2 +3=5.

Or [2,3] and [3,1], sum 3 +3=6.

So, the maximum should be 6, but the sample output is 4.

This suggests that perhaps the problem has additional constraints not mentioned in the problem statement.

Given this confusion, perhaps the provided program is incorrect, but according to the sample outputs, it seems to be producing the expected results.

Wait, in the second test case, according to the sample output, it's 4, which matches the program's output of max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1].

But as per my earlier reasoning, it's possible to get a higher sum.

Perhaps the problem intends to have the two piles such that the two highest books are not in the same pile, but that's not explicitly stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem wants the sum of the two largest distinct values, but again, that's not what the problem says.

Given this confusion, perhaps the provided program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the optimal division.

But according to the sample outputs, it seems to be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a specific way of dividing the piles that I'm missing.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose we fix one book to be in one pile and the rest in the other pile.

Then, the sum would be that book plus the maximum of the remaining books.

The provided program seems to be choosing the maximum of the first n-1 books plus the last book.

But in the second test case, nums = [2,3,3,1], max(nums[:-1])=3, nums[-1]=1, sum=4.

But if we choose to put book 3 in one pile and book 3 in another pile, sum=3+3=6.

But according to the program, it's 4.

Yet, the sample output is 4.

So, perhaps the program is correct, and my earlier reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a constraint that the two piles must be non-empty, and the two books read must not be the same book.

But in the second test case, even if we put two books with 3 pages in separate piles, it's allowed.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intends for the two piles to be contiguous in the input order, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Given the confusion, perhaps the provided program is correct based on the sample outputs, even though my initial reasoning suggests otherwise.

Given that, perhaps the program is correct.

So, the answer is Correctness: True.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{True}} \]
