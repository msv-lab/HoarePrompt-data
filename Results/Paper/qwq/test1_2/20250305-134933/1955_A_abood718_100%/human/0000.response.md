Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Maxim wants to buy exactly n yogurts, and there are two options for purchasing them: he can buy them individually at a price of a burles each, or buy two of them together at a promotional price of b burles. The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim needs to spend to get exactly n yogurts.

First, I need to understand the inputs and outputs. The input consists of multiple test cases, specified by the integer t, which indicates how many separate scenarios I need to handle. For each test case, there's a line with three integers: n, a, and b. These represent the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy, the regular price per yogurt, and the promotional price for two yogurts, respectively.

The constraints are given: t is between 1 and 10,000, n is between 1 and 100, and both a and b are between 1 and 30. So, I need to make sure that my solution is efficient enough to handle up to 10,000 test cases quickly.

Now, let's think about how to approach this problem. For each test case, I need to decide whether to buy yogurts individually or in pairs to minimize the total cost.

One way to think about this is to consider the cost per yogurt for the promotional deal. If buying two yogurts for b burles is cheaper than buying them individually, then it makes sense to use the promotional deal as much as possible.

So, let's calculate the cost per yogurt for the promotional deal: b divided by 2. If this is less than the individual price a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible.

But there's a catch: n might not be even, so there might be one yogurt left to buy individually.

Let me formalize this:

- If b / 2 < a, then it's better to buy as many pairs as possible, and if n is odd, buy one yogurt individually.

- If b / 2 >= a, then buying individually might be cheaper or equal in price to buying in pairs.

Wait, actually, if b / 2 >= a, then buying individually is at least as cheap as buying in pairs. So, in this case, it's better to buy all yogurts individually to minimize the cost.

But let me check this with an example.

Take the first test case from the example:

2 5 9

Here, n=2, a=5, b=9

So, buying two yogurts individually would cost 2*5=10 burles, but the promotional price is 9 burles for two yogurts. So, it's better to buy them as a pair, and the total cost is 9 burles.

Second test case:

3 5 9

n=3, a=5, b=9

If I buy one pair for 9 burles and one yogurt individually for 5 burles, the total is 14 burles.

Alternatively, if I try to buy all individually, it would be 3*5=15 burles, which is more. So, 14 burles is better.

Third test case:

3 5 11

n=3, a=5, b=11

Buying one pair for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles gives a total of 16 burles.

But the output is 15 burles, which is different. Hmm, that doesn't match my calculation.

Wait, maybe there's another way to look at it.

Wait, in this case, buying all three individually would cost 3*5=15 burles, which is less than buying one pair for 11 and one individual for 5 (which would be 16 burles). So, it's better to buy all individually for 15 burles.

But according to the example output, it's 15 burles, which matches buying all individually.

Wait, but according to my earlier logic, if b/2 < a, buy as many pairs as possible, else buy individually.

In this case, b=11, b/2=5.5, which is greater than a=5, so buy all individually.

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but in the second test case, b=9, b/2=4.5, which is less than a=5, so buy as many pairs as possible and any remaining individually.

So, for n=3, buy one pair (9 burles) and one individual (5 burles), total 14 burles.

In the third test case, b=11, b/2=5.5, which is greater than a=5, so buy all individually, total 15 burles.

Okay, that seems consistent.

Now, let's look at the fourth test case:

4 5 11

n=4, a=5, b=11

If b/2=5.5, which is greater than a=5, so buy all individually, total 4*5=20 burles.

Yes, that matches the example output of 20 burles.

So, the general approach seems to be:

- If b / 2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible, and if n is odd, buy one additional yogurt individually.

- Else, buy all yogurts individually.

Wait, but in the third test case, b/2=5.5 >= a=5, so buy all individually.

Yes, that makes sense.

But let me think about another scenario.

Suppose n=4, a=5, b=9.

Then, b/2=4.5 < a=5, so buy two pairs: 2*9=18 burles.

Alternatively, buy all individually: 4*5=20 burles.

So, 18 burles is better.

Another scenario: n=5, a=5, b=9.

b/2=4.5 < a=5, so buy two pairs (2*9=18 burles) and one individual (5 burles), total 23 burles.

Alternatively, buy all individually: 5*5=25 burles.

So, 23 burles is better.

Another scenario: n=5, a=6, b=10.

b/2=5 < a=6, so buy two pairs (2*10=20 burles) and one individual (6 burles), total 26 burles.

Alternatively, buy all individually: 5*6=30 burles.

So, 26 burles is better.

Another scenario: n=5, a=5, b=10.

b/2=5 >= a=5, so buy all individually: 5*5=25 burles.

Alternatively, buy two pairs (2*10=20 burles) and one individual (5 burles), total 25 burles.

So, both options give the same total cost.

In this case, it's fine to buy all individually.

So, in cases where b/2 == a, it doesn't matter; both options will give the same total cost.

Hence, the general approach holds.

Now, looking at the provided program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

(A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())

if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

elif A % 2 == 0:

print(int(A * C / 2))

else:

X = A // 2

print(X * C + B)

Wait, this seems a bit off.

In the condition: if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

This suggests that if the cost of two individual yogurts is less than the promotional price, then buy all individually.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, which is equivalent to b < 2*a, then buy as many pairs as possible and any remaining individually.

But here, it's checking if b < 2*a, and if so, buy all individually.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought.

Wait, no, in my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible and any remaining individually.

But in this code, if b*2 < c, which is b*2 < c, but in our notation, b is the promotional price for two yogurts, and a is the individual price.

Wait, hold on, in the code, (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split()), corresponding to n, a, b.

Wait, in the problem statement, the variables are n, a, b.

But in the code, they are A, B, C.

So, A is n, B is a, C is b.

So, the condition is if B * 2 < C:

print(A * B)

Which means, if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, buy as many pairs as possible.

Wait, there's a confusion here.

Wait, if b/2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible.

In the code, it's checking if 2*a < b, which is the opposite.

Wait, no, let's be careful.

If b/2 < a, then buy as many pairs as possible.

Which is equivalent to b < 2*a.

So, in the code, it should check if b < 2*a, and if so, buy as many pairs as possible.

But in the code, it's checking if B*2 < C, which is 2*a < b, and if so, buy all individually.

That seems incorrect.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in variable naming.

Wait, in the code, (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split()), where A is n, B is a, C is b.

So, if B*2 < C, which is if 2*a < b, then buy all individually.

Else, if A is even, buy A/2 pairs, which would cost (A/2)*C.

Else, buy (A//2) pairs and one individual yogurt, which would cost (A//2)*C + B.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, buy as many pairs as possible, and any remaining individually.

Else, buy all individually.

So, in the code, it's checking if 2*a < b, which is the opposite.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake.

Wait, let's take the third test case:

3 5 11

So, A=3, B=5, C=11

Check if 2*5 < 11, which is 10 < 11, which is True, so print(A * B) = 3*5=15.

Which matches the example output.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, which is 11/2=5.5 < 5? No, 5.5 > 5, so it should buy all individually.

But in the code, it's checking 2*a < b, which is 10 < 11, so buy all individually, which is A*B=15.

Wait, but in my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, buy as many pairs as possible, else buy all individually.

But in the code, if 2*a < b, buy all individually, else if A is even, buy A/2 pairs, else buy (A//2) pairs and one individual.

So, in the third test case, 2*a=10 < b=11, so buy all individually, which is correct.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, which is 5.5 < 5, which is False, so buy all individually.

Wait, but 5.5 > 5, so buy all individually.

So, in the code, if 2*a < b, buy all individually.

Else, if A is even, buy A/2 pairs, else buy (A//2) pairs and one individual.

Which seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I was confused earlier.

So, in the code, if 2*a < b, which is equivalent to b/2 > a, buy all individually.

Else, if A is even, buy A/2 pairs.

Else, buy (A//2) pairs and one individual.

Which aligns with the earlier reasoning.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Let me verify with another test case.

Second test case: 3 5 9

A=3, B=5, C=9

Check if 2*5 < 9, which is 10 < 9, which is False.

So, proceed to else clause.

Since A is odd (A%2 ==1), so X = A//2 =1

Print(X*C + B) =1*9 +5=14, which matches the example output.

First test case:2 5 9

A=2, B=5, C=9

Check if 2*5 <9, which is 10<9, False.

Then, since A is even, print(int(A*C/2))=int(2*9/2)=int(9)=9, which matches the example.

Fourth test case:4 5 11

A=4, B=5, C=11

Check if 2*5 <11, which is 10<11, True, so print(A*B)=4*5=20, which matches the example.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, which is 11/2=5.5 <5, which is False, so buy all individually, which is A*B=20.

But in the code, it's checking 2*a < b, which is 10 <11, which is True, so print(A*B)=20.

But according to my earlier reasoning, if b/2 < a, buy as many pairs as possible, else buy all individually.

But in this case, b/2=5.5 >5, so buy all individually.

But 2*a < b is the same as b/2 > a, which is the condition for buying all individually.

Hence, the code seems correct.

Wait, but in the third test case, b/2=5.5 >5, which means buy all individually.

In the code, if 2*a < b, which is 10<11, True, so buy all individually.

Hence, it's consistent.

So, the code seems correct.

Hence, Correctness: **True**

**Final Solution**
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly n yogurts given the regular price per yogurt and a promotional price for two yogurts.

### Approach

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Read the number of test cases, t.
   - For each test case, read the values n (number of yogurts), a (regular price per yogurt), and b (promotional price for two yogurts).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the promotional price for two yogurts (b) is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually (2*a), i.e., if b < 2*a, then:
     - Buy as many pairs as possible and, if n is odd, buy one yogurt individually.
   - Else, buy all yogurts individually since the promotional deal does not offer a better price per yogurt.

3. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, check if b < 2*a:
     - If true, buy all yogurts individually (A * B).
     - If false, buy as many pairs as possible (A // 2 * C) and, if n is odd, buy one additional yogurt individually (B).
   - Print the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

### Solution Code

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if C < 2 * B:
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)
        else:
            print(A * B)

func()
```

### Explanation

- **Step-by-step breakdown for each test case**:
  1. **Read input values** A (n), B (a), and C (b).
  2. **Check condition** if C < 2 * B:
     - If true, calculate the cost by buying as many pairs as possible and any remaining individual yogurts.
     - If false, calculate the cost by buying all yogurts individually.
  3. **Output the minimum cost** for the current test case.

- **Why this approach works**:
  - By comparing the cost of the promotional deal to the cost of buying individually, we decide the optimal way to minimize the total cost.
  - This ensures that we leverage the promotional price only when it offers a better deal per yogurt, otherwise, falling back to individual pricing.

This method is efficient and ensures the correct minimum cost is calculated for each test case, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
