Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. There are n cities on a number line, each with a unique coordinate in ascending order. So, the cities are arranged in increasing order of their positions, which means no two cities share the same position.

Each city has a closest city, and this closest city is unique for every city. So, for any city, there's only one city that's closest to it. The distance between two cities is just the absolute difference in their coordinates.

Now, I can travel between cities in two ways:

1. Travel directly from city x to city y, paying the absolute difference in their coordinates in coins.

2. Travel from city x to its closest city, paying just 1 coin.

I need to handle m queries, each asking for the minimum number of coins required to travel from city x to city y.

First, I need to understand how to interpret the movement between cities, especially using the option to travel to the closest city for just 1 coin.

Looking at the example:

Cities: [0, 8, 12, 15, 20]

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (8)

- City 2 (8) -> City 3 (12)

- City 3 (12) -> City 4 (15)

- City 4 (15) -> City 3 (12)

- City 5 (20) -> City 4 (15)

In the first query, going from City 1 to City 4:

- Go from City 1 to City 2 (closest city, cost 1)

- Go from City 2 to City 3 (closest city, cost 1)

- Go from City 3 to City 4 (closest city, cost 1)

Total cost: 3 coins

In the second query, from City 1 to City 5:

- From City 1 to City 2: 1 coin

- From City 2 to City 3: 1 coin

- From City 3 to City 4: 1 coin

- From City 4 to City 5: cost is 20 - 15 = 5 coins

Total: 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins

But in the example output, it's 8 for the second query, which matches this.

Wait, but in the explanation, it says:

"Then you can travel from the city 4 to the city 5 , paying 5 coins. In total, you spend 3 + 5 = 8 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 5 ."

But in the program, it's calculating something differently.

Looking at the program:

It's using two dictionaries, d1 and d2, to store some cumulative costs.

d1 seems to be built from left to right, and d2 from right to left.

In d1, it seems to be calculating some kind of prefix sum where for each position i, it's deciding whether to go to the next city directly or via the closest city.

Similarly, d2 is doing something similar but from the end towards the start.

Then, for each query, it's computing the difference in these prefix sums to get the cost.

I need to verify if this approach is correct.

Let me think about what d1 and d2 represent.

Looking at d1:

- Initialize d1[2] = 1, which probably means the cost to go from city 1 to city 2 is 1 coin (since it's the closest city).

- Then, for each city i from 1 to n-2, it's calculating d1[i+2] based on d1[i+1].

- If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it adds 1 (probably meaning it's going to the closest city).

- Else, it adds the distance to the next city.

Similarly, d2 is doing something similar from the end.

So, d1 seems to be accumulating costs from the first city onwards, choosing to go to the closest city when it's cheaper.

Similarly, d2 is doing the same from the last city backwards.

Then, for each query, if y > x, it's computing d1[y] - d1[x], else d2[y] - d2[x].

Wait, but in the example, going from city 1 to city 4 would be d1[4] - d1[1] = 3 - 0 = 3, which matches the first query.

Going from city 1 to city 5 would be d1[5] - d1[1] = suppose d1[5] is 8, minus 0 is 8, which matches the second query.

Similarly, going from city 3 to city 4 is d1[4] - d1[3] = 3 - 2 = 1, which matches the third query.

Going from city 3 to city 2 is d2[2] - d2[3] = suppose d2[2] is 4, d2[3] is 0, so 4 - 0 = 4, which matches the fourth query.

And going from city 5 to city 1 is d2[1] - d2[5] = suppose d2[1] is 14, d2[5] is 0, so 14 - 0 = 14, which matches the fifth query.

So, it seems like d1 and d2 are precomputing some cumulative costs to reach each city from the start or end, respectively.

But I need to ensure that this approach correctly captures the minimum cost paths for any x and y.

Let me consider another example to verify.

Suppose we have cities at positions [0, 10, 20].

Closest cities:

- City 1 (0) -> City 2 (10)

- City 2 (10) -> City 1 or City 3, but since closest city is unique, maybe positions are such that City 2 -> City 1.

- City 3 (20) -> City 2 (10)

Wait, but according to the problem, closest cities are unique, so perhaps positions are adjusted accordingly.

Wait, but in this setup, City 2 is closest to City 1 and City 3 is closest to City 2.

Now, if I have to go from City 1 to City 3:

Option 1: Go directly from City 1 to City 3, paying |20 - 0| = 20 coins.

Option 2: Go from City 1 to City 2 (closest city, 1 coin), then from City 2 to City 3 (closest city, 1 coin). Total: 2 coins.

So, the minimum is 2 coins.

Now, according to the program:

Assuming n=3, a=[0,10,20]

d1[2] = 1

Then, i=1 (city 2), check if a[3] - a[2] < a[2] - a[1]: 20-10=10 < 10-0=10? No, since 10 is not less than 10, so d1[4] = 10 + d1[3]. But wait, n=3, so i goes up to n-1=2.

Wait, the loop is for i in range(1, n-1):

So, i=1:

if a[3] - a[2] < a[2] - a[1]: 20-10=10 < 10-0=10? No, so d1[4] = 10 + d1[3]

But n=3, so d1[4] is out of bounds. Wait, perhaps the indexing is off.

Wait, in Python, list indices start from 0, but the cities are numbered from 1 to n.

So, l = [0,10,20], where l[0]=0 (city 1), l[1]=10 (city 2), l[2]=20 (city 3)

d1 is a dictionary, d1[2] = 1

Then, for i in range(1, n-1): i=1 (city 2)

Check if l[2] - l[1] < l[1] - l[0]: 10 < 10? No, so d1[3] = 10 + d1[2] = 10 + 1 = 11

Then, d1 = {2:1, 3:11}

Similarly, d2[n-1]=1, so d2[3]=1

Then, for i in range(n-2,0,-1): i=2-1=1 (city 2)

if l[2] - l[1] < l[1] - l[0]: 10 < 10? No, so d2[2] = 10 + d2[3] = 10 + 1 = 11

So, d2 = {3:1, 2:11}

Now, for query x=1, y=3:

y > x, so print(d1[3] - d1[1]) = 11 - 0 = 11

But earlier, the minimum cost should be 2 coins, not 11.

Wait, this doesn't match. So, perhaps there's an issue with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the indexing or the initialization.

Let me check the code again.

d1 is initialized with d1[2] = 1

Then, for i in range(1, n-1):

index i corresponds to city i+1

l[i+1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i-1]

If true, d1[i+2] = 1 + d1[i+1]

Else, d1[i+2] = l[i+1] - l[i] + d1[i+1]

In our example:

n=3, cities 1,2,3 at positions 0,10,20

d1[2] = 1

i=1 (from range(1,2)), so i=1:

l[2] - l[1] = 20 - 10 = 10

l[1] - l[0] = 10 - 0 = 10

10 < 10? No, so d1[3] = 10 + d1[2] = 10 + 1 = 11

So, d1 = {2:1, 3:11}

Similarly, d2[3] = 1

Then, i=1:

if l[2] - l[1] < l[1] - l[0]: 10 < 10? No, so d2[1] = 10 + d2[2] = 10 + 11 = 21

Wait, but in the earlier step, d2[2] was not set yet. Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the code.

Looking back, d2 is initialized with d2[n-1] = 1, so d2[2] = 1 (since n=3, n-1=2)

Then, for i in range(n-2,0,-1): i=1

if l[i] - l[i-1] < l[i+1] - l[i]:

l[1] - l[0] = 10 - 0 = 10

l[2] - l[1] = 20 - 10 = 10

10 < 10? No, so d2[1] = 10 + d2[2] = 10 + 1 = 11

So, d2 = {2:1, 1:11}

Then, for query x=1, y=3: y > x, so d1[y] - d1[x] = 11 - 0 = 11

But earlier, the minimum cost should be 2 coins, not 11.

This suggests that the approach in the code is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps d1 and d2 are not being used correctly.

Looking back at the code, d1 is initialized with d1[2] = 1, but in Python, list indices start at 0, and cities are numbered from 1 to n.

Maybe there's confusion in indexing.

Alternatively, perhaps d1 and d2 are supposed to represent the minimum cost to reach city i from city 1 or city n, respectively.

But in this case, for x=1, y=3, the cost should be 2 coins, but according to d1[3] - d1[1] = 11 - 0 = 11, which is incorrect.

Hence, the program seems to have a flaw in its logic.

Let me think of an alternative approach.

Given that we can either move directly to any city paying the distance or move to the closest city for 1 coin, we need to find the minimum cost path from x to y.

This sounds like a graph problem where each city is a node, and there are edges to all other cities with weights equal to their distances, plus an edge to its closest city with weight 1.

However, with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building and traversing a graph directly is not feasible due to time constraints.

Instead, we need a smarter way to compute the minimum cost.

Looking back at the example:

Cities: [0,8,12,15,20]

Closest cities:

1->2, 2->3, 3->4, 4->3, 5->4

In the first query, 1->4:

1->2 (1 coin), 2->3 (1 coin), 3->4 (1 coin): total 3 coins

In the second query, 1->5:

1->2->3->4->5: 1+1+1+5=8 coins

Alternatively, 1->5 directly: 20-0=20 coins, which is worse.

Another option: 1->2->4->5: 1 + 7 + 5 = 13 coins, worse than 8.

So, 8 is the minimum.

Now, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

I notice that moving to closest cities is cheap (1 coin), but sometimes I need to pay more to jump directly to a farther city.

Perhaps, I can model this as a tree or some kind of hierarchical structure, but I need to think carefully.

Let me consider the sequence of cities and their closest cities.

Given that the cities are on a number line in ascending order, and each city has a unique closest city, I can observe the following:

- For city i, its closest city is either i-1 or i+1, depending on which is closer.

- Since the positions are strictly increasing, the distance between consecutive cities is positive.

- The closest city for city i is the one with the smallest distance |a_j - a_i|, and it's unique.

So, for each city, I can precompute its closest city.

Then, the problem becomes navigating this set of cities where each city has a pointer to its closest city, and I can move along these pointers for 1 coin or make direct jumps for the distance cost.

This resembles a graph where each city has an edge to its closest city with weight 1, and edges to all other cities with weights equal to their distances.

To find the minimum cost path from x to y, I can consider the following:

- Moving along the closest city pointers is cheap (1 coin per move), but it might take many steps.

- Moving directly to y from x is costly (|a_x - a_y| coins), but it's a direct path.

- There might be a combination of moving along closest city pointers and making direct jumps to minimize the total cost.

I need to find an efficient way to compute this without processing each query individually in O(n) time.

Let's consider the properties of moving along closest city pointers.

If I keep moving from a city to its closest city, I might end up reaching a common point from both x and y, and then I can meet there.

However, this might not always be efficient, and it's unclear how to compute this quickly for a large number of queries.

Another approach is to model this as a graph and use some kind of shortest path algorithm, but with n up to 10^5, traditional shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra would be too slow.

I need a smarter way to handle this.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards a center or a root in some tree structure.

If I can build some kind of tree where each node points to its closest city, then I can perhaps compute the minimum cost using properties of trees, like LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor).

But I'm not sure if that directly applies here.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of compressing the path towards the closest city.

If I keep moving to the closest city, I might be able to group cities into clusters where moving within the cluster is cheap.

But I need to formalize this idea.

Let me try to think recursively.

Define dp[x][k] as the minimum cost to go from city x to some city that is at most 2^k steps away, where each step is moving to the closest city.

Then, I can use these dp values to jump across the city array in a binary lifting manner.

But I'm not sure if this directly helps in computing the minimum cost between any two cities.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimum cost for x to reach some meeting point and y to reach the same meeting point, and then sum those costs.

But finding the optimal meeting point might be time-consuming.

Let me consider another angle.

Suppose I fix x and y, and I want to find the minimum cost path from x to y.

I can consider the direct path from x to y, which costs |a_x - a_y|.

Alternatively, I can move from x to its closest city, then repeat this process until I reach y, paying 1 coin per move.

But this could be very inefficient if y is far away.

A better strategy might be to move from x to y directly if the distance is smaller than the path through closest cities.

But I need a way to balance these options.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimum cost to go from x to y as the minimum over all paths that involve moving to closest cities and making direct jumps.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is always better than moving directly, unless the direct move is cheaper.

Wait, no. Moving to the closest city costs only 1 coin, but it might take many steps to reach y.

While moving directly from x to y costs |a_x - a_y| coins, which could be larger than the cost of moving through closest cities.

So, in some cases, moving through closest cities is cheaper.

In the first example, moving from city 1 to city 4 via cities 2 and 3 costs 3 coins, which is less than the direct cost of |15 - 0| = 15 coins.

Hence, moving through closest cities is better.

In another case, moving from city 1 to city 5 can be done either directly for 20 coins or through cities 2, 3, 4, and then 5 for 1 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 8 coins, which is better.

So, moving through closest cities is preferable when the path is short enough.

But how do I generalize this?

Let me consider that the sequence of cities is ordered on a number line, and their closest cities are determined based on distances.

Given that, perhaps I can model the movement between cities using the differences in their coordinates and the costs associated with moving to closest cities.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal path in a graph where each city is connected to its closest city with an edge of weight 1, and to all other cities with edges of weight equal to their distances.

But building such a graph explicitly is not feasible for n up to 10^5.

I need a smarter way to compute the minimal cost paths.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step closer to the target in a certain sense.

If the closest city for x is z, and the closest city for z is w, and so on, then moving from x to z to w, etc., might lead me towards y.

But this path might not be the most direct or efficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute for each city the sequence of cities reached by repeatedly moving to the closest city, and then find a way to jump across these sequences.

This sounds a bit like path compression or binary lifting in trees.

Wait, perhaps I can model the cities as a tree where each city has an edge to its closest city, and then compute some tree-related properties to answer the queries.

But in the given example, the tree would look like this:

City 1 -> City 2

City 2 -> City 3

City 3 -> City 4

City 4 -> City 3 (but since it's a tree, we might have to handle cycles carefully)

City 5 -> City 4

So, there might be a cycle between City 3 and City 4.

But the problem states that the closest city is unique for each city, so the graph should be a DAG or a tree without cycles.

Wait, in the example, City 4 points back to City 3, which would create a cycle: 3 -> 4 -> 3.

But the problem says that the closest city is unique, so perhaps such cycles are not possible.

Wait, perhaps the problem ensures that the graph is a tree.

But in the above example, there is a cycle.

Wait, maybe not, because in the problem statement, it's guaranteed that for every city, the closest city is unique, but it doesn't guarantee that the graph is a tree.

Wait, in the example, City 4 points to City 3, and City 3 points to City 4, but since movement is directed (each city points to its closest city), it might not form a cycle in the graph.

Wait, actually, if City 4's closest city is City 3, and City 3's closest city is City 4, it would create a cycle in the graph.

But the problem states that the closest city is unique for each city, so perhaps such mutual pointing is allowed.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's mentioned that for every city, the closest city is unique, meaning that for each city, there is exactly one closest city.

So, in the example, City 4's closest city is City 3, and City 3's closest city is City 4.

This is allowed as long as each city has only one closest city.

But for the purpose of building a graph, this would create a cycle: 3 -> 4 -> 3.

This could cause issues in path computation.

Hence, perhaps the graph is not a tree but a DAG or a graph with cycles.

Given that, finding the minimal path in such a graph would be more complex.

Given time constraints, I need an efficient way to handle this.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph with cost 1, and moving directly to any city is like taking a shortcut with cost equal to the distance.

Hence, the minimal cost path would be the minimal sum of these costs along any path from x to y.

This sounds like a shortest path problem in a graph with n nodes and edges of two types:

1. Edges to closest cities with weight 1.

2. Edges to any city with weight equal to their distance.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, building and traversing such a graph is not feasible.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that the cities are on a number line, sorted in increasing order.

Hence, the cities are arranged in a linear order.

Given that, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost based on their positions.

Let me consider that moving from x to y directly costs |a_x - a_y|.

Moving from x to its closest city z costs 1 coin, and then from z to y.

If z is closer to y than x is, then this might be beneficial.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I have two cities, x and y, with positions a_x and a_y.

If I move from x to y directly, it costs |a_x - a_y|.

Alternatively, I can move from x to its closest city z, which costs 1 coin, and then from z to y, which would cost whatever the minimal cost from z to y is.

Hence, the total cost would be 1 + cost(z, y).

I need to choose the minimum between |a_x - a_y| and 1 + cost(z, y).

Similarly, from z to y, I can again choose to move directly or to its closest city, and so on.

This seems recursive, but with n up to 10^5, I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Perhaps I can precompute some values to speed up the computation.

Let me consider precomputing for each city the cost to reach certain landmarks or endpoints.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the minimal cost to reach the leftmost or rightmost city, and then use that to compute the cost between any two cities.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving towards the center or some optimal point, and that by moving in that direction, I can minimize the total cost.

But I need to formalize this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the movement as a combination of moving step by step to the closest city and making direct jumps when it's beneficial.

But this is still too vague.

Let me consider that for any two cities x and y, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum of:

- |a_x - a_y|

- 1 + cost(z, y), where z is the closest city to x

- 1 + cost(w, y), where w is the closest city to z, and so on.

This seems like a recursive definition, but it's not clear how to compute it efficiently.

Perhaps I can use dynamic programming to compute the minimal cost from each city to some reference point.

But with n up to 10^5 and m up to 10^5, I need an O(n log n) precomputation and O(1) query time.

Let me consider precomputing the minimal cost from each city to the first city and to the last city, and then use those precomputed values to answer queries.

But I need to think about how to compute these minimal costs efficiently.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step with cost 1, and I can model this as a step in a graph.

But again, with potential cycles and the large number of cities, this seems challenging.

Wait, perhaps I can model the movement as a sequence of moves where I keep moving to the closest city until I reach a city that is closer to y than x is, and then make a direct jump to y.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that for any city x, moving to its closest city z brings me closer to y in terms of cost.

But this might not always be the case.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y, using memoization.

But with n up to 10^5, memoization might not be feasible.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimal over all sequences of moves where I can choose to either move to the closest city or make a direct jump.

This sounds like a classic shortest path problem, but with the constraints on n and m, I need an efficient algorithm.

Given that the cities are on a number line and sorted in increasing order, perhaps I can exploit this property.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path from x to y involves moving to the closest city repeatedly until I am "close enough" to y, and then make a direct jump.

But I need to define what "close enough" means.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that moving to the closest city is cheap (1 coin) and use it to navigate towards y in a more controlled manner.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost using the difference in positions and the number of steps needed to move through closest cities.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider precomputing for each city x, the minimal cost to reach the first city or the last city, and then use these precomputed values to answer queries.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost from x to y as the minimum of:

- cost(x, 1) + cost(1, y)

- cost(x, n) + cost(n, y)

But I need to define cost(a, b) in a way that's efficient to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a certain direction, and compute the minimal number of steps needed to go from x to y via these connections.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider building a tree where each city has an edge to its closest city, and then compute the distance in this tree.

But as we've seen earlier, this tree might have cycles, so it's not a tree in reality.

Hence, this approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost using the concept of the shortest path in a graph with weights, but find a way to represent this graph efficiently.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that the initial approach in the code is flawed and think of an alternative.

Let me consider that for any two cities x and y, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum of:

- |a_x - a_y|

- 1 + cost(z, y), where z is the closest city to x

I can compute this recursively, but with potential recursion depth up to n, it's not feasible.

Hence, perhaps I can use dynamic programming to compute the minimal cost from each city to y.

But with m up to 10^5 and n up to 10^5, this is still too slow.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider that the minimal cost path from x to y is the sum of the minimal cost from x to some city k, plus the minimal cost from k to y, where k is chosen optimally.

But I need to find a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can observe that moving to the closest city is cheap and use it to navigate towards y in a way that minimizes the total cost.

But I need a clear algorithm to do this.

Let me consider that for any city x, moving to its closest city z costs 1 coin, and from z, I can continue moving to its closest city, and so on, until I reach y.

But this could take many steps, and it's not guaranteed to be optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a way to jump directly to y if it's cheaper than moving through closest cities.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Let me consider that for any two cities x and y, the minimal cost to go from x to y is the minimum of:

- |a_x - a_y|

- 1 + cost(z, y), where z is the closest city to x

But as this is recursive, I need a way to compute it without recursion.

Perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by iteratively considering moving to its closest city.

But this still seems too slow for the given constraints.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y, by traversing the closest city pointers.

But with potential cycles, this might not terminate or be efficient.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step in a graph with cost 1, and moving directly to y is like taking a shortcut with cost |a_x - a_y|.

Hence, the minimal cost is the shortest path from x to y in this graph.

Given that, perhaps I can model this graph and use BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, but with n up to 10^5, this is not feasible.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the sum of the distances when moving through the closest city chain.

Wait, perhaps I can precompute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach the leftmost or rightmost city, and then use that to compute the cost between any two cities.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider precomputing two arrays:

- d_left[x]: minimal cost to reach city 1 from city x

- d_right[x]: minimal cost to reach city n from city x

Then, for any query x and y, the minimal cost from x to y is the minimum of:

- d_left[x] + d_left[y]

- d_left[x] + cost(1 to y)

Wait, this seems unclear.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach x from the left end (city 1), and from the right end (city n).

Then, for any two cities x and y, I can consider the paths:

1. Go from x to y directly: |a_x - a_y|

2. Go from x to city 1, then to y: d_left[x] + d_left[y]

3. Go from x to city n, then to y: d_right[x] + d_right[y]

Then, take the minimum of these options.

But I need to verify if this covers all possible paths.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider going from x to some city z, then to y, minimizing the total cost.

But this seems too broad.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step with cost 1, and moving directly is like taking a shortcut with cost equal to the distance.

Hence, the minimal cost path would be the minimal sum of these costs.

Given that, perhaps I can model the minimal cost from x to y as the minimal number of steps to move to closest cities plus the direct jump cost.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city repeatedly will eventually lead me to y, but possibly in a suboptimal way.

Hence, I need to find a way to minimize the cost by potentially making direct jumps at certain points.

But I need a systematic way to compute this.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is flawed and look for a different way.

Let me consider that the minimal cost from x to y is the minimal over all sequences of moves where I can choose to move to the closest city or make a direct jump.

Given that, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by considering the minimal number of steps to move to y via closest cities and direct jumps.

But I need a way to compute this efficiently.

Wait, perhaps I can compute for each city x, the minimal cost to reach y by considering the minimal of:

- |a_x - a_y|

- 1 + minimal cost from the closest city to y

But this is recursive and may not be efficient.

Given that, perhaps I need to find a way to compute this iteratively or using some precomputed values.

Let me consider that for any city x, moving to its closest city z costs 1 coin, and from z, I can continue moving to its closest city, and so on, until I reach y.

Hence, the cost would be the number of steps to reach y via closest cities.

But if y is not on this path, I need to make a direct jump at some point.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that the minimal cost is the minimal number of steps to move to y via closest cities plus any direct jumps needed.

But I need a clear algorithm.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that my initial approach is not leading me to the solution and consider an alternative approach.

Let me consider that since the cities are on a number line and sorted in increasing order, perhaps I can compute the minimal cost based on their positions and the positions of their closest cities.

Let me consider precomputing for each city x, the minimal cost to reach all cities to the left or to the right.

But I need to formalize this.

Wait, perhaps I can compute prefix sums where each prefix sum represents the minimal cost to reach that city from the previous one, considering the closest city moves.

But I need to think carefully.

Let me consider that moving to the closest city is like moving one step with cost 1, and moving directly is like making a jump with cost equal to the distance.

Hence, for any two consecutive cities, say x and x+1, the minimal cost to move from x to x+1 is min(|a_{x+1} - a_x|, 1 + cost(z, x+1)), where z is the closest city to x.

But this seems recursive and not directly helpful.

Given that, perhaps I need to find a way to compute the minimal cost in a prefix or suffix manner.

Let me consider building two arrays:

- left_min[x]: minimal cost to reach city x from city 1

- right_min[x]: minimal cost to reach city x from city n

Then, for any query x and y, the minimal cost from x to y would be min(left_min[y] - left_min[x], right_min[y] - right_min[x])

But I need to verify if this works.

In the example:

Cities: [0,8,12,15,20]

left_min:

left_min[1] = 0

left_min[2] = min(8-0, 1 + left_min[z]), where z is the closest city to city 2, which is city 3.

Wait, city 2's closest city is city 3.

So, left_min[2] = min(8-0, 1 + left_min[3])

But left_min[3] is min(12-0, 1 + left_min[4]) = min(12, 1 + min(15-0, 1 + left_min[5])) = min(12, 1 + min(15, 1 + left_min[5]))

left_min[5] = min(20-0, 1 + left_min[4]) = min(20, 1 + 15) = min(20,16) = 16

Then, left_min[4] = min(15-0, 1 + left_min[5]) = min(15,17) = 15

left_min[3] = min(12, 1 + 15) = min(12,16) = 12

left_min[2] = min(8, 1 + 12) = min(8,13) = 8

left_min[1] = 0

Hence, left_min = [0,8,12,15,16]

Similarly, right_min[x]: minimal
