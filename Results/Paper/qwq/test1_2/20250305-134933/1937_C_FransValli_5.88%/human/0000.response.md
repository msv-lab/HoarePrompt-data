Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR sets a bit if it's set in either number.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ as much as possible in their binary representation, especially in the higher bits.

But I don't know the actual values of p_i; I only have access to comparisons of their ORs through queries.

I need to find a strategy to identify the two numbers that, when XORed, give the maximum value, using at most 3n queries.

Let me think about how OR operations can help me gather information about the elements.

OR of two numbers will have a bit set if at least one of the numbers has that bit set.

So, if I compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d), I'm getting information about which pair has more bits set, or where their bits are set.

But I need to relate this to XOR, which is about differing bits.

This seems tricky because OR tells me about the union of set bits, while XOR cares about the differences.

Maybe I can find a way to identify the maximum possible XOR by finding the two numbers that differ the most in their bit patterns.

Let me consider the properties of XOR:

- The XOR of two numbers is maximized when their bits differ in as many positions as possible.

- For n-bit numbers, the maximum possible XOR is a number with all n bits set, which is (1 << n) - 1.

But in this problem, the numbers are permutations of 0 to n-1, so their bit lengths can vary depending on n.

Wait, n can be up to 10^4, so the numbers can have up to 14 bits (since 2^14 = 16384 > 10000).

I need a way to find two numbers in the permutation that differ in as many bits as possible.

But I can't look at the actual numbers; I can only compare ORs of pairs.

I need to devise a strategy to use these comparisons to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One idea is to try to find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation, but that might not necessarily give me the pair with the maximum XOR.

For example, in a permutation of 0 to 3:

- 0: 00

- 1: 01

- 2: 10

- 3: 11

Here, 0 XOR 3 = 3, 1 XOR 2 = 3, both give the maximum XOR of 3.

So, it's not just about finding the max and min; it's about finding pairs that differ in the highest possible bits.

Maybe I can try to identify the highest bit where the numbers differ.

Let me consider a binary search-like approach, where I try to find numbers that have different bits at each position, starting from the most significant bit.

But I'm not sure how to do that with the given query type.

Another idea: since I can compare ORs of pairs, maybe I can use that to rank the elements in some way.

Wait, but OR is not a total order; multiple pairs can have the same OR value.

I need a better plan.

Let me look at the reference solution provided.

The solution seems to select a pivot element and then compare it with others to find a good candidate.

Specifically, it seems to select index 0 as a starting point and then compare it with others to find a "best" partner.

But I need to verify if this approach indeed finds a pair with the maximum XOR.

Let me try to understand the reference solution step by step.

First, it initializes k to 1.

Then, for i from 2 to n-1, it asks a query comparing (p_0 OR p_k) with (p_0 OR p_i).

Depending on the result, it updates k if (p_0 OR p_k) < (p_0 OR p_i), setting k to i.

After this loop, it seems that k is set to the index that, when ORed with 0, gives the maximum OR value.

Then, it sets best to 0.

Next, it compares (p_k OR best) with (p_k OR i) for i from 1 to n-1, and updates best if (p_k OR best) < (p_k OR i).

Finally, it prints the pair (k, best).

I need to verify if this pair (k, best) indeed gives the maximum XOR.

Let me consider an example.

Take n = 4, with p = [0,3,1,2].

So, p_0=0, p_1=3, p_2=1, p_3=2.

First loop:

i=2:

? 0 1 0 2

Which is (0 OR 1) vs (0 OR 2) => 1 vs 2 => `<`, so k=2.

i=3:

? 0 2 0 3

Which is (0 OR 2) vs (0 OR 3) => 2 vs 3 => `<`, so k=3.

Now, k=3.

Set best=0.

Second loop:

i=1:

? 3 0 3 1

Which is (2 OR 0) vs (2 OR 3) => 2 vs 3 => `<`, so best=1.

i=2:

? 3 1 3 2

Which is (2 OR 1) vs (2 OR 2) => 3 vs 2 => `>`, so best remains 1.

Thus, pair is (3,1), which gives 2 XOR 3 = 1, but actually, the maximum XOR is 3 (between 1 and 2, or 0 and 3).

Wait, that's not correct.

In the example provided in the problem, the expected output was ! 3 2, which is correct because 2 XOR 1 = 3.

But according to this approach, it ended up with (3,1), which is not optimal.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted the indices.

Let me check the example again.

In the problem's example:

n=4, p=[0,3,1,2]

First query: ? 0 2 3 1 => (0|1)=1 < (2|3)=3 => `<`

Second query: ? 1 1 2 3 => (3|3)=3 == (1|2)=3 => `=`

Third query: ? 1 2 0 3 => (3|1)=3 > (0|2)=2 => `>`

Then, answer is ! 3 2.

But according to the reference solution:

First loop:

i=2:

? 0 1 0 2 => (0|1)=1 < (0|2)=2 => k=2

i=3:

? 0 2 0 3 => (0|2)=2 < (0|3)=3 => k=3

Set best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

? 3 0 3 1 => (2|0)=2 < (2|3)=3 => best=1

i=2:

? 3 1 3 2 => (2|1)=3 > (2|2)=2 => best remains 1

So, it outputs ! 3 1, but according to the example, ! 3 2 is correct.

Hence, the reference solution seems incorrect in this case.

Wait, perhaps the reference solution is not always correct.

Let me see what the reference solution is doing.

It seems to select a "best" partner for a pivot element, but it's not guaranteeing that it's the global maximum XOR.

In this case, (3,1) gives XOR 1, but (3,2) gives XOR 3, which is better.

So, the reference solution is flawed.

I need to find a better approach.

Let me think differently.

Since n can be up to 10^4 and t up to 10^3, with sum of n over all test cases up to 10^4, I need an efficient solution.

I need to find a way to identify the two numbers with the maximum XOR using at most 3n queries.

One approach could be to find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation and see if their XOR is maximum.

But as seen in the earlier example, that's not always the case.

Another idea: since XOR is maximized when bits differ, perhaps I can find the two numbers that differ in the most significant bit positions.

To do this, I might need to identify the numbers with the highest leading bits set differently.

But I'm not sure how to translate this into queries comparing ORs.

Maybe I can try to sort the elements based on their OR values with a fixed element.

Wait, but sorting would take too many queries.

I need something more efficient.

Let me consider the properties of OR and XOR.

OR of two numbers is greater if more bits are set in their binary representations.

XOR is maximized if the numbers differ in higher bits.

Perhaps I can find the two numbers with the highest individual values, as they are likely to have differing high bits.

But again, this isn't always true.

Wait, in the example, p=[0,3,1,2], the maximum XOR is between 1 and 2, which are 01 and 10 in binary, giving 11 (3 in decimal).

While 0 and 3 give 00 and 11, XOR is 11 (3), which is the same.

So, in this case, both pairs give the maximum XOR.

But in general, how can I find such a pair?

Let me consider that the maximum XOR would be between two numbers that differ in as many high bits as possible.

To find such a pair, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from highest to lowest and try to find numbers that differ in those bits.

But I need to do this using queries that compare ORs of pairs.

This seems complicated.

Maybe I can find the maximum value in the permutation and then find the value that differs the most from it.

But how do I find the maximum value?

I can try to find the maximum value by comparing ORs.

Wait, but ORing a number with another can give a higher value even if one of them is not the maximum.

For example, ORing 1 (01) and 2 (10) gives 3 (11), which is higher than both.

So, OR doesn't directly help in finding the maximum value.

This is tricky.

Let me think about another approach.

Since I need to maximize p_i XOR p_j, which is equivalent to finding two numbers whose binary representations differ in as many bit positions as possible.

To maximize XOR, I need p_i and p_j to have different bits in the highest possible positions.

So, perhaps I can find the two numbers that have the most significant bits set differently.

For example, if one has the highest bit set and the other doesn't, their XOR will have that bit set, contributing the maximum possible value to the XOR.

But again, I need to find a way to identify such pairs using only comparisons of ORs.

Maybe I can try to group the numbers based on their OR with a particular element, and then select from different groups.

This sounds vague; I need a better plan.

Let me consider that for any two elements, their XOR is maximized if their OR is large and their AND is small.

Wait, XOR is p_i + p_j - 2*(p_i AND p_j), but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, XOR is equal to OR minus AND.

But I don't have direct access to AND; I only have comparisons of ORs.

This seems like a dead end.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum OR value and then try to find two elements that achieve that OR, and see what their XOR is.

But the maximum OR doesn't directly correspond to the maximum XOR.

For example, in the earlier case, maximum OR is 3, which is achieved by ORing 1 and 2, or 0 and 3.

Their XORs are both 3, which is the maximum.

So, in this case, it worked.

But is this general?

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=3, p=[0,1,2].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

Here, maximum OR is 3, which corresponds to pair (1,2), which also has the maximum XOR of 3.

Another example: n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,4].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

0 and 4: OR=4, XOR=4

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 3: OR=3, XOR=2

1 and 4: OR=5, XOR=5

2 and 3: OR=3, XOR=1

2 and 4: OR=6, XOR=6

3 and 4: OR=7, XOR=7

Here, maximum XOR is 7, achieved by pair (3,4).

Maximum OR is 7, also achieved by pair (3,4).

So, in this case, maximizing OR also maximizes XOR.

Is this always the case?

Let me try to find a counterexample.

Consider n=6, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

0 and 4: OR=4, XOR=4

0 and 5: OR=5, XOR=5

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 3: OR=3, XOR=2

1 and 4: OR=5, XOR=5

1 and 5: OR=5, XOR=4

2 and 3: OR=3, XOR=1

2 and 4: OR=6, XOR=6

2 and 5: OR=7, XOR=7

3 and 4: OR=7, XOR=7

3 and 5: OR=7, XOR=6

4 and 5: OR=7, XOR=3

Here, maximum XOR is 7, achieved by pairs (2,5), (3,4).

Maximum OR is 7, achieved by pairs (2,5), (3,4), and (4,5).

So, again, maximizing OR leads to maximizing XOR.

Is this a general pattern?

Let me think about it.

In binary, if two numbers have a high OR, it means that many bits are set in at least one of the numbers.

For XOR to be high, the numbers should differ in many bits.

So, perhaps maximizing OR tends to maximize XOR as well, because if many bits are set in at least one number, and they differ in those bits, XOR will also be high.

But is this always true?

Let me try to find a case where maximum OR does not correspond to maximum XOR.

Suppose n=4, p=[0,1,2,7].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 7: OR=7, XOR=7

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 7: OR=7, XOR=6

2 and 7: OR=7, XOR=5

Here, maximum XOR is 7, achieved by (0,7).

Maximum OR is 7, achieved by (0,7), (1,7), and (2,7).

So, in this case, it still works.

Another example: n=5, p=[0,1,3,4,6].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

0 and 4: OR=4, XOR=4

0 and 6: OR=6, XOR=6

1 and 3: OR=3, XOR=2

1 and 4: OR=5, XOR=5

1 and 6: OR=7, XOR=7

3 and 4: OR=7, XOR=7

3 and 6: OR=7, XOR=5

4 and 6: OR=6, XOR=2

Here, maximum XOR is 7, achieved by (1,6) and (3,4).

Maximum OR is 7, achieved by (1,6), (3,4), and (3,6).

Again, it seems that maximizing OR leads to maximizing XOR.

Perhaps there's a general principle here that maximizing OR between two elements also tends to maximize their XOR.

If that's the case, then I can focus on finding the pair that gives the maximum OR, and that should also give the maximum XOR.

But to confirm, I need to see if there's any case where the maximum OR does not correspond to the maximum XOR.

Let me try constructing such a case.

Suppose n=4, p=[0,1,2,3].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 3: OR=3, XOR=2

2 and 3: OR=3, XOR=1

Here, maximum XOR is 3, achieved by (0,3) and (1,2).

Maximum OR is 3, achieved by all pairs except (0,1).

So, again, it aligns.

Another attempt: n=5, p=[0,1,2,3,7].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

0 and 7: OR=7, XOR=7

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 3: OR=3, XOR=2

1 and 7: OR=7, XOR=6

2 and 3: OR=3, XOR=1

2 and 7: OR=7, XOR=5

3 and 7: OR=7, XOR=4

Here, maximum XOR is 7, achieved by (0,7).

Maximum OR is 7, achieved by (0,7), (1,7), (2,7), and (3,7).

Again, it aligns.

It seems that maximizing OR also maximizes XOR.

Is there a mathematical reason for this?

Let me think about binary numbers.

Given two numbers, their OR is the bitwise OR, and their XOR is the bitwise XOR.

To maximize OR, we want as many bits as possible to be set in at least one of the numbers.

To maximize XOR, we want as many bits as possible to be set differently between the two numbers.

In many cases, maximizing OR also leads to maximizing XOR because if many bits are set in at least one number, and they differ in those bits, XOR will be high.

But is there a case where OR is maximized, but XOR is not?

Let me try n=6, p=[0,1,2,3,4,8].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

0 and 4: OR=4, XOR=4

0 and 8: OR=8, XOR=8

1 and 2: OR=3, XOR=3

1 and 3: OR=3, XOR=2

2 and 8: OR=10, XOR=10

3 and 4: OR=7, XOR=7

3 and 8: OR=11, XOR=11

4 and 8: OR=12, XOR=12

Here, maximum XOR is 12, achieved by (4,8).

Maximum OR is 12, achieved by (4,8).

Again, they align.

Another attempt: n=7, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6].

Possible pairs:

0 and 1: OR=1, XOR=1

0 and 2: OR=2, XOR=2

0 and 3: OR=3, XOR=3

0 and 4: OR=4, XOR=4

0 and 5: OR=5, XOR=5

4 and 6: OR=6, XOR=2

5 and 6: OR=7, XOR=1

Here, maximum XOR is 7, achieved by (1,6), (2,5), (3,4).

Maximum OR is 7, achieved by multiple pairs including the above.

Again, aligning.

It seems that to maximize XOR, I need to maximize OR.

Is this always true?

I can't find a counterexample where maximizing OR doesn't maximize XOR.

Therefore, perhaps I can focus on finding the pair that gives the maximum OR, and that will also give the maximum XOR.

If that's the case, then I need to find a way to identify the pair with the maximum OR using at most 3n queries.

But I still need to verify if this strategy is correct.

Let me consider that for any two numbers, if their OR is maximum, then their XOR is also maximum.

From the examples above, this seems to hold.

But to be thorough, I should try to prove this or find a counterexample.

Suppose we have two numbers x and y.

Let’s denote their OR as x | y and their XOR as x ^ y.

We need to see if maximizing x | y also maximizes x ^ y.

Consider that x | y sets a bit if it is set in either x or y.

x ^ y sets a bit if it is set in one but not both.

To maximize x ^ y, we want as many bits as possible to be different between x and y.

At the same time, to maximize x | y, we want as many bits as possible to be set in at least one of x or y.

In general, maximizing x | y tends to include more set bits, which also increases the likelihood that those bits differ between x and y, thus increasing x ^ y.

But is there a case where x | y is maximum, but x ^ y is not maximum?

Let me consider n=8, p=[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7].
