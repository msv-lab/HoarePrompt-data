Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's try to understand what's being asked here.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries where I compare the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR sets a bit if it's set in either number.

The goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ in as many bits as possible, preferably the highest significant bits.

Given that p is a permutation, all values from 0 to n-1 are present exactly once. So, for a given n, I know the range of possible values.

Now, about the queries: I can ask comparisons between (p_a OR p_b) and (p_c OR p_d). The result tells me which OR is larger or if they are equal.

I need to use these comparisons to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

Let me think about how OR and XOR relate. OR gives me the union of set bits, while XOR gives me the symmetric difference.

To maximize XOR, I need p_i and p_j to have as many bits differing as possible.

Maybe I can find the two largest elements in the permutation, because their XOR would be large due to differing higher bits.

Wait, but it's not necessarily true that the two largest elements will have the maximum XOR. For example, if n=3, permutation [0,1,2], then 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is the maximum possible.

But in general, the two largest elements might have some overlapping high bits, which could result in a lower XOR than expected.

Is there a better way to approach this?

Let me consider the properties of XOR. The maximum possible XOR would be when p_i and p_j differ in all bits. For numbers from 0 to n-1, the maximum XOR would be (2^m - 1), where m is the number of bits needed to represent n-1.

For example, if n=3, numbers are 0 (00), 1 (01), 2 (10). The maximum XOR is 3 (11), which is achieved by 1 XOR 2.

So, in general, the maximum XOR for numbers up to n-1 is going to be the XOR of the two numbers that differ in the most significant bits.

Maybe I can find the two numbers that differ the most in the highest significant bits.

But how do I find those using only OR comparisons?

Let me think differently. Suppose I fix one element and try to find another element that maximizes the XOR with it.

For example, fix p_0 and try to find p_j such that p_0 XOR p_j is maximized.

But I need to do this efficiently, within 3n queries.

Wait, the solution provided seems to do something similar.

Let's look at the given solution and understand what it's doing.

The function func is defined, and it loops over the number of test cases.

For each test case, it reads n, the size of the permutation.

Then it initializes k to 1.

Then there's a loop from i=2 to n-1:

It prints a query: '? 0 k 0 i' and flushes the output.

It reads the response: '<', '=', or '>'.

If the response is '<', it sets k to i.

After this loop, it sets best to 0.

Then another loop from i=1 to n-1:

It prints a query: '? k best k i' and flushes the output.

It reads the response.

If the response is '<', it sets best to i.

Finally, it prints '! k best'.

So, what's happening here?

In the first loop, it's comparing OR of p_0 and p_k with OR of p_0 and p_i.

If p_0 OR p_k < p_0 OR p_i, it sets k to i.

This seems like it's trying to find a k that maximizes p_0 OR p_k.

Wait, but it's comparing p_0 OR p_k with p_0 OR p_i.

If p_0 OR p_k < p_0 OR p_i, it sets k to i.

So, it's iteratively updating k to have the largest p_0 OR p_k.

After this loop, k is the index that maximizes p_0 OR p_k.

Then, in the second loop, it's comparing p_k OR p_best with p_k OR p_i.

If p_k OR p_best < p_k OR p_i, it sets best to i.

So, it's finding the i that maximizes p_k OR p_i.

Finally, it outputs '! k best'.

So, it's choosing the pair (k, best) where k maximizes p_0 OR p_k, and best maximizes p_k OR p_best.

Is this guaranteed to give a pair with maximum XOR?

Let me think about this.

Suppose that by choosing k to maximize p_0 OR p_k, and then choosing best to maximize p_k OR p_best, we might end up with a pair that has a large OR, but OR being large doesn't directly correlate with XOR being large.

Wait, maybe I need to recall that in the given example, it worked.

In the example, n=4, permutation [0,3,1,2].

First loop:

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 1 = 1

Since 3 > 1, no change to k=1

i=3:

'? 0 1 0 3' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 2 = 2

Since 3 > 2, no change to k=1

So, k remains 1.

Then, second loop:

i=1:

'? 1 0 1 1' -> p1 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p1 OR p1 = 3 OR 3 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

i=2:

'? 1 0 1 2' -> p1 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p1 OR p2 = 3 OR 1 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

i=3:

'? 1 0 1 3' -> p1 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p1 OR p3 = 3 OR 2 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

So, best remains 0.

But in the example, it printed '! 3 2', which seems inconsistent with the code.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the explanation or the code.

Looking back at the code:

print('! ',k,best,flush=True)

In the example, it printed '! 3 2', but according to the code, it should have printed '! 1 0', which corresponds to i=1 and j=0.

But in the example, the correct answer was i=3 and j=2.

So, perhaps the code is incorrect.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding.

In the example interaction, it shows:

Input:

2

...

<

=

>

2

Output:

? 0 2 3 1

? 1 1 2 3

? 1 2 0 3

! 3 2

! 0 1

Wait, but according to the code, it's doing something different.

Wait, perhaps the code provided is not matching the example.

In the example, the queries are:

'? 0 2 3 1' -> '<'

'? 1 1 2 3' -> '='

'? 1 2 0 3' -> '>'

And then output '! 3 2'

But according to the code, it's doing:

First loop:

i from 2 to n-1:

'? 0 1 0 i'

So for i=2: '? 0 1 0 2'

For i=3: '? 0 1 0 3'

But in the example, it's '? 0 2 3 1', which doesn't match the pattern in the code.

So perhaps the code provided is not the same as in the example.

Wait, maybe the code is different from what's in the example.

In the code:

for i in range(2, n):

print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

k = i

Then:

best = 0

for i in range(1, n):

print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)

res = input()

if res == '<':

best = i

print('!', k, best, flush=True)

But in the example, the queries are:

'? 0 2 3 1'

'? 1 1 2 3'

'? 1 2 0 3'

Which don't match the pattern in the code.

So perhaps there's a discrepancy here.

Wait, maybe the code is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the code is trying to find the maximum OR and then find the maximum XOR based on that.

But it's not clear.

Let me think of another approach.

I need to find two numbers in the permutation that have the maximum XOR.

Given that it's a permutation of 0 to n-1, I can consider all possible pairs, but that would be O(n^2), which is too slow.

I need a way to find the pair with maximum XOR using at most 3n queries.

An efficient way would be to find the two numbers that differ the most in their binary representation.

To maximize XOR, I need to maximize the number of differing bits, starting from the most significant bit.

So, perhaps I can find the two numbers with the highest leading bits set differently.

For example, if n=4, numbers are 0 (000), 1 (001), 2 (010), 3 (011), 4 (100), etc.

The maximum XOR would be between numbers like 0 and 7 (assuming n is large enough), which would be 7.

But in general, for numbers up to n-1, the maximum possible XOR is going to be (2^m -1), where m is the number of bits in n-1.

So, for n=4, m=3, maximum XOR is 7.

But how do I find such a pair using only OR comparisons?

Let me consider that OR gives me the union of set bits, while XOR gives me the differing bits.

Is there a way to use OR comparisons to infer which numbers have differing bits?

Maybe I can try to find the maximum element in the permutation, and then find the element that has the maximum XOR with it.

But, as I thought earlier, the maximum element might not necessarily pair with the smallest element to give the maximum XOR.

For example, in n=3, [0,1,2], 1 XOR 2 = 3, which is the maximum possible.

But 2 is not the smallest element.

So, perhaps I need to find the two elements that differ in the most significant bit.

Wait, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant, and try to maximize the XOR at each step.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider that for two numbers, their XOR is maximized if they differ in all bits.

But in reality, for numbers from 0 to n-1, this might not be possible, depending on the bit length.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sort the numbers based on their binary representation and pick two numbers that are as far apart as possible.

But I can't sort directly; I can only ask OR comparisons.

Wait, maybe I can use the queries to compare elements and somehow order them.

But ordering based on OR might not directly translate to ordering based on XOR.

This is tricky.

Let me consider that the OR of two numbers is at least as large as each individual number.

So, if I have p_a OR p_b, it's the bitwise OR of p_a and p_b.

Similarly, p_c OR p_d is the bitwise OR of p_c and p_d.

By comparing these, I can get some information about the relative sizes of the p's.

But how can I use this to find the maximum XOR?

Maybe I can find the maximum element in the permutation by comparing ORs.

Wait, but OR doesn't directly give the magnitude; it gives the union of set bits.

For example, 1 OR 2 = 3, which is larger than 2 OR 2 = 2, even though 2 is less than 3.

Wait, but in that case, 2 OR 2 = 2, and 1 OR 2 = 3, so 3 > 2, which tells me that 1 OR 2 is larger than 2 OR 2.

This might give me some information about the individual elements.

But I need a systematic way to find the two elements with maximum XOR.

Let me consider that to maximize XOR, I need to maximize the number of differing bits.

So, perhaps I can find the two elements that have the most bits differing, especially in the higher bits.

But how do I find that using OR comparisons?

Maybe I can fix one element and find the element that differs the most from it.

But that seems inefficient.

Wait, maybe I can find the maximum and minimum elements and see their XOR.

But again, this might not give the maximum XOR.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the two elements that have the maximum OR, and then check their XOR.

But I'm not sure if that correlates.

This is confusing.

Let me look back at the provided solution and see if I can understand its logic.

In the provided solution:

- It initializes k to 1.

- Then, for i from 2 to n-1, it compares OR of p_0 and p_k with OR of p_0 and p_i.

- If OR of p_0 and p_i is larger, it sets k to i.

- Then, it sets best to 0.

- For i from 1 to n-1, it compares OR of p_k and p_best with OR of p_k and p_i.

- If OR of p_k and p_i is larger, it sets best to i.

- Finally, it outputs '! k best'.

So, it's choosing k to maximize OR with p_0, and then choosing best to maximize OR with p_k.

Is this a correct approach to maximize XOR?

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=3, permutation [0,1,2].

First loop:

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 1 = 1

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

Since 1 < 2, set k=2

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 2 0 2 1' -> p2 OR p0 = 2 OR 0 = 2

p2 OR p1 = 2 OR 1 = 3

Since 2 < 3, set best=1

i=2:

'? 2 1 2 2' -> p2 OR p1 = 2 OR 1 = 3

p2 OR p2 = 2 OR 2 = 2

Since 3 > 2, no change to best=1

So, output '! 2 1', which corresponds to p2=2 and p1=1, XOR is 3, which is correct.

Another example, n=4, permutation [0,3,1,2].

First loop:

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 1 = 1

Since 3 > 1, no change to k=1

i=3:

'? 0 1 0 3' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 2 = 2

Since 3 > 2, no change to k=1

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 1 0 1 1' -> p1 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p1 OR p1 = 3 OR 3 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

i=2:

'? 1 0 1 2' -> p1 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p1 OR p2 = 3 OR 1 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

i=3:

'? 1 0 1 3' -> p1 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p1 OR p3 = 3 OR 2 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

So, output '! 1 0', which corresponds to p1=3 and p0=0, XOR is 3, which is correct.

Wait, but in the example interaction, it printed '! 3 2', which also gives XOR 3, but according to the code, it should have printed '! 1 0'.

Maybe there's more than one correct answer, and both are acceptable.

So, in this case, the code seems to work.

Let me consider another example.

n=5, permutation [0,1,2,3,4]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 1 = 1

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

1 < 2, set k=2

i=3:

'? 0 2 0 3' -> p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

2 < 3, set k=3

i=4:

'? 0 3 0 4' -> p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

3 < 4, set k=4

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 4 0 4 1' -> p4 OR p0 = 4 OR 0 = 4

p4 OR p1 = 4 OR 1 = 5

Since 4 < 5, set best=1

i=2:

'? 4 1 4 2' -> p4 OR p1 = 4 OR 1 = 5

p4 OR p2 = 4 OR 2 = 6

Since 5 < 6, set best=2

i=3:

'? 4 2 4 3' -> p4 OR p2 = 4 OR 2 = 6

p4 OR p3 = 4 OR 3 = 7

Since 6 < 7, set best=3

i=4:

'? 4 3 4 4' -> p4 OR p3 = 4 OR 3 = 7

p4 OR p4 = 4 OR 4 = 4

Since 7 > 4, no change to best=3

So, output '! 4 3', which corresponds to p4=4 and p3=3, XOR is 7, which is correct.

Another correct pair would be p2=2 and p3=3, XOR is 1, which is less than 7, so p4 and p3 is better.

So, in this case, the code works correctly.

Let me think about why this approach works.

By choosing k to maximize p0 OR p_k, and then choosing best to maximize p_k OR p_best, we are trying to select elements that have high OR values.

But why does this lead to a pair with maximum XOR?

Well, maximizing OR suggests that we want as many bits set to 1 as possible in the union of the two numbers.

However, maximizing XOR requires that the bits differ between the two numbers.

So, it's not immediately clear why this approach works.

Perhaps it's just coincidental in these examples.

Let me try to find a case where this approach fails.

Suppose n=6, permutation [0,1,2,3,4,5]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 1 = 1

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

1 < 2, set k=2

i=3:

'? 0 2 0 3' -> p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

2 < 3, set k=3

i=4:

'? 0 3 0 4' -> p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

3 < 4, set k=4

i=5:

'? 0 4 0 5' -> p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

p0 OR p5 = 0 OR 5 = 5

4 < 5, set k=5

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 5 0 5 1' -> p5 OR p0 = 5 OR 0 = 5

p5 OR p1 = 5 OR 1 = 5

Equal, no change to best=0

i=2:

'? 5 0 5 2' -> p5 OR p0 = 5 OR 0 = 5

p5 OR p2 = 5 OR 2 = 7

Since 5 < 7, set best=2

i=3:

'? 5 2 5 3' -> p5 OR p2 = 5 OR 2 = 7

p5 OR p3 = 5 OR 3 = 7

Equal, no change to best=2

i=4:

'? 5 2 5 4' -> p5 OR p2 = 7

p5 OR p4 = 5 OR 4 = 5

Since 7 > 5, no change to best=2

i=5:

'? 5 2 5 5' -> p5 OR p2 = 7

p5 OR p5 = 5

Since 7 > 5, no change to best=2

So, output '! 5 2', which corresponds to p5=5 and p2=2, XOR is 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is the maximum possible.

Another correct pair would be p4=4 and p5=5, XOR is 1, which is less than 7.

So, again, the code works.

Let me try another permutation.

n=6, permutation [0,2,4,1,3,5]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 2 = 2

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 4 = 4

2 < 4, set k=2

i=3:

'? 0 2 0 3' -> p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 4 = 4

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 1 = 1

4 > 1, no change to k=2

i=4:

'? 0 2 0 4' -> p0 OR p2 = 4

p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 3 = 3

4 > 3, no change to k=2

i=5:

'? 0 2 0 5' -> p0 OR p2 = 4

p0 OR p5 = 0 OR 5 = 5

4 < 5, set k=5

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 5 0 5 1' -> p5 OR p0 = 5 OR 0 = 5

p5 OR p1 = 5 OR 2 = 7

Since 5 < 7, set best=1

i=2:

'? 5 1 5 2' -> p5 OR p1 = 7

p5 OR p2 = 5 OR 4 = 5 OR 4 = 5 | 4 = 5 (since 5 is 101 and 4 is 100, OR is 101 which is 5)

Since 7 > 5, no change to best=1

i=3:

'? 5 1 5 3' -> p5 OR p1 = 7

p5 OR p3 = 5 OR 3 = 7

Equal, no change to best=1

i=4:

'? 5 1 5 4' -> p5 OR p1 = 7

p5 OR p4 = 5 OR 3 = 7

Equal, no change to best=1

i=5:

'? 5 1 5 5' -> p5 OR p1 = 7

p5 OR p5 = 5

Since 7 > 5, no change to best=1

So, output '! 5 1', which corresponds to p5=5 and p1=2, XOR is 5 XOR 2 = 7, which is maximum.

Again, correct.

Let me try to think of a case where this might fail.

Suppose n=7, permutation [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 1 = 1

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

1 < 2, set k=2

i=3:

'? 0 2 0 3' -> p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

2 < 3, set k=3

i=4:

'? 0 3 0 4' -> p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

3 < 4, set k=4

i=5:

'? 0 4 0 5' -> p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

p0 OR p5 = 0 OR 5 = 5

4 < 5, set k=5

i=6:

'? 0 5 0 6' -> p0 OR p5 = 5

p0 OR p6 = 0 OR 6 = 6

5 < 6, set k=6

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 6 0 6 1' -> p6 OR p0 = 6 OR 0 = 6

p6 OR p1 = 6 OR 1 = 7

Since 6 < 7, set best=1

i=2:

'? 6 1 6 2' -> p6 OR p1 = 7

p6 OR p2 = 6 OR 2 = 6

Since 7 > 6, no change to best=1

i=3:

'? 6 1 6 3' -> p6 OR p1 = 7

p6 OR p3 = 6 OR 3 = 7

Equal, no change to best=1

i=4:

'? 6 1 6 4' -> p6 OR p1 = 7

p6 OR p4 = 6 OR 4 = 6

Since 7 > 6, no change to best=1

i=5:

'? 6 1 6 5' -> p6 OR p1 = 7

p6 OR p5 = 6 OR 5 = 7

Equal, no change to best=1

i=6:

'? 6 1 6 6' -> p6 OR p1 = 7

p6 OR p6 = 6

Since 7 > 6, no change to best=1

So, output '! 6 1', which corresponds to p6=6 and p1=1, XOR is 6 XOR 1 = 7, which is maximum.

Another correct pair is p5=5 and p6=6, XOR is 3, which is less than 7.

So, again, correct.

Let me try n=8, permutation [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 1 = 1

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

1 < 2, set k=2

i=3:

'? 0 2 0 3' -> p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 2 = 2

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

2 < 3, set k=3

i=4:

'? 0 3 0 4' -> p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 3 = 3

p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

3 < 4, set k=4

i=5:

'? 0 4 0 5' -> p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 4 = 4

p0 OR p5 = 0 OR 5 = 5

4 < 5, set k=5

i=6:

'? 0 5 0 6' -> p0 OR p5 = 5

p0 OR p6 = 0 OR 6 = 6

5 < 6, set k=6

i=7:

'? 0 6 0 7' -> p0 OR p6 = 6

p0 OR p7 = 0 OR 7 = 7

6 < 7, set k=7

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 7 0 7 1' -> p7 OR p0 = 7 OR 0 = 7

p7 OR p1 = 7 OR 1 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

i=2:

'? 7 0 7 2' -> p7 OR p0 = 7

p7 OR p2 = 7 OR 2 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

i=3:

'? 7 0 7 3' -> p7 OR p0 = 7

p7 OR p3 = 7 OR 3 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

i=4:

'? 7 0 7 4' -> p7 OR p0 = 7

p7 OR p4 = 7 OR 4 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

i=5:

'? 7 0 7 5' -> p7 OR p0 = 7

p7 OR p5 = 7 OR 5 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

i=6:

'? 7 0 7 6' -> p7 OR p0 = 7

p7 OR p6 = 7 OR 6 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

i=7:

'? 7 0 7 7' -> p7 OR p0 = 7

p7 OR p7 = 7

Equal, no change to best=0

So, output '! 7 0', which corresponds to p7=7 and p0=0, XOR is 7 XOR 0 = 7, which is maximum.

Another correct pair is p6=6 and p7=7, XOR is 1, which is less than 7.

So, again, correct.

Hmm, it seems consistent.

Let me consider a different permutation where the maximum XOR might not be between the maximum element and zero.

Suppose n=5, permutation [0,4,1,2,3]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 4 = 4

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 1 = 1

4 > 1, no change to k=1

i=3:

'? 0 1 0 3' -> p0 OR p1 = 4

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 2 = 2

4 > 2, no change to k=1

i=4:

'? 0 1 0 4' -> p0 OR p1 = 4

p0 OR p4 = 0 OR 3 = 3

4 > 3, no change to k=1

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 1 0 1 1' -> p1 OR p0 = 4 OR 0 = 4

p1 OR p1 = 4 OR 4 = 4

Equal, no change to best=0

i=2:

'? 1 0 1 2' -> p1 OR p0 = 4

p1 OR p2 = 4 OR 1 = 5

Since 4 < 5, set best=2

i=3:

'? 1 2 1 3' -> p1 OR p2 = 5

p1 OR p3 = 4 OR 2 = 6

Since 5 < 6, set best=3

i=4:

'? 1 3 1 4' -> p1 OR p3 = 6

p1 OR p4 = 4 OR 3 = 7

Since 6 < 7, set best=4

So, output '! 1 4', which corresponds to p1=4 and p4=3, XOR is 4 XOR 3 = 7, which is maximum.

Another correct pair is p3=2 and p4=3, XOR is 1, which is less than 7.

So, again, correct.

Let me try to think of a case where this approach might fail.

Suppose n=4, permutation [0,1,3,2]

First loop:

k=1

i=2:

'? 0 1 0 2' -> p0 OR p1 = 0 OR 1 = 1

p0 OR p2 = 0 OR 3 = 3

1 < 3, set k=2

i=3:

'? 0 2 0 3' -> p0 OR p2 = 3

p0 OR p3 = 0 OR 2 = 2

3 > 2, no change to k=2

Then, best=0

Second loop:

i=1:

'? 2 0 2 1' -> p2 OR p0 = 3 OR 0 = 3

p2 OR p1 = 3 OR 1 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

i=2:

'? 2 0 2 2' -> p2 OR p0 = 3

p2 OR p2 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

i=3:

'? 2 0 2 3' -> p2 OR p0 = 3

p2 OR p3 = 3 OR 2 = 3

Equal, no change to best=0

So, output '! 2 0', which corresponds to p2=3 and p0=0, XOR is 3 XOR 0 = 3, which is correct.

Another correct pair is p1=1 and p2=3, XOR is 2, which is less than 3.

So, again, correct.

Wait, but according to the earlier example, in n=4, [0,3,1,2], it output '! 1 0', which is correct.

I can't find a case where this approach fails.

Maybe it's correct.

But I still don't understand why this approach works.

Let me try to reason about it.

In the first loop, we're selecting k to maximize p0 OR p_k.

By choosing k that maximizes p0 OR p_k, we're selecting a p_k that has bits set that p0 doesn't have.

Then, in the second loop, we're selecting best to maximize p_k OR p_best.

This seems like we're trying to find p_best that adds more bits to p_k.

But how does this lead to maximizing XOR?

Wait, maybe it's ensuring that p_k and p_best have different bits set.

For example, if p_k has some bits set that p0 doesn't have, and then p_best has different bits set, their XOR would be large.

But this is still vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose that p0 is the smallest element, which it often is, being 0.

Then, maximizing p0 OR p_k is equivalent to selecting the largest p_k, since p0 is 0.

In that case, p0 OR p_k is just p_k.

Then, in the second loop, maximizing p_k OR p_best is selecting the largest possible p_best.

But in some cases, p_k and p_best being the two largest elements might give a large XOR, but as I thought earlier, it's not guaranteed.

For example, in n=4, [0,3,1,2], p_k=3 and p_best=2, XOR is 1, but p_k=3 and p_best=1 have XOR 2, which is larger.

But in that case, the code chooses p_k=3 and p_best=2, which gives XOR 1, but another pair gives a larger XOR.

Wait, but in the earlier example, it chose p_k=1 and p_best=0, which gives XOR 3, which is correct.

Wait, in n=4, [0,3,1,2], p1=3 and p0=0, XOR is 3, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps in this case, it's correct.

Wait, but in the earlier manual simulation, it chose p_k=1 (p1=3) and p_best=0 (p0=0), giving XOR 3, which is correct.

In another simulation, it chose p_k=2 (p2=3) and p_best=0 (p0=0), giving XOR 3, which is correct.

Wait, but in n=4, [0,3,1,2], when k=1, p1=3, and p0=0, XOR is 3.

Another pair is p2=1 and p3=2, XOR is 3, which is the same.

So, in this case, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps in this specific permutation, multiple pairs give the same maximum XOR.

So, maybe the approach is correct in general.

But I still don't have a clear understanding of why it works.

Let me consider that by maximizing p0 OR p_k, we're selecting a p_k that is as large as possible, and then maximizing p_k OR p_best, we're selecting a p_best that adds as many bits as possible to p_k.

This might lead to p_k and p_best having different bits set, which could maximize XOR.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that for two numbers, their XOR is maximized when their differing bits are maximized.

By choosing p_k to maximize p0 OR p_k, we're selecting a p_k that has many bits set that p0 doesn't have.

Then, choosing p_best to maximize p_k OR p_best, we're selecting a p_best that has bits set that p_k doesn't have.

This should lead to p_k and p_best having different bits set, which should maximize their XOR.

Wait, this seems plausible.

So, by selecting p_k to maximize p0 OR p_k, we're ensuring that p_k has many high bits set that p0 doesn't have.

Then, selecting p_best to maximize p_k OR p_best ensures that p_best has bits set that p_k doesn't have, thus maximizing the number of differing bits between p_k and p_best, which should maximize their XOR.

This seems like a reasonable strategy.

Moreover, in all the examples I tried, it gave the correct answer.

Therefore, I conclude that the provided solution is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{The provided solution is correct.}} \]
