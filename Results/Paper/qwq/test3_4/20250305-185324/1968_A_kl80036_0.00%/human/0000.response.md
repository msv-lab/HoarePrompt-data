Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an integer x, and I need to find another integer y, where y is less than x, and the sum of y and the greatest common divisor of x and y (that's gcd(x,y)) is as large as possible. And I can choose any y that gives this maximum value.

First, I need to understand what gcd(x,y) is. GCD is the largest number that divides both x and y without leaving a remainder. For example, gcd(6,4) is 2 because 2 is the biggest number that goes into both 6 and 4.

So, the expression I'm trying to maximize is gcd(x,y) + y. I need to pick y, where y is less than x, to make this sum as big as possible.

Let me think about how gcd(x,y) relates to x and y. If y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x,y) is y itself because y divides x perfectly. But y has to be less than x, so y can't be equal to x.

Wait, but if y is a divisor of x, then gcd(x,y) is y, so the sum would be y + y = 2y. But y is less than x, so 2y is less than 2x.

But if y is not a divisor of x, then gcd(x,y) is some number less than y.

So, if y is a divisor of x, the sum is 2y, and if y is not a divisor, the sum is y plus something less than y, so less than 2y.

Therefore, to maximize gcd(x,y) + y, it's probably best to choose y that is a divisor of x, because then the sum is 2y, which is higher than y plus any number less than y.

But I need to choose y that is less than x, and among all such y, pick the one that maximizes 2y.

So, the largest y that is less than x and divides x would be x/2, but only if x is even.

Wait, no. For example, if x is 10, the divisors less than 10 are 1, 2, 5. So, y could be 1, 2, or 5. The corresponding sums would be:

- y=1: gcd(10,1)=1, so 1 + 1 = 2

- y=2: gcd(10,2)=2, so 2 + 2 = 4

- y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, so 5 + 5 = 10

So, in this case, y=5 gives the highest sum of 10.

Similarly, for x=7, which is prime, the divisors less than 7 are 1. So, y=1: gcd(7,1)=1, sum=2.

Since there are no other divisors, y=1 is the only option.

For x=21, divisors less than 21 are 1,3,7. So, y=7: gcd(21,7)=7, sum=14.

Wait, but according to the example output, for x=21, y=18 is chosen. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let's check the example output:

Input:

7

10

7

21

100

2

1000

6

Output:

5

6

18

98

1

750

3

So, for x=10, y=5 is chosen, which makes sense because 5 is a divisor of 10, and gcd(10,5)=5, so 5+5=10.

For x=7, y=6 is chosen. But 6 is not a divisor of 7, since 7 is prime. So, gcd(7,6)=1, so sum is 7.

Wait, but earlier I thought that y should be a divisor of x to maximize the sum, but in this case, y=6 gives sum=7, which is higher than y=1's sum=2.

Wait, but 7 is equal to x, but the problem states y < x. Wait, y has to be less than x.

Wait, but in the example, for x=7, y=6 is chosen, and gcd(7,6)=1, so sum is 7.

But if y=1, sum is 2, which is less than 7.

So, choosing y=6 gives a higher sum than choosing y=1.

But y=6 is not a divisor of 7.

So, maybe my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider not just the divisors, but all possible y less than x.

Let me think differently.

Let me consider that gcd(x,y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.

If y is less than x, then gcd(x,y) divides both x and y.

Now, to maximize gcd(x,y) + y, perhaps I should choose y such that gcd(x,y) is as large as possible, and y is as large as possible.

But gcd(x,y) can be at most y, since gcd(x,y) divides y.

So, to maximize gcd(x,y) + y, perhaps choosing y as large as possible is key.

But in the case where x is prime, like x=7, the divisors are only 1 and 7. But y has to be less than x, so y=1.

But in the example, y=6 is chosen, which gives sum=7, which is higher than choosing y=1's sum=2.

Similarly, for x=10, y=5 gives sum=10, which is higher than y=2's sum=4 or y=1's sum=2.

For x=7, y=6 gives sum=7, which is higher than y=1's sum=2.

For x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, so sum=21, which is higher than y=7's sum=14.

Wait, but y=18 is chosen, which gives sum=21, which is higher than y=7's sum=14.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, sum=100.

But y=98 gives sum=100, while y=50 would give gcd(100,50)=50, sum=100.

Wait, but y=50 also gives sum=100.

So, both y=50 and y=98 give the same sum.

But according to the example, y=98 is chosen.

So, perhaps there are multiple y that give the same maximum sum.

The problem says: "if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are allowed to find any."

So, for x=100, both y=50 and y=98 give sum=100.

Similarly, for x=21, y=18 gives sum=21, and y=7 gives sum=14.

So, y=18 is better.

Wait, but y=18 is not a divisor of 21.

Wait, gcd(21,18)=3, so sum=21.

But y=7 is a divisor, sum=14.

So, y=18 is better.

Wait, but 3 is a divisor of both 21 and 18.

So, gcd is 3.

So, sum is 18 + 3 = 21.

Similarly, y=3: gcd(21,3)=3, sum=6.

Which is less than 21.

So, y=18 is better.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, sum=100.

y=50: gcd(100,50)=50, sum=100.

y=25: gcd(100,25)=25, sum=50.

So, y=50 and y=98 both give sum=100.

But y=98 is chosen in the example.

So, multiple y can achieve the maximum sum.

Now, I need to find a way to compute y that maximizes gcd(x,y) + y.

Looking at the example outputs:

x=10: y=5

x=7: y=6

x=21: y=18

x=100: y=98

x=2: y=1

x=1000: y=750

x=6: y=3

I need to find a pattern or a formula to compute y based on x.

Looking at x=10, y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, sum=10.

x=7, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, sum=7.

x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, sum=21.

x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, sum=100.

x=2, y=1: gcd(2,1)=1, sum=2.

x=1000, y=750: gcd(1000,750)=250, sum=1000.

x=6, y=3: gcd(6,3)=3, sum=6.

So, in all these cases, y is chosen such that gcd(x,y) + y equals x.

Wait, for x=10, 5 + 5 =10.

x=7, 6 +1=7.

x=21,18 +3=21.

x=100,98 +2=100.

x=2,1 +1=2.

x=1000,750 +250=1000.

x=6,3 +3=6.

So, in all these cases, y + gcd(x,y) equals x.

Is this always the case?

Is there a y less than x such that y + gcd(x,y) = x?

Wait, in all the example cases, y + gcd(x,y) = x.

Is this always possible?

Wait, for x=4:

Possible y:

y=1: gcd(4,1)=1, sum=2.

y=2: gcd(4,2)=2, sum=4.

y=3: gcd(4,3)=1, sum=4.

So, y=2 and y=3 both give sum=4, which equals x.

So, for x=4, y=2 or y=3 are both acceptable.

Similarly, for x=9:

y=1: gcd(9,1)=1, sum=2.

y=3: gcd(9,3)=3, sum=6.

y=6: gcd(9,6)=3, sum=9.

So, y=6 gives sum=9, which equals x.

Wait, again, y + gcd(x,y) = x.

So, perhaps in general, choosing y such that y + gcd(x,y) = x.

Is this always possible?

Is there always a y < x such that y + gcd(x,y) = x?

Let me think.

Suppose I set y = x - d, where d = gcd(x,y).

So, y = x - d.

But d must divide both x and y.

Since y = x - d, and d divides x and d, then d divides y.

Wait, d divides x and d divides d, so d divides y = x - d.

So, d divides y.

But d is gcd(x,y), so d is the greatest divisor of both x and y.

But since d divides y, and y = x - d, then d divides x.

So, this seems consistent.

So, if I set y = x - d, where d is a common divisor of x and y.

But d is gcd(x,y), so d divides both x and y.

So, perhaps I can set y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

Then, gcd(x,y) = gcd(x, x - d) = gcd(x,d) = d.

Because gcd(x, x - d) = gcd(x,d).

So, y = x - d, and gcd(x,y) = d.

Then, y + gcd(x,y) = (x - d) + d = x.

So, y + gcd(x,y) = x.

Therefore, for any divisor d of x, setting y = x - d will give y + gcd(x,y) = x.

And since y < x, because d >=1, y = x - d < x.

So, in this way, I can always choose y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

And in the example, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen.

Let's see: x=1000, y=750.

Then, gcd(1000,750)=250.

So, y + gcd(x,y) = 750 + 250 = 1000.

Which matches x.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98: gcd(100,98)=2, sum=100.

x=21, y=18: gcd(21,18)=3, sum=21.

x=7, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, sum=7.

x=10, y=5: gcd(10,5)=5, sum=10.

x=2, y=1: gcd(2,1)=1, sum=2.

x=6, y=3: gcd(6,3)=3, sum=6.

So, in all these cases, y + gcd(x,y) = x.

Therefore, to maximize y + gcd(x,y), it's sufficient to set y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x.

And since y must be less than x, d must be at least 1.

So, y can be from 1 to x-1, provided that d divides x.

But in the example, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen.

Let's see what d is: x - y = 1000 - 750 = 250.

Is 250 a divisor of 1000? Yes, because 1000 / 250 = 4.

So, d=250 divides x=1000.

Hence, y = x - d = 1000 - 250 = 750.

Similarly, for x=100, y=98: d = x - y = 100 - 98 = 2, which divides 100.

For x=21, y=18: d=3, which divides 21.

For x=7, y=6: d=1, which divides 7.

So, this seems to work.

Now, is there a specific d to choose?

The problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, which is x.

So, any y = x - d, where d is a divisor of x, will satisfy y + gcd(x,y) = x.

Therefore, I can choose any d that divides x, and set y = x - d.

But in the example, for x=1000, y=750 is chosen, which corresponds to d=250.

But I could also choose d=1, giving y=999.

Or d=2, y=998.

Or d=4, y=996.

And so on.

But in the example, y=750 is chosen.

So, it seems that any y = x - d, where d divides x, is acceptable.

Hence, in the program, as long as it chooses y = x - d for some divisor d of x, it's correct.

Now, looking at the given program:

def func():

for i in range(int(input())):

x = int(input())

y = x // 2

print(y)

So, it reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, reads x, sets y to x//2, and prints y.

Now, x//2 is the integer division of x by 2, which is floor(x/2).

So, y = floor(x/2).

Is this always a valid choice?

Let's check for some values.

For x=10, y=5, which is x//2.

gcd(10,5)=5, sum=10.

Which matches x.

So, correct.

For x=7, y=3 (since 7//2=3), but in the example, y=6 is chosen.

gcd(7,3)=1, sum=4.

But in the example, y=6: gcd(7,6)=1, sum=7.

So, y=6 is better.

But the program chooses y=3, which gives sum=4, which is less than 7.

Wait, but according to the problem, any y that achieves the maximum sum is acceptable.

But in this case, y=6 achieves sum=7, which is higher than y=3's sum=4.

So, for x=7, choosing y=6 is better.

But the program chooses y=3.

Hence, for x=7, the program's choice is not the maximum possible.

Wait, but according to the problem, y has to be less than x, which it is.

So, is the program incorrect for x=7?

Wait, but the problem allows any y that achieves the maximum sum, and in this case, y=6 achieves the maximum sum of 7.

But y=3 achieves sum=4, which is less than 7.

So, is the program incorrect in this case?

Wait, but in the example, y=6 is chosen for x=7, which achieves sum=7.

But the program chooses y=3 for x=7, which achieves sum=4.

So, the program is not choosing the y that achieves the maximum sum for x=7.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example, y=6 is chosen for x=7, which is x-1.

So, perhaps choosing y = x - 1, where d=1, which divides x.

In this case, y = x -1, d=1, gcd(x,y)=1, sum=x.

Which is maximum possible.

So, choosing y = x -1 is always acceptable, as d=1 always divides x.

Hence, to make the program correct, I could set y = x -1.

But in the program, y = x//2 is chosen.

Which for even x, y = x/2, which is a divisor.

For example, x=10, y=5, which is a divisor.

For x=100, y=50, which is a divisor.

For x=21, y=10, which is not a divisor.

Wait, for x=21, y=10: gcd(21,10)=1, sum=11.

But in the example, y=18 is chosen, which gives sum=21.

Hence, y=10 is not optimal.

Hence, choosing y = x//2 is not always optimal.

Only when x is even and y = x//2 is a divisor.

But for x=10, y=5 is a divisor, and sum=10.

But for x=21, y=10 is not a divisor, and sum=11, which is less than 21.

Hence, the program is incorrect for x=21.

Similarly, for x=7, y=3 is chosen, which gives sum=4, but y=6 gives sum=7.

Hence, the program is incorrect for x=7.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

**Final Solution**

To solve this problem, we need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum of \( y \) and the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) (\( \gcd(x, y) \)) is maximized.

## Approach

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to maximize \( y + \gcd(x, y) \).
   - Since \( y < x \), the possible values for \( y \) range from 1 to \( x-1 \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize \( y + \gcd(x, y) \), we should choose \( y \) such that \( y + \gcd(x, y) \) is as large as possible.
   - One way to achieve this is to set \( y = x - d \), where \( d \) is a divisor of \( x \). This ensures that \( \gcd(x, y) = d \), and thus \( y + \gcd(x, y) = x \).

3. **Optimal Choice**:
   - Choosing \( y = x - 1 \) is always valid because 1 is a divisor of any integer \( x \).
   - This choice guarantees that \( y + \gcd(x, y) = (x - 1) + 1 = x \), which is the maximum possible sum.

4. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, read the integer \( x \).
   - Set \( y = x - 1 \).
   - Print \( y \).

## Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    for i in range(1, t + 1):
        x = int(data[i])
        y = x - 1
        print(y)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Explanation

- **Input Handling**:
  - Read all input data at once for efficiency.
  - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
  - Each of the next \( t \) lines contains an integer \( x \).

- **Choosing \( y \)**:
  - For each \( x \), set \( y = x - 1 \).
  - This ensures \( y < x \) and \( y + \gcd(x, y) = x \), which is the maximum possible sum.

- **Output**:
  - Print the value of \( y \) for each test case.

This approach ensures that we always choose a \( y \) that maximizes the sum \( y + \gcd(x, y) \) by leveraging the properties of divisors and the gcd function.
