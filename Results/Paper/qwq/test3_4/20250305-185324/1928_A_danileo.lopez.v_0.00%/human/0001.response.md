Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Bob has a rectangle of size a by b, and he wants to cut it into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. Then, he tries to form a new rectangle from these two pieces, possibly rotating them.

The key point is that the new rectangle should be different from the original one, and rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same. For example, a 6x4 rectangle is the same as a 4x6 rectangle.

From the examples provided:

- For a 2x6 rectangle, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6.

- For a 2x1 rectangle, cutting it into two 1x1 rectangles can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, which is the same as the original.

So, the task is to determine, for given a and b, whether it's possible to create a new rectangle that is different from the original one after cutting and rearranging.

First, I need to understand the cutting process. Bob can make a cut parallel to one of the sides, meaning he can either cut along the length or the width.

Let's consider cutting parallel to the width (horizontal cut):

- If he cuts the a x b rectangle horizontally, he gets two rectangles of size (a/c) x b, where c is the position of the cut.

Similarly, cutting parallel to the length (vertical cut):

- He gets two rectangles of size a x (b/d), where d is the position of the cut.

Then, he can rotate these pieces and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

The problem states that two rectangles are considered the same if they can be obtained from each other by rotation. So, for example, a 2x3 rectangle is the same as a 3x2 rectangle.

The goal is to see if, after cutting and rearranging, Bob can get a rectangle that is different from the original one, considering this rotation equivalence.

Let me think about the conditions under which this is possible.

First, note that the area remains the same before and after the transformation, since we're just cutting and rearranging the pieces.

So, the area of the new rectangle should be equal to the area of the original rectangle, i.e., a * b.

Now, the new rectangle has dimensions, say, c x d, where c * d = a * b.

But, since rectangles that are rotations of each other are considered the same, we can consider c <= d without loss of generality.

Similarly, for the original rectangle, we can assume a <= b.

So, the original rectangle is a x b, with a <= b.

We need to check if there exists another rectangle c x d, with c <= d, such that:

1. c * d = a * b

2. c != a or d != b (since it should be different from the original)

Given that, the problem reduces to checking if there exists another pair (c, d) with c <= d, c * d = a * b, and (c, d) != (a, b).

But, there's an additional constraint: the new rectangle must be formed by arranging two smaller rectangles obtained by cutting the original rectangle either horizontally or vertically.

So, I need to ensure that these two smaller rectangles can be arranged to form the new rectangle.

Let's think about the possible ways to cut the original rectangle.

Case 1: Horizontal cut

- Suppose we cut the rectangle horizontally at position k (0 < k < a), resulting in two rectangles of size k x b and (a - k) x b.

Then, we can rotate these pieces any way we like and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, for a vertical cut at position m (0 < m < b), we get two rectangles of size a x m and a x (b - m).

I need to consider both types of cuts.

Now, the question is, for each possible cut, can I arrange the two resulting pieces into a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

But checking all possible cuts is not feasible, as a and b can be up to 10^9.

I need a smarter way to determine if such a transformation is possible.

Let me consider the total area, which is a * b.

If I cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles, their areas add up to a * b.

Then, rearranging them to form a new rectangle with area a * b.

But since the new rectangle must be different from the original one, it must have dimensions different from a and b, considering the rotation equivalence.

Wait, but in the example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and then arranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

Similarly, a 3x2 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, and arranged to form a 1x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x1, but since it's different from the original 3x2, it's considered a different rectangle.

Wait, but 1x6 and 6x1 are considered the same.

So, in this case, from 3x2, we can form 1x6, which is different from 3x2.

Similarly, from 2x2, we can cut into two 1x2 rectangles and arrange them to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from 2x2.

From 2x1, cutting into two 1x1 rectangles can only form a 1x2 rectangle, which is the same as the original 2x1.

So, in this case, it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

From 1x1, no cutting is possible, so it's not possible.

From 6x3, cutting into two 3x3 rectangles, which can be arranged to form a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as the original 6x3.

Alternatively, cutting into two 6x1.5 rectangles, but since dimensions must be integers, this is not allowed.

Wait, the problem states that the cut must be parallel to one of the sides and result in integer side lengths.

So, only integer cuts are allowed.

Hence, for 6x3, possible cuts are:

- Horizontal cuts: k x 3 and (6 - k) x 3, where k is from 1 to 5.

- Vertical cuts: 6 x m and 6 x (3 - m), where m is from 1 to 2.

Then, arranging these pieces to form a new rectangle.

From horizontal cuts:

- For k=1: 1x3 and 5x3.

- These can be arranged side by side to form a (1+5)x3 = 6x3, which is the same as the original.

- Or, stack them vertically to form a 1x(3+3) = 1x6, which is the same as 6x1, which is the same as the original.

- So, no new rectangle is formed.

- For k=2: 2x3 and 4x3.

- Arranged side by side: (2+4)x3 = 6x3, same as original.

- Stacked vertically: 2x(3+3) = 2x6, which is different from 6x3.

Wait, is 2x6 considered different from 6x3?

Wait, no, because 2x6 is the same as 6x2, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the problem, rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

So, 6x2 is the same as 2x6, but is this different from 6x3?

Yes, because 6x2 is not the same as 6x3.

Hence, in this case, from 6x3, by cutting into 2x3 and 4x3, and arranging them to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 6x3, so it's possible.

But in the input, for 6x3, the output is "No", which contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Looking back at the sample input and output:

Input:

7

1 1

2 1

2 6

3 2

2 2

2 4

6 3

Output:

No

No

Yes

Yes

Yes

Yes

No

So, for 6x3, it's "No", meaning it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it seems possible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Let's think again.

From a 6x3 rectangle:

Possible cuts:

- Horizontal cuts:

- k=1: 1x3 and 5x3.

- Arranged side by side: 6x3, same as original.

- Stacked vertically: 1x6, same as original.

- k=2: 2x3 and 4x3.

- Side by side: 6x3, same as original.

- Stacked vertically: 2x6, which is different from 6x3.

But according to the sample output, it's "No", meaning it's not considered a different rectangle.

Wait, but earlier in the problem statement, it's mentioned that for 2x6, it's possible to form a 4x3, which is different.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the new rectangle must not only be different in dimensions but also not equivalent by rotation.

Wait, no, the problem says that if two rectangles differ only by a 90-degree rotation, they are considered the same.

So, for 6x3 and 3x6, they are considered the same.

Similarly, 2x6 and 6x2 are considered the same.

But 2x6 is different from 6x3 because 6x3 is the same as 3x6, which is different from 2x6.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, according to the problem, rectangles that differ only by a 90-degree rotation are considered the same.

So, 6x3 and 3x6 are considered the same.

Similarly, 2x6 and 6x2 are considered the same.

But 6x3 is different from 2x6 because 6x3 is not the same as 2x6.

Wait, but in the sample input, for 6x3, the output is "No", meaning it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

But according to my earlier thought, by cutting into 2x3 and 4x3 and arranging them to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from 6x3, it should be "Yes".

But the sample output says "No".

So, perhaps my understanding is incorrect.

Maybe there's an additional constraint that I'm missing.

Looking back at the problem statement:

"Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are considered the same."

So, in the case of 6x3 and 2x6:

- 6x3 is the same as 3x6.

- 2x6 is the same as 6x2.

Since 6x3 is different from 2x6, they are considered different rectangles.

However, according to the sample input, for 6x3, the answer is "No", meaning it's not possible to form a different rectangle.

But according to my earlier thought, it should be possible.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the new rectangle must not only be different but also not equivalent to the original in any way.

Wait, no, the problem is to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle, meaning different from the original, considering the rotation equivalence.

Given that, in the case of 6x3, it seems possible to form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from 6x3.

But the sample output is "No", so perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe there's a constraint that the new rectangle must have different dimensions in some other way.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement of the two pieces doesn't actually allow forming a different rectangle in this case.

Let me think differently.

Maybe the condition is simply that at least one of the dimensions is even.

Looking at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: No

- 2x1: No

- 2x6: Yes

- 3x2: Yes

- 2x2: Yes

- 2x4: Yes

- 6x3: No

Looking for a pattern:

- For a and b both odd: No

- For a or b even: Yes

Except for 2x1: a=2 (even), b=1 (odd), output No

Wait, that's inconsistent with the pattern.

Wait, in the code provided, it checks if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0, then print "Yes", else "No".

But in the sample input, for 2x1, which should be "Yes" according to the code, but the sample output is "No".

Wait, no, in the sample input, for 2x1, the output is "No", but according to the code, it would print "Yes" because a=2 is even.

But in the sample, it's "No", which contradicts the code.

So, perhaps the condition is not just a or b even.

Wait, perhaps it's that both a and b need to be even.

But in the sample, for 2x2, which is both even, output is "Yes".

For 3x2, which is a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes".

For 2x1, a=2 even, b=1 odd, output is "No".

Wait, so it's not just that both are even.

Wait, perhaps it's that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

But in the sample, 2x2: GCD=2, output "Yes"

3x2: GCD=1, output "Yes"

2x1: GCD=1, output "No"

Wait, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's possible when a or b is even, except for the case when one of them is 1 and the other is even.

So, a or b is even, and neither a nor b is 1.

But in the sample, for 2x2: a=2, b=2, both even, output "Yes"

3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, output "Yes"

2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd, output "No"

1x1: both odd, output "No"

2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even, output "Yes"

6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, output "No"

Wait, this is inconsistent.

Wait, in 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, output "No"

But according to the earlier pattern, a or b even should be "Yes", but it's "No"

So, perhaps it's a and b are both even, or a and b are both odd and greater than 1.

Wait, but 1x1 is "No"

2x1 is "No"

3x2 is "Yes"

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Let me consider the mathematical condition for being able to form a different rectangle.

Suppose we have a rectangle of size a x b.

After cutting into two smaller rectangles, we have two rectangles with integer dimensions.

Then, we can arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle.

The total area is a * b.

The new rectangle must have dimensions c x d, where c * d = a * b, and c <= d.

Moreover, (c, d) should not be equal to (a, b) considering rotation, i.e., (c, d) != (a, b) and (c, d) != (b, a).

Now, the question is under what conditions such a c and d exist.

But, there's an additional constraint: the two smaller rectangles must be able to form the new rectangle c x d.

Let's consider that.

Suppose we have two rectangles with areas s1 and s2, where s1 + s2 = a * b.

But in our case, s1 and s2 are not arbitrary; they are obtained by cutting the original rectangle either horizontally or vertically.

So, for a horizontal cut at position k (0 < k < a), we have two rectangles: k x b and (a - k) x b.

Similarly, for a vertical cut at position m (0 < m < b), we have two rectangles: a x m and a x (b - m).

Now, we need to arrange these two rectangles to form a new rectangle c x d, where c * d = a * b, and (c, d) != (a, b) considering rotation.

Moreover, since we can rotate the pieces, each piece can be oriented in two ways: original orientation or rotated by 90 degrees.

So, for each cut type, we need to consider the possible arrangements.

Let's consider horizontal cuts first.

After a horizontal cut at position k, we have two rectangles: k x b and (a - k) x b.

We can rotate these pieces, so each can be either k x b or b x k, and similarly for (a - k) x b.

Then, we need to arrange these two pieces to form a new rectangle of area a * b.

The possible ways to arrange two rectangles are:

1. Place them side by side horizontally.

2. Place them side by side vertically.

3. Other arrangements, but considering that we can rotate them, these are the main possibilities.

Let's consider placing them side by side horizontally.

Then, the total width would be the sum of their widths, and the height would be the maximum of their heights.

But, since we can rotate them, we need to consider different orientations.

This seems complicated.

Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Let me consider the aspect ratio.

If a and b are both even, then it might be easier to form a different rectangle.

But, in the sample input, for 6x3, which is a=6 even, b=3 odd, the output is "No".

So, that suggests that just having one even dimension is not sufficient.

Wait, but in 2x6, which is a=2 even, b=6 even, output is "Yes"

In 3x2, which is a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

In 2x1, which is a=2 even, b=1 odd, output is "No"

In 6x3, which is a=6 even, b=3 odd, output is "No"

So, perhaps the condition is that a and b are both even, or one of them is even and greater than 2.

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 even and b=1 odd, output is "No"

In 2x2, a=2 even, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

In 2x4, a=2 even, b=4 even, output is "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, output is "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, output is "No"

So, perhaps the condition is that a and b are both even, or a and b are both odd and greater than 1.

Wait, but 1x1 is "No", which fits, since both are odd and a=1.

Similarly, 2x1 is "No", which has a=2 even and b=1 odd.

Wait, but 3x2 is "Yes", which has a=3 odd and b=2 even.

So, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, and neither a nor b is 1.

Looking at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: No (both odd, a=1)

- 2x1: No (a even, b=1)

- 2x6: Yes (a even, b even)

- 3x2: Yes (a odd, b even)

- 2x2: Yes (both even)

- 2x4: Yes (both even)

- 6x3: No (a even, b odd)

Wait, but 3x2 is "Yes", which has a odd and b even.

So, perhaps the condition is that at least one of a or b is even, except when a=1 and b even, or a even and b=1.

In other words, if a >=2 and a even, or b >=2 and b even, then "Yes", else "No".

Looking at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: No (a=1, b=1)

- 2x1: No (a=2 even, b=1)

- 2x6: Yes (a=2 even, b=6 even)

- 3x2: Yes (a=3 odd, b=2 even)

- 2x2: Yes (both even)

- 2x4: Yes (both even)

- 6x3: No (a=6 even, b=3 odd)

Wait, but according to this condition, for a=6 even and b=3 odd, it should be "Yes", but the sample output is "No".

So, my condition is incorrect.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps the condition is that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b is greater than 1.

But in the sample:

- 2x6: GCD=2, output "Yes"

- 3x2: GCD=1, output "Yes"

- 2x1: GCD=1, output "No"

- 6x3: GCD=3, output "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's related to whether a and b share a common factor greater than 1.

But in 3x2, GCD=1, output "Yes"

In 6x3, GCD=3, output "No"

So, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both divisible by 2, but not both odd.

But in 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, output "Yes"

In 2x1, a=2 even, b=1 odd, output "No"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, output "No"

So, perhaps if a is even and b is odd, then "No" unless a >=4.

But in 2x2, a=2 even, b=2 even, output "Yes"

In 2x4, a=2 even, b=4 even, output "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, output "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, output "No"

Wait, perhaps it's "Yes" when a is even and b >= a, or b is even and a >= b.

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 even, b=1 odd, and b < a, output "No"

In 2x6, a=2 even, b=6 even, and b > a, output "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, and b < a, output "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, and b < a, output "No"

So, perhaps when a is even and b >= a, then "Yes", else "No".

Wait, but in 2x1, a=2 even, b=1 odd, and b < a, output "No"

In 2x6, a=2 even, b=6 even, b > a, output "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 odd, b=2 even, b < a, output "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, b < a, output "No"

So, this condition doesn't hold.

I'm getting more confused.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the aspect ratio must change in a way that the new dimensions are different from the original ones, considering the rotation equivalence.

But I need a mathematical condition to determine this.

Wait, perhaps it's about the number of ways to factorize a * b.

Given a * b, the number of possible rectangles is the number of pairs (c, d) such that c <= d and c * d = a * b.

Then, excluding the original pair (a, b), if there exists at least one other pair, then "Yes".

But, considering that rectangles differing only by rotation are the same, so (c, d) is considered the same as (d, c).

But, in the problem, we need to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

So, if there exists a pair (c, d) != (a, b) and (c, d) != (b, a), then "Yes".

But, the problem is that we need to ensure that such a pair can actually be formed by arranging the two pieces obtained from cutting the original rectangle.

This is the tricky part.

Perhaps the key is to see if a or b is even, and that allows splitting into two parts that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

But, as seen in the sample inputs, this is not always sufficient.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and greater than 1.

But, in the sample, for 2x1, it's "No", even though a=2 is divisible by 2.

Similarly, for 6x3, which is a=6 even, b=3 odd, output is "No"

So, perhaps it's about whether both a and b are even, or one of them is even and greater than 2.

Wait, in 2x1, a=2 even and greater than 2? Wait, 2 is greater than 1, but output is "No"

Wait, maybe it's about whether both a and b are greater than 1 and at least one of them is even.

But in 2x1, a=2 >1, b=1 <=1, output "No"

In 2x2, a=2 >1, b=2 >1, output "Yes"

In 3x2, a=3 >1, b=2 >1, output "Yes"

In 6x3, a=6 >1, b=3 >1, output "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a * b is divisible by 4.

In 2x1: 2*1=2, not divisible by 4, output "No"

2x6: 2*6=12, divisible by 4, output "Yes"

3x2: 3*2=6, not divisible by 4, output "Yes"

6x3: 6*3=18, not divisible by 4, output "No"

Wait, this doesn't hold either.

Wait, in 2x2: 2*2=4, divisible by 4, output "Yes"

2x4: 2*4=8, divisible by 4, output "Yes"

1x1:1*1=1, not divisible by 4, output "No"

So, perhaps if a * b is divisible by 4, then "Yes", else "No".

But in 3x2: 3*2=6, not divisible by 4, output "Yes"

6x3:6*3=18, not divisible by 4, output "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

I'm really stuck here.

Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the key is to see if the original rectangle can be tiled into smaller rectangles in more than one way.

But that seems too vague.

Alternatively, maybe it's about whether the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Let me consider that.

Suppose a and b are both even: a=2k, b=2m.

Then, cutting horizontally at position k, we get two rectangles of size k x 2m.

These can be placed side by side to form a new rectangle of size k x 4m, which is different from the original 2k x 2m, provided that k != m.

Wait, but this seems too specific.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a or b is divisible by 2, and a and b are not both odd.

But in the sample, for 3x2, which is a=3 odd, b=2 even, output "Yes"

For 6x3, a=6 even, b=3 odd, output "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's about whether a and b share a common factor other than 1.

But in 3x2, GCD=1, output "Yes"

In 6x3, GCD=3, output "No"

So, that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck.

Maybe I need to look at the mathematical properties of a and b.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both powers of the same prime.

But in 2x6, 2 is 2^1 and 6 is 2*3, which are not both powers of the same prime.

In 3x2, 3 and 2 are distinct primes.

In 6x3, 6 is 2*3 and 3 is 3, again distinct primes.

So, that doesn't seem relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both multiples of some number greater than 1.

But in 3x2, GCD=1, they are not.

In 6x3, GCD=3, they are.

But output is "Yes" for 3x2 and "No" for 6x3.

So, that doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here.

Maybe I need to consider the parity of a and b.

Looking back at the sample inputs:

- 1x1: No

- 2x1: No

- 2x6: Yes

- 3x2: Yes

- 2x2: Yes

- 2x4: Yes

- 6x3: No

Looking for a pattern in parity:

- a even and b odd: "No" (2x1, 6x3)

- a even and b even: "Yes" (2x6, 2x2, 2x4)

- a odd and b even: "Yes" (3x2)

- a odd and b odd: "No" (1x1)

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If a is even and b is even, then "Yes"

- If a is even and b is odd, then "No"

- If a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- If a is odd and b is odd, then "No"

This seems to fit the sample inputs.

- 2x6: a even, b even -> "Yes"

- 2x1: a even, b odd -> "No"

- 3x2: a odd, b even -> "Yes"

- 6x3: a even, b odd -> "No"

- 1x1: a odd, b odd -> "No"

- 2x2: a even, b even -> "Yes"

- 2x4: a even, b even -> "Yes"

So, this condition seems to hold.

Therefore, the condition is:

- If a is even and b is even, or a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

Wait, but in the sample, for 2x1: a even, b odd -> "No"

For 3x2: a odd, b even -> "Yes"

For 6x3: a even, b odd -> "No"

So, yes, that seems to be the pattern.

Hence, the condition is:

- If a is even and b is even, or a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

Wait, but in the sample, for 2x1: a even, b odd -> "No"

For 3x2: a odd, b even -> "Yes"

For 6x3: a even, b odd -> "No"

Wait, but according to this condition, a odd and b even is "Yes", which matches 3x2.

a even and b even is "Yes", matches 2x6, 2x2, 2x4.

a even and b odd is "No", matches 2x1, 6x3.

a odd and b odd is "No", matches 1x1.

So, this seems consistent with the sample inputs.

Therefore, the condition is:

- If a is even and b is even, or a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

But in the code provided, it's checking if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0, then "Yes", else "No".

Which covers:

- If a is even or b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

But according to the sample, for a even and b odd, it's "No" in some cases, like 2x1 and 6x3.

Wait, but according to the condition I derived, for a odd and b even, it's "Yes", and for a even and b even, it's "Yes", and for a even and b odd, it's "No".

Wait, but in the sample, for 2x1: a even, b odd -> "No"

For 6x3: a even, b odd -> "No"

For 3x2: a odd, b even -> "Yes"

For 2x6: a even, b even -> "Yes"

So, the condition should be:

- If a is even and b is even, or a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

But in the code, it's checking if a is even or b is even, which covers both a even and b even, and a odd and b even.

So, according to this, for 2x1: a even, b odd -> "Yes"

But in the sample, it's "No"

So, there's a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps there's an additional constraint.

Looking back, maybe it's about whether a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is greater than 1.

Wait, in 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd -> "No"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

So, perhaps when a is even and b is odd, and a >=4, then "Yes", else "No"

Wait, in 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd -> "No"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

But in 2x6: a=2 even, b=6 even -> "Yes"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even -> "Yes"

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If a is even and b is even, then "Yes"

- If a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

But according to this, for 2x1: a even, b odd -> "Yes"

But in the sample, it's "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

Wait, maybe it's about whether b is divisible by a when a is even.

Wait, that seems not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both greater than 1 and at least one of them is even.

But in 2x1: a=2>1, b=1=1 -> "No"

In 3x2: a=3>1, b=2>1 -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6>1, b=3>1 -> "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

I'm really stuck here.

Maybe I need to consider the mathematical properties of the greatest common divisor.

Let me think about the GCD of a and b.

In 2x6: GCD=2

In 3x2: GCD=1

In 2x1: GCD=1

In 6x3: GCD=3

So, it's not directly related to the GCD.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether a * b is divisible by 4.

In 2x6: 12, divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

In 3x2: 6, not divisible by 4 -> "Yes"

Wait, no, 6 is not divisible by 4, but output is "Yes"

In 6x3: 18, not divisible by 4, output "No"

In 2x1: 2, not divisible by 4, output "No"

In 2x2: 4, divisible by 4, output "Yes"

In 2x4: 8, divisible by 4, output "Yes"

So, if a * b is divisible by 4, then "Yes"

Else, if a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

Else, "No"

Wait, in 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, a*b=6 not divisible by 4, output "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, a*b=18 not divisible by 4, output "No"

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If a * b is divisible by 4, then "Yes"

- Else, if a is odd and b is even, then "Yes"

- Else, "No"

But in the sample, for 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even, a*b=6 not divisible by 4, output "Yes"

For 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd, a*b=18 not divisible by 4, output "No"

So, this condition would incorrectly say "Yes" for 6x3.

Hence, it's not correct.

I need to think differently.

Perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is a multiple of 2.

Wait, that seems the same as earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about whether a and b are both even, or one is even and the other is greater than 1.

But in 2x1: a=2 even, b=1 odd=1 -> "No"

In 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even -> "Yes"

In 6x3: a=6 even, b=3 odd -> "No"

So, perhaps if a is even and b >1, then "Yes"

Else if a is odd and b is even and b >1, then "Yes"

Else, "No"

This seems to fit:

- 2x1: a=2 even, b=1=1 -> "No"

- 2x6: a=2 even, b=6>1 -> "Yes"

- 3x2: a=3 odd, b=2 even>1 -> "Yes"

- 6x3: a=6 even, b=3=3>1 -> "No"

Wait, but according to this, for 6x3, it should be "Yes", but the sample output is "No"

So, that doesn't hold.

I'm really stuck.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach entirely.

Let me consider that in order to form a different rectangle, the cutting and rearrangement must allow for a change in dimensions that isn't just a rotation.

So, perhaps I need to see if there's a way to cut the rectangle into two parts and rearrange them to form a rectangle with different dimensions.

Let me consider the total area, which is a * b.

Suppose I cut the rectangle into two parts with areas s1 and s2, where s1 + s2 = a * b.

Then, to form a new rectangle, I need to arrange these two parts into a rectangle with dimensions c and d, where c * d = a * b.

Moreover, (c, d) != (a, b) and (c, d) != (b, a).

Now, the question is, for given a and b, does there exist such c and d where c * d = a * b, and c != a or d != b, considering rotation equivalence.

But, there's an additional constraint: the two parts must be rearranged to form this new rectangle.

This seems tricky.

Perhaps I need to consider the possible ways to cut the rectangle and see if the resulting pieces can form a different rectangle.

Let me consider horizontal cuts first.

Suppose I make a horizontal cut at position k (0 < k < a), resulting in two rectangles: k x b and (a - k) x b.

Now, I can rotate these pieces any way I like and arrange them to form a new rectangle.

Similarly, for vertical cuts.

Let me consider an example.

Take 2x6:

Original rectangle: 2x6

Possible horizontal cuts:

- k=1: 1x6 and 1x6

- k=1: arranging two 1x6 rectangles side by side gives 1x12, which is the same as 12x1, which is different from 2x6.

- Or stacking them vertically gives 2x6, which is the same as the original.

- So, from this cut, I can form a 1x12 rectangle, which is different from 2x6.

Hence, "Yes"

Similarly, for 3x2:

Original rectangle: 3x2

Possible horizontal cuts:

- k=1: 1x2 and 2x2

- Arranging them side by side: 3x2, same as original

- Stacking them vertically: 1x4, which is different from 3x2

Hence, "Yes"

For 6x3:

Original rectangle: 6x3

Possible horizontal cuts:

- k=1: 1x3 and 5x3

- Arranging side by side: 6x3, same as original

- Stacking vertically: 1x6, same as original

- k=2: 2x3 and 4x3

- Arranging side by side: 6x3, same as original

- Stacking vertically: 2x6, which is different from 6x3

But according to the sample, it's "No", so perhaps in this case, it's not considered a different rectangle.

Wait, but 2x6 is different from 6x3, as per the problem's rotation equivalence.

So, perhaps there's an additional constraint that I'm missing.

Alternatively, maybe the new rectangle must not only be different but also have different side lengths in a specific way.

Wait, perhaps it's about whether the new rectangle can be formed without rotating the pieces.

But the problem states that Bob can rotate the pieces as he wishes, so rotation is allowed.

Hence, that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, perhaps it's about the parity of the dimensions.

Looking back, in 6x3, cutting into 2x3 and 4x3, and arranging them to form a 2x6 rectangle.

But, perhaps, in this case, the new rectangle is considered the same as the original one under some condition.

Wait, no, 2x6 is different from 6x3, as per the problem's definition.

So, perhaps the answer should be "Yes" for 6x3, but the sample output is "No".

This suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe there's a constraint on how the pieces can be arranged.

Perhaps the pieces must be arranged without overlapping and completely filling the new rectangle, and in some cases, this is not possible.

But in the examples provided, it seems possible.

Wait, perhaps it's about tiling.

In the case of 6x3, cutting into two 3x3 rectangles, which can only be arranged to form the same 6x3 rectangle or a 3x6 rectangle, which is the same as 6x3.

Alternatively, cutting into 2x3 and 4x3, and arranging them to form a 2x6 rectangle.

But perhaps, in reality, these pieces cannot be arranged to form a 2x6 rectangle.

Let me try to visualize this.

Take the 6x3 rectangle.

Cut horizontally at position 2: get a 2x3 rectangle and a 4x3 rectangle.

Now, to form a 2x6 rectangle, I need to arrange these two pieces.

If I place the 2x3 rectangle horizontally, it's 2x3.

If I place the 4x3 rectangle horizontally, it's 4x3.

To form a 2x6 rectangle, I need a height of 2 and width of 6.

If I place the 2x3 rectangle vertically, it becomes 3x2.

Similarly, the 4x3 rectangle placed vertically becomes 3x4.

Now, arranging a 3x2 and a 3x4 to form a 2x6 rectangle.

Wait, but 3x2 and 3x4 have areas 6 and
