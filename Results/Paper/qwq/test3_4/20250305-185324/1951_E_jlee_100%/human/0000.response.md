Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and I need to partition this string into some substrings such that none of these substrings is a palindrome. If it's possible to do that, I should output "YES" followed by the number of parts and the parts themselves. If not, just "NO".

First, I need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards, like "racecar" or "abccba". So, my task is to split the string into substrings that aren't palindromes.

Let's consider some examples to get a better grasp.

Example 1:

Input: "sinktheyacht"

Output: "YES", 1, "sinktheyacht"

Explanation: The whole string is not a palindrome, so it's acceptable as a single part.

Example 2:

Input: "lllllllll"

Output: "NO"

Explanation: Every possible substring is a palindrome (since all characters are 'l'), so it's impossible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings.

Example 3:

Input: "uwuowouwu"

Output: "YES", 3, "uw uow ouwu"

Explanation: Each of these substrings is not a palindrome.

From these examples, I can see that if the entire string is not a palindrome, I can just take it as a single part. If it is a palindrome, I need to see if I can split it into smaller non-palindromic parts.

But, in the second example, it's impossible because every substring is a palindrome. So, I need a way to detect whether it's possible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Let me think about the conditions under which it's impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

1. If the string has only one character, it's a palindrome, and I can't split it further, so "NO".

2. If all characters are the same, like "lllllllll", any substring is a palindrome, so "NO".

3. If the string is a palindrome and has an odd length with all characters same except the middle one, but in this case, if all characters are the same, it's already covered in point 2.

Wait, in point 2, if all characters are the same, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings because any substring will consist of the same character repeated, which is a palindrome.

But, is there any other case where it's impossible?

Let's consider a string like "aabaa". It's a palindrome, but if I split it into "a" and "aba" and "a", but "a" and "aba" are palindromes. So, I need to find a different partition.

Alternatively, "aabaa" can be split into "aa" and "ba" and "a". "aa" is a palindrome, so this doesn't work. "aab" and "aa". "aab" is not a palindrome, and "aa" is a palindrome. So, this partition has one palindrome substring.

Is there any way to partition "aabaa" into non-palindromic substrings?

Wait, "aab" and "a" and "a". "aab" is not a palindrome, "a" is a palindrome. So, it's invalid.

Another attempt: "aa" and "baa". "aa" is a palindrome, so invalid.

"aabaa" itself is a palindrome, and it seems challenging to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, what if I split it into "a" and "abaa"? "a" is a palindrome, so invalid.

"aa" and "baa"? "aa" is a palindrome.

"a" and "ab" and "aa"? "a" and "ab" (not palindrome), "aa" (palindrome). Still invalid.

Seems like it's impossible to partition "aabaa" into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the problem, in the second test case, "lllllllll" is impossible, which makes sense because all substrings are palindromes.

So, is there a general rule here?

I think that if all characters are the same, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings, because any substring will consist of the same character repeated, which is a palindrome.

Additionally, if the string is a palindrome and consists of more than one character, and it can't be split into non-palindromic substrings, then "NO".

Wait, but in the first example, "sinktheyacht" is not a palindrome, so it's acceptable as a single part.

In the third example, "uwuowouwu" is a palindrome, but it can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", which are not palindromes.

So, in some cases, even if the string is a palindrome, it can be split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, how do I determine when it's possible?

I need to check if the string can be split into substrings where none of them is a palindrome.

One approach could be:

- If the entire string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the entire string is a palindrome, try to split it into two parts and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output them.

- If one or both parts are palindromes, try splitting differently.

- Recursively, keep splitting until all parts are non-palindromic.

But this could be inefficient for large strings.

Is there a better way?

Looking back at the examples, in the second test case, "lllllllll", it's impossible because any substring is a palindrome.

In the first test case, "sinktheyacht", it's not a palindrome, so it can be output as a single part.

In the third test case, "uwuowouwu", it's a palindrome, but it can be split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu", which are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, for strings that are palindromes, I need to find a way to split them into non-palindromic substrings.

But, if all characters are the same, it's impossible.

So, maybe, if there exists at least one character that is different from the first character, I can use that to split the string into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, let's think about that.

Suppose the string is a palindrome and has at least two distinct characters.

Can I always split it into non-palindromic substrings in that case?

Let's take "abccba". It's a palindrome. If I split it into "a", "bccc", "ba", but "a" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "ab", "cc", "ba". "ab" is not a palindrome, "cc" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Another attempt: "abc", "cba". "abc" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, "cba" is the reverse of "abc", but since it's not the same as "abc", it's not a palindrome. Wait, no, "cba" reversed is "abc", so it is a palindrome.

Wait, no, "cba" is not a palindrome because "cba" reversed is "abc", which is different from "cba".

Wait, but according to the definition, a palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. So, "cba" is not a palindrome because "cba" != "abc".

Wait, but in the code, the function to check palindrome likely checks if s == s[::-1].

So, "cba" == "abc"? No, so "cba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, but in "abccba", "abc" and "cba" are different strings, so "cba" is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "cba" reversed is "abc", which is different from "cba", so "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting "abccba" into "abc" and "cba" would be acceptable because both are not palindromes.

So, perhaps, if I can find a split where no part is a palindrome, it's possible.

But, in the case where all characters are the same, it's impossible.

So, maybe the general rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split it into two parts, and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output them.

- If one or both parts are palindromes, try splitting differently.

But, in the case of "abccba", splitting into "abc" and "cba" works.

Similarly, in "uwuowouwu", it's split into "uw", "uow", "ouwu".

So, seems like it's possible when there are multiple distinct characters.

But, what if the string is a palindrome and has multiple distinct characters, but any split results in palindrome substrings?

I need a better approach.

Let me think about this differently.

Suppose I have a string that is a palindrome.

To split it into non-palindromic substrings, I need to ensure that each part is not a palindrome.

One way to ensure that a substring is not a palindrome is to make sure that its first and last characters are different.

Because, if first and last characters are different, it can't be a palindrome.

So, if I can split the string such that in each part, the first and last characters are different, then each part is not a palindrome.

So, perhaps, I can look for positions where the characters at those positions are different from the corresponding characters from the ends.

Wait, let's formalize this.

Given a string s of length n, which is a palindrome.

I need to find a way to split it into substrings where for each substring t, t[0] != t[-1].

Because if t[0] != t[-1], then t is not a palindrome.

So, if I can find a split where in each substring, the first and last characters are different, then all substrings are non-palindromic.

Now, since s is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

So, in this case, if I want to split the string such that in each substring, t[0] != t[-1], but since s is a palindrome, t[0] == t[-1] for any substring that is a palindrome.

Wait, but I want t[0] != t[-1] to ensure it's not a palindrome.

So, in a palindrome string, it's tricky because s[i] == s[n-1-i].

So, to have t[0] != t[-1], I need to choose substrings where t[0] != t[-1].

But in a palindrome string, any substring that has t[0] == t[-1] is a palindrome.

Wait, no, not necessarily.

For example, in "abccba", "abc" has 'a' != 'a' (wait, 'a' == 'a'), but "abc" is not a palindrome because "abc" != "cba".

Wait, but according to the definition, "abc" is not a palindrome because "abc" != "cba".

So, even if t[0] == t[-1], it doesn't guarantee that t is a palindrome.

Wait, for example, "aba" is a palindrome, but "ab" is not a palindrome, even though "ab" has 'a' != 'b'.

So, perhaps, the condition t[0] != t[-1] is sufficient but not necessary for t to be not a palindrome.

Because "ab" has 'a' != 'b' and is not a palindrome, but "abc" has 'a' != 'c' and is not a palindrome.

Wait, but "abc" has 'a' != 'c', but according to the palindrome check, "abc" != "cba", so it's not a palindrome.

So, perhaps, t[0] != t[-1] implies t is not a palindrome, but t[0] == t[-1] doesn't necessarily imply t is a palindrome.

Wait, no, "aba" has 'a' == 'a', and it's a palindrome.

But "aaa" has 'a' == 'a' and is a palindrome.

"aa" has 'a' == 'a' and is a palindrome.

"ab" has 'a' != 'b' and is not a palindrome.

"abc" has 'a' != 'c' and is not a palindrome.

So, t[0] != t[-1] is a sufficient condition for t not being a palindrome, but t[0] == t[-1] doesn't guarantee that t is a palindrome.

Wait, no, "abba" has 'a' == 'a', and it's a palindrome.

"abcdcba" has 'a' == 'a', and it's a palindrome.

"abcba" has 'a' == 'a', and it's a palindrome.

So, t[0] == t[-1] is necessary but not sufficient for t being a palindrome.

t[0] != t[-1] is sufficient for t not being a palindrome.

So, if I can split the string such that in each substring, t[0] != t[-1], then each substring is not a palindrome.

In a palindrome string s, where s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i, if I split it into substrings where t[0] != t[-1], I need to ensure that t[0] != t[-1].

But since s is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i], so for any substring t starting at position p and ending at position q, t[0] = s[p], t[-1] = s[q].

But s[p] == s[n-1-p], and s[q] == s[n-1-q].

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that if the string is a palindrome and consists of repeating characters, like "aaa", "bbbb", etc., then any substring will also be a palindrome, so it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

If the string is a palindrome but has varying characters, like "abccba", then it might be possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, the key is to check if all characters in the string are the same.

If they are, and the string is a palindrome, then it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

If not, then it's possible.

Wait, but in "abccba", all characters are not the same, and it's a palindrome, and it can be split into "abc" and "cba", which are not palindromes.

Wait, but "abc" is not a palindrome, and "cba" is not a palindrome because "cba" != "abc".

Wait, but according to the definition, "cba" reversed is "abc", which is different from "cba", so "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting "abccba" into "abc" and "cba" works.

Another example: "racecar".

Can I split it into "rac" and "ecar"?

"rac" reversed is "car", which is different from "rac", so it's not a palindrome.

"ecar" reversed is "race", which is different from "ecar", so it's not a palindrome.

So, this works.

So, perhaps, for any palindrome string that doesn't consist of all identical characters, it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

Is that always true?

Let's consider "abcdedcba".

Can I split it into "abcd" and "edcba"?

"abcd" reversed is "dcba", which is different from "abcd", so not a palindrome.

"edcba" reversed is "abcde", which is different from "edcba", so not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Another example: "aabbbaabaabbbbaa".

This is a palindrome, but it has varying characters.

Can I split it into "aabbb", "aaba", "abbbbaa"?

"aabbb" reversed is "bbbaa", which is different from "aabbb", so not a palindrome.

"aaba" reversed is "abaa", which is different from "aaba", so not a palindrome.

"abbbbaa" reversed is "aabbbba", which is different from "abbbbaa", so not a palindrome.

So, this works.

Wait, but what about a string like "aaabaaa"?

It's a palindrome, but it has varying characters.

If I split it into "aaa", "b", "aaa", but "aaa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "aaab", "aaa".

"aaab" reversed is "baaa", which is different from "aaab", so not a palindrome.

"aaa" is a palindrome, which is invalid.

Another split: "aa", "aba", "aa".

"aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

"aba" is a palindrome, invalid.

Another split: "a", "aaba", "aa".

"a" is a palindrome, invalid.

"aaba" is not a palindrome, and "aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

So, in this case, it seems impossible to split "aaabaaa" into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to my earlier assumption, since not all characters are the same, it should be possible, but in this case, it's not.

So, my assumption is incorrect.

So, there must be another condition.

Let me think again.

What's special about "aaabaaa"?

It's a palindrome, not all characters are the same, but every possible split includes at least one palindrome substring.

So, perhaps, in addition to checking if all characters are the same, I need to check something else.

Wait, in "aaabaaa", the center character is 'b', and the rest are 'a's.

If I try to split it into "aaa", "b", "aaa", which are all palindromes.

Alternatively, "aaaba", "aa", which are both palindromes.

"aa", "aba", "aa", all palindromes.

"aaa", "baa", "a".

"aaa" is a palindrome.

"baa" reversed is "aab", which is different from "baa", so not a palindrome.

"a" is a palindrome.

So, in this case, splitting into "aaa", "baa", "a", where "aaa" and "a" are palindromes, which is invalid.

Alternatively, "aaaa", "ba", "a".

"aaaa" is a palindrome.

"ba" is not a palindrome.

"a" is a palindrome.

Still invalid.

Another split: "aa", "aba", "aaa".

All are palindromes.

Seems like no matter how I split, at least one substring is a palindrome.

So, in this case, it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

But why?

What's the underlying condition?

Let me consider that in "aaabaaa", the center 'b' is surrounded by 'a's, and any split that includes the 'b' and some 'a's still results in palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, in addition to checking if all characters are the same, I need to check if there exists at least one character that, when used to split the string, results in non-palindromic substrings.

But, in "aaabaaa", it's impossible.

Wait, but in "abccba", it's possible.

What's the difference?

In "abccba", the characters are arranged in a way that allows splitting into "abc" and "cba", which are not palindromes.

In "aaabaaa", any split seems to include palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, the general rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, try to split it into two parts and check if both parts are not palindromes.

- If both parts are not palindromes, output them.

- If one or both parts are palindromes, try splitting into more parts.

- Recursively, keep splitting until all parts are non-palindromic.

- If no such split exists, output "NO".

But, in practice, for large strings, this could be inefficient.

Is there a better way to determine if a palindrome string can be split into non-palindromic substrings?

Let me consider that for a palindrome string, if there exists at least one character that is different from the first character, then it's possible to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

In "abccba", 'b' is different from 'a', so it's possible.

In "aaabaaa", 'b' is different from 'a', but as we've seen, it's still impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, maybe that's not the right condition.

Alternatively, perhaps if there are at least two different characters in the string, it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But in "aaabaaa", there are 'a's and one 'b', but it's still impossible.

So, that can't be the condition.

Another idea: if the string has at least one character that is different from its neighboring characters, maybe that can be used to create a non-palindromic substring.

But in "aaabaaa", the 'b' is different from its neighbors ('a's), but as we've seen, it's still impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, perhaps the key is to check if the string has more than one distinct character.

But in "aaabaaa", there are two distinct characters, 'a' and 'b', but it's still impossible.

Wait, perhaps it's impossible only when all characters are the same.

But in "aaabaaa", not all characters are the same, but it's still impossible.

So, that can't be the only condition.

Wait, maybe it's impossible when the string is a palindrome and the frequency of at least one character is 1.

Wait, in "aaabaaa", 'b' has frequency 1, and it's impossible.

In "abccba", 'b' and 'c' have frequencies greater than 1, and it's possible.

Wait, in "abccba", 'a' appears twice, 'b' appears twice, 'c' appears twice.

In "aaabaaa", 'a' appears 6 times, 'b' appears 1 time.

So, perhaps, if there's a character that appears only once in the string, and the string is a palindrome, then it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

Is that the case?

Let's test this idea.

In "aaabaaa", 'b' appears only once, and it's impossible.

In "abccba", all characters appear at least twice, and it's possible.

Another example: "aabbbaa".

All characters appear at least twice ('a':4, 'b':3), and it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Another example: "aabaa".

'a' appears 4 times, 'b' appears 1 time.

Try to split it.

If I split "aabaa" into "aab" and "aa".

"aab" is not a palindrome, "aa" is a palindrome.

Alternatively, "aa" and "baa".

"aa" is a palindrome, invalid.

"aabaa" as a single part is a palindrome.

Seems like it's impossible.

So, in "aabaa", 'b' appears only once, and it's impossible to partition into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, the rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, if there exists at least one character that appears only once in the string, output "NO".

- Else, output "YES" and provide a possible partition.

Wait, but in "abccba", all characters appear at least twice, and it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "aaabaaa", 'b' appears only once, and it's impossible.

In "aabaa", 'b' appears only once, and it's impossible.

In "aabbbaa", all characters appear at least twice, and it's possible.

So, this seems to hold.

Therefore, the general rule is:

- If the string is not a palindrome, output it as a single part.

- If the string is a palindrome:

- If all characters are the same, output "NO".

- Else, if there exists at least one character that appears only once in the string, output "NO".

- Else, output "YES" and provide a possible partition.

But, is this always true?

Let's consider a string like "abcba".

It's a palindrome, and 'b' appears only once, so according to this rule, output "NO".

But, can I split "abcba" into non-palindromic substrings?

Let's try.

Split into "abc" and "ba".

"abc" is not a palindrome, "ba" is not a palindrome.

So, it's possible.

But according to the rule, since 'b' appears only once, it should be "NO".

This is a contradiction.

So, my rule is incorrect.

Wait, in "abcba", 'b' appears only once, but it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, my previous assumption is wrong.

Another example: "abacaba".

It's a palindrome, 'c' appears only once.

Can I split it into non-palindromic substrings?

"abac" and "aba".

"abac" is not a palindrome, "aba" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

"aba" and "caba".

"aba" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

"ab" and "acaba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "acaba" is a palindrome.

Invalid.

"aba" is a palindrome.

Wait, "abacaba" is a palindrome, and it seems challenging to split it into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the earlier rule, since 'c' appears only once, it should be "NO".

But in "abcba", which is a palindrome with 'c' appearing only once, it was possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, perhaps, the rule needs to be adjusted.

Let me think differently.

Suppose the string is a palindrome.

If I can find a split where each substring has its first and last characters different, then each substring is not a palindrome.

Given that the string is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

So, for any substring t from position p to q, t[0] = s[p], t[-1] = s[q].

But s[p] == s[n-1-p], and s[q] == s[n-1-q].

Wait, to have t[0] != t[-1], I need s[p] != s[q].

But since s[p] == s[n-1-p] and s[q] == s[n-1-q], this implies that s[p] != s[q].

But in a palindrome, s[p] == s[n-1-p], so for s[p] != s[q], we need q != n-1-p.

So, perhaps, if I choose p and q such that q != n-1-p, then s[p] != s[q].

Wait, but s[p] == s[n-1-p], and q != n-1-p, so s[q] may or may not be equal to s[p].

This seems too vague.

Maybe I need to consider that in a palindrome, positions are symmetric around the center.

If I split the string into two halves, each half will have corresponding characters that are equal.

So, perhaps, splitting the string into two parts where each part has different first and last characters.

Wait, in "abcba", splitting into "abc" and "ba".

"abc" has 'a' and 'c', which are different.

"ba" has 'b' and 'a', which are different.

So, both substrings are not palindromes.

Similarly, in "abccba", splitting into "abc" and "cba".

"abc" has 'a' and 'c', different.

"cba" has 'c' and 'a', different.

So, both are not palindromes.

In "aaabaaa", if I try to split into "aaa" and "baaa".

"aaa" has 'a' and 'a', same, so it's a palindrome.

"baaa" has 'b' and 'a', different, so not a palindrome.

But "aaa" is a palindrome, so invalid.

Another split: "aaaba", "aa".

"aaaba" has 'a' and 'a', same, palindrome.

"aa" has 'a' and 'a', same, palindrome.

Invalid.

Another split: "aa", "aba", "aaa".

All are palindromes.

Invalid.

So, in "aaabaaa", it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

But according to the earlier rule, if there exists at least one character that appears only once, output "NO".

In "aaabaaa", 'b' appears only once, so according to this rule, output "NO".

Similarly, in "abcba", 'c' appears only once, but it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

So, the rule is not consistent.

Maybe instead of checking if a character appears only once, check if the frequency of the least frequent character is 1.

Wait, in "abcba", 'c' appears once, but it's possible to split.

In "aabaa", 'b' appears once, and it's impossible.

In "abacaba", 'c' appears once, and it's impossible to split.

Wait, in "abacaba", splitting into "abac" and "aba" doesn't work because "aba" is a palindrome.

"abaca" and "ba".

"abaca" is a palindrome, "ba" is not.

Invalid.

"aba" and "caba".

Both are palindromes.

Invalid.

So, perhaps, in addition to having a character that appears only once, if that character is in the center of the palindrome, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "abcba", 'c' is in the center, and it's possible to split into "abc" and "ba", where both are not palindromes.

In "aabaa", 'b' is in the center, and it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "abacaba", 'c' is in the center, and it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Wait, but in "abcba", it's possible.

So, perhaps, if the central character is the only one of its kind, and the remaining string can be split into non-palindromic substrings, then it's possible.

But in "abcba", the central 'c' is the only one, but it's possible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

In "aabaa", the central 'b' is the only one, and it's impossible.

So, this still doesn't hold.

I'm getting confused here.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let me consider that for a palindrome string, if I can split it into two non-palindromic substrings, then output "YES" with two parts.

Otherwise, try splitting into more parts.

But for efficiency, perhaps splitting into two parts is sufficient.

So, perhaps, for palindrome strings, try splitting into two parts where neither part is a palindrome.

If that's possible, output "YES" with those two parts.

If not, output "NO".

How can I check if a split into two non-palindromic substrings is possible?

Given that the string is a palindrome, s[i] == s[n-1-i] for all i.

So, for the first part t1 = s[0..k], and second part t2 = s[k+1..n-1], where 0 <= k < n.

To ensure t1 is not a palindrome, we need t1[0] != t1[-1], which is s[0] != s[k].

Similarly, for t2, we need t2[0] != t2[-1], which is s[k+1] != s[n-1].

But since s is a palindrome, s[k+1] == s[n-1-k-1] = s[n-2-k].

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Wait, but s is a palindrome, so s[k+1] == s[n-2-k].

So, for t2[0] != t2[-1], we need s[k+1] != s[n-1], which is s[k+1] != s[k+1], since s[k+1] == s[n-2-k] == s[k+1].

Wait, no, s[k+1] == s[n-2-k], but s[n-1] == s[0].

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me consider that for the string to be split into two non-palindromic substrings, both t1 and t2 must have their first and last characters different.

Given that s is a palindrome, s[0] == s[n-1], s[1] == s[n-2], and so on.

So, for t1 = s[0..k], t1[0] = s[0], t1[-1] = s[k].

For t1 to not be a palindrome, s[0] != s[k].

Similarly, for t2 = s[k+1..n-1], t2[0] = s[k+1], t2[-1] = s[n-1].

But s[n-1] == s[0], since s is a palindrome.

So, for t2 to not be a palindrome, s[k+1] != s[0].

So, to have both t1 and t2 not palindromes, we need:

s[0] != s[k] and s[k+1] != s[0].

If such a k exists, then we can split the string into two non-palindromic substrings.

Otherwise, it's impossible.

So, in code, for a palindrome string s, iterate through possible k from 0 to n-2, and check if s[0] != s[k] and s[k+1] != s[0].

If such a k exists, output "YES" with t1 = s[0..k] and t2 = s[k+1..n-1].

Else, output "NO".

Let's test this logic with some examples.

Example 1: "sinktheyacht"

This is not a palindrome, so output "YES" with the whole string.

Example 2: "lllllllll"

This is a palindrome, and all characters are 'l', so s[0] == s[k] for all k, and s[k+1] == s[0] for all k.

So, s[0] != s[k] is false for all k, so no such k exists, output "NO".

Example 3: "uwuowouwu"

This is a palindrome.

Let's check if there exists a k where s[0] != s[k] and s[k+1] != s[0].

s[0] = 'u'.

Look for k where s[k] != 'u' and s[k+1] != 'u'.

Looking at the string: u w u o w o u w u

Looking for k where s[k] != 'u' and s[k+1] != 'u'.

At k=1: s[1]='w' != 'u', s[2]='u' == 'u' → doesn't satisfy s[k+1] != 'u'.

At k=3: s[3]='o' != 'u', s[4]='w' != 'u' → satisfies both conditions.

So, k=3 is valid.

Split into "uwuow" and "ouwu".

"uwuow" is not a palindrome, "ouwu" is not a palindrome.

So, it works.

Another example: "abccba"

s[0] = 'a'.

Look for k where s[k] != 'a' and s[k+1] != 'a'.

s: a b c c b a

At k=1: s[1]='b' != 'a', s[2]='c' != 'a' → valid.

Split into "ab" and "ccba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "ccba" is not a palindrome.

So, it works.

Another example: "aaabaaa"

s[0] = 'a'.

Look for k where s[k] != 'a' and s[k+1] != 'a'.

s: a a a b a a a

At k=3: s[3]='b' != 'a', s[4]='a' == 'a' → doesn't satisfy s[k+1] != 'a'.

At k=2: s[2]='a' == 'a' → doesn't satisfy s[k] != 'a'.

At k=1: s[1]='a' == 'a' → doesn't satisfy s[k] != 'a'.

At k=4: s[4]='a' == 'a' → doesn't satisfy s[k] != 'a'.

So, no k satisfies both conditions.

Therefore, output "NO".

This matches our earlier observation that "aaabaaa" cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

Another example: "abcba"

s[0] = 'a'.

Look for k where s[k] != 'a' and s[k+1] != 'a'.

s: a b c b a

At k=1: s[1]='b' != 'a', s[2]='c' != 'a' → valid.

Split into "ab" and "cba".

"ab" is not a palindrome, "cba" is not a palindrome.

So, it works.

Another example: "aabaa"

s[0] = 'a'.

Look for k where s[k] != 'a' and s[k+1] != 'a'.

s: a a b a a

At k=2: s[2]='b' != 'a', s[3]='a' == 'a' → doesn't satisfy s[k+1] != 'a'.

At k=1: s[1]='a' == 'a' → doesn't satisfy s[k] != 'a'.

No such k exists, so output "NO".

This matches our earlier observation.

So, this seems to be a reliable method.

Therefore, the algorithm can be:

For each test case:

- Read the string s.

- If s is not a palindrome, output "YES" with the whole string as one part.

- Else, if s consists of all identical characters, output "NO".

- Else, check if there exists a k (0 <= k < n-1) such that s[0] != s[k] and s[k+1] != s[0].

- If such a k exists, output "YES" and split s into s[0..k] and s[k+1..n-1].

- Else, output "NO".

This should work efficiently, as checking for palindrome and finding such a k can be done in linear time.

Now, looking at the given code, let's see if it implements this logic correctly.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for i in range(t):

string = input()

s = list(string)

n = len(s)

done = False

if n == 1:

print('NO')

continue

x = s[0]

if x != s[-1]:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

continue

if s.count(x) == n:

print('NO')

continue

elif s.count(x) == n - 1:

if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:

print('NO')

else:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

continue

count = 0

count2 = 0

for j in range(n):

if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:

print('YES')

print(1)

print(string)

done = True

break

if s[j] != x and count < 1:

count = j

continue

if count > 0:

if s[j] != x:

if count2 < count:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(string[:j], string[j:])

done = True

break

elif count2 == count:

if count > 1:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])

done = True

break

else:

count2 = 0

continue

elif count2 > count:

print('YES')

print(2)

print(string[:j], string[j:])

done = True

break

else:

count2 += 1

if not done:

print('NO')



First, it reads the number of test cases t.

For each test case:

- Reads the string and converts it to a list s.

- Gets the length n.

- Initializes done to False.

- If n == 1, prints "NO".

- Sets x to s[0].

- If x != s[-1], prints "YES", 1, and the string.

- If all characters in s are x, prints "NO".

- If exactly n-1 characters are x:

- If n is odd and the central character is not x, prints "NO".

- Else, prints "YES", 1, and the string.

- Else, iterates through the string:

- If s[j] != s[n-1-j], prints "YES", 1, and the string, sets done to True, and breaks.

- If s[j] != x and count < 1, sets count to j and continues.

- If count > 0:

- If s[j] != x and count2 < count, prints "YES", 2, and splits the string at j.

- If count2 == count and count > 1, prints "YES", 2, and splits at j-1.

- If count2 > count, prints "YES", 2, and splits at j.

- Else, count2 +=1

- If no condition is met, prints "NO".

This seems overly complicated.

Let's see if it aligns with the logic I derived.

First, if the string is not a palindrome, output "YES" with the whole string.

In the code, if x != s[-1], which means s[0] != s[-1], so s is not a palindrome, it outputs "YES", 1, and the string.

This is correct.

If all characters are x, which means all characters are the same, outputs "NO", which is correct.

If exactly n-1 characters are x, and n is odd, and the central character is not x, outputs "NO".

This seems to handle the case where there's only one character different, and it's in the center.

In such cases, it's impossible to split into non-palindromic substrings.

Else, if n-1 characters are x, but the central one is x, or n is even, outputs "YES" with the whole string.

Wait, but in such cases, the string might still be a palindrome, and splitting might be necessary.

For example, "aaaba", where x='a', and the central 'b' is at position 3 (0-based index), which is not the exact center for n=5.

Wait, for n=5, (n-1)//2 = 2, so position 2 is the center.

In "aaaba", the central character is 'a', which is x, so it would output "YES" with the whole string.

But "aaaba" is not a palindrome, so it's correct.

Wait, but "aaaba" is not a palindrome, so it should be handled by the first condition where s[0] != s[-1], but s[0] = 'a', s[-1] = 'a', so it doesn't satisfy that condition.

Wait, in "aaaba", s[0] = 'a', s[-1] = 'a', so it doesn't fall
