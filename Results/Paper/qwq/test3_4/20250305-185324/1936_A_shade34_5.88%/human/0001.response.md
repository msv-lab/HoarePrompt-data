Alright, I've got this interactive problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, there's a secret permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1, and I need to find two indices i and j such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. I can ask up to 3n queries, where each query compares the OR of two elements with the OR of another two elements.

First, I need to understand what XOR and OR operations do. XOR gives me the bits that are set in one number or the other but not both, while OR gives me the bits that are set in either or both numbers.

My goal is to maximize p_i XOR p_j. To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ as much as possible in their higher bits.

Given that p is a permutation, all elements are unique, and I need to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

Now, thinking about how to approach this with the given queries. Each query lets me compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d). I need to use these comparisons to gather information about the elements in the permutation.

One idea is to find the maximum element in the permutation because the maximum XOR might involve the maximum value in the permutation.

Wait, but XOR is not directly related to the magnitude of the numbers; it's about the bit differences.

However, in binary numbers, higher bits contribute more to the value, so perhaps finding the elements with the highest bits set could help.

Let me think differently. Since I can compare ORs of pairs, maybe I can find the elements with the highest bits set by comparing them.

First, I need to determine the bit length of the numbers. Since p is a permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum value is n-1, so the number of bits required is ceil(log2(n)).

Letâ€™s denote the number of bits as b.

I can try to find the highest bit where not all elements have the same bit value.

Starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit, I can try to partition the elements based on whether that bit is set or not.

This sounds like a divide-and-conquer strategy based on bits.

But I need to do this interactively, using the provided query format.

Looking back at the code provided, it seems to have a different approach.

Let me analyze the given code step by step.

First, it reads the number of test cases t, and then for each test case, it reads n.

Then, it initializes mak to 0.

It performs a loop from i=1 to n-1, where for each i, it asks a query comparing (p_mak OR p_mak) with (p_i OR p_i), and if the result is '<', it sets mak to i.

So, it's trying to find the element p_mak that has the maximum p_i OR p_i.

Wait, but p_i OR p_i is just p_i, since OR-ing a number with itself gives itself.

So, this loop is essentially finding the maximum p_i in the permutation by comparing the elements directly.

After this loop, mak should be the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

Then, it sets mak2 to mak, which is the index of the maximum element.

Next, it initializes pans as an empty list.

It loops through all i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, it asks a query comparing (p_mak OR p_mak2) with (p_i OR p_mak2).

Wait, but p_mak2 is the same as mak, which is the index of the maximum element.

So, it's comparing (p_mak OR p_mak) with (p_i OR p_mak).

But p_mak OR p_mak is just p_mak.

So, it's comparing p_mak with (p_i OR p_mak).

If p_i OR p_mak < p_mak, then it sets mak to i and sets pans to [i].

If p_i OR p_mak == p_mak, it appends i to pans.

Wait, but p_i OR p_mak will be equal to p_mak if p_i's bits are subset of p_mak's bits.

Otherwise, if p_i has some bits not in p_mak, then p_i OR p_mak will be greater than p_mak.

So, by selecting i where p_i OR p_mak == p_mak, it's gathering all i where p_i's bits are subset of p_mak's bits.

In other words, p_i is a subset in terms of bits of p_mak.

Then, among these pans, it performs another loop to find the maximum p_i.

It sets mak to 0, and then loops from i=1 to len(pans)-1, comparing p_pans[mak] OR p_pans[mak] with p_pans[i] OR p_pans[i], which is essentially comparing p_pans[mak] with p_pans[i], since OR-ing a number with itself gives itself.

So, it's finding the maximum p_i among the pans list.

Finally, it prints "! mak2 mak", which are the indices of the maximum element and the one found in the last step.

Wait, but I need to find two indices i and j such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized.

I need to check if this approach achieves that.

Let me think about what this code is doing.

First, it finds the index of the maximum p_i, let's call it mak.

Then, it finds all i where p_i OR p_mak == p_mak, which means p_i's bits are subset of p_mak's bits.

Among these, it finds the one with the maximum p_i.

Finally, it outputs mak2 (which is mak, the index of the maximum p_i) and mak (the index of the maximum p_i among those whose bits are subset of p_mak's bits).

Wait, but I need to maximize p_i XOR p_j.

I'm not sure if this approach guarantees that.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose n=4, and p = [0,3,1,2].

So, p in binary:

0 - 000

3 - 011

1 - 001

2 - 010

The maximum p_i is 3, at index 1.

So, mak = 1.

Then, for each i, it compares p_mak OR p_i with p_mak.

For i=0: p_1 OR p_0 = 3 OR 0 = 3 == p_mak, so append 0 to pans.

For i=1: p_1 OR p_1 = 3 OR 3 = 3 == p_mak, append 1 to pans.

For i=2: p_1 OR p_2 = 3 OR 1 = 3 == p_mak, append 2 to pans.

For i=3: p_1 OR p_3 = 3 OR 2 = 3 == p_mak, append 3 to pans.

So, pans = [0,1,2,3].

Then, among these, it finds the one with the maximum p_i.

Comparing p_0=0 with p_1=3: 0 < 3, so mak=1.

Comparing p_1=3 with p_2=1: 3 > 1, mak remains 1.

Comparing p_1=3 with p_3=2: 3 > 2, mak remains 1.

So, it outputs "! 1 1", which is the same index twice.

But p_1 XOR p_1 = 0, which is not the maximum possible XOR.

The maximum XOR is between p_3=2 and p_2=1, which is 3.

So, this approach is incorrect for this example.

Wait, but in the example provided in the problem, the output is "! 3 2", which is correct.

But according to the code, it outputs "! mak2 mak", which are both 1 in this case.

So, there's a discrepancy.

Perhaps the code is different from what's described.

Wait, in the code, it prints "! mak2 mak", but in the example, it prints "! 3 2".

So, maybe in that specific run, mak2=3 and mak=2.

Looking back, in the first loop, mak is set to the index of the maximum p_i, which is 1 (p_1=3).

Then mak2=mak=1.

Then, it builds pans by checking p_i OR p_mak == p_mak.

In the example, p_i OR 3 == 3 for all i, so pans=[0,1,2,3].

Then, it finds the maximum p_i in pans, which is p_1=3.

So, mak=1.

Then, it prints "! mak2 mak", which is "! 1 1".

But in the example, it's printed "! 3 2".

So, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the indices are 1-based in output, but in code, they are 0-based.

But in the problem, indices are 0-based.

Wait, in the example, it's printed "! 3 2", which corresponds to indices 3 and 2.

But according to the code, it should print "! mak2 mak", which are both 1 in this case.

This doesn't match.

So, perhaps the code provided is different from what's in the example.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps when it says "pans.append(i)", it's appending i, but in the second loop, it's comparing pans[mak] and pans[i], but mak is index, not value.

Wait, perhaps I need to trace the code more carefully.

Let me try to trace the code with the example n=4, p=[0,3,1,2].

First loop:

mak=0

i=1: "? 0 0 1 1" -> compare p_0 OR p_0=0 with p_1 OR p_1=3 -> 0 < 3, so mak=1

i=2: "? 1 1 2 2" -> compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_2 OR p_2=1 -> 3 > 1, mak remains 1

i=3: "? 1 1 3 3" -> compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_3 OR p_3=2 -> 3 > 2, mak remains 1

So, mak=1

Then mak2=1

Then, build pans:

for i=0: "? 1 1 0 1" -> compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_0 OR p_1=0 OR 3=3 -> "=" -> append 0 to pans

for i=1: "? 1 1 1 1" -> compare p_1 OR p_1=3 with p_1 OR p_1=3 -> "=" -> append 1 to pans

for i=2: "? 1 1 2 1" -> compare p_1 OR p_2=3 OR 1=3 with p_1 OR p_1=3 -> "=" -> append 2 to pans

for i=3: "? 1 1 3 1" -> compare p_1 OR p_3=3 OR 2=3 with p_1 OR p_1=3 -> "=" -> append 3 to pans

So, pans=[0,1,2,3]

Then, find the maximum p_i in pans:

Compare p_0=0 with p_1=3: "? 0 0 1 1" -> 0 < 3, so mak=1

Compare p_1=3 with p_2=1: "? 1 1 2 2" -> 3 > 1, mak remains 1

Compare p_1=3 with p_3=2: "? 1 1 3 3" -> 3 > 2, mak remains 1

So, mak=1

Then, print "! 1 1"

But in the example, it's printed "! 3 2"

So, either the code is different, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps in the code, it's printing "! mak2 pans[mak]", but in my analysis, I assumed it's "! mak2 mak".

Looking back at the code:

print('!', mak2, mak)

But mak is the index in pans, which is 1, so pans[1]=1.

So, it should print "! 1 1"

But in the example, it's printed "! 3 2"

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code or in the example.

Alternatively, maybe the code is correct, and the example is just an illustration.

But in any case, according to my analysis, this approach doesn't seem to be correct, as it outputs "! 1 1" in this example, which is incorrect.

So, perhaps the code is wrong.

I need to think of a different approach.

Let me think about how to maximize p_i XOR p_j.

To maximize XOR, I want p_i and p_j to differ in the highest possible bits.

So, if I can find two numbers that differ in the most significant bit, that would be ideal.

Given that, perhaps I can find the maximum and minimum values in the permutation, or something similar.

Wait, but XOR is not directly related to the magnitude; it's about bit differences.

Maybe I can consider the bits from the most significant to the least significant and try to make p_i and p_j differ in as many bits as possible.

Given that I can only ask comparisons between ORs of pairs, it's a bit tricky.

An alternative approach is to realize that for any permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum XOR of any two elements is equal to 2^b - 1, where b is the number of bits required to represent n-1.

For example, if n=4, numbers are 0 to 3, which in 2 bits: 00, 01, 10, 11. The maximum XOR is 01 XOR 11 = 10, which is 3, which is 2^2 - 1.

Similarly, for n=2, numbers 0 and 1: maximum XOR is 1.

So, in general, the maximum possible XOR is 2^b - 1, where b is the bit length of n-1.

But I need to find any two indices that achieve this maximum XOR.

Given that, perhaps I can find any two numbers that differ in all the higher bits up to b.

But I need to confirm if this is always possible.

Wait, for n=4, p=[0,3,1,2], maximum XOR is 3, which is 011 XOR 000.

Wait, 0 XOR 3 is 3, which is 11, which is 3 in decimal.

Similarly, 1 XOR 2 is 3.

So, in this case, multiple pairs achieve the maximum XOR.

So, I need to find any such pair.

Now, how can I do this interactively with at most 3n queries?

I need to come up with a strategy to identify two numbers that achieve this maximum XOR.

One way is to find two numbers that differ in the most significant bit.

But I need to generalize this for any n and any permutation.

Wait, perhaps I can group the numbers based on their most significant bit.

For example, separate numbers with the highest bit set to 1 and those with 0.

If both groups are non-empty, then the maximum XOR would be between a number with the highest bit 1 and another with 0.

If the highest bit is the same in all numbers, then I need to look at the next highest bit.

Wait, this sounds like finding the two numbers that differ the most in their bit patterns.

I need to maximize the number of bits in which they differ.

To do this, I can try to split the numbers based on the highest bit where there is a difference.

This seems similar to building a trie (prefix tree) based on bits and finding two numbers that differ in the leftmost bit possible.

But since this is an interactive problem with limited queries, I need an efficient way to do this.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and try to find two numbers that differ in that bit.

To do this, for each bit position, starting from the highest, I can try to find if there are numbers with that bit set and numbers with that bit not set.

If there are numbers with the bit set and numbers with the bit not set, then I can pick one from each group, and their XOR will have that bit set.

Among such pairs, the one with the highest bit differing will have the maximum XOR.

So, my plan is:

1. Determine the bit length b of n-1.

2. For each bit position from b-1 down to 0:

a. Find if there are numbers with that bit set and numbers with that bit not set.

b. If both exist, then find any two numbers that differ in that bit.

c. Once such a pair is found, output their indices.

To implement this interactively, I need a way to group the numbers based on specific bits using the allowed queries.

Given that each query allows me to compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d), I need to use these comparisons to infer the bit values of the elements.

This seems tricky because OR combines bits in a way that makes it hard to isolate individual bits.

Maybe I can find a way to compare elements in such a way that the OR operation reveals information about specific bits.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum and second maximum elements, or something similar, to pair them for maximum XOR.

Wait, but in the earlier example, pairing the maximum with some other element didn't give the maximum XOR.

So, that approach is flawed.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I fix one element and try to find another element that maximizes its XOR.

But doing this for each element would require n queries for each element, which is n^2, way beyond the allowed 3n.

So, that's not feasible.

Another idea: since XOR is commutative and associative, maybe there's a way to group elements based on their XOR values.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for any two elements, their XOR is maximized when their bits differ as much as possible.

Given that, perhaps I can find the two elements that have the most differing bits.

To do this, I can try to find the two elements that are furthest apart in terms of Hamming distance.

But again, I need an efficient way to do this with limited queries.

Given the constraints, I need a strategy that uses at most 3n queries.

Let me consider dividing the elements into groups based on their highest set bits.

For example, group elements with the most significant bit set to 1 and those with 0.

If both groups are non-empty, then the maximum XOR is between a element from each group.

If the most significant bit is the same in all elements, then I need to look at the next bit down.

I can recursively apply this idea.

But how do I implement this with the given query format?

Perhaps I can select a pivot element and compare it with others to see which group they belong to based on a specific bit.

But I need to do this indirectly through the OR comparisons.

This seems complicated.

Let me consider a different approach.

Since the permutation is fixed and not adaptive, I can treat it as a static array.

I need to find two indices with maximum XOR.

Given that, perhaps I can find the maximum possible XOR value first and then find any pair that achieves it.

To find the maximum possible XOR, I can consider the bitwise OR of all elements, but that might not directly give me the maximum XOR.

Wait, actually, the maximum possible XOR is equal to the bitwise OR of all elements, because OR sets a bit if it's set in any of the operands, whereas XOR sets a bit only if it's set in one but not both operands.

No, that's not correct.

Wait, for example, in n=4, p=[0,1,2,3], the maximum XOR is 3 (11), which is the same as the bitwise OR of all elements.

But in general, is the maximum XOR equal to the bitwise OR of all elements?

Let me check.

Take p=[0,1,2,3]:

- 0 in binary: 00

- 1: 01

- 2: 10

- 3: 11

Bitwise OR of all: 11 (3)

Maximum XOR: 3 (same)

Another example, p=[0,2,4,6]:

- 0: 000

- 2: 010

- 4: 100

- 6: 110

Bitwise OR of all: 110 (6)

Maximum XOR: 4 XOR 6 = 10 XOR 110 = 100 (4)

Wait, that's different.

So, in this case, the maximum XOR is 4, which is not equal to the bitwise OR of all elements (6).

Hence, my earlier assumption is wrong.

So, the maximum XOR is not necessarily equal to the bitwise OR of all elements.

Therefore, I need another way to find the maximum XOR.

Let me think about the properties of XOR.

XOR is maximized when the number of differing bits is maximized.

So, for two numbers, the XOR is maximized if they differ in all the bits from the most significant to the least significant.

Given that, perhaps I can find two numbers that differ in the most significant bit possible.

To do this, I can look for the highest bit position where the bits differ between two numbers.

I need to find such a pair with the highest possible bit position differing.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate from the highest bit down to the lowest bit and try to find two numbers that differ in that bit position.

To do this, I can group the numbers based on whether that bit is set or not.

If there are numbers in both groups, then I can pick one from each group, and their XOR will have that bit set.

Among such pairs, the one with the highest differing bit will have the maximum XOR.

So, my plan is:

1. Determine the bit length b of n-1.

2. For each bit position from b-1 down to 0:

a. Partition the elements into two groups: those with that bit set and those without.

b. If both groups are non-empty, find any two elements, one from each group.

c. Their XOR will have that bit set, contributing the maximum possible value for that bit.

d. Output those two indices and terminate.

This way, I find the highest bit where there is a difference and pick any two elements that differ in that bit.

This should give me a pair with maximum possible XOR.

Now, the challenge is to implement this interactively using the allowed queries.

Each query allows me to compare (p_a OR p_b) with (p_c OR p_d).

I need to use these comparisons to determine the bit values of the elements.

This seems tricky because OR combines bits in a way that makes it hard to isolate individual bits.

I need to find a way to use these comparisons to group elements based on specific bits.

Perhaps I can fix a and b, and vary c and d to compare (p_a OR p_b) with different (p_c OR p_d) to gather information about the elements.

Alternatively, maybe I can fix a and c, and vary b and d, but this seems too vague.

Let me consider that for any element p_i, I can find its value by comparing it with others in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps I can find the maximum element first, and then find the element that maximizes XOR with it.

But as seen in the earlier example, that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe I can find two elements that differ in the highest bit.

To do this, perhaps I can find the elements with the highest bit set and those with it not set.

Then, pick one from each group.

But how do I find these groups using the queries?

One idea is to select a reference element and compare it with others to see if certain bits are set or not.

Wait, perhaps I can select a reference element and use queries to determine the value of specific bits in other elements relative to it.

But this still seems unclear.

Let me consider that for any two elements, their OR will have bits set if either element has that bit set.

So, if I have two elements where one has a certain bit set and the other doesn't, their OR will have that bit set.

But comparing this with another OR might not directly reveal the bit values.

This seems too indirect.

Given the time constraints, maybe I need a different approach.

Let me consider that for any permutation of 0 to n-1, the maximum XOR is achieved by selecting the two elements that are furthest apart in terms of their binary representations.

In other words, the two elements that differ in the most significant bit possible.

So, to maximize XOR, I need to maximize the number of differing bits, starting from the most significant bit.

Given that, perhaps I can iterate through the bits from the most significant to the least significant and try to find two elements that differ in that bit.

Once I find such a pair, I can output them.

To implement this, I need a way to group elements based on specific bits using the queries.

This seems challenging with the given query format.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the two elements with the maximum difference.

But XOR doesn't directly correspond to numerical difference.

Wait, maybe I can find the minimum and maximum elements and see if their XOR is equal to the maximum possible XOR.

But earlier, I saw that in some cases, it's not.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that the provided code is incorrect and think of a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the provided code is correct, and I just misanalyzed it.

Let me look back at the code.

The code first finds the index mak of the maximum p_i by comparing p_i OR p_i, which is just p_i.

Then, it finds all i where p_i OR p_mak == p_mak, which means p_i's bits are subset of p_mak's bits.

Then, among these i, it finds the one with the maximum p_i.

Finally, it outputs mak2 (which is mak) and mak (which is the index of the maximum p_i among those whose bits are subset of p_mak's bits
