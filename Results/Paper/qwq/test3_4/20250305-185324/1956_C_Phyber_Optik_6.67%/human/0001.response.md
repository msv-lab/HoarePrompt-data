Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this n by n matrix, initially all zeros. I can perform two types of operations: Type 1 and Type 2. Both involve choosing a row or a column and assigning it a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than 2n operations.

First, I need to understand what these operations do.

Type 1 operation: Choose a row i and a permutation p of 1 to n. This sets the elements of row i to the values in the permutation p.

Type 2 operation: Choose a column i and a permutation p of 1 to n. This sets the elements of column i to the values in the permutation p.

Since I can perform these operations, I need to decide which operations to use and in what order to maximize the sum of the matrix.

Constraints:

- I can perform up to 2n operations.

- n can be up to 500, and the sum of n^2 over all test cases doesn't exceed 5*10^5.

Given that n can be up to 500, and t up to 500, I need an efficient solution.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, observe that each operation affects either a entire row or a entire column.

If I perform a Type 1 operation on a row, I set that row to a permutation of 1 to n. Similarly, for Type 2, I set a column to a permutation of 1 to n.

I need to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix.

Let me consider the sum contributed by each cell.

If a cell is set by a Type 1 operation on its row, it will have the value from the permutation assigned to that row.

Similarly, if a cell is set by a Type 2 operation on its column, it will have the value from the permutation assigned to that column.

If both operations are performed on the same cell, the last operation performed will overwrite the previous value.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to decide for each cell which operation should set its final value.

An idea: If I perform Type 1 operations on all rows, I can set each row to a permutation, and the sum would be n times the sum of a single permutation, which is n*(n+1)/2. So total sum would be n * n*(n+1)/2 = n^2*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I perform Type 2 operations on all columns, the sum would be the same.

But I can mix both types of operations.

Wait, but I have a limit of 2n operations. So, I can perform up to 2n operations in total.

I need to find a way to perform operations to maximize the sum, using at most 2n operations.

Let me think about the maximum possible sum.

If I could set each cell independently to n, that would be ideal, but I can't because operations set entire rows or columns.

So, what's the maximum sum achievable?

Let me consider that if I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 2n operations, which is within the limit.

But in this case, the last operation on each cell will determine its value.

So, if I do Type 1 on all rows and then Type 2 on all columns, each cell will be set by the last operation, which would be the Type 2 operation on its column.

Therefore, the sum would be the sum of all columns set to permutations, which is n * n*(n+1)/2 = n^2*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I do Type 1 on all rows and Type 2 on some columns, the cells in those columns will be set by the Type 2 operations, unless the row operation was performed after the column operation.

Wait, operations are performed in sequence, and the last operation on a cell determines its value.

So, perhaps I need to arrange the operations in such a way that the highest possible values are set in as many cells as possible.

Wait, maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider that each operation sets an entire row or column to a permutation of 1 to n.

The sum contributed by a row operation is the sum of the permutation, which is n*(n+1)/2.

Similarly for a column operation.

So, if I perform operations on all rows, sum is n * n*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, if I perform operations on all columns, sum is n * n*(n+1)/2.

But if I perform operations on both rows and columns, some cells will be overwritten.

Wait, perhaps there's a way to perform operations such that some cells are set by row operations and some by column operations, maximizing the total sum.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the maximum sum possible and then find a way to achieve it with at most 2n operations.

Let me consider that for each cell, the maximum value it can have is n.

But since operations set permutations, not all cells can be set to n.

In a permutation, values are from 1 to n, each appearing exactly once.

So, in a row or column set by an operation, the sum is fixed at n*(n+1)/2.

Therefore, the sum of the matrix is determined by which operations set which rows and columns, considering that later operations overwrite earlier ones.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of operations performed on rows and columns.

Suppose I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Each row operation sets a row to sum n*(n+1)/2.

Each column operation sets a column to sum n*(n+1)/2.

But where rows and columns intersect, the last operation performed will determine the value in that cell.

So, for cells where a row operation and a column operation are both performed, the value will be determined by the last operation.

To maximize the sum, I need to maximize the sum of the values set by the last operations.

This seems a bit tricky.

Let me consider a simpler approach.

Suppose I perform operations on all rows first.

This sets all rows to permutations, giving a sum of n * n*(n+1)/2.

Then, if I perform operations on some columns, I can overwrite the values in those columns.

But I need to decide which columns to operate on to maximize the sum.

Wait, maybe it's better to perform operations on rows and columns in a specific order.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mathematical formula to calculate the maximum sum.

Let me think about the maximum possible sum.

If I could set each cell to n, the sum would be n^2 * n = n^3.

But that's not possible because operations set permutations where the maximum value is n, but each permutation must include all numbers from 1 to n.

So, the sum of each permutation is fixed at n*(n+1)/2.

Therefore, the sum of the matrix is determined by how many cells are set by row operations and how many by column operations, considering the overwriting.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the number of row operations and column operations.

Suppose I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Then, the sum of the matrix would be k * n*(n+1)/2 + m * n*(n+1)/2 minus the sum of the cells that are overwritten by both operations.

But this seems complicated.

Let me consider the example provided.

In the second test case, n=2.

The maximum sum is 7, achieved with 3 operations.

Let me see:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1, set to [1,2]. Sum += 3.

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2, set to [1,2]. Sum += 3, total sum 6.

Operation 3: Type 2 on column 1, set to [1,2]. Now, column 1 is set to [1,2], overwriting the previous values in row 1 and row 2 for column 1.

So, cell (1,1) is now 1, cell (2,1) is 2.

Cell (1,2) is still 2 (from row 1 operation), cell (2,2) is still 2 (from row 2 operation).

So, total sum is 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7.

Indeed, the sum is 7.

Alternatively, if I perform operations only on rows:

Operation 1: Type 1 on row 1, set to [1,2]. Sum += 3.

Operation 2: Type 1 on row 2, set to [1,2]. Sum += 3.

Total sum is 6.

If I perform operations only on columns:

Operation 1: Type 2 on column 1, set to [1,2]. Sum += 3.

Operation 2: Type 2 on column 2, set to [1,2]. Sum += 3.

Total sum is 6.

But by performing one additional operation on column 1 again, I can increase the sum.

Wait, in the example, they performed 3 operations: two row operations and one column operation.

This suggests that performing operations on both rows and columns can lead to a higher sum.

Let me try to generalize this.

Suppose I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation.

This gives me a sum of n * n*(n+1)/2.

Then, I can perform operations on some columns to overwrite some cells with higher values.

But in the example, performing one column operation increased the sum from 6 to 7.

Is there a way to perform more column operations to increase the sum further?

Let's see.

If I perform operations on all rows and then operations on all columns, the sum would be n * n*(n+1)/2 + n * n*(n+1)/2 - the sum of the cells that are overwritten.

But in the example, n=2:

Sum from rows: 2 * 2*3/2 = 6.

Sum from columns: 2 * 2*3/2 = 6.

But the overwriting is such that the total sum is 7.

Wait, 6 + 6 - overwriting = 7 â‡’ overwriting = 5.

But how?

Wait, perhaps this is not the right approach.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform operations on k rows and m columns, with k + m <= 2n.

Then, the sum would be k * n*(n+1)/2 + m * n*(n+1)/2 - the sum of the cells that are overwritten.

But calculating the overwriting seems tricky.

An alternative idea: perhaps I can perform operations on rows and columns in such a way that minimizes the overwriting or maximizes the sum.

Wait, maybe there's a better way to think about this.

Let me consider that each operation on a row or column sets the entire row or column to a permutation.

The sum contributed by a row operation is n*(n+1)/2.

Similarly for a column.

But when both operations are performed on the same cell, the last operation overwrites the previous one.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that the overwriting results in higher values.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize setting higher values in cells that are overwritten.

But this seems vague.

Let me consider that in a permutation, the sum is fixed, so perhaps I need to maximize the number of cells set by operations that assign higher values.

But again, it's not clear.

Let me consider the maximum possible sum.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 2n operations.

In this case, the cells where rows and columns are both operated on will have their values set by the last operation.

To maximize the sum, perhaps I should arrange the operations such that the overwriting sets higher values.

Wait, maybe I can choose the permutations such that the overwriting increases the sum.

But I need to think more carefully.

Let me consider that for cells that are only set by a row operation or only by a column operation, their values are from the respective permutations.

For cells where both operations are performed, their values are from the last operation.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to maximize the sum from the row operations, the sum from the column operations, and manage the overwriting to maximize the sum.

This seems too vague.

Let me think about it differently.

Suppose I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation.

This gives me a sum of n * n*(n+1)/2.

Then, if I perform operations on some columns, I can overwrite some cells with higher values.

But in the example, performing one column operation increased the sum by 1.

Is there a pattern here?

Wait, in the example, n=2.

Sum from rows: 2 * 2*3/2 = 6.

Sum from columns: 2 * 2*3/2 = 6.

But when performing both, the total sum is 7.

So, there must be a way to calculate the maximum sum based on the number of row and column operations.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula for the maximum sum based on the number of row and column operations.

Let me try to derive such a formula.

Let k be the number of row operations, and m be the number of column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Then, the sum s = k * n*(n+1)/2 + m * n*(n+1)/2 - the sum of the cells that are overwritten.

The overwriting occurs in the cells where both a row operation and a column operation are performed.

For each cell that is overwritten, the value is set by the last operation.

Assuming that the last operation is a column operation, the value is from the column permutation.

Similarly, if the last operation is a row operation, the value is from the row permutation.

But since permutations have varying values, it's not straightforward to calculate the overwriting sum.

Perhaps I need to consider that the sum from row operations is k * n*(n+1)/2, and the sum from column operations is m * n*(n+1)/2, and the overwriting sum is the sum of the cells that are set by both operations.

But I need to find a way to maximize s = k * n*(n+1)/2 + m * n*(n+1)/2 - overwriting sum.

To maximize s, I need to maximize k and m, and minimize the overwriting sum.

Wait, but the overwriting sum depends on which cells are overwritten and which operations set their values.

This seems too complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation.

Then, perform operations on some columns.

Each column operation will set the entire column to a permutation, overwriting the values set by the row operations.

So, for each column operation performed, I overwrite n cells, setting them to a permutation sum of n*(n+1)/2.

But I need to consider what was the previous value in those cells.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the difference in sum when performing a column operation after row operations.

Let me consider that for a column that has been set by row operations, performing a column operation will change the values in that column to the new permutation.

So, the change in sum for that column would be the sum of the new permutation minus the sum of the previous values in that column.

But since the sum of the permutation is fixed, it's n*(n+1)/2.

Similarly, the sum of the previous values in the column depends on the row permutations.

This seems too involved.

Let me think about the maximum possible sum.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, that's 2n operations.

In this case, each cell is set by either the last row operation or the last column operation.

So, the sum would be the sum of the values set by the last operations.

To maximize this sum, I need to arrange the permutations such that higher values are set in as many cells as possible.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize setting higher values in the cells that are overwritten.

But I need a systematic way to do this.

Let me consider that performing operations on rows and columns in a certain order can lead to higher sums.

Suppose I perform all row operations first, setting each row to a permutation.

Then, perform column operations last, setting columns to permutations.

In this case, the cells in the columns that are operated on will have their values overwritten by the column operations.

So, the sum would be the sum from row operations plus the sum from column operations minus the sum of the cells that are overwritten.

But again, calculating this seems tricky.

An alternative idea: perhaps I can perform operations on rows and columns in such a way that minimizes the overwriting or maximizes the sum from overwriting.

Wait, maybe I can think in terms of the number of operations performed on rows and columns.

Suppose I perform k row operations and m column operations, with k + m <= 2n.

Then, the sum s = k * n*(n+1)/2 + m * n*(n+1)/2 - sum of overwriting.

But I need to find a way to maximize s.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that for each cell, if it's only set by a row operation, its value is from the row permutation.

If it's only set by a column operation, its value is from the column permutation.

If it's set by both, its value is from the last operation.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to arrange the operations such that as many cells as possible are set to higher values.

Wait, perhaps I can prioritize setting higher values in cells that are overwritten.

But I need a concrete plan.

Let me consider that in a permutation, the highest value is n, then n-1, and so on.

So, if I can arrange the permutations such that higher values are placed in cells that are overwritten, that might help.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation.

Then, perform operations on some columns, setting those columns to permutations.

In this case, the cells in the operated columns will have their values overwritten by the column operations.

So, to maximize the sum, I need to choose which columns to operate on such that the overwriting increases the sum as much as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the difference in sum for each column operation.

Let me consider that performing a column operation on a column that has lower values from the row operations can increase the sum more.

But I need to formalize this.

Let me consider that the sum from row operations is fixed.

Then, performing a column operation on a column will replace the values in that column with a permutation, which has a sum of n*(n+1)/2.

But the net change in sum would be n*(n+1)/2 minus the sum of the previous values in that column.

So, to maximize the total sum, I should choose to perform column operations on columns where the sum of the previous values is minimized.

In other words, perform column operations on columns that have lower sums from the row operations.

This way, the net increase in sum would be maximized.

Similarly, for row operations, if I perform them after column operations, I can choose to operate on rows that have lower sums from the column operations.

But in this problem, since operations are performed sequentially, and we can choose the order, perhaps I can arrange the operations to maximize the sum.

Wait, but in the example, performing operations on all rows and then on one column increases the sum by 1.

Let me see:

In n=2:

- Perform row 1: [1,2], sum += 3, total sum 3.

- Perform row 2: [1,2], sum += 3, total sum 6.

- Perform column 1: [1,2], overwriting cell (1,1) and (2,1), changing them from [1,1] to [1,2]. So, cell (1,1) was 1 and becomes 1 (no change), cell (2,1) was 1 and becomes 2 (increase by 1). So, total sum increases by 1 to 7.

So, by performing the column operation, I increased the sum by 1.

Is there a way to increase it more?

If I perform another column operation on column 2: [1,2], overwriting cell (1,2) and (2,2), changing them from [2,2] to [1,2]. So, cell (1,2) was 2 and becomes 1 (decrease by 1), cell (2,2) was 2 and becomes 2 (no change). So, total sum decreases by 1 to 6.

So, it's not beneficial.

Alternatively, if I perform another row operation on row 1: [1,2], overwriting cell (1,1) and (1,2), changing them from [1,1] to [1,2]. So, cell (1,1) was 1 and becomes 1 (no change), cell (1,2) was 2 and remains 2 (no change). So, no change in sum.

Alternatively, if I set row 1 to [2,1], then cell (1,1) was 1 and becomes 2 (increase by 1), cell (1,2) was 2 and becomes 1 (decrease by 1). So, total sum remains the same.

So, in this case, performing operations on both rows and columns can lead to a higher sum, but only up to a certain point.

So, perhaps the maximum sum is achieved by performing operations on all rows and some columns, choosing the columns that have the lowest sums from the row operations.

But I need a general formula.

Let me consider that performing operations on all rows gives a sum of n * n*(n+1)/2.

Then, performing operations on m columns will overwrite those columns, each adding n*(n+1)/2 - sum of the previous values in that column.

To maximize the total sum, I need to choose the columns with the lowest sum from the row operations.

But since the row operations set each row to a permutation, the sum per column from row operations is also n*(n+1)/2.

Wait, no.

Wait, if each row is set to a permutation, then the sum per column depends on which permutations are chosen for the rows.

Wait, but in the example, when all rows are set to [1,2], the sum per column is 1+1=2 for column 1 and 2+2=4 for column 2.

Then, performing a column operation on column 1, setting it to [1,2], changes the sum of column 1 to 1+2=3, which increases the total sum by 1.

Similarly, performing a column operation on column 2, setting it to [1,2], changes the sum of column 2 to 1+2=3, which decreases the total sum by 3.

So, in this case, it's better to perform column operations on columns with lower sums from the row operations.

So, perhaps in general, I should perform column operations on columns where the sum from row operations is less than n*(n+1)/2.

Wait, but in the example, the sum from row operations per column is 2 for column 1 and 4 for column 2.

Performing a column operation on column 1 increases the sum by 1 (from 2 to 3), while performing it on column 2 decreases the sum by 1 (from 4 to 3).

So, to maximize the sum, I should perform column operations on columns where the sum from row operations is less than n*(n+1)/2.

In this case, n=2, n*(n+1)/2 = 3.

So, column 1 has sum 2 < 3, so performing a column operation on it increases the sum to 3.

Column 2 has sum 4 > 3, so performing a column operation on it decreases the sum to 3.

Therefore, I should perform column operations only on columns where the sum from row operations is less than 3.

In this case, only column 1.

Hence, performing operations on all rows and on column 1 increases the sum to 7.

Is this general?

Let me see for n=3.

Suppose I perform operations on all rows, setting each row to [1,2,3], sum per row is 6, total sum is 18.

Then, consider the sum per column:

- Column 1: 1+1+1=3

- Column 2: 2+2+2=6

- Column 3: 3+3+3=9

Now, performing a column operation on column 1, setting it to [1,2,3], sum becomes 1+2+3=6, which increases the total sum by 3.

Performing a column operation on column 2, setting it to [1,2,3], sum becomes 1+2+3=6, which does not change the sum (was 6).

Performing a column operation on column 3, setting it to [1,2,3], sum becomes 1+2+3=6, which decreases the sum by 3.

So, to maximize the sum, I should perform column operations on columns where the sum from row operations is less than n*(n+1)/2 = 6.

In this case, only column 1, which has sum 3 < 6.

Performing a column operation on column 1 increases the sum to 18 + 3 = 21.

Performing operations on all rows and column 1: total operations 4 (<= 6=2n).

Is there a better way?

If I perform operations on all rows and columns, that's 6 operations.

In this case, the sum would be:

Sum from rows: 3 * 6 = 18

Sum from columns: 3 * 6 = 18

Overwriting: sum of cells set by both operations.

Each cell is set by both, so overwriting sum is sum of the column permutations.

But in this case, the total sum would be sum from columns, which is 18.

But if I perform operations only on rows and on columns where the row sum is less than 6, which is column 1, I get sum 21, which is better.

So, perhaps performing operations on all rows and on columns where the row sum is less than 6 is better.

Wait, I need to think in terms of column sums.

Wait, in the previous step, performing operations on all rows and on columns where the column sum from row operations is less than 6.

In this case, only column 1.

So, total operations: 3 (rows) + 1 (column) = 4 <= 6.

Sum: 21.

Is there a way to get higher sum?

If I perform operations on all rows and on columns where the column sum from row operations is less than 6.

In this case, column 1 sum is 3 < 6, so perform operation on column 1.

Sum increases by 3.

Total sum: 18 + 3 = 21.

If I perform operations on all rows and on columns where the column sum from row operations is less than or equal to 6.

In this case, column 1 and column 2.

Performing operation on column 1: sum increases by 3 to 21.

Performing operation on column 2: sum remains the same (since 6 == 6), so no change.

Total sum: 21.

If I perform operations on all rows and on all columns, sum would be 18 (from columns), since columns operations overwrite rows.

So, sum from columns: 3 * 6 = 18.

Which is less than 21.

Hence, performing operations on all rows and on columns where the column sum from row operations is less than 6 maximizes the sum.

So, generalizing:

- Perform operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation.

- Calculate the sum per column from the row operations.

- Perform operations on columns where the sum from row operations is less than n*(n+1)/2.

This seems to maximize the sum.

Now, I need to verify if this is indeed the optimal strategy.

Let me consider another example.

Suppose n=4.

Perform operations on all rows: sum = 4 * (4*5/2) = 4*10 = 40.

Sum per column from row operations: 1+1+1+1=4, 2+2+2+2=8, 3+3+3+3=12, 4+4+4+4=16.

n*(n+1)/2 = 10.

So, columns with sum less than 10 are column 1 (4 < 10) and column 2 (8 < 10).

So, perform operations on these two columns, setting them to [1,2,3,4], sum per column 10.

Increase in sum:

- Column 1: 10 - 4 = 6

- Column 2: 10 - 8 = 2

Total increase: 6 + 2 = 8.

Total sum: 40 + 8 = 48.

If I perform operations on all rows and all columns, sum would be sum from columns: 4*10 = 40.

Which is less than 48.

If I perform operations on all rows and on columns where sum from rows is less than or equal to 10.

In this case, column 1 and column 2.

Total operations: 4 (rows) + 2 (columns) = 6 <= 8=2n.

Sum: 40 + 6 + 2 = 48.

Is there a better way?

If I perform operations on all rows and on columns where sum from rows is less than 10, which is only column 1.

Then, increase in sum: 6.

Total sum: 40 + 6 = 46.

Which is less than 48.

Hence, performing operations on columns where sum from rows is less than or equal to n*(n+1)/2 maximizes the sum.

Wait, in this case, performing operations on columns where sum from rows is less than 10.

But in the previous n=3 example, performing operations on columns where sum from rows is less than 6.

Including equal or not?

Wait, in n=3, performing operations on columns where sum from rows is less than 6 increases the sum, while performing on columns where sum from rows is equal to 6 doesn't change the sum.

So, perhaps performing operations on columns where sum from rows is less than n*(n+1)/2 is better.

But in n=2 example, sum from rows per column is 2 and 4.

n*(n+1)/2=3.

So, perform operation on column 1 (sum=2 < 3), increasing sum by 1 to 7.

Not performing on column 2 (sum=4 > 3), as it would decrease the sum.

Hence, performing operations on columns where sum from rows is less than n*(n+1)/2 maximizes the sum.

So, general strategy:

- Perform operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation.

- Calculate the sum per column from the row operations.

- Perform operations on columns where the sum from row operations is less than n*(n+1)/2.

This seems to be a good strategy.

Now, in terms of implementation, I need to:

- Perform Type 1 operations on all rows.

- Calculate the sum per column.

- Identify columns where sum < n*(n+1)/2.

- Perform Type 2 operations on those columns.

This ensures that I'm maximizing the sum.

Also, I need to make sure that the total number of operations doesn't exceed 2n.

In this strategy, the number of operations is n (rows) + r (columns), where r is the number of columns where sum from rows is less than n*(n+1)/2.

Given that n can be up to 500, and t up to 500, with sum of n^2 <= 5e5, it's feasible.

Now, in the code provided, let's see what it's doing.

Looking at the code:

def func():

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

n = int(input())

(sum, r) = (0, 0)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:

r = i

sum += n * (n + 1) // 2

else:

sum += i * n

print(sum, n + r)

for j in range(1, n + r + 1):

if j <= n:

print(1, j, end=' ')

print(*range(1, n + 1))

else:

print(2, j % n, end=' ')

print(*range(1, n + 1))

So, for each test case:

- Read n.

- Initialize sum and r to 0.

- Loop from i=1 to n:

- If n*(n+1)//2 > i*n:

- Set r = i

- Add n*(n+1)//2 to sum

- Else:

- Add i*n to sum

- Print sum and m = n + r

- Loop from j=1 to n + r:

- If j <= n:

- Perform Type 1 operation on row j, with permutation 1 to n

- Else:

- Perform Type 2 operation on column j % n, with permutation 1 to n

So, it's performing n row operations and r column operations, where r is determined in the loop.

Wait, in the loop, r is being updated in each iteration, but only the last value matters since it's being set in each iteration.

Wait, no, in Python, the assignment inside the loop will overwrite r each time the condition is true.

So, at the end of the loop, r will be equal to the last i where n*(n+1)//2 > i*n.

Wait, for i from 1 to n:

- If n*(n+1)//2 > i*n, set r = i and add n*(n+1)//2 to sum

- Else, add i*n to sum

So, r will be the last i where n*(n+1)//2 > i*n.

Wait, for i from 1 to n:

- i*n is the sum if the row is set to [i,i,i,...,i]

- But in reality, rows are set to permutations, so sum is n*(n+1)/2 per row.

Wait, I think there's a confusion here.

Wait, no, in the code, sum is being accumulated based on whether n*(n+1)//2 > i*n.

But in reality, when setting a row to a permutation, the sum is always n*(n+1)/2.

So, perhaps the code is trying to calculate how many columns need to be operated on based on some condition.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to calculate r as the number of columns that need to be operated on additionally.

Let me see.

In the loop:

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:

r = i

sum += n * (n + 1) // 2

else:

sum += i * n

So, for each i from 1 to n:

- If n*(n+1)//2 > i*n, set r = i and add n*(n+1)//2 to sum

- Else, add i*n to sum

Wait, what's the logic behind this?

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to calculate the sum by considering that some rows are set to permutations (sum n*(n+1)/2) and some rows are set to [i,i,...,i], sum i*n.

But in the problem, operations set rows or columns to permutations, not to [i,i,...,i].

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Looking back, in the problem, operations set rows or columns to permutations, which are sequences containing each number from 1 to n exactly once.

So, the sum of each permutation is n*(n+1)/2.

Therefore, when setting a row to a permutation, the sum of that row becomes n*(n+1)/2.

Similarly for columns.

Hence, the sum contributed by row operations is k * n*(n+1)/2, where k is the number of row operations.

Similarly for column operations.

But in the code, it's adding n*(n+1)//2 or i*n to sum based on some condition.

This seems inconsistent with the problem's operations.

Wait, perhaps the code is trying to model the sum from row operations and column operations.

But in reality, when performing operations on rows and columns, the sum is determined by which operation last sets each cell.

So, the code's approach seems flawed.

Let me consider the correct approach based on my earlier reasoning.

Correct approach:

- Perform Type 1 operations on all rows, setting each row to a permutation (sum += n * n*(n+1)/2)

- Calculate the sum per column from the row operations.

- Identify columns where the sum from row operations is less than n*(n+1)/2.

- Perform Type 2 operations on those columns, setting them to a permutation (sum += n*(n+1)/2 - current column sum)

This way, the total sum is maximized.

In terms of implementation:

- Perform n Type 1 operations, setting each row to [1,2,3,...,n]

- Calculate the sum per column.

- For columns where sum < n*(n+1)/2, perform a Type 2 operation on that column, setting it to [1,2,3,...,n]

- The number of such columns is r.

- Total operations: n + r <= 2n

Now, in the code, it seems to be performing n row operations and r column operations, where r is determined in a loop.

But the way r is determined seems incorrect.

In the loop:

for i in range(1, n + 1):

if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:

r = i

sum += n * (n + 1) // 2

else:

sum += i * n

This seems to be adding n*(n+1)/2 when n*(n+1)/2 > i*n, and adding i*n otherwise.

But in reality, when setting a row to a permutation, the sum is always n*(n+1)/2, not i*n.

Hence, this seems incorrect.

Moreover, in the output, it performs n + r operations, where r is the last i where n*(n+1)/2 > i*n.

This doesn't align with the correct approach.

Hence, the given code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: **False**

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
