Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, we have an undirected weighted graph, and I need to find a simple cycle where the lightest edge is as minimal as possible. A simple cycle means no repeated vertices or edges in the cycle.

First, I need to understand what a cycle is in a graph. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex, and in an undirected graph, it's a bit simpler because edges don't have directions.

The problem says there are multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have the number of vertices (n) and the number of edges (m). Then, for each edge, I have the two vertices it connects and the weight of that edge.

I need to output, for each test case, the weight of the lightest edge in the found cycle and the number of vertices in that cycle, followed by the list of vertices in the cycle in traversal order.

Looking at the constraints, n can be up to a certain size, and m can be up to about 2*10^5 per the sum of all test cases. So, efficiency is probably important here.

Let me think about how to approach this.

One way to find cycles in a graph is to perform a traversal, like DFS or BFS, and look for back edges. A back edge in a DFS traversal indicates a cycle.

Since I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible, maybe I should look for cycles that include the smallest possible edge weights.

Wait, but it's not just about finding a cycle with the smallest lightest edge; it's about finding any simple cycle where the lightest edge is minimal across all possible simple cycles.

I think the key here is to find a cycle where the minimum edge weight is as small as possible.

One idea is to sort the edges by their weights and try to find cycles starting from the edges with the smallest weights.

But sorting edges by weight seems intuitive. If I sort the edges in ascending order of their weights, then the smallest weight in any cycle would be the smallest edge in that cycle.

Wait, but the problem has me sort the edges in descending order of their weights, based on the code provided. Hmm, that's interesting.

Let me look at the code provided.

It sets T, the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads n and m, then reads the edges.

It defines a Union-Find structure to keep track of connected components.

It sorts the edges in descending order of their weights, which is opposite of what I initially thought.

Then, it iterates through the edges from highest weight to lowest weight, and for each edge, it checks if the two vertices it connects are already in the same connected component.

If they are, that means adding this edge would create a cycle.

So, it keeps track of the weight of this edge and the vertices involved.

Then, it performs a DFS starting from one of these vertices to find the cycle.

Finally, it prints the weight and the cycle.

So, the approach seems to be:

1. Sort edges in descending order of their weights.

2. Use Union-Find to keep track of connected components.

3. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. If the two vertices are already in the same connected component, adding this edge would create a cycle.

b. Keep track of the weight of this edge and the vertices involved.

4. Use DFS to find the actual cycle.

5. Output the weight and the cycle.

Now, why sort in descending order?

Well, by sorting in descending order, you're considering the highest weight edges first.

When you find a cycle using the highest weight edges first, the smallest edge in that cycle would be relatively larger compared to cycles that include lower weight edges.

But the problem wants the smallest edge in the cycle to be as small as possible.

So, intuitively, it might make more sense to sort in ascending order, find cycles with smaller weights first, and select the one where the smallest edge is minimal.

But perhaps there's a different reasoning here.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort the edges in descending order and build a forest using Union-Find.

When I find an edge that connects two vertices already in the same connected component, that edge would form a cycle.

Among all such cycles found this way, the weight of the edge that causes the cycle would be part of that cycle.

But since I'm sorting in descending order, the first cycle I find would be composed of higher-weight edges.

But the problem wants the cycle with the smallest possible smallest edge.

So, maybe this approach isn't directly giving me what I need.

Wait, perhaps the minimal weight in the cycle is minimized by considering the cycles formed by adding the lowest weight edges last.

In other words, by sorting edges in descending order and finding cycles formed by adding higher weight edges, I can keep track of the minimal smallest edge in those cycles.

But I'm getting confused.

Let me consider an alternative approach.

What if I sort the edges in ascending order of their weights?

Then, I can build a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Krusky's algorithm, for example.

In the MST, there are no cycles.

Now, if I take an edge not in the MST and add it, it would create a cycle.

Among all such cycles, I need to find the one where the smallest edge is minimal.

Wait, that sounds promising.

So, build the MST, then consider edges not in the MST, and for each such edge, find the cycle formed by adding it to the MST.

Then, among these cycles, find the one where the smallest edge is minimal.

But perhaps that's more complicated than necessary.

Looking back at the provided code, it sorts edges in descending order and uses Union-Find to detect cycles.

It keeps track of the weight of the edge that forms a cycle and finds the cycle using DFS.

But I'm not sure if this guarantees that the smallest edge in the cycle is minimized.

Let me consider an example.

Suppose I have a graph with edges:

1-2: weight 1

2-3: weight 2

3-1: weight 3

Sorting edges in descending order: 3-1, 2-3, 1-2.

Start with Union-Find, all vertices in separate sets.

First edge: 3-1, unite 3 and 1.

Second edge: 2-3, unite 2 and 3.

Third edge: 1-2, both already in the same set, so adding this would form a cycle.

The weight of this edge is 1, which is the smallest in this cycle: 1-2 (1), 2-3 (2), 3-1 (3).

So, the smallest edge in this cycle is 1.

But is this the minimal possible?

In this case, yes, because 1 is the smallest weight.

Another example:

1-2: 1

2-3: 1

3-1: 2

Sorting: 3-1, 1-2, 2-3.

First edge: 3-1, unite 3 and 1.

Second edge: 1-2, unite 1 and 2.

Third edge: 2-3, both in same set, so cycle: 2-3,2-1,1-3.

Weights: 1,1,2. Smallest is 1.

But in this case, there is another cycle: 1-2-3-1, with smallest edge 1.

So, it seems okay.

But let's consider another case.

1-2:1

2-3:2

3-4:3

4-1:4

1-3:5

Sorting: 4-1,3-4,2-3,1-2,1-3.

Start with Union-Find:

Add 4-1, unite 4 and 1.

Add 3-4, unite 3 and 4.

Add 2-3, unite 2 and 3.

Add 1-2, both in same set, so cycle: 1-2,2-3,3-4,4-1.

Smallest edge in cycle:1.

But there is another cycle:1-2-3-1, with smallest edge:1.

But according to the approach, it would pick the cycle found by the first back edge, which is the larger cycle.

But in this case, both have the same smallest edge.

So, it's still correct.

Another example:

1-2:1

2-3:2

3-1:3

1-4:4

4-2:5

Sorting:4-2,3-1,2-3,1-4,1-2.

Add 4-2, unite 4 and 2.

Add 3-1, unite 3 and 1.

Add 2-3, unite 2 and 3.

Add 1-4, already connected, so cycle:1-4,4-2,2-3,3-1.

Smallest edge:1.

Alternatively, cycle 1-2-3-1 with smallest edge 1.

Again, same smallest edge.

Seems okay.

But let's consider a case where sorting in descending order might not pick the minimal smallest edge.

Suppose:

1-2:1

2-3:1

3-1:2

1-4:3

4-2:4

Sorting:4-2,3-1,1-4,2-3,1-2.

Add 4-2, unite 4 and 2.

Add 3-1, unite 3 and 1.

Add 1-4, unite 1 and 4.

Add 2-3, already connected, so cycle:2-3,2-4,4-1,1-3.

Smallest edge:1.

Alternatively, cycle 1-2-3-1 with smallest edge:1.

Again, same.

It's hard to find a case where this approach fails.

Maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps sorting in ascending order would be better.

Let's try sorting in ascending order and see.

Take the previous example:

Sort:1-2,2-3,3-1,1-4,4-2.

Add 1-2, unite 1 and 2.

Add 2-3, unite 2 and 3.

Add 3-1, already connected, so cycle:1-2-3-1.

Smallest edge:1.

Same as before.

Another example:

1-2:1

2-3:2

3-4:3

4-1:4

1-3:5

Sort:1-2,2-3,3-4,4-1,1-3.

Add 1-2, unite 1 and 2.

Add 2-3, unite 2 and 3.

Add 3-4, unite 3 and 4.

Add 4-1, already connected, so cycle:1-2-3-4-1.

Smallest edge:1.

Same as before.

Seems no difference.

So, perhaps sorting in descending order is acceptable, as long as I keep track of the smallest edge in the cycles found.

But why sort in descending order?

Maybe to find heavier cycles first, but in the end, I'm interested in the smallest edge in the cycle, regardless of other edges' weights.

Wait, perhaps sorting in descending order helps in some way, but I'm not sure.

Looking back at the code, it sorts edges in descending order of their weights, then iterates through them, uniting vertices that are not yet connected.

When it finds an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it means adding this edge would create a cycle.

It keeps track of the weight of this edge and the vertices involved.

Then, it performs a DFS to find the actual cycle.

But in the cycle, the smallest edge might not necessarily be this edge; it could be any edge in the cycle.

So, to find the minimal smallest edge, I need to consider the smallest edge in each cycle found this way and keep track of the minimum among them.

In the code, it seems to just take the weight of the edge that causes the cycle and assumes it's the smallest in the cycle, but that might not be the case.

Wait, no. In the cycle, the smallest edge could be any edge in the cycle, not necessarily the one that caused the cycle.

In the code, it sets ans to the minimum of ans and c (the weight of the edge that causes the cycle), but that might not be the smallest edge in the cycle.

For example, consider:

1-2:1

2-3:2

3-1:3

Here, adding 1-2, then 2-3, then 3-1 causes a cycle, and the smallest edge in the cycle is 1, which is c in this case.

But consider:

1-2:2

2-3:1

3-1:3

Sort:3-1,2-3,1-2.

Add 3-1, then 2-3, then 1-2.

When adding 1-2, it forms a cycle:1-2,2-3,3-1.

The smallest edge in the cycle is 1 (edge 2-3), but c is 2 (edge 1-2).

So, in this case, ans would be min(ans, c) = min(inf,2), but the actual smallest edge in the cycle is 1.

So, the code would output 2, but the correct answer should be 1.

Wait, but according to the problem, I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be minimal across all cycles.

So, in this case, the correct answer should be 1, but the code would output 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Wait, but in the example I just thought of, the code would set ans = min(ans, c) = min(inf,2) = 2, but in reality, in the cycle, there's an edge with weight 1.

So, it's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I'm thinking about this.

In the code, it sets ans = min(ans, c), where c is the weight of the edge that causes the cycle.

But in the cycle, there might be edges with smaller weights.

So, to fix this, perhaps when a cycle is found, I need to find the smallest edge in that cycle and keep track of that.

Then, among all such cycles, find the one with the smallest smallest edge.

So, in the example above, when the cycle is found, I need to look at all edges in the cycle and find the smallest one, which is 1, and set ans to min(ans, that smallest edge).

In the code, it seems to only consider c, which is the weight of the edge that causes the cycle, but not necessarily the smallest in the cycle.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

So, to fix this, I need to modify the code to find the actual smallest edge in the cycle when a cycle is found.

How can I do that?

One way is, when a cycle is found, to perform a DFS to find the cycle and then find the smallest edge in that cycle.

In the code, it already performs a DFS to find the cycle, so perhaps I can modify it to find the smallest edge in that cycle.

Then, keep track of the cycle with the smallest smallest edge.

But this might be inefficient if done for every cycle found.

Given the constraints, efficiency is important.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach this problem.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

Then, I can iterate through the edges, and for each edge, check if adding it would create a cycle where this edge is the smallest in the cycle.

If so, keep track of that cycle.

But I need to ensure that the cycle found in this way has the smallest possible smallest edge.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that if I have a set of edges that form a cycle, and I sort them by their weights, the smallest edge in the cycle is the minimal one in that cycle.

So, to find the cycle with the minimal smallest edge, I can iterate through the edges in ascending order and keep track of the connected components.

When I add an edge that connects two vertices already in the same component, it forms a cycle.

In that cycle, the smallest edge would be the smallest among all edges in the cycle.

But to efficiently find the smallest edge in the cycle, I need a way to identify the cycle and find its smallest edge.

This seems a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Union-Find structure with rank or size to keep track of the minimal smallest edge in the cycles.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: for each edge, find if it is part of a cycle, and among all such cycles, find the one with the smallest smallest edge.

But this seems too slow.

Wait, perhaps I can use the Union-Find structure to keep track of the minimal smallest edge in the cycles.

Let me think about this.

If I sort the edges in ascending order and build a spanning forest, when I find an edge that would create a cycle, that edge together with the path in the forest between the two vertices forms a cycle.

In that cycle, the smallest edge is the minimal among all edges in the cycle.

So, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal smallest edge in such cycles.

But I need to find the actual cycle and find its smallest edge.

This seems a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can modify the Union-Find structure to keep track of the minimal edge in the cycles.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider the following approach:

1. Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

2. Initialize a Union-Find structure.

3. Iterate through the edges in order:

a. If the two vertices are already connected, then adding this edge would create a cycle.

b. The cycle would consist of the path between the two vertices in the current forest plus this edge.

c. Among these edges, find the smallest one.

d. Keep track of the cycle with the smallest smallest edge.

4. Output the cycle with the smallest smallest edge.

This seems correct, but I need to implement it efficiently.

Given that m can be up to 2*10^5, I need an efficient implementation.

In the code provided, it sorts edges in descending order, which might not be the best approach.

I think sorting in ascending order would be better.

Let me try to implement this approach.

First, sort edges in ascending order.

Then, initialize Union-Find.

Initialize variables to keep track of the minimal smallest edge and the corresponding cycle.

Then, iterate through the sorted edges:

if the two vertices are already connected:

find the path between them in the Union-Find tree.

collect all edges in this path.

add the current edge to form the cycle.

find the smallest edge in this cycle.

if this smallest edge is smaller than the current minimal, update the minimal and remember this cycle.

else:

unite the two vertices.

This seems correct, but finding the path between two vertices in Union-Find is not straightforward.

Union-Find typically doesn't store the actual path.

To find the path, I might need to keep parent pointers or something similar.

This could complicate the implementation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can keep track of the minimal smallest edge in a different way.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the smallest edge in any cycle must be among the edges that are not in the MST.

Wait, no, edges in the MST don't form cycles.

Wait, perhaps I need to find cycles that include edges not in the MST.

This is getting complicated.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I fix a vertex as the root and perform a BFS or DFS from that root, keeping track of the minimal incoming edge for each vertex.

Then, for each back edge, I can find a cycle and determine its smallest edge.

But this seems too time-consuming for the given constraints.

Another idea: for each edge, check if it is part of a cycle by checking if the two vertices are connected in the graph without that edge.

If they are connected, then the edge forms a cycle with the path connecting them.

Then, find the smallest edge in that cycle.

But this is also inefficient.

I need a more efficient way.

Let me look back at the initial code.

In the initial code, it sorts edges in descending order, finds cycles by detecting when two vertices are already connected, and keeps track of the weight of the edge that causes the cycle.

Then, it performs a DFS to find the actual cycle and outputs it.

But, as I saw in my earlier example, this might not correctly find the cycle with the minimal smallest edge.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

To fix this, I need to modify the code to correctly find the cycle with the minimal smallest edge.

One way is to sort edges in ascending order, build a spanning tree, and when a cycle is found, find the smallest edge in that cycle.

But implementing this efficiently might be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate through edges in ascending order of their weights and keep track of the minimal smallest edge in any cycle.

When I find a cycle, I can find the smallest edge in that cycle and keep track of the minimal one.

But again, finding the smallest edge in the cycle efficiently is tricky.

Let me consider the following optimized approach:

1. Sort all edges in ascending order of their weights.

2. Initialize a Union-Find structure.

3. Initialize variables to keep track of the minimal smallest edge and the corresponding cycle.

4. Iterate through the sorted edges:

a. If the two vertices are already connected:

i. Find the path between them in the Union-Find tree.

ii. Collect all edges along this path.

iii. Add the current edge to form the cycle.

iv. Find the smallest edge in this cycle.

v. If this smallest edge is smaller than the current minimal, update the minimal and remember this cycle.

b. Else:

i. Unite the two vertices.

5. Output the cycle with the smallest smallest edge.

To implement step 4a efficiently, I need a way to find the path between two vertices in the Union-Find tree.

One way is to keep parent pointers during the union operations.

By keeping parent pointers, I can reconstruct the path when needed.

This would allow me to find the cycle and determine its smallest edge.

This seems feasible.

Let me try to sketch this in code.

Define the Union-Find structure with parent pointers.

When uniting two sets, record the parent of one set as the other.

Then, when two vertices are in the same set, I can traverse the parent pointers from one vertex to the root, and from the other vertex to the root, find the intersection point, and thus find the cycle.

This sounds workable.

But implementing this correctly and efficiently within the time constraints is challenging.

Given the time constraints, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Let me consider that in any cycle, the smallest edge is the minimal among all edges in the cycle.

So, to find the cycle with the minimal smallest edge, I need to find the cycle where the smallest edge is as small as possible.

This suggests that I should look for cycles that include the smallest edges.

Perhaps I can iterate through the edges in ascending order and keep track of the connected components, and when I find a cycle, check its smallest edge.

But I need to ensure that I'm finding the cycle with the smallest possible smallest edge.

Wait, maybe I can use the fact that if I have a set of edges that form a cycle, the smallest edge in that cycle is the minimal one.

So, to find the cycle with the minimal smallest edge, I can look for cycles that include the smallest edges.

Perhaps I can iterate through the edges in ascending order and maintain a list of edges in the current MST.

When I find an edge that would create a cycle, I can find the smallest edge in that cycle and keep track of the minimal one.

But again, finding the smallest edge in the cycle efficiently is tricky.

Maybe I need to accept that the initial approach, although incorrect in theory, might still work correctly in practice due to some properties I'm missing.

Looking back at the initial code, it sorts edges in descending order, finds cycles by detecting when two vertices are already connected, and keeps track of the weight of the edge that causes the cycle.

Then, it performs a DFS to find the actual cycle.

In my earlier example, even though the code sets ans to the weight of the edge that causes the cycle, which might not be the smallest in the cycle, the actual cycle found might have a smaller edge.

But in the code, it doesn't seem to check for the smallest edge in the cycle; it just uses the weight of the edge that causes the cycle.

This suggests that the code might be incorrect.

However, in the problem's example, the output seems correct.

Let me check the first test case in the example:

6 6

1 2 1

2 3 1

3 1 1

4 5 1

5 6 1

6 4 1

In this case, all edges have weight 1, so the minimal smallest edge is 1.

The code would sort edges in descending order (all 1), iterate through them, and find cycles where the edge causing the cycle has weight 1.

So, it should be correct in this case.

Second test case:

6 6

1 2 10

2 3 8

3 1 5

4 5 100

5 6 40

6 4 3

Sort edges in descending order: 1-2:10, 2-3:8, 3-1:5, 4-5:100, 5-6:40, 6-4:3.

Iterate:

Add 1-2:10, unite 1 and 2.

Add 2-3:8, unite 2 and 3.

Add 3-1:5, already connected, so cycle:1-2-3-1, smallest edge is 5.

Set ans=5.

Add 4-5:100, unite 4 and 5.

Add 5-6:40, unite 5 and 6.

Add 6-4:3, already connected, so cycle:4-5-6-4, smallest edge is 3.

Set ans=3.

So, ans=3, which matches the expected output.

But according to my earlier concern, ans should be the smallest edge in any cycle found, which in this case is correct.

Wait, but in this case, the cycle 1-2-3-1 has smallest edge 5, and the cycle 4-5-6-4 has smallest edge 3.

So, ans is set to 3, which is correct.

But according to the code, it sets ans to the weight of the edge that causes the cycle, which is 3 in this case.

But in the first cycle found, it was set to 5.

So, it seems that in this case, it correctly finds the minimal smallest edge.

Another test case:

6 15 with various edges.

It's time-consuming to simulate the entire process, but assuming the code works correctly in the example, perhaps there's something I'm missing in understanding why it works.

Wait, perhaps when sorting in descending order and finding cycles with higher-weight edges, the smallest edge in those cycles is still being tracked correctly.

But in my earlier example where sorting in descending order seemed to set ans to the weight of the edge causing the cycle, which might not be the smallest in the cycle, but in practice, it seems to work.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Perhaps in any cycle found this way, the smallest edge in the cycle is at least as large as the weight of the edge causing the cycle.

Wait, no.

In the example I thought earlier, where edges are 1-2:2, 2-3:1, 3-1:3, sorting in descending order:3-1:3,2-3:1,1-2:2.

Iterate:

Add 3-1:3, unite 3 and 1.

Add 2-3:1, unite 2 and 3.

Add 1-2:2, already connected, so cycle:1-2-3-1, smallest edge is 1, which is less than the edge causing the cycle (2).

So, in this case, ans would be set to min(ans,2), but the smallest edge in the cycle is 1.

So, ans should be 1, but according to the code, it would set ans to 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but according to the problem, I need the lightest edge in the cycle to be minimal across all cycles.

So, in this case, the correct answer should be 1, but the code would output 2.

Hence, the code is incorrect.

Therefore, the answer is **False**.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find a simple cycle in a given undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge is minimized. The provided code attempts to solve this problem but contains some logical errors that can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios. Below is a corrected version of the code along with an explanation of the changes made.

### Approach

1. **Sort Edges by Weight**: Sort the edges in ascending order of their weights. This helps in ensuring that we consider the smallest possible weights first.
2. **Union-Find Data Structure**: Use Union-Find to detect cycles. When adding an edge that connects two vertices already in the same connected component, a cycle is formed.
3. **Track the Smallest Edge in the Cycle**: When a cycle is detected, find the smallest edge in that cycle and keep track of the cycle with the smallest such edge.

### Explanation

1. **Sorting Edges**: By sorting edges in ascending order, we ensure that we consider smaller weights first, which helps in minimizing the lightest edge in the cycle.
2. **Union-Find Operations**: We use Union-Find to keep track of connected components. When adding an edge between two vertices already in the same component, a cycle is formed.
3. **Finding the Cycle**: When a cycle is detected, we perform a DFS to find the path between the two vertices, forming the cycle. We then find the smallest edge in this cycle and keep track of the cycle with the smallest such edge.
4. **Output**: For each test case, output the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the cycle vertices in order.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify a cycle with the minimal lightest edge, addressing the issues present in the original code.
