Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked. I'm given an array of integers and a set of queries. Each query specifies a range within the array, and I need to find two indices within that range such that the elements at those indices are different. If such a pair doesn't exist, I should return -1 -1.

First, I need to process multiple test cases, and for each test case, I have an array and several queries to answer. The constraints are quite large: n can be up to 2*10^5, and q up to 2*10^5 per test case, with t test cases up to 10^4, but the sum of n and q across all test cases is limited to 2*10^5.

This means that the total time complexity should be O(n + q), or at least close to linear, to handle the input size within reasonable time limits.

Looking at the provided program, it seems to attempt solving this problem. Let's try to understand what the code is doing.

In the main part, it reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, calls func_1(). So, func_1() seems to handle each test case individually.

Inside func_1():

- It reads the input for n, the array nums, and q.

- It initializes some variables: s and e to 0, num to the first element of nums.

- It appends -1 to nums, which might be a sentinel value to handle the last group.

- It creates an array arr by iterating through nums and recording ranges where elements are the same.

Specifically, it uses bisect_left to find the position where l fits in arr, which seems to be a list of tuples representing the start and end of ranges where elements are equal.

Then, for each query, it tries to determine if there are different elements within the specified range.

I need to verify if this approach correctly identifies pairs of indices with different values within the given ranges.

Let me think about a simpler approach first to compare.

A straightforward way is, for each query, to iterate through the specified range and find the first two elements that are different. But this would be O(q * n), which is too slow for the given constraints.

A better approach is to preprocess the array to quickly determine if there are distinct elements in any given range.

One efficient way is to use a prefix sum array to count the frequency of each element up to each index. Then, for each query, we can check if the number of distinct elements in the range is more than one.

If there are more than one distinct elements, we can pick any two indices with different values. If there's only one distinct element, then all elements in the range are the same, and we should return -1 -1.

However, since the elements can be up to 10^6, storing a frequency array for each element up to each index might not be efficient in terms of space and time.

An alternative is to find, for each position, the next position where the element changes. This way, we can determine if there are at least two different elements in the range by checking if there's a change within the range.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to be attempting something similar.

It's grouping consecutive equal elements and storing the start and end positions of these groups in arr.

Then, for each query, it's using bisect_left to find where the query's l falls in arr and then deciding based on the start and end positions whether there are different elements in the range.

I need to verify if this logic correctly handles all cases.

Let's consider some examples.

Example 1:

n = 5

nums = [1, 1, 2, 1, 1]

q = 3

queries:

1 5 → should return any pair where a_i ≠ a_j, e.g., 1 and 3

1 2 → both elements are 1, so -1 -1

1 3 → elements 1,1,2 → indices 1 and 3

This seems correct as per the sample input.

Example 2:

n = 6

nums = [30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]

q = 5

queries:

1 2 → indices 1 (30) and 2 (20) → different

2 3 → indices 2 (20) and 3 (20) → same

2 4 → indices 2 (20) and 4 (10) → different

2 6 → indices 2 (20), 3 (20), 4 (10), 5 (10), 6 (20) → different

3 5 → indices 3 (20), 4 (10), 5 (10) → different

This also seems correctly handled in the sample output.

Now, looking back at the code:

- It groups consecutive equal elements.

- For each query, it uses bisect_left to find the group that l falls into.

- Then, it checks conditions based on the group's start and end positions to decide whether to return a pair or -1 -1.

I need to ensure that this logic covers all edge cases.

Potential edge cases:

- All elements in the array are the same.

- All elements are unique.

- Queries that span the entire array.

- Queries with l = r (though l ≤ r and l < r as per the problem, but need to confirm if l can be equal to r.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n, and l ≤ i ≤ r and l ≤ j ≤ r, with i and j being any indices in the range, possibly the same, but a_i ≠ a_j.

But in the sample input, l < r, so perhaps there's a mistake in my earlier assumption.

Looking back: "Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)."

But in the sample input, l < r, but the problem allows l = r.

Wait, in the first sample input, l = r in some queries? Wait, no, in the first test case, queries are 1 5, 1 2, 1 3, which all have l < r.

Wait, the problem says: "Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)."

And "find two indices i and j (or determine that they do not exist) such that:

- l ≤ i ≤ r;

- l ≤ j ≤ r;

- a_i ≠ a_j."

So, l and r can be equal.

But in the sample inputs, l < r.

I need to consider the case when l = r.

If l = r, then i and j must both be l, and a_i ≠ a_j, which is impossible since they are the same element. So, in this case, we should always return -1 -1.

Wait, but the problem says "two indices i and j", which could imply i ≠ j, but it's not explicitly stated. It just says "two indices i and j such that a_i ≠ a_j".

So, if l = r, and we have only one index, and a_i ≠ a_j cannot hold since i = j, so we should return -1 -1.

But in the problem statement, it's given that l ≤ r, and in the sample inputs, l < r.

I need to confirm if l can be equal to r.

Looking back: "Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n)."

And "find two indices i and j (or determine that they do not exist) such that:

- l ≤ i ≤ r;

- l ≤ j ≤ r;

- a_i ≠ a_j."

It doesn't explicitly say i ≠ j, but it's implied that i and j are two different indices.

Wait, the problem says "two indices i and j", but doesn't specify if they can be equal or not.

In programming problems, unless specified otherwise, indices can be the same unless stated otherwise.

But in this case, if i and j are the same, a_i cannot be unequal to itself, so effectively, we need to find two different indices with different values.

So, when l = r, it's impossible to have two different indices, so we should return -1 -1.

But in the sample inputs, l < r, so perhaps the code handles l = r correctly by default.

Looking back at the code:

In func_1(), it reads q and then processes q queries.

In the query processing loop:

(l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))

Then, it uses bisect_left to find eli, the position in arr where (l, 0, 0) should be inserted to keep arr sorted.

Then, it gets (s, e, _) = arr[min(eli, LA)], where LA is len(arr) - 1.

Then, it has several conditions:

- if s > l:

- if s == 1 or s > r:

print(-1, -1)

else:

print(s - 1, s)

- elif e >= r:

print(-1, -1)

- elif e < N or e < l:

print(s, e + 1)

- else:

print(-1, -1)

This seems convoluted. I need to understand what's happening here.

Maybe I should think of a different approach.

An efficient way is to preprocess for each position the next position where the element changes.

Then, for each query [l, r], check if there is a position between l and r where the element changes. If there is, then there are two different elements; otherwise, all elements are the same.

To implement this:

- Create an array next_diff, where next_diff[i] is the smallest j > i such that a[j] != a[i], or n if no such j exists.

- Then, for a query [l, r], if next_diff[l - 1] <= r, then there is a different element in the range, else all elements are the same.

- To answer the query, if next_diff[l - 1] <= r, pick i = l and j = next_diff[l - 1].

- Else, return -1 -1.

This would be O(n + q) time, which is efficient.

Now, looking back at the provided code, it seems to be trying to group consecutive equal elements and then use binary search to find the group that l falls into.

But the logic seems complicated and error-prone.

I need to verify if the provided code correctly handles all cases.

Let me consider a simple test case.

Test case 1:

n = 3

nums = [1, 2, 3]

q = 3

queries:

1 1 → should return -1 -1

1 2 → should return 1 2

1 3 → should return 1 2 or 1 3 or 2 3

According to the code:

It groups the array:

arr = [(1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,3)]

For query 1 1:

l = 1, r = 1

eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) → eli = 0

(s, e, _) = arr[0] = (1,1,1)

since s = 1 <= l = 1, and e >= r = 1, it should print -1 -1

Correct.

For query 1 2:

l = 1, r = 2

eli = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,1,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 1 < r = 2

then, e < N = 3, so print(s, e + 1) = 1 2

Correct.

For query 1 3:

l = 1, r = 3

eli = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,1,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 1 < r = 3

e < N = 3, so print(s, e + 1) = 1 2

Correct.

Another test case:

n = 4

nums = [1,1,1,1]

q = 3

queries:

1 2 → should return -1 -1

1 3 → should return -1 -1

1 4 → should return -1 -1

According to the code:

arr = [(1,4,1)]

For query 1 2:

l = 1, r = 2

eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,4,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 4 >= r = 2, so print -1 -1

Correct.

Similarly, for other queries, it should correctly return -1 -1.

Another test case:

n = 4

nums = [1,2,1,2]

q = 3

queries:

1 2 → should return 1 2

1 3 → should return 1 2 or 1 3

2 4 → should return 2 3 or 2 4

According to the code:

arr = [(1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,1), (4,4,2)]

For query 1 2:

l = 1, r = 2

eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,1,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 1 < r = 2

e < N = 4, so print(s, e + 1) = 1 2

Correct.

For query 1 3:

l = 1, r = 3

eli = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,1,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 1 < r = 3

e < N = 4, so print(s, e + 1) = 1 2

Correct.

For query 2 4:

l = 2, r = 4

eli = bisect_left(arr, (2,0,0)) = 1

(s, e, _) = (2,2,2)

s = 2 <= l = 2, e = 2 < r = 4

e < N = 4, so print(s, e + 1) = 2 3

Correct.

Seems okay.

But I need to think about edge cases.

Edge case 1:

n = 2

nums = [1,2]

q = 1

query: 1 1 → should return -1 -1

According to the code:

arr = [(1,1,1), (2,2,2)]

For query 1 1:

l = 1, r = 1

eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,1,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 1 >= r = 1, so print -1 -1

Correct.

Edge case 2:

n = 2

nums = [1,1]

q = 1

query: 1 2 → should return -1 -1

According to the code:

arr = [(1,2,1)]

For query 1 2:

l = 1, r = 2

eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,2,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 2 >= r = 2, so print -1 -1

Correct.

Edge case 3:

n = 3

nums = [1,2,1]

q = 1

query: 1 3 → should return 1 2 or 1 3 or 2 3

According to the code:

arr = [(1,1,1), (2,2,2), (3,3,1)]

For query 1 3:

l = 1, r = 3

eli = bisect_left(arr, (1,0,0)) = 0

(s, e, _) = (1,1,1)

s = 1 <= l = 1, e = 1 < r = 3, e < N = 3, so print(s, e + 1) = 1 2

Correct.

Another edge case:

n = 1

nums = [1]

q = 1

query: 1 1 → should return -1 -1

But according to the problem, l and r are between 1 and n, and n >=2 in the problem statement, but in reality, n >=1 might be possible, but per problem, n >=2.

Wait, the problem says 2 <= n <= 2e5, so n >=2.

So, n=1 is not possible, but in the code, it appends -1 to nums, which might cause issues if n=1, but since n >=2, it's fine.

Another consideration: when l=1 and s=1, and e < r, it prints s and e+1, which is correct.

When s > l, it prints s-1 and s, which seems correct if s > l and s <= r.

Wait, in the code, if s > l:

if s ==1 or s > r:

print(-1 -1)

else:

print(s-1, s)

But s > l and s ==1 is impossible since s >=1 and l >=1, so s ==1 and s > l=1 is s=1 > l=1, which is false.

So, perhaps there's a mistake here.

Wait, s is the start of a group, and it's >=1.

If s > l, it means that the group starts after l, so the element before s is different from the element at s.

So, it prints s-1 and s, assuming that a[s-1] != a[s].

But, if s > r, it means that the group starts after r, so there are no different elements in the range, hence -1 -1.

Otherwise, print s-1 and s.

This seems correct.

Another consideration: when e >= r, print -1 -1, meaning that within the range [l, r], all elements are the same.

Else, if e < r, then there must be a different element at e+1, assuming e+1 <= r.

So, the code seems to handle this correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the provided program correctly solves the problem as per the given specifications and sample inputs.

Correctness: **True**
