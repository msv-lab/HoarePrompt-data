Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's understand what's being asked here. So, Polycarp has lost a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, but he has its "trace." The trace is an array `a` of `n` integers, where each `a_i` represents the number of indices `j` (with `j < i`) such that `s_i` equals `s_j`. Essentially, `a_i` tells us how many times the character at position `i` has appeared before it in the string.

For example, given the string "abracadabra", its trace is `[0,0,0,1,0,2,0,3,1,1,4]`. Let's see why:

- The first 'a' has no previous 'a's, so 0.

- The first 'b' has no previous 'b's, so 0.

- The first 'r' has no previous 'r's, so 0.

- The second 'a' has one previous 'a', so 1.

- And so on.

Given this trace, I need to reconstruct any string `s` that could have produced this trace. The problem guarantees that a valid string exists for the given trace.

Input:

- The first line contains `t`, the number of test cases.

- For each test case:

- The first line contains `n`, the length of the string.

- The second line contains `n` integers representing the trace `a`.

Output:

- For each test case, output a string `s` that corresponds to the given trace.

Constraints:

- `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5`

- `0 ≤ a_i < n`

- Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2*10^5`.

- It's guaranteed that a valid string exists for the given trace.

Example:

Input:

5

11

0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4

10

0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0

1

0

8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

8

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

Output:

abracadabra

codeforces

a

aaaaaaa

dijkstra

Approach:

To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct the original string from its trace. The trace provides information about how many times each character has appeared before its current position. We can use this information to determine which character should be placed at each position in the string.

### Approach Explanation

1. **Understanding the Trace**:
   - The trace array `a` for a string `s` indicates, for each character in `s`, how many times that specific character has appeared before the current position.
   - For example, in the string "abracadabra", the trace is `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`. Here, the first 'a' has 0 occurrences before it, the fourth character 'a' has 1 'a' before it, and so on.

2. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - We need to assign characters to positions in the string based on the trace values.
   - To ensure that characters are assigned correctly according to their frequencies, we can use an array to keep track of the frequency counts for each possible character (from 'a' to 'z').

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case:
     - Read the length of the string `n`.
     - Read the trace array `a`.
     - Initialize an array `s` of size 26 (for each letter from 'a' to 'z'), each element representing the current frequency count of that character.
     - Iterate through the trace array:
       - For each position `i`, find the character whose current frequency count matches `a_i`.
       - Assign that character to the position in the result string.
       - Increment the frequency count for that character.
     - Print the constructed string.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        s = [0] * 26
        ans = ''
        for freq in a:
            for char in range(26):
                if s[char] == freq:
                    ans += chr(char + 97)
                    s[char] += 1
                    break
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Solution Code

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all input data at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n` (length of the string) and the trace array `a`.

2. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - Initialize a list `s` of size 26, each element representing the frequency count of characters 'a' to 'z'.
   - For each frequency value in the trace array `a`:
     - Iterate through possible characters (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z').
     - Find the character whose current frequency count matches the frequency value in `a`.
     - Append this character to the result string and increment its frequency count.
   - Print the constructed string for each test case.

This approach ensures that the constructed string matches the given trace, adhering to the frequency constraints specified by the trace array.
