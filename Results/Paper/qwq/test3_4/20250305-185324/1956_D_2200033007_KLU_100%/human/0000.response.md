Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I have an array of integers, and I can perform operations on it. Each operation involves choosing a subarray, computing the MEX of that subarray, and then setting all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I can do this up to 5*10^5 times, but I don't need to minimize the number of operations, just ensure I don't exceed that limit.

My goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing these operations. I need to output the maximum possible sum and a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

First, I need to understand what MEX is. MEX stands for "minimum excludant," which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in a given set. For example, the MEX of [0, 1, 3] is 2, because 2 is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

So, in each operation, I choose a subarray, compute its MEX, and set all elements in that subarray to that MEX value. I can do this up to 5*10^5 times, but I don't need to minimize the number of operations.

Given that n can be up to 18, which is relatively small, I might be able to come up with an exhaustive or recursive approach without worrying too much about time constraints.

Let me consider what happens when I perform an operation on a subarray. Suppose I have a subarray [a, b, c], and their MEX is m. After the operation, the subarray becomes [m, m, m]. So, the sum of this subarray increases to 3m, provided that m is greater than the average of a, b, and c.

But I need to maximize the total sum of the array. So, I should look for operations that can increase the sum by setting subarrays to a higher value than their current elements.

One straightforward approach is to set each element to its own MEX, but since MEX is defined for a set, and a single element is a set with one element, the MEX would be 0 if the element is -1, 1 if the element is 0, and so on. But in this problem, elements are non-negative integers, so MEX would be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

Wait, in the single element case, if a_i = 0, MEX would be 1, because 0 is present. If a_i = 1, MEX would be 0, since 0 is not present. Wait, that seems off. Actually, for a single element a_i, the MEX would be the smallest non-negative integer not equal to a_i.

So, for a_i = 0, MEX would be 1.

For a_i = 1, MEX would be 0.

For a_i = 2, MEX would be 0.

Wait, no. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set. So, for a_i = 0, MEX is 1.

For a_i = 1, MEX is 0.

For a_i = 2, MEX is 0.

Wait, but 0 is a non-negative integer, so for a_i = 1, since 0 is not present, MEX is 0.

For a_i = 2, since 0 and 1 are not present, MEX is 0.

Wait, no. MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

So, for a single element a_i:

- If a_i = 0, MEX is 1.

- If a_i = 1, MEX is 0.

- If a_i = 2, MEX is 0.

- And so on.

Wait, but in general, for a single element a_i, MEX is 0 if a_i != 0, and 1 if a_i = 0.

Wait, no. Wait, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

So, for a single element a_i:

- If a_i = 0, then MEX is 1, because 0 is present, so the smallest non-present is 1.

- If a_i = 1, then MEX is 0, because 0 is not present.

- If a_i = 2, then MEX is 0, because 0 is not present.

- If a_i = 3, then MEX is 0, and so on.

So, in general, for a single element:

- If a_i = 0, MEX = 1

- Else, MEX = 0

Wait, that seems odd, but that's how MEX is defined.

But in the problem, it's mentioned that you can perform operations up to 5*10^5 times, but you don't need to minimize the number of operations, just ensure you don't exceed that limit.

Given that n is up to 18, which is small, perhaps an exhaustive approach is feasible.

I need to maximize the sum of the array after performing any number of operations (up to 5*10^5, but likely much fewer operations are needed).

Let me think about what operations can do.

Each operation chooses a subarray, computes its MEX, and sets all elements in that subarray to that MEX value.

I need to maximize the sum of the array.

So, I should look for operations that can set subarrays to higher values.

Given that MEX is involved, I need to understand how MEX behaves on different subarrays.

Let's consider some small examples.

Example 1:

n = 2

a = [0, 1]

Compute MEX of the entire array: MEX of {0,1} is 2.

So, if I perform an operation on the entire array, it becomes [2,2], sum = 4.

If I perform operations on individual elements:

- Operation on a[1]: MEX of {0} is 1, so a[1] becomes 1.

- Operation on a[2]: MEX of {1} is 0, so a[2] becomes 0.

Resulting array: [1,0], sum = 1.

Which is less than 4.

So, in this case, operating on the entire array is better.

Another operation sequence:

- Operation on a[1]: a[1] becomes 1.

- Operation on a[1] again: a[1] becomes 1 (no change).

- Operation on a[2]: a[2] becomes 0.

Sum: 1 + 0 = 1.

Still less than 4.

Or:

- Operation on a[1]: a[1] becomes 1.

- Operation on a[1:2]: MEX of {1,0} is 2, set both to 2.

Sum: 2 + 2 = 4.

Same as before.

So, in this case, performing one operation on the entire array achieves the maximum sum of 4.

Example 2:

n = 3

a = [1,3,9]

Compute MEX of the entire array: MEX of {1,3,9} is 0, since 0 is not present.

If I set the entire array to 0, sum = 0.

Which is worse than the original sum of 13.

Operating on individual elements:

- Operation on a[1]: MEX of {1} is 0, set to 0.

- Operation on a[2]: MEX of {3} is 0, set to 0.

- Operation on a[3]: MEX of {9} is 0, set to 0.

Sum: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Worse.

Alternatively:

- Operation on a[1:2]: MEX of {1,3} is 0, set to [0,0].

- Operation on a[3]: MEX of {9} is 0, set to 0.

Sum: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Still worse.

Operating on a[2:3]:

- MEX of {3,9} is 0, set to [0,0].

Then a = [1,0,0], sum = 1.

Better than 0, but less than original 13.

Original array sum is 13, which is already better than any operation sequence seems to provide.

Hence, in this case, the original array sum is the maximum achievable.

Example 3:

n = 4

a = [1,100,2,1]

Compute MEX of the entire array: MEX of {1,100,2,1} is 0, since 0 is not present.

Setting the entire array to 0 would give sum = 0.

Which is worse than the original sum of 104.

Trying different operations:

- Operation on a[2]: MEX of {100} is 0, set to 0.

- Operation on a[3]: MEX of {2} is 0, set to 0.

- Operation on a[4]: MEX of {1} is 0, set to 0.

Sum: 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1.

Worse.

- Operation on a[1:2]: MEX of {1,100} is 0, set to [0,0].

- Operation on a[3:4]: MEX of {2,1} is 0, set to [0,0].

Sum: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Worse.

- Operation on a[1:3]: MEX of {1,100,2} is 0, set to [0,0,0].

- Operation on a[4]: MEX of {1} is 0, set to 0.

Sum: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

Worse.

- Operation on a[2:3]: MEX of {100,2} is 0, set to [0,0].

- Operation on a[1:4]: MEX of {1,0,0} is 2, set to [2,2,2].

Sum: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Better than before, but less than original 104.

Wait, but in the sample input 3, they achieved a sum of 105 with two operations.

Let me look back at the sample explanation.

In the third example, the array changes as follows:

- After the first operation (l=3, r=3), the array becomes [1,100,0,1].

- After the second operation (l=3, r=4), the array becomes [1,100,2,2].

Sum: 1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105.

So, in this case, they performed two operations to achieve a sum of 105, which is better than the original sum of 104.

Let me see why this works.

Initially: [1,100,2,1]

First operation: l=3, r=3, MEX of {2} is 0, set to 0. Array becomes [1,100,0,1].

Second operation: l=3, r=4, MEX of {0,1} is 2, set to 2. Array becomes [1,100,2,2].

Sum: 1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105.

So, by performing these operations, they increased the sum from 104 to 105.

Interesting. So, operations can be used to increase the sum in some cases, even if the MEX might seem counterintuitive.

Another sample:

n=1

a=[0]

MEX of [0] is 1, set to 1. Sum becomes 1.

Which is better than the original sum of 0.

So, in this case, performing one operation increases the sum from 0 to 1.

Alright, so operations can be used strategically to increase the sum, but it's not always straightforward.

Given that n is small (n <= 18), perhaps a dynamic programming approach can be used to find the maximum achievable sum.

I need to consider all possible ways to perform operations on subarrays and compute the resulting sum, then choose the one with the maximum sum.

But with n=18, the number of possible subarrays is manageable, but I need an efficient way to model the operations.

Let me think about the DP state.

Perhaps dp[l][r] represents the maximum sum achievable for the subarray from index l to r.

But I need to consider that operations can overlap in complex ways, so maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the array as a sequence of segments, each segment being a range of identical values, and find a way to merge these segments via operations to maximize the sum.

But that seems complicated.

Another idea: since operations can be nested and overlapping, maybe I can model the problem using inclusion of subarrays.

Wait, perhaps inclusion-exclusion might be relevant here, but I'm not sure.

Let me consider that each operation on a subarray sets all its elements to the MEX of that subarray.

So, if I perform an operation on a subarray, the new sum of that subarray becomes (r - l + 1) * MEX.

I need to choose operations such that the total sum is maximized.

Perhaps I can model this as choosing a set of operations (i.e., subarrays) and computing the resulting array after applying all these operations in some order.

But the operations are not necessarily commutative, as performing one operation might change the MEX of another subarray.

Wait, actually, since each operation sets the subarray to a single value, once a subarray is set to a certain value, further operations on that subarray will set it to the MEX of that uniform subarray.

For example, if a subarray is [x, x, x], its MEX is the smallest non-x value.

Wait, but MEX is defined based on the values in the subarray.

So, if a subarray is uniform with value x, its MEX is the smallest non-x non-negative integer.

So, for a uniform subarray with x=0, MEX=1.

For x=1, MEX=0.

For x=2, MEX=0.

Wait, in general, for a uniform subarray with x, MEX is 0 if x != 0, else 1.

But operations can be performed on overlapping subarrays, so it's tricky to model.

Maybe I need to think in terms of the final configuration of the array.

What is the maximum possible sum I can achieve?

Each element in the final array is set to some value, and this value is determined by some operation that was performed on some subarray containing that element.

But it's complex to directly model.

Given the small n, perhaps I can consider all possible ways to partition the array into segments, where each segment is the result of some operation setting it to a uniform value, and find the partition that maximizes the sum.

But I need to ensure that such a partition can be achieved via a sequence of operations.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as choosing a value for each position, subject to the constraints imposed by the operations.

But it's still tricky.

Let me consider that each operation sets a subarray to its MEX, and MEX is determined by the current values in that subarray.

So, planning a sequence of operations to achieve a desired final array is non-trivial.

An alternative approach: since n is small, perhaps I can try all possible final configurations and check if they are achievable via some sequence of operations.

But that seems inefficient, as the number of possible configurations is exponential.

Wait, perhaps I can find, for each position, the maximum value it can be set to via some sequence of operations, and sum them up.

But how do I ensure that the operations don't interfere with each other?

This seems complicated.

Looking back at the sample input 3, where they achieved a sum of 105 by setting a[3] and a[4] to 2, after first setting a[3] to 0.

So, in that case, they performed operations in a specific sequence to achieve the desired result.

This suggests that the sequence of operations matters, as operations can build upon each other to achieve higher values.

But given that we don't need to minimize the number of operations, perhaps there's a way to order operations to maximize the sum.

Maybe performing operations on smaller subarrays first and then larger subarrays that include them.

But I'm not sure.

Another idea: since MEX is involved, perhaps there's a way to model this with the inclusion of certain values in the subarrays.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the array as a whole and find a way to set it to the highest possible MEX.

But in the first sample, setting the entire array to MEX=2 gave a sum of 4, which was optimal.

In the second sample, setting the entire array to MEX=0 would give sum=0, which is worse than the original sum of 13.

So, in that case, keeping the array as is is better.

In the third sample, they performed operations to set parts of the array to higher values.

So, it seems that sometimes it's better to perform operations, and sometimes it's better to keep the array as is.

I need a way to decide which approach to take.

Perhaps I can consider all possible ways to group the array into segments, where each segment is set to its MEX, and find the combination that gives the maximum sum.

But again, with n=18, this seems computationally intensive.

Wait, perhaps I can use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the maximum sum for the subarray from the beginning up to index i.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that for a subarray from l to r, its MEX is determined by the unique values present in that subarray.

So, to maximize the sum, I might want to set larger subarrays to higher MEX values.

But MEX is not necessarily higher for larger subarrays.

In fact, MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.

So, if a subarray contains 0 and 1, MEX is 2.

If it contains only 0, MEX is 1.

If it contains only 1, MEX is 0.

So, MEX can be higher for subarrays with more values, but it's not straightforward.

I need a better approach.

Given that n is small, perhaps I can consider all possible partitions of the array into segments, where each segment is set to its MEX, and choose the partition that maximizes the sum.

But again, with n=18, the number of possible partitions is 2^n * n, which is manageable.

Wait, but it's still quite large for n=18.

I need a smarter way.

Let me consider that performing an operation on a subarray can be seen as setting that subarray to a specific value, and that value is determined by the MEX, which in turn depends on the current values in the subarray.

This seems too recursive to model directly.

Perhaps I can think in terms of the final values of the array.

Suppose I fix the final value for each position in the array.

Then, I need to ensure that there exists a sequence of operations that can achieve those final values.

But how do I ensure that?

This seems too vague.

Let me consider that each operation sets a subarray to a single value, which is the MEX of that subarray before the operation.

So, if I have a subarray with values [a,b,c], and MEX is m, then after the operation, it becomes [m,m,m].

If I perform another operation on a larger subarray that includes this subarray, the MEX of the larger subarray would depend on the values in the larger subarray after the first operation.

This seems too interdependent to model directly.

An alternative idea: perhaps I can model this as a graph where nodes represent array positions, and edges represent possible operations on subarrays.

But that seems too vague.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of ranges and how operations affect those ranges.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that an exhaustive approach is necessary here, given that n is small.

So, perhaps I can use recursion with memoization to compute the maximum sum achievable for each subarray.

Let me try to define a recursive function that computes the maximum sum for a subarray from index l to r.

So, dp(l, r) represents the maximum sum for the subarray a[l..r].

The base case is when l == r, in which case dp(l, r) is the maximum between a[l] and the MEX of that single element.

Wait, but for a single element, as we saw earlier, MEX is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of a[l].

So, for l == r:

- If a[l] == 0, MEX is 1, so dp(l, r) = max(a[l], 1)

- If a[l] != 0, MEX is 0, so dp(l, r) = max(a[l], 0)

Wait, but in the single element case, setting it to MEX might not always increase the sum.

Wait, in the sample input 4, with n=1 and a=[0], setting it to MEX=1 increases the sum from 0 to 1.

So, in that case, dp(0,0) = 1.

In another case, if a[l] != 0, MEX is 0, which might be less than a[l].

So, dp(l, r) should be max(a[l], MEX).

Wait, but in the sample input 2, with a=[1,3,9], the maximum sum is the original sum, 13.

If I set any subarray to MEX, it would reduce the sum.

So, in that case, dp(0,2) = 13.

In sample input 3, dp(0,3) = 105.

So, how can I generalize this?

Let me consider that dp(l, r) can be computed by considering all possible ways to split the subarray a[l..r] into smaller subarrays, performing operations on them, and taking the maximum sum.

So, for dp(l, r):

- Option 1: Perform an operation on the entire subarray a[l..r], set it to MEX(a[l..r]), and sum becomes (r - l + 1) * MEX(a[l..r]).

- Option 2: Do not perform any operation on a[l..r], and sum is sum(a[l..r]).

- Option 3: Perform operations on some subarrays within a[l..r], and combine their sums.

Wait, this seems too vague.

Perhaps more formally:

dp(l, r) = max(

sum(a[l..r]),  # no operations

(r - l + 1) * MEX(a[l..r]),  # operation on the entire subarray

max over i=l to r-1 of dp(l, i) + dp(i+1, r),  # split into two parts

max over i=l to r-1 of dp(l, i) + dp(i+1, r) + a[i],  # not sure

)

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the recursive structure again.

dp(l, r) = maximum of:

- sum(a[l..r]), i.e., no operations.

- (r - l + 1) * MEX(a[l..r]), i.e., perform one operation on the entire subarray.

- For all possible splits l <= i < r, dp(l, i) + dp(i+1, r), i.e., perform operations on the left and right subarrays independently.

But I think I'm missing something.

In the sample input 3, dp(0,3) = 105, which is achieved by setting a[2:4] to 2, after setting a[2] to 0.

So, it's not just about splitting into two parts and summing their dp values.

I need a better way to model this.

Perhaps I need to consider that performing an operation on a subarray affects the MEX of larger subarrays that include it.

This seems too recursive.

An alternative idea: perhaps I can model this as a tree where each node represents a subarray, and its children are subarrays obtained by splitting it.

But again, it's not clear.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that an exhaustive approach is necessary here, even if it's not the most efficient.

Given that n <= 18, and the problem allows up to 5*10^5 operations, which is more than enough, perhaps I can focus on computing the maximum possible sum and then constructing a sequence of operations that achieves it, without worrying too much about minimizing the number of operations.

So, perhaps I can compute the maximum possible sum using a recursive approach with memoization, and then backtrack to construct the sequence of operations.

Let me try to define dp(l, r) as the maximum sum achievable for the subarray a[l..r].

Base case: l == r.

In this case, dp(l, r) = max(a[l], MEX(a[l])).

As we saw earlier, MEX(a[l]) is 1 if a[l] == 0, else 0.

So, dp(l, r) = max(a[l], 1 if a[l] == 0 else 0).

Wait, but in sample input 4, with n=1 and a=[0], dp(0,0) = 1.

In sample input 3, with n=4 and a=[1,100,2,1], dp(0,3) = 105.

I need a way to compute dp(l, r).

Perhaps dp(l, r) = max(

sum(a[l..r]),  # no operations

(r - l + 1) * MEX(a[l..r]),  # operation on entire subarray

max over i=l to r-1 of dp(l, i) + dp(i+1, r)  # split into two parts

)

But in sample input 3, dp(0,3) = 105, which seems higher than any of these options.

Wait, sum(a[0..3]) = 1 + 100 + 2 + 1 = 104.

(r - l + 1) * MEX(a[0..3]) = 4 * 0 = 0.

dp(0,1) + dp(2,3):

dp(0,1) = max(sum([1,100]), sum([1,100]) with operation) = max(101, 2 * MEX([1,100])).

MEX([1,100]) = 0, so 2 * 0 = 0.

So, dp(0,1) = max(101, 0) = 101.

dp(2,3) = max(sum([2,1]), sum([2,1]) with operation) = max(3, 2 * MEX([2,1])).

MEX([2,1]) = 0, so 2 * 0 = 0.

So, dp(2,3) = max(3, 0) = 3.

Total: 101 + 3 = 104, which is less than 105.

So, perhaps I need to consider overlapping operations or operations that are performed after splitting.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that after splitting, I can perform operations on the combined subarrays.

But it's getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that an exhaustive approach is necessary here, even if it's not the most efficient.

So, perhaps I can implement a recursive function with memoization to compute dp(l, r), considering all possible splits and operations.

Then, to construct the sequence of operations, I can backtrack through the choices made in the dp table.

But implementing this correctly would be error-prone.

Looking back at the provided code, it seems to implement something similar to what I was thinking.

Let me try to understand the provided code.

The code defines two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 computes the maximum sum achievable for the subarray from start_index to end_index, using memoization.

It stores results in res_dict.

The base case is when start_index == end_index, in which case it returns max(1, arr[start_index]).

Then, it considers two main options:

1. Performing an operation on the entire subarray, which sets all elements to MEX of the subarray, giving sum (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2.

Wait, (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2 seems off.

In the first sample input, with n=2 and a=[0,1], the MEX is 2, and sum would be 2 * 2 = 4, which matches.

In the second sample input, n=3 and a=[1,3,9], MEX is 0, so sum would be 3 * 0 = 0, which is worse than the original sum of 13.

In the third sample input, n=4 and a=[1,100,2,1], MEX is 0, so sum would be 4 * 0 = 0, which is worse than the original sum of 104.

Wait, but in the sample output, it's 105, which is higher than 104.

So, perhaps there's another way to interpret this.

Wait, (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2 seems to be (length of subarray)^2.

In the first sample, length=2, so 4, which matches.

In the second sample, length=3, so 9, which is higher than 13, but in reality, setting the entire array to MEX=0 gives sum=0, which is worse.

So, perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, perhaps it's a mistake in interpreting MEX.

Wait, (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2 seems arbitrary.

Wait, maybe it's a typo or misunderstanding.

Looking back at the code, in func_1, it has:

res = (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2

Then, it iterates over possible splits and computes dp values accordingly.

But this seems incorrect, because (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2 is not related to MEX.

Wait, perhaps it's a placeholder or a mistake.

Looking back, it's likely that the code is incorrect, as it uses (end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2, which doesn't make sense in this context.

So, perhaps I need to correct this.

Instead, it should use (end_index - start_index + 1) * MEX(subarray).

But computing MEX for each subarray in the recursive function would be inefficient, as MEX computation is O(n) per subarray, and with n=18, it would be too slow.

Wait, but n is small, so perhaps it's acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can precompute MEX for all possible subarrays.

But that would require O(n^2) time, which is manageable for n=18.

Wait, but MEX depends on the current values in the subarray, which change with operations.

Wait, no, in the recursive function, when considering performing an operation on a subarray, the MEX is computed based on the original values, before any operations.

But that's not accurate, because operations can be performed on subarrays in any order.

This is getting too complicated.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that an exhaustive approach is necessary here, even if it's not the most efficient.

So, perhaps I can implement a recursive function with memoization to compute dp(l, r), considering all possible ways to split the subarray and perform operations.

Then, to construct the sequence of operations, I can backtrack through the choices made in the dp table.

But implementing this correctly would be error-prone.

Given that, perhaps I should accept that the provided code is incorrect and try to come up with a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the maximum sum is achieved by setting each element to the highest possible value via a sequence of operations.

Given that MEX is involved, perhaps I can model this as building a "MEX tree" or something similar.

But I'm not sure.

Given time constraints, perhaps I need to accept that I don't have a clear solution and that the provided code is incorrect.

Therefore, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{Correctness: False}} \]
