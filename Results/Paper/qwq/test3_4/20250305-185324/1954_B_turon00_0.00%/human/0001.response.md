Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have an array that's called "beautiful." It's beautiful if, through a series of operations, I can make all its elements the same. The operation allowed is: choose an index i (where 2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that a[i-1] equals a[i+1], and then replace a[i] with a[i-1].

So, the task is to take this beautiful array and figure out the minimum number of elements I need to remove so that it's no longer beautiful. If it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removing elements, I should output -1.

First, I need to understand what makes an array beautiful. The definition says that it's beautiful if I can make all elements the same by repeatedly applying that specific operation.

Let's consider the operation: I can only change a[i] to a[i-1] if a[i-1] equals a[i+1]. This means that the elements around a[i] must be equal for me to change a[i] to match them.

I need to think about what sequences can be made beautiful. If I have a sequence where I can propagate changes from the ends towards the center, making all elements equal to some value.

Looking at the examples:

1. [2, 2, 2]: It's already all the same, so it's beautiful. Removing any element still leaves all elements the same, so it remains beautiful. Hence, output -1.

2. [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]: By removing the element at index 5 (which is 1), we get [1, 2, 1, 2]. Now, trying to make all elements the same:

- Option 1: Choose i=2 (a[1]=1, a[3]=1, so a[2]=2 can be changed to 1). The array becomes [1,1,1,2]. Then, choose i=4 (a[3]=1, a[5]=2, but a[3] ≠ a[5], so no operation). This doesn't make all elements the same.

- Option 2: Choose i=3 (a[2]=2, a[4]=2, so a[3]=1 can be changed to 2). The array becomes [1,2,2,2]. Then, choose i=1 (but i must be 2 ≤ i ≤ n-1), so no operation. Again, not all elements are the same.

Hence, after removal, it's not beautiful.

3. [1]: It's already not beautiful because it's a single element; no operations can be applied. But according to the problem, all given arrays are beautiful, so maybe this test case is invalid? Wait, the problem says "the given array a is beautiful," so perhaps this is a misprint in the example. Probably, it should be -1 since it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removal.

4. [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]: Removing the first three 3's leaves [5,3,3,3]. Now, can I make all elements the same?

- Choose i=2 (a[1]=5, a[3]=3, which are different, so no operation).

- Choose i=3 (a[2]=3, a[4]=3, so a[3]=3 can be changed to 3, which is already 3. No change.

- Choose i=4 (if possible, but i must be ≤ n-1, which is 4 ≤ 3 is false.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

From these examples, it seems that if the array consists of all elements being the same, it remains beautiful no matter what you remove (except if you remove all elements, but probably that's not allowed). Otherwise, if there are different elements, by removing some elements, you can make it not beautiful.

Wait, but in the second example, even though there are different elements, removing one element makes it not beautiful.

I need a general approach.

Let me think about the condition for an array to be not beautiful.

An array is not beautiful if it's impossible to make all elements the same using the given operations.

One observation: if all elements are already the same, then no matter what you remove, it remains beautiful. Hence, output -1.

Otherwise, perhaps the minimum number of removals needed is related to the number of times the most frequent element appears.

Wait, but in the second example, [1,2,1,2,1], the most frequent element is 1, which appears 3 times. By removing one element (a 1), we get [1,2,1,2], which is not beautiful.

But, in this case, removing one element is enough to make it not beautiful.

Is the answer always 1, except when all elements are the same?

Wait, no. In the fourth example, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing three elements is necessary to make it not beautiful.

Wait, no, in the fourth example, removing the first three 3's leaves [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

But, perhaps there's a better way with fewer removals.

Let's see: [3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

If I remove the 5, I get [3,3,3,3,3,3], which is still beautiful.

So, removing one element isn't enough.

If I remove two elements, say two 3's from the ends: [3,3,5,3,3,3]. Now, can I make all elements the same?

- Choose i=3 (a[2]=3, a[4]=5 ≠ a[2], so no operation).

- Choose i=4 (a[3]=5, a[5]=3 ≠ a[3], so no operation).

- Choose i=5 (a[4]=3, a[6]=3, so a[5]=3 can be changed to 3, which is already 3.

Hence, it's not beautiful.

So, removing two elements is enough.

But according to the example, removing three elements is the answer, but actually removing two is also enough.

Wait, perhaps their removal is different.

In the explanation, they removed the first three elements, leaving [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

But, removing two elements can also make it not beautiful, as shown above.

So, perhaps the answer is the minimum number among different possible removals.

I need to find the minimum number of removals such that after removal, the array is not beautiful.

I need a general strategy.

Let me consider that an array is beautiful if I can make all elements equal by repeatedly changing a[i] to a[i-1] when a[i-1] == a[i+1].

This seems similar to propagating values through the array under certain conditions.

I need to think about what configurations make the array beautiful.

Suppose the array has only one unique element, it's always beautiful, and removing elements won't make it not beautiful.

If the array has two different elements, perhaps removing certain elements can prevent making them all the same.

Wait, but in the second example, [1,2,1,2,1], removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth example, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing two elements is enough.

I need to find a pattern.

Let me consider that if the array has multiple runs of the same value, and these runs alternate, removing elements from certain positions can break the beauty.

Wait, perhaps it's related to the number of times the most frequent value appears.

Wait, but that doesn't seem directly applicable.

Let me consider that in order for the array to be beautiful, it must be possible to propagate changes to make all elements equal to some value.

If I can make all elements equal to, say, x, then the array is beautiful.

To prevent this, I need to ensure that it's impossible to make all elements equal to any value.

One way to do this is to have at least two different values that cannot be changed to each other.

But, given the operation, if I have a sequence where a[i-1] == a[i+1], I can change a[i] to a[i-1].

So, if I have sections where a[i-1] != a[i+1], I cannot change a[i].

I need to ensure that after removal, there are elements that cannot be changed to make all elements equal.

This seems complicated.

Perhaps another approach: find the minimum number of removals to break the condition that allows making all elements equal.

Alternatively, find the minimum number of removals such that the remaining array cannot be made into a constant array using the given operations.

I need to think differently.

Let me consider that if the array is already not beautiful, the answer is 0.

But according to the problem, all given arrays are beautiful, so the answer is always at least 1, or -1 if it's impossible to make it not beautiful.

Wait, no: in the first example, it's impossible to make it not beautiful, so the answer is -1.

In other cases, it's possible.

So, I need to find, for each test case, the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful, or -1 if it's impossible.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "if it is impossible to do so, then output -1."

But in the first example, where the array is all the same, it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removal, so output -1.

In other cases, it's possible.

So, the key is: if all elements are the same, output -1; otherwise, find the minimum number of removals to make it not beautiful.

Wait, but in the second example, [1,2,1,2,1], which has different elements, removing one element makes it not beautiful.

In the fourth example, [3,3,3,5,3,3,3], removing two elements is enough, but the example says removing three elements.

Maybe the example is not showing the minimal removal.

Wait, in the fourth example, removing two elements can make it not beautiful, as I showed earlier.

But the example removes three elements, giving [5,3,3,3], which is not beautiful.

But removing two elements is also enough.

So, perhaps the answer should be 2 for that case, but the example shows 3.

Wait, perhaps I miscounted.

Wait, in the fourth example, n=7, a=[3,3,3,5,3,3,3].

If I remove the first three elements, I get [5,3,3,3].

Is there a way to make all elements equal?

- Choose i=2: a[1]=5, a[3]=3 ≠ 5, so cannot change a[2].

- Choose i=3: a[2]=3, a[4]=3, so change a[3] to 3 (but it's already 3).

- Choose i=4: not possible.

So, it's not beautiful.

Alternatively, removing two elements:

Say, remove a[1] and a[2]: [3,3,5,3,3,3].

Now, can I make all elements equal?

- Choose i=2: a[1]=3, a[3]=5 ≠ 3, so cannot change a[2].

- Choose i=3: a[2]=3, a[4]=5 ≠ 3, so cannot change a[3].

- Choose i=4: a[3]=5, a[5]=3 ≠ 5, so cannot change a[4].

- Choose i=5: a[4]=3, a[6]=3, so change a[5]=3 (already 3).

So, it's not beautiful.

Hence, removing two elements is enough.

But the example shows removing three elements.

Perhaps the minimal number is 2, but the example shows 3.

So, perhaps the answer should be 2, but the example says 3.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Looking back at the problem, it says "the minimum number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being beautiful."

So, in the fourth example, removing two elements is enough, but the example shows removing three.

Perhaps the example is not minimal, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe different removals lead to different results.

Wait, perhaps removing one element isn't enough in the fourth example.

Let's try removing one element.

Say, remove a[4]=5: [3,3,3,3,3,3], which is beautiful.

So, removing one element still keeps it beautiful.

Hence, need to remove at least two elements.

So, the minimal number is 2, but the example shows 3.

Hence, the answer should be 2, not 3.

Wait, but the example output is 3.

Perhaps the problem allows non-minimal answers, but the task is to find the minimum.

Hence, the correct answer should be 2, not 3.

So, perhaps the example is incorrect, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the problem is to make the array not beautiful, and it's acceptable to remove more elements than necessary.

Hence, removing three elements is acceptable, but the minimal is 2.

Hence, the answer should be 2.

So, perhaps the program outputs 3, but the correct answer is 2.

Wait, but in the program, it outputs 3 for that case.

Hence, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Wait, let's look at the program.

The program does the following:

- Read the number of test cases t.

- For each test case:

- Read n, the size of the array.

- Read the array a.

- Set tmp to a[0].

- Create a set aa from a.

- If the set has only one element, output -1.

- Initialize cnt to 0 and ans to n.

- Iterate through the array:

- If a[i] == tmp, increment cnt.

- Else, set ans to the minimum of ans and cnt, and reset cnt to 0.

- After the loop, set ans to the minimum of ans and cnt.

- Print ans.

So, in the fourth example:

n=7, a=[3,3,3,5,3,3,3]

tmp = 3

aa = {3,5}

Since len(aa) !=1, proceed.

Initialize cnt=0, ans=7

Iterate:

i=0: a[0]=3 == tmp => cnt=1

i=1: a[1]=3 == tmp => cnt=2

i=2: a[2]=3 == tmp => cnt=3

i=3: a[3]=5 != tmp => ans = min(7,3)=3, cnt=0

i=4: a[4]=3 == tmp => cnt=1

i=5: a[5]=3 == tmp => cnt=2

i=6: a[6]=3 == tmp => cnt=3

After loop, ans = min(3,3)=3

Hence, output 3.

But earlier, we saw that removing two elements is enough.

Hence, the program outputs 3, but the minimal is 2.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the logic is different.

Let me understand the logic of the program.

It seems that it's trying to find the minimum run of consecutive elements equal to a[0], and use that as the number of elements to remove.

In the fourth example, the first run of 3's is of length 3, and the second run is of length 3.

Hence, ans is 3.

But, as we saw, removing two elements is enough.

Hence, the logic is flawed.

So, the program is incorrect.

Hence, Correctness: False.

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. If it is impossible to do so, we should output -1.

### Approach

1. **Understanding Beautiful Arrays**:
    - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing `a[i]` with `a[i-1]` when `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for `2 <= i <= n-1`.
    - If all elements are already the same, it remains beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, hence output -1.

2. **Key Observations**:
    - If the array has only one unique element, output -1.
    - For arrays with more than one unique element, we need to find the minimal number of removals such that the remaining array cannot be transformed into a uniform array using the given operation.

3. **Strategy**:
    - Identify the most frequent element in the array.
    - Calculate the maximum run (consecutive sequence) of this most frequent element.
    - The minimum number of removals required is the difference between the total length of the array and the length of the longest run of the most frequent element.

### Solution Code

```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))
        idx += n
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        freq = {}
        for num in a:
            freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
        if len(freq) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        max_count = max(freq.values())
        max_run = 0
        current_run = 0
        most_frequent_value = [k for k, v in freq.items() if v == max_count][0]
        for num in a:
            if num == most_frequent_value:
                current_run += 1
                max_run = max(max_run, current_run)
            else:
                current_run = 0
        ans = n - max_run
        print(ans)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation

1. **Reading Input**:
    - Read the number of test cases `t`.
    - For each test case, read the array size `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Handling Single Element Array**:
    - If `n` is 1, output -1 since it's impossible to make it not beautiful by removal.

3. **Frequency Calculation**:
    - Calculate the frequency of each element in the array.
    - If there is only one unique element, output -1.

4. **Finding Maximum Run of Most Frequent Element**:
    - Identify the element with the highest frequency.
    - Traverse the array to find the longest consecutive sequence (run) of this most frequent element.

5. **Calculating Minimum Removals**:
    - The minimum number of removals required is the total elements minus the length of the longest run of the most frequent element.
    - Print this value for each test case.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum removals needed to disrupt the beauty of the array across multiple test cases.
