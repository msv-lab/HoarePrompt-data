Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

We have an array `a` of length `n`, and an empty set `S`. We need to perform an operation `n` times, where in each operation, we select an index `i` (1-based), insert `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then delete `a[i]` from `a`. After all operations, `a` will be empty, and `S` will contain some unique values. We need to sort `S` in decreasing order to form array `b` and find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

First, I need to understand what values can be in `S`. Since `S` is a set, it only contains unique elements. The value inserted is `a[i] + i`, and this is done `n` times, but since it's a set, duplicates are ignored.

My goal is to maximize the array `b` in lex order. Lexicographical order means comparing element by element from left to right. So, the largest possible `b` would have the largest possible elements at the earliest positions.

I need to think about how the operations affect the set `S`. Each operation involves choosing an index `i`, inserting `a[i] + i` into `S`, and then deleting `a[i]` from `a`, which shifts the indices of the elements to the right of `i` by one position to the left.

This shifting of indices complicates things because the indices change after each deletion. I need to keep track of how the indices evolve with each deletion.

Let me consider a small example to understand better.

Take the first sample input:

2

2 1

So, n=2, a=[2,1]

Operation 1:

- Choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, delete a[1], so a becomes [1]

- Then, operation 2: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes empty

- S = {2, 3}, sorted in decreasing order: b = [3,2]

Another choice:

Operation 1:

- Choose i=2, insert a[2] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 into S, delete a[2], so a becomes [2]

- Operation 2: choose i=1, insert a[1] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 into S, delete a[1], a becomes empty

- Since S only allows unique elements, inserting 3 again doesn't change S, so S = {3}, b = [3]

Comparing [3,2] and [3], [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3].

Hence, the first choice is better.

From this, it seems that choosing elements in a certain order affects the set `S` and hence the final `b`.

I need to maximize `b`, which is sorted in decreasing order, and maximize it in lex order.

I need to think about what values can be in `S` and how to maximize them.

Let me consider that `a[i] + i` is the value being inserted into `S`. Since indices are 1-based, `i` ranges from 1 to current `|a|`.

Wait, but after each deletion, the indices shift.

This seems tricky to handle directly.

Maybe there's a smarter way to model this.

Let me consider that in the first operation, `i` can be from 1 to `n`, and `a[i] + i` is inserted into `S`.

Then, after deleting `a[i]`, the array shifts, and in the next operation, `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`, and so on.

But keeping track of shifting indices is complicated.

Perhaps I can think of the indices in terms of their original positions.

Wait, let's think differently.

Suppose I fix the order in which I delete the elements, i.e., fix the sequence of `i`s to choose in each operation.

Each sequence corresponds to a permutation of the elements, considering the shifting indices.

But enumerating all permutations is not feasible due to the size of `n`.

I need a smarter approach.

Let me consider that each `a[i] + i` is computed based on its original index.

But wait, when I delete an element, the indices of the elements to the right shift left by one.

So, the value `a[j] + j` for j > i changes in subsequent operations after deleting a[i].

This is getting complicated.

Is there a way to compute all possible values that can be inserted into `S` without worrying about the order?

Wait, perhaps I can compute all possible `a[i] + pos`, where `pos` is the position where `a[i]` is deleted.

But this seems too vague.

Let me consider that each element `a[i]` will be added to some position `pos` when it's deleted.

The position `pos` is its index at the time of deletion.

Since the array shifts left after each deletion, the position of an element can change.

Wait, perhaps I can think in terms of the order of deletion.

Suppose I fix the order in which I delete the elements, from first to last.

Each deletion affects the positions of the remaining elements.

This seems too involved.

Is there a better way?

Let me consider the following:

If I delete an element at position `i`, then the values `a[j] + j` for `j > i` will have `j` decreased by 1 in the next operation.

So, the value inserted for an element depends on its position at the time of deletion.

But positions change dynamically as elements are deleted.

Is there a static way to compute the position at the time of deletion?

Wait, perhaps I can assign a "deletion order" to each element, from 1 to n, and compute the position at the time of deletion based on which elements have been deleted before it.

This seems promising.

Let's formalize it.

Suppose I fix a deletion order, i.e., a permutation of the elements, specifying the order in which they are deleted.

For each element, its position at the time of deletion depends on how many elements before it in the array have been deleted.

Wait, more precisely, for each element, the position at the time of deletion is its original index minus the number of elements to its left that have been deleted before it.

But this seems too vague.

Let me try to find another approach.

Let me consider that each element `a[i]` can be associated with multiple possible positions depending on when it's deleted.

But this seems too broad.

Wait, perhaps inclusion of `a[i] + i` into `S` can be modeled in a different way.

Given that `S` is a set and only unique elements are inserted, I need to maximize the sorted array `b`.

I need to maximize the largest elements in `b`, then the next largest, and so on.

I need to maximize the entire array `b` in lex order.

I need to think about how to maximize the number of large elements in `S`.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the possible values of `a[i] + i` and their frequencies.

But since `S` is a set, frequencies don't matter; only uniqueness counts.

Wait, but in the code provided, there's a `Counter` used for `a[i] + i`.

Wait, let's look at the provided code to understand.

The code does the following:

- For each test case:

- Read `n`

- Read array `a`

- Compute `a[i] + (i+1)` for each element (since Python uses 0-based indexing)

- Create a `Counter` for these values

- Create a set from `a`, convert to a list, sort in reverse order

- Initialize `cnt` as `n - len(a)`, which is the number of duplicates in `a`

- Initialize `ans` as an empty list

- Iterate through the sorted unique values:

- If it's not the first element, and there's a gap between consecutive unique values, insert numbers in that gap up to the count allowed by `cnt` and `cur`

- Append the current unique value to `ans`

- Decrement `counter[a[i]]` and update `cur`

- After processing all unique values, append decreasing numbers to `ans` if `cnt` is still positive

- Print the final `ans`

Wait, this seems to be trying to maximize `b` by filling in the gaps with as large numbers as possible.

But I need to verify if this approach is correct.

First, the code computes `a[i] + (i+1)` for each element, which seems correct for the initial `a[i] + i` as per the problem statement.

Then, it uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each value.

It then creates a list of unique values from `a`, sorted in reverse order.

It initializes `cnt` as `n - len(a)`, which is the number of duplicates in `a`.

Wait, but `a` after adding `i+1` might have duplicates, so `cnt` is the number of duplicates.

Then, it iterates through the sorted unique values, and for each pair of consecutive values, if there's a gap, it inserts numbers in that gap up to the limit of `cnt` and some `cur`.

This seems to be trying to fill in the gaps with as many numbers as possible to maximize `b`.

But I need to think carefully if this is indeed correct.

Let me consider the first sample input again.

n=2, a=[2,1]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0] + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3

- a[1] + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3

So, `a` becomes [3,3], `Counter` is {3:2}

Unique sorted list is [3]

cnt = 2 - 1 = 1

ans starts empty

Iterate through unique values:

- i=0: append 3

- counter[3] -=1 → 1

- cur += counter[3] → cur=1

Then, since cnt=1, append 3-1=2 to ans

So, ans = [3,2]

Which matches the first sample.

Another sample:

n=5, a=[1,100,1000,1000000,1000000000]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=1+1=2

- a[1]+2=100+2=102

- a[2]+3=1000+3=1003

- a[3]+4=1000000+4=1000004

- a[4]+5=1000000000+5=1000000005

All unique, so `Counter` is {2:1,102:1,1003:1,1000004:1,1000000005:1}

Unique sorted list: [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

cnt = 5 - 5 = 0

ans starts empty

Iterate through unique values:

- i=0: append 1000000005

- counter[1000000005]-=1 → 0

- cur += 0 → cur=0

- i=1: append 1000004

- counter[1000004]-=1 → 0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- and so on, append all unique values

Finally, since cnt=0, no additional numbers are appended

So, ans = [1000000005,1000004,1003,102,2]

Which matches the second sample.

Another sample:

n=3, a=[6,4,8]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=6+1=7

- a[1]+2=4+2=6

- a[2]+3=8+3=11

So, `a` = [7,6,11], `Counter` is {7:1,6:1,11:1}

Unique sorted list: [11,7,6]

cnt = 3 - 3 = 0

ans starts empty

Iterate through unique values:

- i=0: append 11

- counter[11]-=1 → 0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=1: append 7

- counter[7]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=2: append 6

- counter[6]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

Then, cnt=0, so no additional numbers

ans = [11,7,6]

Which matches the third sample.

Seems correct for the samples.

But I need to think if this approach always works.

The approach seems to be:

- Compute all possible `a[i] + i` values

- Count their frequencies

- Collect unique values, sort them in reverse order

- For gaps between consecutive unique values, fill in as many numbers as possible, up to the number of duplicates (`cnt`)

Wait, but in the first sample, there were duplicates, but in the sorted unique list, there was only one value, so it filled in one number (3 and 2).

Wait, but in that case, cnt=1, and it appended 2, which is correct.

But I need to think about whether this always leads to the lexicographically largest `b`.

Let me think about another example.

Suppose n=3, a=[1,2,3]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=1+1=2

- a[1]+2=2+2=4

- a[2]+3=3+3=6

All unique, so `Counter` is {2:1,4:1,6:1}

Unique sorted list: [6,4,2]

cnt=3-3=0

ans starts empty

Iterate through unique values:

- i=0: append 6

- counter[6]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=1: append 4

- counter[4]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=2: append 2

- counter[2]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

Then, cnt=0, so no additional numbers

ans = [6,4,2]

Is this the lexicographically largest `b`?

Let's see what other choices are possible.

If I choose i=1 first:

Insert a[1] +1=2+1=3 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [1,3]

Then choose i=1 again:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [3]

Then choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=3+1=4 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,3,4}, sorted in decreasing order: b=[4,3,2], same as above.

Another choice:

Choose i=2 first:

Insert a[2]+2=3+2=5 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1,2]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [2]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=2+1=3 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,3,5}, sorted as [5,3,2], same as above.

Another choice:

Choose i=3 first:

Insert a[3]+3=3+3=6 into S, delete a[3], a becomes [1,2]

Choose i=2:

Insert a[2]+2=2+2=4 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,4,6}, sorted as [6,4,2], same as above.

So, in this case, no matter what order I choose, S always has the same elements {2,4,6}, sorted as [6,4,2].

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Let me think of a case with duplicates.

Suppose n=4, a=[1,1,1,1]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=1+1=2

- a[1]+2=1+2=3

- a[2]+3=1+3=4

- a[3]+4=1+4=5

All unique, so `Counter` is {2:1,3:1,4:1,5:1}

Unique sorted list: [5,4,3,2]

cnt=4-4=0

ans starts empty

Iterate through unique values:

- i=0: append 5

- counter[5]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=1: append 4

- counter[4]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=2: append 3

- counter[3]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

- i=3: append 2

- counter[2]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=0

Then, cnt=0, so no additional numbers

ans = [5,4,3,2]

Is this the lexicographically largest `b`?

Let's see:

If I choose i=1 first:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [1,1,1]

Choose i=1 again:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [1,1]

Choose i=1 again:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2}, sorted as [2]

But the approach gives [5,4,3,2], which is better.

Another choice:

Choose i=4 first:

Insert a[4]+4=1+4=5 into S, delete a[4], a becomes [1,1,1]

Choose i=3:

Insert a[3]+3=1+3=4 into S, delete a[3], a becomes [1,1]

Choose i=2:

Insert a[2]+2=1+2=3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,3,4,5}, sorted as [5,4,3,2]

Same as above.

Another choice:

Choose i=2 first:

Insert a[2]+2=1+2=3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1,1,1]

Choose i=2:

Insert a[2]+2=1+2=3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1,1]

Choose i=2:

Insert a[2]+2=1+2=3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,3}, sorted as [3,2]

Which is worse than [5,4,3,2]

Hence, the approach seems correct.

Another test case:

n=4, a=[1,2,2,1]

Compute a[i] + (i+1):

- a[0]+1=1+1=2

- a[1]+2=2+2=4

- a[2]+3=2+3=5

- a[3]+4=1+4=5

So, `a` becomes [2,4,5,5], `Counter` is {2:1,4:1,5:2}

Unique sorted list: [5,4,2]

cnt=4-3=1

ans starts empty

Iterate through unique values:

- i=0: append 5

- counter[5]-=1 →1

- cur +=1 → cur=1

- i=1: since a[i-1]=5, a[i]=4, gap=5-4-1=0, so adv=0

- append 4

- counter[4]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=1

- i=2: append 2

- counter[2]-=1 →0

- cur +=0 → cur=1

Then, cnt=1, append 2-1=1 to ans

So, ans=[5,4,2,1]

Is this the lexicographically largest `b`?

Let's see:

One possible sequence:

Choose i=4 first:

Insert a[4]+4=1+4=5 into S, delete a[4], a becomes [1,2,2]

Choose i=3:

Insert a[3]+3=2+3=5 into S, delete a[3], a becomes [1,2]

Choose i=2:

Insert a[2]+2=2+2=4 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,4,5}, sorted as [5,4,2]

Another sequence:

Choose i=1 first:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [2,2,1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=2+1=3 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [2,1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=2+1=3 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,3}, sorted as [3,2]

Which is worse.

Another sequence:

Choose i=3 first:

Insert a[3]+3=2+3=5 into S, delete a[3], a becomes [1,2,1]

Choose i=2:

Insert a[2]+2=1+2=3 into S, delete a[2], a becomes [1,1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a becomes [1]

Choose i=1:

Insert a[1]+1=1+1=2 into S, delete a[1], a empty

S={2,3,5}, sorted as [5,3,2]

Still not as good as [5,4,2]

So, the approach seems to be maximizing `b` correctly.

Hence, I think the provided code is correct.
