Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for.

So, Jay created a problem of difficulty x and wants to make it the second problem for Codeforces Round #921. But Yash is worried that this might make the contest unbalanced, so he decides to break this problem into n sub-problems. Each sub-problem should have a positive integer difficulty, and the sum of all these sub-problems should equal x.

Now, the coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of all the sub-problems. Yash wants to maximize this balance.

My task is to find the maximum balance Yash can achieve by optimally choosing the difficulties of the sub-problems.

First, I need to understand what GCD is. GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder.

So, if Yash breaks down the problem into n sub-problems with difficulties a1, a2, ..., an, such that a1 + a2 + ... + an = x, I need to maximize the GCD of these ai's.

I need to think about how to choose ai's such that their sum is x and their GCD is as large as possible.

Let me consider an example to get a better understanding.

Take the first example from the problem:

x = 10, n = 3

One possible way is to have sub-problems with difficulties 4, 2, and 4. The sum is 10, and the GCD is 2.

Is there a way to get a higher GCD? Let's see.

If I choose 3, 3, and 4, sum is 10, GCD is 1.

If I choose 2, 2, and 6, sum is 10, GCD is 2.

If I choose 1, 1, and 8, sum is 10, GCD is 1.

So, the maximum GCD possible is 2.

Another example:

x = 5, n = 5

Only possible way is to have all sub-problems with difficulty 1, so GCD is 1.

Third example:

x = 420, n = 69

I need to find a way to break 420 into 69 sub-problems with maximum GCD.

First, I need a general approach that works for any x and n.

Let's think about the properties of GCD.

If the GCD of the sub-problems is d, then each ai must be a multiple of d.

So, ai = d * bi, where bi are positive integers.

Then, the sum x = d * (b1 + b2 + ... + bn)

So, d must be a divisor of x.

Also, since there are n sub-problems, the sum b1 + b2 + ... + bn must be x / d.

We need to find the maximum d such that x is divisible by d, and it's possible to have n positive integers whose sum is x / d.

Wait, since bi are positive integers, the smallest sum for n positive integers is n (when all bi = 1).

So, x / d must be at least n.

Therefore, x / d >= n, which implies d <= x / n.

So, the maximum possible d is x / n, but x and n may not be divisible, so d must be less than or equal to floor(x / n).

But, d must be a divisor of x.

So, I need to find the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to floor(x / n).

Wait, but in the first example, x = 10, n = 3, floor(10 / 3) = 3.

Divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10.

The largest divisor <= 3 is 2, which matches the answer.

In the second example, x = 5, n = 5, floor(5 / 5) = 1.

Divisors of 5 are 1, 5.

The largest divisor <= 1 is 1, which matches the answer.

In the third example, x = 420, n = 69, floor(420 / 69) = 6.

Divisors of 420 <= 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, the largest is 6, which matches the sample output.

So, this seems to be a correct approach.

Therefore, to solve the problem, I need to:

1. Find all divisors of x.

2. Find the largest divisor that is <= floor(x / n).

But, generating all divisors of x could be time-consuming if x is up to 10^8, and t is up to 10^3.

I need an efficient way to find the divisors of x.

I recall that the number of divisors of x is generally small, especially for x up to 10^8.

I can iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), and for each i that divides x, add both i and x/i to the list of divisors.

Then, sort the divisors in descending order and find the largest one that is <= floor(x / n).

But sorting might not be the most efficient way.

Alternatively, I can iterate from 1 to sqrt(x), add i and x/i, and keep track of the maximum divisor <= floor(x / n).

This way, I don't need to sort the entire list.

In the code provided, it seems to be doing something similar.

Let's look at the code:

from math import *

tc = int(input())

for _ in range(tc):

func_1()

def func_1():

(x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))

ans = 0

for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):

if x % i == 0:

if n <= x // i:

ans = max(ans, i)

if n <= i:

ans = max(ans, x // i)

print(ans)

So, it's defining a function func_1() that reads x and n, initializes ans to 0, and then iterates i from 1 to sqrt(x).

For each i that divides x, it checks if n <= x // i, and if so, sets ans to the maximum of ans and i.

Also, checks if n <= i, and if so, sets ans to the maximum of ans and x // i.

Finally, prints ans.

I need to verify if this logic correctly finds the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x / n).

Let me analyze this.

In the first example, x = 10, n = 3

floor(x / n) = 3

Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10

Largest divisor <= 3 is 2, which is correct.

In the second example, x = 5, n = 5

floor(x / n) = 1

Divisors of 5: 1, 5

Largest divisor <= 1 is 1, correct.

Third example, x = 420, n = 69

floor(x / n) = 6

Divisors of 420 <= 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

Largest is 6, correct.

Another test case: x = 12, n = 2

floor(x / n) = 6

Divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Largest <= 6 is 6, which is correct.

Another test case: x = 7, n = 1

floor(x / n) = 7

Divisors of 7: 1, 7

Largest <=7 is 7, which is correct.

Another test case: x = 8, n = 4

floor(x / n) = 2

Divisors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

Largest <=2 is 2, which is correct.

Seems like the code is working correctly for these cases.

But let's see if there are any edge cases where it might fail.

Edge case 1: x = 1, n = 1

floor(x / n) = 1

Divisors of 1: 1

Largest <=1 is 1, which is correct.

Edge case 2: x = 1, n = 1

Same as above.

Edge case 3: x = 1, n = 2

floor(x / n) = 0

But n <= x // i would not hold since x // i = 1 // i, and for i >=1, x // i <=0 only if x=0, but x=1.

Wait, x=1, n=2

In this case, it's impossible to break x=1 into 2 sub-problems with positive integers, but according to the problem, it's guaranteed that valid inputs are provided, so perhaps n <=x.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says "1 <= n <= x", so n can be up to x.

In the case x=1, n=1, it's allowed.

Another edge case: x=2, n=2

floor(x / n) = 1

Divisors of 2: 1,2

Largest <=1 is 1, which is correct.

Another edge case: x=100000000, n=1

floor(x / n) = 100000000

Divisors of 100000000 include 100000000, so ans should be 100000000, which is correct.

Another edge case: x=99999999, n=3

floor(x / n) = 33333333

Divisors of 99999999: need to check, but the code should handle it correctly.

I think the code is correctly implementing the logic to find the largest divisor of x that is <= floor(x / n).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Final Answer**

\[\boxed{\text{True}}\]
