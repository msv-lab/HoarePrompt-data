Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's read it carefully.

So, Polycarp has a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. He encodes this string using a specific algorithm:

1. First, he constructs a new auxiliary string `r`, which consists of all distinct letters of the string `s`, written in alphabetical order.

2. Then, he replaces each character in the string `s` with its symmetric character from the string `r`. That means the first character of `r` is replaced by the last of `r`, the second by the second from the end, and so on.

For example, with `s = "codeforces"`:

- `r` is obtained as "cdefors".

- Then, 'c' is replaced by 's', 'o' by 'e', 'd' by 'r', and so on, resulting in "serofedsoc".

Our task is to write a program that decodes the encoded string back to the original string `s`.

Input:

- The first line contains an integer `t` (number of test cases).

- For each test case:

- The first line contains an integer `n` (length of the string `b`).

- The second line contains the encoded string `b`.

Output:

- For each test case, output the decoded string `s`.

Constraints:

- `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`

- Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

Example:

Input:

Now, let's think about how to approach this problem.

First, understanding the encoding process is crucial. The encoding uses an auxiliary string `r`, which is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`. Then, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

So, for decoding, we need to reverse this process. Given the encoded string `b` and knowing how it was encoded, we should find the original string `s`.

But there's a catch: we don't know the original string `s` or the auxiliary string `r`. We only have the encoded string `b`.

Let me try to reverse-engineer the encoding process.

Given that `r` is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`, and the replacement is symmetric, I need to find a way to map characters from `b` back to `s`.

Wait, actually, in the encoding process, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. So, in decoding, each character in `b` should be replaced by its symmetric character in `r`, but I don't know `r`.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let's think differently.

Perhaps I can reconstruct `r` from the encoded string `b`.

Since `b` is obtained by replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`, and `r` is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`, maybe I can find `r` by looking at the unique characters in `b` and their relationships.

Wait, let's consider that `r` contains unique characters from `s`, sorted alphabetically, and the mapping is symmetric.

So, if I have `r = "cdefors"`, then the mapping is:

c -> s

d -> r

e -> o

f -> f

o -> e

r -> d

s -> c

Wait, in this case, 'f' is mapped to itself because it's in the middle.

So, the mapping is based on the positions in `r`, with the first and last characters swapping, the second and second-last swapping, and so on.

In decoding, I need to reverse this mapping, i.e., map from the encoded character back to the original character.

But I don't know `r`. So, I need to find `r` from `b`.

Let me think about the properties of `r`.

`r` is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`.

In the encoding process, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

So, in `b`, each character corresponds to a character in `s` via this symmetric mapping.

To decode, I need to apply the reverse mapping.

But without knowing `r`, how can I find the mapping?

Wait, perhaps I can find `r` by analyzing the pairs of characters in `b` and `s`.

But I don't have `s`; I only have `b`.

This seems challenging.

Let me consider that `r` is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`, and the mapping is a bijection.

So, if I can find the mapping that satisfies this property, I can decode `b` to `s`.

But I need a more concrete approach.

Maybe I can find the mapping by considering that the characters in `b` are mapped from `s` via the symmetric mapping defined by `r`.

Wait, perhaps I can find `r` by looking at the characters in `b` and their positions.

But I'm not sure.

Let me consider that `r` has a certain length, and the mapping is symmetric.

Suppose `r` has length `k`. Then, the mapping pairs the first and k-th characters, the second and (k-1)-th characters, and so on.

If `k` is odd, the middle character maps to itself.

So, in decoding, I need to reverse this mapping.

But without knowing `k` or `r`, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps I can find `r` by considering that it's the sorted list of unique characters in `s`, and `s` is the decoded string of `b`.

But that seems circular because I don't know `s`.

This is confusing.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I have the encoded string `b`, and I need to find `s`.

I know that `b` is obtained by replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`, where `r` is the sorted unique characters of `s`.

So, if I can find `r`, I can find the mapping and thus decode `b` to `s`.

But how do I find `r` without knowing `s`?

Wait, perhaps I can find `r` by analyzing the frequencies or the positions of characters in `b`.

But that seems too vague.

Let me consider that `r` is the same for all characters in `b`, as it's derived from `s`.

So, if I can find `r`, I can decode `b` to `s`.

But how?

Maybe I can iterate through all possible `r` and see which one fits, but that's not practical due to time constraints.

I need a better approach.

Let me consider the example:

Encoded `b = "serofedsoc"`

Original `s = "codeforces"`

`r = "cdefors"`

So, in this case, 's' in `b` corresponds to 'c' in `s`, 'e' corresponds to 'o', 'r' corresponds to 'd', and so on.

So, the mapping from `b` to `s` is based on the symmetric positions in `r`.

I need to reverse this mapping to get from `b` back to `s`.

But without knowing `r`, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can find `r` by considering that it's the sorted unique characters in `s`, and `s` is obtained by mapping each character in `b` back using the symmetric positions in `r`.

This seems circular again.

Let me try to think about the properties of `r`.

Since `r` is sorted, and it's the unique characters in `s`, which is obtained by decoding `b`.

But I don't know `s`.

This is problematic.

Maybe I need to consider that the mapping is a permutation, and since it's symmetric, it's an involution (i.e., its own inverse).

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can find pairs of characters in `b` and `s` based on their positions in `r`.

But again, without knowing `r`, it's difficult.

Let me consider that `r` has a certain order, and the mapping is based on that order.

If I can find a string `r` such that when I apply the symmetric mapping, I get from `s` to `b`, but I don't know `s`.

This seems like a dead end.

Maybe I need to look for a different approach.

Let's consider that `r` is a sorted list of unique characters in `s`, and the mapping is a bijection between characters in `s` and `b`.

So, perhaps I can find the mapping by considering that the first character in `r` maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.

But without knowing `r`, I can't directly apply this.

Wait, perhaps I can find `r` by analyzing the relationships between characters in `b`.

For example, if a character in `b` maps to itself, it must be in the middle of `r`.

But not all `r` have a middle character.

Only when the length is odd.

This seems too vague.

Let me consider another approach.

Suppose I create a mapping where each character in `b` is mapped to a new character, and these new characters form `s`, such that when I apply the encoding process, I get back `b`.

But this seems too abstract.

Maybe I need to consider that the mapping is a fixed transformation based on `r`, and since `r` is sorted unique characters in `s`, which is the same as the sorted unique characters in `b`, because the mapping is bijective.

Wait, is that true?

Actually, since the mapping is bijective, the unique characters in `s` and `b` should be the same.

Therefore, `r` is the same for `s` and `b`.

So, `r` is the sorted unique characters in `b`.

Wait, is that correct?

Let's see: `r` is the sorted unique characters in `s`.

But `s` is obtained by decoding `b`, and `b` is obtained by encoding `s` using `r`.

So, `r` is the sorted unique characters in `s`, which is also the sorted unique characters in `b`, because the mapping is bijective.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, `r` is the same for `s` and `b`.

Therefore, I can obtain `r` by taking the sorted unique characters from `b`.

That's a crucial insight.

So, to decode `b` to `s`, I can:

1. Obtain `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.

2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. Then, for each character in `b`, map it to the corresponding character in `s` using this symmetric mapping.

This seems correct.

Let's verify it with the example.

Example 1:

`b = "serofedsoc"`

Unique characters in `b`: 's', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'c'

Sorted unique characters: 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's' → this is `r`.

Now, the symmetric mapping is:

'c' -> 's'

'd' -> 'r'

'e' -> 'o'

'f' -> 'f'

'o' -> 'e'

'r' -> 'd'

's' -> 'c'

So, to decode `b` to `s`, I need to map each character in `b` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`:

's' -> 'c'

'e' -> 'o'

'r' -> 'd'

'o' -> 'e'

'f' -> 'f'

'e' -> 'o'

'd' -> 'r'

's' -> 'c'

'o' -> 'e'

's' -> 'c'

Which should give "codeforces", matching the original `s`.

Great, this works.

So, the approach is:

- For each test case:

- Read `n` and `b`.

- Obtain `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.

- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

- Decode `b` to `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in `s` using this mapping.

- Output `s`.

Now, let's think about implementing this efficiently, considering the constraints.

Constraints:

- `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`

- Sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

So, the total time should be O(2*10^5), which is acceptable.

Implementing this in Python should be straightforward.

I need to make sure that I handle multiple test cases efficiently, and that I correctly create the mapping for each test case.

Also, I need to ensure that the mapping is correctly established, especially when the length of `r` is odd, where the middle character maps to itself.

Let me think about how to implement the mapping.

I can create a list or a dictionary that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.

For example, for `r = 'cdefors'`, the mapping would be:

'c' -> 's'

'd' -> 'r'

'e' -> 'o'

'f' -> 'f'

'o' -> 'e'

'r' -> 'd'

's' -> 'c'

So, in code, I can create a dictionary where keys are characters in `r` and values are their symmetric counterparts.

To do this, I can iterate over the first half of `r` and pair them with the corresponding characters from the end.

If the length is odd, the middle character maps to itself.

In Python, I can do this with a loop:

for i in range(len(r)//2):

mapping[r[i]] = r[-(i+1)]

mapping[r[-(i+1)]] = r[i]

if len(r) % 2 == 1:

mapping[r[len(r)//2]] = r[len(r)//2]

This should correctly set up the mapping.

Then, to decode `b` to `s`, I can simply map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `s` using this mapping.

In Python, this can be done using a list comprehension or by mapping over the string.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Edge Cases:

1. Single character: If `b` has only one character, then `r` has one character, which maps to itself.

   - For example, `b = "w"`, then `r = "w"`, mapping 'w' -> 'w'.

   - So, `s = "w"`.

2. All characters the same: If all characters in `b` are the same, then `r` has one character, which maps to itself.

   - For example, `b = "aaa"`, then `r = "a"`, mapping 'a' -> 'a'.

   - So, `s = "aaa"`.

3. Minimal differences: If `b` has minimal differences, ensure the mapping is correctly handled.

4. Maximum input size: `n = 2 * 10^5`, need to ensure efficiency.

5. Multiple test cases: Up to `10^4` test cases, but the sum of `n` is `2 * 10^5`, so it's manageable.

I need to make sure that my implementation is efficient and doesn't have any unnecessary computations.

Now, let's look at the provided program and see if it implements this correctly.

Given Program:

```python

import sys

from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':

    num_cases = int(input().strip())

    for _ in range(num_cases):

        n = int(input().strip())

        encoded = input().strip()

        decoded = func_1(encoded)

        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:

    mapping = {}

    decoded = []

    for char in encoded:

        if char in mapping:

            decoded.append(mapping[char])

        else:

            for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):

                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():

                    mapping[char] = chr(c)

                    break

            decoded.append(chr(c))

    return ''.join(decoded)

```

Wait, this doesn't seem to implement the correct approach.

In `func_1`, it's creating a mapping where each character in `encoded` is mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', in order, ensuring that no two characters in `encoded` map to the same character.

This is clearly not the correct mapping for decoding `b` to `s`.

It seems like this is attempting to create some kind of injection from `encoded` to unique characters, but it doesn't align with the problem's encoding/decoding mechanism.

Therefore, this program is incorrect.

The correct approach, as I've reasoned earlier, is:

- For each test case:

- Obtain `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.

- Create a symmetric mapping from `r` to itself.

- Decode `b` to `s` by mapping each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `s` using this symmetric mapping.

The given program does not implement this approach, hence it's incorrect.

I need to implement the correct approach.

Here's how I would implement it:

```python

import sys

def main():

    import sys

    input = sys.stdin.read

    data = input().split()

    idx = 0

    num_cases = int(data[idx])

    idx += 1

    for _ in range(num_cases):

        n = int(data[idx])

        idx += 1

        encoded = data[idx]

        idx += 1

        r = sorted(set(encoded))

        mapping = {}

        n_r = len(r)

        for i in range(n_r // 2):

            mapping[r[i]] = r[n_r - 1 - i]

            mapping[r[n_r - 1 - i]] = r[i]

        if n_r % 2 == 1:

            mapping[r[n_r // 2]] = r[n_r // 2]

        decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)

        print(decoded)

if __name__ == '__main__':

    main()

```

In this correct implementation:

- Read all input at once for efficiency.

- For each test case:

- Read `n` and `encoded`.

- Compute `r` by sorting the unique characters in `encoded`.

- Create a symmetric mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart.

- Decode `encoded` to `s` by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character in `s` using the symmetric mapping.

- Print the decoded string `s`.

This should correctly decode `b` to `s` for each test case.

Comparing this with the given program, it's clear that the given program does not implement the correct mapping and decoding process.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
