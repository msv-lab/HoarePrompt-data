Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, there's this concept of a "good" array, and I need to determine whether certain subarrays are good based on some conditions.

First, let's understand what makes an array "good." According to the problem, an array \( a \) of length \( m \) is considered good if there exists another integer array \( b \) of the same length such that:

1. The sum of elements in \( a \) is equal to the sum of elements in \( b \): \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i \).

2. For every index \( i \), \( a_i \neq b_i \).

3. Every element in \( b \) is positive: \( b_i > 0 \) for all \( i \).

So, given an array \( c \) of length \( n \), and a series of queries, each query specifies a subarray \( c_{l_i} \) to \( c_{r_i} \), and I need to determine if this subarray is good based on the above conditions.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I need to find a way to efficiently answer multiple queries about subarrays of \( c \). Given that \( n \) and \( q \) can be up to \( 3 \times 10^5 \), I need an efficient way to compute the answers without exceeding time limits.

Let's consider the conditions for a subarray to be good.

Condition 1: The sum of \( a \) should equal the sum of \( b \).

Condition 2: For every element, \( a_i \neq b_i \).

Condition 3: All \( b_i > 0 \).

I need to find if such a \( b \) exists for a given subarray \( a \) (which is a subarray of \( c \)).

Let me try to rephrase the problem. I need to find if there's a way to adjust each \( a_i \) to some \( b_i \) such that:

- \( b_i > 0 \)

- \( b_i \neq a_i \)

- The total sum remains the same.

Wait a minute, if I have to change each \( a_i \) to some \( b_i \) such that \( b_i \neq a_i \), and the sum remains the same, and \( b_i > 0 \), what does that imply?

Let's consider that I need to adjust each \( a_i \) by some value, but the total sum should remain unchanged. That means the sum of adjustments should be zero.

But also, each \( b_i \) has to be positive and different from \( a_i \).

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can think about the minimal possible sum for \( b \), given the constraints.

Since each \( b_i > 0 \), the minimal sum for \( b \) would be when each \( b_i = 1 \). So, the minimal sum for \( b \) is \( m \), where \( m \) is the length of the subarray.

But, since \( b_i \neq a_i \), if \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i \) has to be at least 2 to be different and positive.

Wait, no. \( b_i \) just has to be different from \( a_i \), and positive. So, if \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \) can be any positive integer except 1. But to minimize the sum, I should choose the smallest possible \( b_i \), which would be 2 in this case.

Similarly, if \( a_i > 1 \), then \( b_i \) can be \( a_i - 1 \), which is still positive and different from \( a_i \).

Wait, but \( a_i - 1 \) might not always be positive. For example, if \( a_i = 1 \), then \( a_i - 1 = 0 \), which is not positive. So, for \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i \) can be \( a_i - 1 \), but for \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i \) has to be at least 2.

So, for each \( a_i \), the minimal \( b_i \) that satisfies \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq a_i \) is:

- If \( a_i > 1 \), then \( b_i = a_i - 1 \)

- If \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i = 2 \)

So, the minimal sum for \( b \) is the sum over all \( i \) of these minimal \( b_i \) values.

Now, for the subarray to be good, the sum of \( a \) should be equal to this minimal sum of \( b \).

Wait, but the problem says that \( b_i \) can be any positive integer different from \( a_i \), not necessarily the minimal one. So, the sum of \( b \) can be greater than this minimal sum, but it has to be equal to the sum of \( a \).

So, perhaps I need to check if the sum of \( a \) is at least the minimal sum of \( b \), but actually, since the sum has to be exactly equal, and I need to find if such a \( b \) exists, I need to see if the sum of \( a \) is equal to the minimal sum of \( b \).

Wait, but that might not be sufficient. Because even if the sum of \( a \) is equal to the minimal sum of \( b \), it doesn't necessarily mean that there exists a \( b \) where each \( b_i \) is different from \( a_i \) and positive.

Wait, actually, if I choose \( b_i \) to be the minimal possible value different from \( a_i \) and positive, and the sum of these minimal \( b_i \) equals the sum of \( a \), then that should be sufficient.

But let's think of a counterexample.

Suppose \( a = [1, 1, 1] \), then the minimal \( b_i \) would be [2, 2, 2], summing to 6, but sum of \( a \) is 3, which is less than 6, so it's not good, which is correct.

Another example: \( a = [2, 2, 2] \), minimal \( b_i \) would be [1, 1, 1], summing to 3, which is less than sum of \( a \), which is 6, so not good.

Wait, but according to the problem, in this case, it should be possible to choose \( b_i \) such that the sum is 6, and \( b_i \neq 2 \). For example, \( b = [1, 2, 3] \), sum is 6, and only one \( b_i \) equals \( a_i \), which violates condition 2.

Wait, no, condition 2 says \( a_i \neq b_i \) for every index. So, in \( b = [1, 2, 3] \), the second element equals \( a_i \), which is not allowed.

So, I need all \( b_i \) to be different from \( a_i \).

So, in this case, for \( a = [2, 2, 2] \), possible \( b \) could be [1, 3, 3], sum is 7, which is not equal to 6.

Alternatively, [1, 1, 4], sum is 6, but 1 == 1 in positions where \( a_i = 2 \), which is fine, but wait, \( a_i = 2 \), \( b_i = 1 \neq 2 \), which is okay.

Wait, but sum is 6, which matches sum of \( a \), and all \( b_i \neq a_i \), and \( b_i > 0 \). So, in this case, it should be good.

But according to my earlier logic, the minimal sum of \( b \) is [1,1,1], sum=3, which is less than sum of \( a \)=6, so according to my earlier thought, it should be not good, but actually, it is good.

So, my earlier logic is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me try to think in terms of adjustments.

Letâ€™s define \( d_i = b_i - a_i \). Then, \( b_i = a_i + d_i \).

Given that \( b_i \neq a_i \), so \( d_i \neq 0 \).

Also, \( b_i > 0 \), so \( a_i + d_i > 0 \), which implies \( d_i > -a_i \) (since \( a_i \) can be positive or negative, but in this problem, \( a_i \) is given to be positive).

Wait, in the problem, it says \( c_i > 0 \), but it doesn't specify whether \( a_i \) can be zero or negative. Wait, in the problem statement, it says "Each element of this array is greater than 0", referring to array \( c \), which is the array we're given, and subarrays of \( c \) are considered.

So, \( a_i > 0 \) for all \( i \).

So, \( a_i + d_i > 0 \), and \( d_i \neq 0 \).

Also, the total sum of \( b \) should equal the sum of \( a \), so \( \sum (a_i + d_i) = \sum a_i \), which implies \( \sum d_i = 0 \).

So, I need to find a set of \( d_i \), where \( d_i \neq 0 \), \( a_i + d_i > 0 \), and \( \sum d_i = 0 \).

Given that \( a_i > 0 \), and \( d_i \neq 0 \), \( a_i + d_i > 0 \), which implies \( d_i > -a_i \).

So, for each \( i \), \( d_i \) can be any integer except 0, and \( d_i > -a_i \).

And the sum of all \( d_i \) should be 0.

Now, the question is, for a given subarray \( a \), does there exist a set of \( d_i \) satisfying these conditions?

This seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way to look at it.

Let's consider the minimal possible sum of \( b \), where \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq a_i \).

For each \( a_i \):

- If \( a_i = 1 \), then \( b_i \) must be at least 2.

- If \( a_i > 1 \), then \( b_i \) can be \( a_i - 1 \), which is positive and different from \( a_i \).

So, the minimal sum of \( b \) is \( \sum (\text{if } a_i = 1 \text{ then } 2 \text{ else } a_i - 1) \).

Now, for the subarray to be good, the sum of \( a \) must be equal to this minimal sum of \( b \), because if the sum of \( a \) is less than this minimal sum, it's impossible to find such a \( b \), and if it's equal, then setting \( b_i \) to the minimal possible value satisfies all conditions.

If the sum of \( a \) is greater than this minimal sum, then perhaps there's a way to adjust some \( b_i \) to higher values to make the sum equal, but while ensuring that \( b_i \neq a_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \).

Wait, but the problem requires that \( b_i \neq a_i \) for every \( i \), so I can't just arbitrarily set \( b_i \) to \( a_i + k \) for some \( k \), because if \( k = 0 \), that would violate the condition.

So, perhaps the minimal sum approach is the way to go.

Let me think about the example provided.

In the example:

Input:

1

5 4

1 2 1 4 5

1 5

4 4

3 4

1 3

Output:

YES

NO

YES

NO

Let's compute the minimal sum of \( b \) for each subarray and compare it to the sum of \( a \).

First query: subarray from 1 to 5: [1,2,1,4,5]

Sum of \( a \): 1+2+1+4+5=13

Minimal sum of \( b \):

- For 1: minimal \( b_i = 2 \)

- For 2: minimal \( b_i = 1 \)

- For 1: minimal \( b_i = 2 \)

- For 4: minimal \( b_i = 3 \)

- For 5: minimal \( b_i = 4 \)

Total minimal sum of \( b \): 2+1+2+3+4=12

Sum of \( a \) is 13, which is greater than 12, so according to my earlier thought, it should be good, but the output is YES.

Wait, but according to my earlier flawed logic, if sum of \( a \) is greater than minimal sum of \( b \), it's good, but in the earlier counterexample, it didn't hold.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my thinking.

Let me consider that if the sum of \( a \) is greater than or equal to the minimal sum of \( b \), then it's possible to choose \( b_i \) such that the sum matches, provided that I can distribute the excess sum appropriately.

In the first query, sum of \( a \) is 13, minimal sum of \( b \) is 12, difference is 1.

I need to distribute this excess 1 among the \( b_i \), while ensuring that \( b_i \neq a_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \).

Looking at the minimal \( b \): [2,1,2,3,4]

Sum is 12, need to increase the sum by 1.

I can choose one of the \( b_i \) and increase it by 1, making sure that it doesn't become equal to \( a_i \).

For example, increase the second element from 1 to 2, but then \( b_i = 2 = a_i \), which violates condition 2.

Alternatively, increase the fifth element from 4 to 5, which is different from \( a_i = 5 \), but wait, 5 equals 5, which violates condition 2.

Wait, \( b_i \neq a_i \), so increasing 4 to 5 is not allowed because 5 equals \( a_i = 5 \).

So, I can't increase \( b_i \) that would make \( b_i = a_i \).

This seems tricky.

Another approach: perhaps the sum of \( a \) should be equal to the minimal sum of \( b \), plus the number of elements where \( a_i > 1 \).

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I calculate the minimal sum of \( b \) as follows:

For each \( a_i \):

- If \( a_i = 1 \), set \( b_i = 2 \)

- If \( a_i > 1 \), set \( b_i = a_i - 1 \)

Then, the sum of \( b \) is minimal possible while satisfying \( b_i > 0 \) and \( b_i \neq a_i \).

Now, if the sum of \( a \) is equal to this minimal sum, then setting \( b_i \) to these minimal values satisfies all conditions.

If the sum of \( a \) is greater than this minimal sum, then I need to distribute the difference across some \( b_i \), increasing them by certain amounts, while ensuring that \( b_i \neq a_i \) and \( b_i > 0 \).

This distribution must be done in such a way that no \( b_i \) becomes equal to \( a_i \).

This seems complicated, but perhaps there's a simpler condition that determines whether a subarray is good or not.

Let me consider the difference between sum of \( a \) and sum of minimal \( b \).

Letâ€™s denote \( s_a = \sum a_i \), \( s_b = \sum b_i \).

We have \( s_a = s_b \), and \( b_i \neq a_i \), \( b_i > 0 \).

From the minimal \( b_i \), \( s_b \) is at least the sum of minimal values as defined earlier.

If \( s_a < s_b \), it's impossible to find such a \( b \), so the subarray is not good.

If \( s_a = s_b \), then setting \( b_i \) to the minimal values works, provided that no \( b_i \) equals \( a_i \), which is already ensured in the minimal \( b_i \) selection.

If \( s_a > s_b \), then I need to distribute the difference \( d = s_a - s_b \) across the \( b_i \)'s by increasing some of them, while ensuring that \( b_i \neq a_i \) for all \( i \).

This seems feasible as long as \( d \) can be distributed in such a way that no \( b_i \) becomes equal to \( a_i \).

Wait, but in some cases, it might not be possible.

For example, consider \( a = [1,1,1] \), sum is 3.

Minimal \( b = [2,2,2] \), sum is 6.

Difference \( d = 3 - 6 = -3 \), which is negative, so not good (which matches the earlier thought).

Another example: \( a = [2,2,2] \), sum is 6.

Minimal \( b = [1,1,1] \), sum is 3.

Difference \( d = 6 - 3 = 3 \).

Now, I need to distribute this 3 across the \( b_i \)'s, increasing some of them, but ensuring that none of them become equal to \( a_i = 2 \).

So, possible adjustments:

- Increase first \( b_i \) from 1 to 2: but 2 equals \( a_i = 2 \), which is invalid.

- Increase second \( b_i \) from 1 to 3: now \( b_i = 3 \neq 2 \), which is valid.

- Increase third \( b_i \) from 1 to 3: similarly valid.

So, if I increase two of the \( b_i \)'s from 1 to 3, sum becomes 1 + 3 + 3 = 7, which is more than 6.

Alternatively, increase one \( b_i \) by 3: but if I increase one \( b_i \) from 1 to 4, which is valid.

But in this case, sum would be 1 + 1 + 4 = 6, which matches \( s_a = 6 \), and all \( b_i \neq a_i \).

So, in this case, it's possible, hence should be "YES", but in the earlier thought process, I had confusion.

Wait, but in my initial approach, I thought that if \( s_a \geq s_b \), it's good, but in this example, \( s_a = 6 \), \( s_b = 3 \), \( s_a > s_b \), and it's good.

But in the earlier flawed example, I thought that \( s_a = s_b \) is necessary, which is not the case.

So, perhaps the correct condition is that \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that the difference \( d = s_a - s_b \) can be distributed in a way that doesn't make any \( b_i = a_i \).

In the case where \( s_a = s_b \), it's straightforward: set \( b_i \) to minimal values.

When \( s_a > s_b \), I need to distribute the excess sum across some \( b_i \)'s, increasing them by certain amounts, while ensuring that none of them become equal to \( a_i \).

This seems manageable if there are enough \( b_i \)'s that can be increased without hitting \( a_i \).

Wait, in the earlier example, \( a = [2,2,2] \), minimal \( b = [1,1,1] \), \( s_a = 6 \), \( s_b = 3 \), \( d = 3 \).

I can increase one \( b_i \) from 1 to 4, making \( b = [1,1,4] \), sum is 6, and all \( b_i \neq a_i \), which works.

Another way: increase two \( b_i \)'s from 1 to 3, making \( b = [1,3,3] \), sum is 7, which is more than 6, so not suitable.

Wait, but I can choose to increase only one \( b_i \) by 3 to make it 4.

So, in general, as long as there is at least one \( b_i \) that can be increased by the required amount without becoming equal to \( a_i \), it should be possible.

Wait, but in the case where all \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i = 2 \), and \( s_a = n \times 1 = n \), \( s_b = n \times 2 = 2n \).

If \( s_a < s_b \), which is always the case when \( n \geq 1 \), then it's not good, which matches the earlier thought.

Wait, but in this case, \( s_a < s_b \), so it's not good, which is correct.

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [2,2,2] \), \( s_a = 6 \), \( s_b = 3 \), \( s_a > s_b \), and it's good.

So, perhaps the condition is that \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that there exists a way to distribute the difference without making any \( b_i = a_i \).

But in the case where \( a_i = 1 \), minimal \( b_i = 2 \), and \( s_a = n \), \( s_b = 2n \), which is greater than \( s_a \), so \( s_a < s_b \), hence not good.

In the case where \( a_i > 1 \), minimal \( b_i = a_i - 1 \), so \( s_b = s_a - m \), where \( m \) is the number of elements.

Then, \( s_a - s_b = m \), which is positive if \( m > 0 \), so \( s_a > s_b \), and it should be good if I can distribute the difference without making any \( b_i = a_i \).

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [2,2,2] \), \( s_a = 6 \), \( s_b = 3 \), \( d = 3 \), and I can distribute it by increasing one \( b_i \) by 3 to make it 4, which is valid.

But what if \( a = [3,3,3] \), \( s_a = 9 \), minimal \( b = [2,2,2] \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( d = 3 \).

I can increase one \( b_i \) by 3 to make it 5, which is valid, since 5 != 3.

Alternatively, increase two \( b_i \)'s by 1 and 2, making them 3 and 4, but 3 equals \( a_i = 3 \), which is invalid.

Wait, but 3 equals \( a_i = 3 \), which violates condition 2.

So, in this case, increasing one \( b_i \) by 3 to make it 5 works.

Hence, it's good.

Another example: \( a = [1,3,3] \), \( s_a = 7 \), minimal \( b = [2,2,2] \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( d = 1 \).

I need to increase the sum of \( b \) by 1, so I can increase one \( b_i \) by 1.

If I increase the first \( b_i \) from 2 to 3, which is different from \( a_i = 1 \), which is valid.

Alternatively, increasing the second \( b_i \) from 2 to 3, different from \( a_i = 3 \), which is invalid.

Wait, \( b_i = 3 \) equals \( a_i = 3 \), which violates condition 2.

So, I can't increase the second or third \( b_i \) by 1, because that would make \( b_i = 3 \), which equals \( a_i = 3 \).

So, the only option is to increase the first \( b_i \) from 2 to 3, which is different from \( a_i = 1 \), which is valid.

Hence, it's good.

Wait, but in this case, \( s_a = 7 \), \( s_b = 6 \), and I can only increase the first \( b_i \) by 1 to make it 3, which is valid.

So, it's good.

Another example: \( a = [1,1,1] \), \( s_a = 3 \), minimal \( b = [2,2,2] \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( s_a < s_b \), so not good.

So, perhaps the general condition is:

- If \( s_a < s_b \), not good.

- If \( s_a \geq s_b \), and there exists at least one \( b_i \) such that increasing \( b_i \) by some amount doesn't make \( b_i = a_i \), then it's good.

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [3,3,3] \), \( s_a = 9 \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( d = 3 \), and I can increase one \( b_i \) by 3 to make it 5, which is valid.

In another example with \( a = [1,3,3] \), \( s_a = 7 \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( d = 1 \), and I can only increase the first \( b_i \) by 1 to make it 3, which is different from \( a_i = 1 \), hence valid.

But what if \( a = [1,2,1] \), \( s_a = 4 \), minimal \( b = [2,1,2] \), \( s_b = 5 \), \( s_a < s_b \), which is not good, as per the earlier thought.

Wait, but in this case, \( s_a = 4 \), \( s_b = 5 \), \( d = 4 - 5 = -1 \), which is negative, so not good.

Wait, but according to the earlier example, for subarray [1,2,1], which is from index 1 to 3, the output is NO, which matches this.

So, perhaps the condition is:

- If \( s_a < s_b \), not good.

- If \( s_a = s_b \), good.

- If \( s_a > s_b \), and there exists a way to distribute the difference without making any \( b_i = a_i \), then it's good.

But how to efficiently check this for multiple queries?

I need a way to compute, for each subarray, whether \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that there's at least one \( b_i \) that can absorb the excess difference without equalling \( a_i \).

Wait, perhaps it's sufficient to check if \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that the subarray has more than one element, or in some specific cases.

Wait, in the earlier example with \( a = [2] \), \( s_a = 2 \), minimal \( b = [1] \), \( s_b = 1 \), \( d = 1 \), but I can't increase \( b_i \) from 1 to 3, because \( b_i = 3 \neq a_i = 2 \), which is valid.

Wait, but \( a_i = 2 \), \( b_i = 3 \), which is valid.

Hence, it's good.

But if \( a = [1] \), \( s_a = 1 \), minimal \( b = [2] \), \( s_b = 2 \), \( s_a < s_b \), not good.

So, perhaps the general condition is:

- If \( s_a < s_b \), not good.

- Else, it's good, provided that for each \( b_i \), increasing it doesn't make it equal to \( a_i \), which can be managed as long as there's at least one \( b_i \) that can be increased without equalling \( a_i \).

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [3,3,3] \), \( s_a = 9 \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( d = 3 \), and I can increase one \( b_i \) from 2 to 5, which is valid.

Similarly, in \( a = [1,3,3] \), \( s_a = 7 \), \( s_b = 6 \), \( d = 1 \), and I can increase the first \( b_i \) from 2 to 3, which is valid since \( a_i = 1 \neq 3 \).

But what if \( a = [2,2] \), \( s_a = 4 \), minimal \( b = [1,1] \), \( s_b = 2 \), \( d = 2 \).

I can increase one \( b_i \) by 2 to make it 3, which is valid, since 3 != 2.

Alternatively, increase both \( b_i \)'s by 1 to make them 2, but 2 == \( a_i = 2 \), which is invalid.

So, in this case, I must increase one \( b_i \) by 2 to make it 3, and leave the other \( b_i = 1 \), which is valid.

Hence, it's good.

Another example: \( a = [1,2] \), \( s_a = 3 \), minimal \( b = [2,1] \), \( s_b = 3 \), \( d = 0 \), which matches, so it's good.

Wait, but according to earlier minimal \( b \), for \( a = [1,2] \), minimal \( b = [2,1] \), sum is 3, which equals \( s_a = 3 \), so it's good.

Another example: \( a = [1,1] \), \( s_a = 2 \), minimal \( b = [2,2] \), \( s_b = 4 \), \( s_a < s_b \), not good.

So, it seems that as long as \( s_a \geq s_b \), and I can distribute the difference without making any \( b_i = a_i \), it's good.

But how to efficiently compute this for multiple queries?

I need an efficient way to compute, for each subarray, whether \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that the difference can be distributed appropriately.

Given that \( n \) and \( q \) can be up to \( 3 \times 10^5 \), I need an \( O(n + q) \) solution.

Let me think about precomputing some prefix sums.

First, I can precompute the prefix sums of \( a \), so that I can compute the sum of any subarray in constant time.

Similarly, I can precompute the prefix sums of the minimal \( b \), which I'll call \( s_b \), and then for any subarray, compute \( s_a \) and \( s_b \), and check if \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that the difference can be distributed without making any \( b_i = a_i \).

But how to handle the distribution of the difference?

Wait, perhaps it's sufficient to check if \( s_a \geq s_b \), and that the difference \( d = s_a - s_b \) can be distributed among the \( b_i \)'s without making any \( b_i = a_i \).

In other words, for each \( b_i \), the amount I can increase it by is any positive integer, as long as \( b_i + k \neq a_i \), where \( k \) is the amount increased.

This seems complicated to handle directly.

Let me consider that for each \( b_i \), the possible increases are all positive integers except \( a_i - b_i \), if \( a_i - b_i > 0 \).

Wait, perhaps there's a simpler way.

Letâ€™s consider that if the subarray has more than one element, then it's easier to distribute the difference without hitting \( b_i = a_i \) for some \( i \).

In the earlier example with \( a = [2,2] \), I had to increase one \( b_i \) by 2 to make it 3, which was valid.

If the subarray has only one element, like \( a = [2] \), then I have to increase \( b_i \) by \( d \) to make \( b_i = a_i + d \), and ensure that \( b_i \neq a_i \), which is possible as long as \( d \neq 0 \), but \( d = s_a - s_b \), which is not necessarily != 0.

Wait, in the case of a single element, \( a = [2] \), \( s_a = 2 \), \( s_b = 1 \), \( d = 1 \), so \( b_i = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which equals \( a_i = 2 \), which is invalid.

So, in this case, it's not possible, hence not good.

Wait, but according to earlier thoughts, if \( a = [2] \), \( s_a = 2 \), \( s_b = 1 \), \( d = 1 \), and I try to set \( b_i = 2 \), which equals \( a_i = 2 \), which is invalid.

So, in this case, it's not good.

Hence, for subarrays of size 1, if \( s_a > s_b \), but increasing \( b_i \) to match \( s_a \) makes \( b_i = a_i \), then it's not good.

So, perhaps for subarrays of size 1, it's only good if \( s_a = s_b \), and \( b_i \neq a_i \).

Wait, but in the minimal \( b_i \), for \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i = 2 \), which is different from \( a_i = 1 \), and for \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i = a_i - 1 \), which is different from \( a_i \).

So, for subarrays of size 1:

- If \( a_i = 1 \), \( b_i = 2 \), \( s_b = 2 \). If \( s_a = 1 < 2 \), not good.

- If \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i = a_i - 1 \), \( s_b = a_i - 1 \). If \( s_a = a_i \), then \( d = 1 \), but setting \( b_i = a_i \), which is invalid.

Hence, for subarrays of size 1, it's only good if \( a_i > 1 \) and \( s_a = s_b \), but \( s_b = a_i - 1 \), which is less than \( s_a = a_i \), so \( s_a > s_b \), but as we saw, it's not good because setting \( b_i = a_i \) is invalid.

Hence, for subarrays of size 1, it's never good.

Wait, but in the earlier example, for \( a = [2] \), it should be not good, which matches this.

Similarly, for \( a = [1] \), it's not good.

Hence, for subarrays of size 1, it's always not good.

So, in general, for subarrays of size greater than 1, if \( s_a \geq s_b \), and the difference can be distributed without making any \( b_i = a_i \), it's good.

For subarrays of size 1, it's not good.

Hence, perhaps the condition is:

- If the subarray length is 1, output NO.

- Else, if \( s_a \geq s_b \), output YES; else, NO.

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [1,2,1] \), subarray from 1 to 3, \( a = [1,2,1] \), \( s_a = 4 \), \( s_b = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 \), \( s_a < s_b \), so not good, which matches.

Another example: \( a = [4,2] \), \( s_a = 6 \), \( s_b = 3 + 1 = 4 \), \( d = 2 \), can I distribute 2 across two \( b_i \)'s without making any \( b_i = a_i \)?

- Increase first \( b_i \) from 3 to 4, which is different from \( a_i = 4 \), valid.

- Leave second \( b_i = 1 \), which is different from \( a_i = 2 \), valid.

Hence, sum becomes 4 + 1 = 5, which is more than 6.

Wait, I need to distribute exactly 2, so increase first \( b_i \) by 2 to make it 5, which is different from \( a_i = 4 \), valid.

Hence, sum becomes 5 + 1 = 6, which matches \( s_a = 6 \), and all \( b_i \neq a_i \), so it's good.

Hence, the condition seems to hold.

Therefore, the general rule is:

- If the subarray length is 1, output NO.

- Else, compute \( s_b \) as sum of minimal \( b_i \)'s, and if \( s_a \geq s_b \), output YES; else, NO.

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [2,2] \), \( s_a = 4 \), \( s_b = 1 + 1 = 2 \), \( s_a > s_b \), and it's good.

Another example: \( a = [1,1] \), \( s_a = 2 \), \( s_b = 2 + 2 = 4 \), \( s_a < s_b \), not good.

Hence, this seems to hold.

Hence, in code, I can precompute the prefix sums of \( a \), and the prefix sums of minimal \( b_i \)'s.

Then, for each query, compute \( s_a \) and \( s_b \) for the subarray, and check if the subarray length is greater than 1 and \( s_a \geq s_b \), then output YES; else, NO.

Wait, but in the earlier example with \( a = [2] \), which is length 1, \( s_a = 2 \), \( s_b = 1 \), \( s_a > s_b \), but it's not good, because subarray length is 1.

Hence, the condition is:

- If subarray length is 1, output NO.

- Else, if \( s_a \geq s_b \), output YES; else, NO.

Hence, in code, I need to compute prefix sums for \( a \), and prefix sums for minimal \( b_i \)'s.

Then, for each query, compute \( s_a \) and \( s_b \), and check the above condition.

Now, let's look at the given program and see if it implements this correctly.

Looking at the code:

from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):

func_1()

def func_1():

(n, q) = map(int, input().split())

a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]

b = [0] * (n + 1)

for i in range(1, n + 1):

x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2

b[i] = b[i - 1] + x

a = list(accumulate(a))

print(*a)

for _ in range(q):

(x, y) = map(int, input().split())

print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')

Wait, there are a few issues here.

First, it's printing the accumulated sum of \( a \), which is not necessary for the solution, and might be a debugging leftover.

Second, in the loop where it computes \( b \), it sets \( x = 1 \) if \( a[i] > 1 \), else 2, and accumulates \( b \).

This corresponds to the minimal \( b_i \) as we discussed: if \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i = a_i - 1 \), else \( b_i = 2 \).

Wait, no, if \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i = a_i - 1 \), else \( b_i = 2 \).

But in the code, it's setting \( x = 1 \) if \( a[i] > 1 \), else 2, and accumulating \( b \).

Wait, that's incorrect.

Because if \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i = a_i - 1 \), which could be any value greater than or equal to 1, depending on \( a_i \).

But in the code, it's setting \( x = 1 \) if \( a[i] > 1 \), else 2.

Hence, it's incorrectly assuming that for \( a_i > 1 \), \( b_i = 1 \), which is not correct.

For example, if \( a_i = 4 \), then \( b_i = 3 \), not 1.

Hence, this is a mistake in the code.

Hence, the code is incorrect because it miscalculates the minimal \( b_i \).

Hence, Correctness: False

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
