Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Vlad wants to hold m rounds of something, and each round needs one problem of each difficulty level: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. That means, for each round, he needs one of each of these seven levels.

Now, he already has a bank of n problems, each with one of these difficulty levels. But it's possible that he doesn't have enough problems for all m rounds, so he might need to create some new problems. The goal is to figure out the minimum number of new problems he needs to create to have enough for m rounds.

Let's look at the example to understand better. If m=1, n=10, and the problems are 'BGECDCBDED', we need to have one of each: A, B, C, D, E, F, G. In the given string, we have:

- B: appears 3 times

- G: appears 1 time

- E: appears 3 times

- C: appears 2 times

- D: appears 2 times

- F: appears 1 time

- A: appears 0 times

Since m=1, we need at least one of each. Looking at the counts:

- A: 0, needs 1

- B: 3, already has more than needed

- C: 2, has enough

- D: 2, has enough

- E: 3, has enough

- F: 1, has enough

- G: 1, has enough

So, only A is missing, and F is present, so actually, A and F are needed, but in the example, it says he needs to come up with two problems: one A and one F. Wait, but F is already present once, so why does he need to come up with F again?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood. Let's read the problem again. Each round needs one of each difficulty. If m=1, then he needs one A, one B, one C, one D, one E, one F, and one G. From the problems he has:

- B: 3

- G: 1

- E: 3

- C: 2

- D: 2

- F: 1

- A: 0

So, for m=1, he needs:

- A: 1 (but has 0, so needs to create 1 A)

- B: 1 (has 3, so enough)

- C: 1 (has 2, enough)

- D: 1 (has 2, enough)

- E: 1 (has 3, enough)

- F: 1 (has 1, enough)

- G: 1 (has 1, enough)

So, he only needs to create 1 A. But the example says he needs to come up with two problems: one A and one F. Maybe I miscounted F. Let's check the string again: 'BGECDCBDED'

B G E C D C B D E D

So, counts are:

- B: 3

- G: 1

- E: 3

- C: 2

- D: 3

- F: 0 (wait, I thought F was 1, but looking back, there's no F in the string)

Wait, now I'm confused. Let's count again:

B G E C D C B D E D

B: positions 1,7

G: position 2

E: positions 3,9,10

C: positions 4,6

D: positions 5,8

So, B:2, G:1, E:3, C:2, D:2

No F's in there. So, he needs to create one A and one F, totaling two new problems.

Okay, that makes sense now. So, for m=1, he needs:

- A:1 (has 0, needs to create 1)

- F:1 (has 0, needs to create 1)

- Others are sufficient.

So, total new problems needed: 2.

Got it.

Now, for m=2, he would need two of each level: A,A,B,B,C,C,D,D,E,E,F,F,G,G.

So, for m=2, with the same problem set, he would need to create more.

Let's see.

Wait, the second test case is m=2, n=10, a='BGECDCBDED'

From previous counts:

- B:2

- G:1

- E:3

- C:2

- D:3

- A:0

- F:0

For m=2, he needs:

- A:2 (has 0, needs to create 2)

- B:2 (has 2, enough)

- C:2 (has 2, enough)

- D:2 (has 3, enough)

- E:2 (has 3, enough)

- F:2 (has 0, needs to create 2)

- G:2 (has 1, needs to create 1)

Total new problems needed: 2 A's + 2 F's + 1 G = 5, which matches the second output in the example.

Great, that makes sense.

And the third test case: m=1, n=9, a='BBCDEFFGG'

Counts:

- B:2

- C:1

- D:1

- E:1

- F:2

- G:2

- A:0

Needs for m=1:

- A:1 (has 0, create 1)

- B:1 (has 2, enough)

- C:1 (has 1, enough)

- D:1 (has 1, enough)

- E:1 (has 1, enough)

- F:1 (has 2, enough)

- G:1 (has 2, enough)

So, only need to create 1 A, which matches the third output.

Perfect.

So, the general approach is:

1. Count the frequency of each difficulty level in the given problems.

2. For each difficulty level (A to G), calculate how many more problems are needed to reach the required number for m rounds. That is, if the required number is m and he has k problems of that difficulty, he needs max(m - k, 0) more.

3. Sum up these deficiencies across all difficulty levels to get the total number of new problems needed.

Now, looking at the given program:

from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())

while t > 0:

t -= 1

d = defaultdict(default_value)

(n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))

s = input()

for i in range(n):

d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1

ans = 0

for val in d.keys():

if d[val] <= m:

ans = ans + m - d[val]

print(ans)

def func_1():

return 0

There are a few issues here.

First, 'default_value' is not defined. It should be defaultdict(int) to initialize missing keys with 0.

Second, the logic in the loop is incorrect. It adds m - d[val] for each difficulty level that has d[val] <= m. But this doesn't account for the fact that some difficulty levels might not be present in the dictionary at all.

Wait, actually, since it's a defaultdict, missing keys will be 0. But the condition if d[val] <= m: ans += m - d[val] is not quite right.

Because for each difficulty level, regardless of whether it's present or not, we need to check how many more are needed to reach m.

But in the current code, it only checks the levels that are present in the dictionary, which might miss levels that are not present at all.

For example, if a certain difficulty level isn't in the string, its count is 0, and m - 0 = m, so we need to add m to ans.

But in the code, it only iterates over the keys that are present in the dictionary, which might not include all seven difficulty levels.

So, it's possible that some difficulty levels are missing from the dictionary, and thus their deficiency isn't being accounted for.

To fix this, we need to iterate over all seven difficulty levels (A to G), check their counts, and calculate the deficiency for each.

Also, in the example where m=1 and the string has no A's and no F's, the code should add 1 for A and 1 for F, totaling 2, which matches the example.

But in the current code, if a difficulty level isn't present in the dictionary, it won't be included in d.keys(), so its deficiency won't be added to ans.

Therefore, the code is incorrect.

A better approach would be to iterate over all possible difficulty levels (A to G), check their counts in the dictionary, and add m - d[val] if d[val] < m.

Wait, actually, since d is a defaultdict(int), missing keys will have a count of 0, so d[val] for missing levels will be 0.

So, in the loop, for val in ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G']:

if d[val] < m:

ans += m - d[val]

This would correctly account for all difficulty levels, including those not present in the string.

In the current code, it's iterating over d.keys(), which may not include all seven levels, hence missing some deficiencies.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
