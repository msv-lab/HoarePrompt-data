Alright, I have this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, Nikita has a word consisting of exactly three lowercase Latin letters. Each letter has a position in the alphabet from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, up to 'z' is 26. He encodes the word by summing up the positions of its letters. For example, "cat" is 3 + 1 + 20 = 24.

But the problem is that this encoding can be ambiguous because different words can have the same sum. For example, "ava" also sums to 24. So, given an encoded number n, I need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded to that number.

First, I need to understand what lexicographical order means. It's basically dictionary order. So, the smallest word is the one that would appear first in a dictionary. For example, "aav" comes before "aba" because 'v' comes before 'b' in the alphabet.

Given that, I need to find three letters a, b, c such that a + b + c = n, and among all possible combinations that satisfy this, I need the one where a is as small as possible, then b is as small as possible, and then c.

So, to minimize the word lexicographically, I should minimize the first letter, then the second, and then the third.

Let's think about how to approach this.

I can iterate through all possible values of a from 1 to 26, and for each a, iterate through all possible values of b from 1 to 26, and then set c = n - a - b, and check if c is between 1 and 26.

But this approach is inefficient, especially since t can be up to 100 and n can be up to 78. But perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me think about it differently. To get the lexicographically smallest word, I should minimize the first letter as much as possible, then the second, and so on.

So, start with the first letter as 'a' (1), and then find the smallest possible second letter, and so on.

Let me try to formalize this.

Let's denote the three letters as x, y, z, where x <= y <= z to ensure lexicographical order.

Wait, no, lexicographical order doesn't necessarily mean x <= y <= z. It just means that among all combinations with x as small as possible, we choose the smallest y, and then the smallest z that satisfies x + y + z = n.

Actually, to minimize the word lexicographically, I should choose the smallest possible x, then the smallest possible y given x, and then z is determined as n - x - y, provided that z is between 1 and 26.

So, here's a plan:

1. Iterate x from 1 to 26:

a. For each x, iterate y from 1 to 26:

i. Set z = n - x - y

ii. If z is between 1 and 26, include this combination.

iii. Among all such combinations, choose the one with the smallest x, then smallest y, then z is determined.

But since we're iterating x and y in increasing order, the first valid combination we find should be the lexicographically smallest one.

Wait, but to make sure, maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider that to minimize the word lexicographically, I should minimize the first letter as much as possible.

So, set x to 1 ( 'a' ), then minimize y, and set z = n - 1 - y.

I need to ensure that z is between 1 and 26.

So, for x = 1, y can be from 1 to min(26, n - 1 - 1), and z = n - 1 - y.

I need to choose the smallest y such that z is between 1 and 26.

So, y should be as small as possible, but also n - 1 - y should be at least 1 and at most 26.

So, n - 1 - y >= 1 => y <= n - 2

And n - 1 - y <= 26 => y >= n - 27

Also, y must be between 1 and 26.

So, y should be in the range max(1, n - 27) to min(26, n - 2)

But to minimize y, I should take the smallest possible y within this range, which is max(1, n - 27).

But I need to ensure that y is within these bounds.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider specific examples.

Let's take n = 24, like in the example.

So, x = 1 ( 'a' ), y starts from 1.

Then z = 24 - 1 - 1 = 22 ( 'v' ). So, the word is "aav".

Is there a smaller word than "aav"? Let's see.

If x = 1, y = 1, z = 22 → "aav"

If x = 1, y = 2, z = 21 → "aab"

Wait, "aab" is larger than "aav" because 'b' comes after 'v'.

Wait, no, wait, 'b' is after 'v' in the alphabet?

Wait, no, 'v' is after 'b'. So "aab" is smaller than "aav"?

Wait, no, in lexicographical order, "aab" comes before "aav" because 'a' < 'a', and 'a' < 'v'.

Wait, but in the example, for n = 24, the output is "aav", but according to this, "aab" should be smaller.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, let's check the sums:

"aab" → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is not 24.

Oh, wait, n = 24 is "cat" → 3 + 1 + 20 = 24, and "ava" → 1 + 22 + 1 = 24.

So, in the example, the output is "aav" for n = 24.

But according to my logic, "aab" would be 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is not 24.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach.

Let me try to find a general solution.

Given n, I need to find x, y, z such that x + y + z = n, with x, y, z between 1 and 26, and the word is lexicographically smallest.

So, to minimize the word, minimize x first, then y, then z.

So, set x to 1 if possible.

Then, set y to 1 if possible.

Then, z = n - 1 - 1 = n - 2.

But z must be between 1 and 26.

So, if n - 2 >= 1 and n - 2 <= 26, then z is valid.

So, for n >= 3 and n <= 52, this should work.

Wait, but n can be up to 78.

Wait, 26 + 26 + 26 = 78.

So, for n = 78, the word is "zzz".

For n = 3, it's "aaa".

Okay, so for x = 1, y =1, z = n - 2.

If z > 26, then set y to a higher value.

Wait, if z > 26, that means n - 1 - y > 26, so y < n - 27.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me try to find the minimal y given x =1.

Given x=1, y should be as small as possible, but z = n -1 -y should be at least 1 and at most 26.

So, z >=1 => y <= n -2

And z <=26 => y >= n - 27

Also, y >=1 and y <=26.

So, y should be in the range max(1, n -27) to min(26, n -2)

To minimize y, set y = max(1, n -27)

But need to ensure y <= min(26, n -2)

Wait, maybe it's better to consider different cases based on n.

Case 1: n <= 27 + 2 = 29

In this case, n -27 >=1, so y = n -27

But need to ensure y <=26 and y <= n -2

Wait, maybe it's getting too complicated.

Let me try to think differently.

To get the smallest lexicographical word, assign the smallest possible letters to the earlier positions.

So, assign 'a' (1) to the first letter if possible, then assign 'a' to the second letter if possible, and so on.

So, for n = 24, "aav" is the smallest because:

- First letter 'a' (1)

- Second letter 'a' (1)

- Third letter 'v' (22)

But "aab" is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, which is not 24.

So, why is "aav" the smallest for n=24?

Wait, perhaps I need to minimize the first letter, then the second, then the third.

So, for n=24:

- Set x=1 ('a')

- Then set y=1 ('a')

- Then z=22 ('v')

- So, "aav"

Is there any combination with x=1, y=2 ('b'), z=21 ('u') → "abu"

Which is larger than "aav" because 'b' > 'a'

Wait, but 'b' is after 'a' in the alphabet, so "abu" is larger than "aav".

Wait, no, in lexicographical order, "aav" comes before "abu" because the second letter 'a' < 'b'.

So, "aav" is indeed smaller than "abu".

Similarly, "aab" is 1 +1 +2=4, which is not 24.

So, for n=24, "aav" is correct.

Another example: n=3 → "aaa"

n=78 → "zzz"

n=70 → "rzz"

n=55 → "czz"

n=48 → "auz"

Okay, now, looking at the provided program, let's see what it does.

The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads n, initializes an empty list arr, then in a loop for j in range(2):

- if lex <=26: append 1, and set lex = lex -1

- elif lex <52: append 26, set lex = lex -26

- else: append 26, set lex = lex -26

Then, append lex to arr, sort arr, and print the corresponding letters.

Wait, this seems problematic.

Let's take n=24.

Initialize arr=[], lex=24

First iteration j=0:

24 <=26 → append 1, lex=24-1=23

Second iteration j=1:

23 <=26 → append 1, lex=23-1=22

Then, append 22 to arr, so arr=[1,1,22]

Sort arr → [1,1,22]

Print 'a','a','v' → "aav"

Which matches the example.

Another example, n=70

Initialize arr=[], lex=70

First iteration j=0:

70 <=26? No

70 <52? 70 <52? 52 is 4*26, but 70 is greater than 52.

Wait, 26*2=52, 26*3=78.

So, 70 - 26*2 =70-52=18

So, j=0:

70 <=26? No

70 <52? 70<52? No

So, append 26, lex=70-26=44

j=1:

44 <=26? No

44 <52? Yes

Append 26, lex=44-26=18

Then, append 18 to arr, so arr=[26,26,18]

Sort arr → [18,26,26]

Which corresponds to 's','z','z' → "szz"

But in the example, for n=70, it's "rzz".

So, there's a mistake here.

Wait, 'r' is 18, 'z' is 26.

So, "rzz" is [18,26,26]

But according to the program, it's sorting [18,26,26] to [18,26,26], which is "rzz".

But according to the example, it's "rzz".

Wait, but in the program, it's printing the sorted array, which would be 'r','z','z' → "rzz"

Which matches the example.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought arr would be [26,26,18], sorted to [18,26,26], which is "rzz".

But according to the example, it's correct.

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought arr would be [26,26,18], sorted to [18,26,26], which is "rzz".

But according to the program, it's appending 18 after the two 26's, then sorting.

Wait, but in the program, it's appending lex after the loop, so arr.append(lex), then sort arr.

In the case of n=70, after two iterations, lex=18, so arr=[26,26,18], sorted to [18,26,26], which is "rzz", matching the example.

Similarly, for n=3:

arr=[], lex=3

j=0:

3 <=26 → append 1, lex=3-1=2

j=1:

2 <=26 → append 1, lex=2-1=1

append 1 to arr → [1,1,1], sorted to [1,1,1] → "aaa"

Correct.

For n=55:

arr=[], lex=55

j=0:

55 <=26? No

55 <52? 52 is 4*26=104, wait, 26*2=52.

55 <52? No

So, append 26, lex=55-26=29

j=1:

29 <=26? No

29 <52? Yes

Append 26, lex=29-26=3

append 3 to arr → [26,26,3], sorted to [3,26,26] → 'c','z','z' → "czz"

Which matches the example.

For n=48:

arr=[], lex=48

j=0:

48 <=26? No

48 <52? Yes

Append 26, lex=48-26=22

j=1:

22 <=26? Yes

Append 1, lex=22-1=21

append 21 to arr → [26,1,21], sorted to [1,21,26] → 'a','u','z' → "auz"

Which matches the example.

Wait, but according to the example, for n=48, it's "auz".

But according to the program, it's "auz".

Wait, but in my earlier thought, I thought it should be [26,1,21], sorted to [1,21,26] → "auz"

But in the example, it's "auz".

So, it seems correct.

Wait, but in the problem statement, for n=48, it's "auz"

But according to the program, it's "auz"

So, it's correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought for n=70, it's "rzz", which matches the example.

So, perhaps the program is correct.

But earlier I thought there was a mistake, but actually, it's correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently.

Let me see the logic behind the program.

The program seems to be trying to maximize the first two letters, and then set the last letter accordingly.

Wait, but no, it's appending 1 when lex <=26, and 26 when lex >26.

Wait, but in the case of n=24:

arr=[], lex=24

j=0:

24 <=26 → append 1, lex=23

j=1:

23 <=26 → append 1, lex=22

append 22 to arr → [1,1,22], sorted to [1,1,22] → "aav"

Which is correct.

For n=70:

arr=[], lex=70

j=0:

70 <=26? No, 70 <52? 52 is 26*2=52, 70<52? No, so append 26, lex=70-26=44

j=1:

44 <=26? No, 44<52? Yes, so append 26, lex=44-26=18

append 18 to arr → [26,26,18], sorted to [18,26,26] → "rzz"

Which is correct.

Similarly, for n=55:

arr=[], lex=55

j=0:

55 <=26? No, 55<52? 52 is 26*2=52, 55<52? No, so append 26, lex=55-26=29

j=1:

29 <=26? No, 29<52? Yes, so append 26, lex=29-26=3

append 3 to arr → [26,26,3], sorted to [3,26,26] → "czz"

Correct.

For n=48:

arr=[], lex=48

j=0:

48 <=26? No, 48<52? Yes, so append 26, lex=48-26=22

j=1:

22 <=26? Yes, so append 1, lex=22-1=21

append 21 to arr → [26,1,21], sorted to [1,21,26] → "auz"

Correct.

So, in all these cases, it's giving the correct answer.

But is this always the case?

Let me think about n=3:

arr=[], lex=3

j=0:

3 <=26 → append 1, lex=3-1=2

j=1:

2 <=26 → append 1, lex=2-1=1

append 1 to arr → [1,1,1], sorted to [1,1,1] → "aaa"

Correct.

Another test case: n=78

arr=[], lex=78

j=0:

78 <=26? No, 78<52? No, so append 26, lex=78-26=52

j=1:

52 <=26? No, 52<52? No, so append 26, lex=52-26=26

append 26 to arr → [26,26,26], sorted to [26,26,26] → "zzz"

Correct.

Another test case: n=27

arr=[], lex=27

j=0:

27 <=26? No, 27<52? Yes, so append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

1 <=26 → append 1, lex=1-1=0

append 0 to arr → [26,1,0], which is invalid because 0 is not between 1 and 26.

Wait, but in the program, it appends lex, which is 0, but 0 is not a valid letter.

Wait, but n=27 should be "abz" → 1 + 2 + 26 = 29, wait, no, "abz" is 1+2+26=29.

Wait, n=27 could be "acc" → 1+3+23=27, or "abb" →1+2+24=27, etc.

Wait, but in the program, it would append [26,1,0], which is invalid.

Wait, but in the problem constraints, n >=3 and <=78, and letters are from 1 to 26.

So, perhaps the program needs to handle the case when lex becomes 0.

Wait, but in the problem description, it's guaranteed that n is between 3 and 78, and letters are between 1 and 26.

So, perhaps in the program, it needs to ensure that lex is at least 1.

Wait, in the case of n=27:

arr=[], lex=27

j=0:

27 <=26? No, 27<52? Yes, append 26, lex=27-26=1

j=1:

1 <=26 → append 1, lex=1-1=0

append 0 to arr → [26,1,0]

But 0 is invalid.

But in the problem constraints, n is at least 3, and letters are at least 1.

So, perhaps the program needs to handle this case.

Wait, but n=27 should be "abb" →1+2+24=27, or "acc" →1+3+23=27, etc.

But according to the program, it's [26,1,0], which is invalid.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect in this case.

Wait, but in the earlier test cases, it worked correctly, but in this case, it fails.

So, perhaps the program is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

To find the lexicographically smallest word, minimize the first letter, then the second, then the third.

So, set the first letter to 1 ('a'), then set the second letter to 1 ('a'), and the third letter to n-2.

If n-2 >26, then set the second letter to 1 + (n-2 -26), and so on.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use a greedy approach.

Let me try to implement a correct approach.

Set x=1, then set y=1, then z=n-2.

If z >26, then set y= y + (z-26), z=26.

But need to ensure y doesn't exceed 26.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust y and z accordingly.

This seems similar to carrying over in addition.

Wait, maybe I should start from the last letter and assign the smallest possible value.

Wait, but to minimize lexicographically, I should minimize the first letter first.

Let me try to think recursively.

Set x=1, then set y=1, z=n-2.

If z is valid (1<=z<=26), then that's the smallest.

If z <1, then set y=1, z=1, and adjust x.

Wait, it's getting complicated.

Let me look for a better way.

An optimal approach is to minimize x, then y, then z.

So, for x from 1 to 26:

Find the smallest x such that there exist y and z where y + z = n -x, and y and z are between 1 and 26.

Once x is fixed, y should be as small as possible, and z = n -x -y should be between 1 and 26.

So, for each x from 1 to 26:

Set y = max(1, n -x -26)

Set z = n -x -y

If z <=26 and z >=1, then this is a valid combination.

Choose the smallest x and corresponding smallest y and z.

But perhaps there's a formula to compute this directly.

Let me try to find a formula.

Given n, we need to find x, y, z such that x + y + z = n, x,y,z from 1 to 26.

We can set x=1, then y from 1 to 26, z =n -1 -y.

We need 1 <= y <=26 and 1 <= n -1 -y <=26.

So, 1 <= y <=26 and n -27 <= y <= n -2

So, y should be in [max(1, n-27), min(26, n-2)]

Then, choose the smallest y in this range.

Then, z = n -x -y

So, for x=1, y = max(1, n-27)

Then z = n -1 -y

Provided that y <= min(26, n-2)

Wait, perhaps it's better to implement this logic.

Let me try for n=27:

x=1, y = max(1, 27-27)=1, z=27-1-1=25 → "aay" → 1+1+25=27

Which is valid and lexicographically smaller than "abb" or "acc".

But according to the program, it gives [26,1,0], which is invalid.

So, the program is incorrect in this case.

Hence, the program is incorrect.

So, the answer is Correctness: **False**

## Final Solution
To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer value `n`, where each letter corresponds to a value from 1 to 26 in the alphabet.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem:** We need to minimize the word lexicographically given the sum of the values of its letters.
2. **Minimizing Lexicographically:** To achieve the smallest word, we should minimize the first letter as much as possible, then the second, and finally the third.
3. **Constraints:** Each letter must correspond to a value between 1 and 26.

### Solution Code
```python
def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        # Minimize the first letter
        for x in range(1, 27):
            # Determine the range for y
            min_y = max(1, n - x - 26)
            max_y = min(26, n - x - 1)
            # Check if y has possible values
            if min_y > max_y:
                continue
            # Choose the smallest possible y
            y = min_y
            z = n - x - y
            # Print the word
            print(chr(x + 96), end='')
            print(chr(y + 96), end='')
            print(chr(z + 96))
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation
1. **Reading Input:** Read all inputs at once and split them into a list for easier access.
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, read the sum value `n`.
   - Iterate through possible values of the first letter `x` from 1 to 26.
3. **Determining `y` and `z`:**
   - Calculate the range for `y` such that `y` is between 1 and 26 and `z` is also between 1 and 26.
   - If `y` has possible values, choose the smallest possible `y` to minimize the word lexicographically.
   - Calculate `z` as `n - x - y`.
4. **Output the Word:** Convert the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to corresponding letters and print them.

This approach ensures that we always get the smallest possible word that sums to `n`, adhering to the constraints provided.
