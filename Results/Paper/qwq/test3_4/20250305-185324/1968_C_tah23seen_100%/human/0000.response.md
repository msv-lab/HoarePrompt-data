Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x_2, x_3, ..., x_n, and I need to find an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that each a_i is between 1 and 10^9, and for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, I need to make sure that the conditions hold for all the given x_i's.

First, I need to understand what "modulo" means. Modulo is the remainder when one number is divided by another. So, x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} means that when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}, the remainder is x_i.

My task is to find such an array a that satisfies these conditions. The problem says that there can be multiple possible a arrays, and I can output any one of them, as long as it meets the criteria.

Looking at the constraints, t can be up to 10^4, which is 10,000, and n can be up to 500 per test case, but the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2*10^5. So, I need to make sure my solution is efficient enough to handle that.

Let me look at the example to get a better understanding.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify:

a_2 mod a_1 = 5 mod 3 = 2, which matches x_2 = 2

a_3 mod a_2 = 4 mod 5 = 4, which matches x_3 = 4

a_4 mod a_3 = 9 mod 4 = 1, which matches x_4 = 1

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1, 1]

Output:

a = [2, 5, 11]

Check:

5 mod 2 = 1 (matches x_2 = 1)

11 mod 5 = 1 (matches x_3 = 1)

Good.

Now, I need to find a general way to construct such an array a for any given x.

Let me try to think about how to approach this.

Starting from the first element, a_1. Since there's no a_0, a_1 can be any value between 1 and 10^9, as long as the subsequent a_i's satisfy the modulo conditions.

Wait, actually, a_1 doesn't have any restriction except being between 1 and 10^9, but it affects the possible values of a_2, which in turn affects a_3, and so on.

Wait, no. a_1 can be chosen freely, and then a_2 should be such that a_2 mod a_1 = x_2.

Similarly, a_3 should be such that a_3 mod a_2 = x_3, and so on.

So, perhaps I can choose a_1 arbitrarily, and then compute the other a_i's based on a_1 and the x_i's.

But, I need to make sure that all a_i's are between 1 and 10^9.

Alternatively, maybe I can work backwards.

Let's think about that.

Suppose I start from the last element, a_n.

I need a_n such that a_n mod a_{n-1} = x_n.

Similarly, a_{n-1} mod a_{n-2} = x_{n-1}, and so on.

If I choose a_n to be some value, then a_{n-1} should be a value such that a_n mod a_{n-1} = x_n.

But this seems a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe I can choose a_n arbitrarily, and then compute a_{n-1} based on a_n and x_n.

But actually, a_n mod a_{n-1} = x_n, so a_{n-1} divides (a_n - x_n).

Wait, more precisely, a_n - x_n should be divisible by a_{n-1}.

So, a_{n-1} is a divisor of (a_n - x_n).

But choosing a_n arbitrarily might not lead to a consistent sequence.

Maybe there's a better way.

Let me consider choosing a_1 first.

Let's choose a_1 to be some value, say, a_1 = x_2 + 1.

Wait, no, that might not work in general.

Wait, actually, I need to ensure that a_2 mod a_1 = x_2.

So, a_2 = k * a_1 + x_2, for some integer k >= 1.

Because, a_2 divided by a_1 gives some quotient k and remainder x_2.

Similarly, a_3 = m * a_2 + x_3, for some integer m >= 1.

And so on.

So, perhaps I can set a_1 to be some value, and then compute a_2 based on a_1 and x_2, a_3 based on a_2 and x_3, and so forth.

But I need to ensure that all a_i's are within 1 to 10^9.

This seems manageable.

Let me try to formalize this.

Set a_1 to be some value between 1 and 10^9.

Then, for each i from 2 to n:

a_i = k_i * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k_i >= 1.

I need to choose k_i such that a_i is within 1 to 10^9.

But this seems a bit vague.

Maybe I can choose k_i = 1 for simplicity, to minimize a_i.

So, a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i.

Let's see if this works.

Take the first test case:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Set a_1 = something, say, a_1 = 3.

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = 3 + 2 = 5.

a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = 5 + 4 = 9.

a_4 = a_3 + x_4 = 9 + 1 = 10.

Now, check:

5 mod 3 = 2 (correct)

9 mod 5 = 4 (correct)

10 mod 9 = 1 (correct)

Wait, but in the example, a_4 is 9, not 10.

Hmm, maybe their a_4 is different.

Wait, in the example, a_4 is 9, but according to my calculation, it should be 10.

But in the example, a_4 is 9, and 9 mod 4 is 1, which matches x_4=1.

Wait, but according to my method, a_4 would be 10, and 10 mod 9 is 1, which also matches x_4=1.

So both are correct.

But in the example, they have a different a_3: in my calculation, a_3=9, but in the example, a_3=4.

Wait, in the example, a=[3,5,4,9]

So, a_1=3, a_2=5, a_3=4, a_4=9.

Let's check:

5 mod 3 = 2 (correct)

4 mod 5 = 4 (correct)

9 mod 4 = 1 (correct)

But according to my method, a=[3,5,9,10] also works.

So, multiple solutions are possible.

That's fine.

Now, I need to find any such a.

So, choosing k_i=1 for all i seems to work, but in some cases, it might lead to a_i's that are too small or too large.

Wait, but in the second test case:

n=3, x=[1,1]

Output: a=[2,5,11]

According to my method:

Set a_1=2

a_2=2+1=3

a_3=3+1=4

But in the example, a_3=11.

Let's check if a=[2,3,4] works:

3 mod 2 = 1 (correct)

4 mod 3 = 1 (correct)

So, a=[2,3,4] is also a valid solution.

But the example chose a=[2,5,11].

So, again, multiple solutions are possible.

Therefore, choosing k_i=1 works, but perhaps the example chose larger k_i's.

So, in general, I can set a_1 to be any value between 1 and 10^9, and then set a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

This should ensure that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i, because a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i, so a_i divided by a_{i-1} gives quotient 1 and remainder x_i.

Perfect.

But I need to make sure that all a_i's are within 1 to 10^9.

Given that n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500, starting from a_1=1, the maximum a_i would be 1 + 500*(n-1), which for n=500 is around 250,000, which is less than 10^9, so it's safe.

Therefore, I can set a_1=1, and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

This should always work.

But in the first test case, they chose a_1=3, which is fine, and in the second test case, a_1=2, which is also fine.

So, I can choose a_1=1, but to make it more general, perhaps I can set a_1 to be x_2 + 1, which is what they did in the first test case: x_2=2, so a_1=3.

Wait, but in the second test case, x_2=1, and they set a_1=2.

So, maybe setting a_1 = x_2 + 1 is a pattern.

Let's check:

In the first test case: x_2=2, a_1=3 = 2 + 1

Second test case: x_2=1, a_1=2 = 1 + 1

Third test case: x=[4,2,5,1,2], a=[5,14,16,5,11,24]

Wait, a_1=5, x_2=4, so 5 = 4 + 1, which fits.

Fourth test case: x=[500], a=[501,500], which is 501 = 500 + 1, fits.

Fifth test case: x=[1,5], a=[2,7,5], 2 = 1 + 1, fits.

So, it seems setting a_1 = x_2 + 1 is a consistent choice.

Let me verify if this always works.

Set a_1 = x_2 + 1

Then a_2 = a_1 + x_2 = (x_2 + 1) + x_2 = 2*x_2 + 1

Then a_2 mod a_1 = (2*x_2 + 1) mod (x_2 + 1)

What is this?

Let's compute it:

2*x_2 + 1 - (x_2 + 1) = x_2

So, (2*x_2 + 1) - (x_2 + 1) = x_2

Thus, (2*x_2 + 1) mod (x_2 + 1) = x_2, which matches x_2.

Good.

Then, a_3 = a_2 + x_3 = (2*x_2 + 1) + x_3

Then, a_3 mod a_2 = (2*x_2 + 1 + x_3) mod (2*x_2 + 1) = x_3, which matches x_3.

And so on.

So, this seems to work.

Therefore, I can set a_1 = x_2 + 1, and then a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i for i from 2 to n.

This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1} = x_i for all i from 2 to n.

Also, a_1 is at least 2 (if x_2 >=1), and a_i's increase by at least 1 each time, so they stay within 10^9.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, x_2=500, a_1=501, and a_2=500.

Wait, that's different.

Wait, in the fourth test case:

n=2

x=[500]

Output: a=[501,500]

Wait, according to my method, a_1=501, a_2=501 + 500 = 1001

But in the output, a_2=500.

So, that's different.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

In this case, a_2=500, and a_1=501.

Then, 500 mod 501 =500, which matches x_2=500.

So, that's correct.

But according to my earlier method, a_2 should be a_1 + x_2=501 + 500=1001, which also satisfies 1001 mod 501 = 1001 - 2*501 = 1001 - 1002 = -1, which is not 500.

Wait, that doesn't work.

Wait, negative remainder doesn't make sense.

Actually, in Python, the modulo operation for positive numbers is fine.

But let's compute 1001 mod 501.

501 * 1 = 501

501 * 2 = 1002, which is greater than 1001.

So, 1001 - 501*1 = 500.

So, 1001 mod 501 =500, which matches x_2=500.

So, both a_2=500 and a_2=1001 are valid.

But in the output, they chose a_2=500, which is smaller.

So, perhaps there is a way to choose a_i <= 10^9, but I need to make sure that a_i is at least x_i +1, or something like that.

Wait, no.

Wait, in the fourth test case, a_1=501, a_2=500.

This satisfies a_2 mod a_1 =500 mod 501=500, which matches x_2=500.

Similarly, if a_2=1001, then 1001 mod 501=500, which also matches.

So, multiple possibilities.

But in the output, they chose a_2=500, which is the smallest possible a_2 that satisfies a_2 mod a_1 =x_2.

Because a_2 can be x_2 + k*a_1, for any integer k >=0.

So, a_2 = x_2 + k*a_1, for some k >=0.

In the first case, k=0, a_2=500 +0*501=500.

In my earlier approach, k=1, a_2=500 +1*501=1001.

So, both are valid.

Hence, to generalize, for each i from 2 to n, a_i can be expressed as a_i = x_i + k*a_{i-1}, for some integer k >=0.

To minimize a_i, we can choose k=0, but since a_i must be at least 1, and x_i >=1, this works.

In the first test case, they chose k=0 for a_2, but in my earlier approach, I chose k=1.

Both are valid.

So, perhaps the problem allows any a_i as long as it satisfies the conditions, and is between 1 and 10^9.

Hence, to make it simple, I can choose a_i = x_i + k*a_{i-1}, with k=0 for all i from 2 to n.

This would set a_i = x_i for all i from 2 to n.

But wait, a_2 =x_2, a_3=x_3, and so on.

But does this satisfy a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i?

Wait, a_2 mod a_1 = x_2, but a_2 =x_2, so x_2 mod a_1 =x_2.

This implies that a_1 > x_2, because if a_1 > x_2, then x_2 mod a_1 =x_2.

So, this works if a_1 > x_2.

Similarly, a_3 =x_3, and a_3 mod a_2 =x_3.

If a_2 > x_3, then x_3 mod a_2 =x_3.

So, as long as a_2 > x_3, this holds.

Continuing this way, I need a_{i-1} > x_i for all i from 2 to n.

So, if I set a_i =x_i for all i from 2 to n, and set a_1 to be greater than x_2, then this should work.

In the fourth test case, a_1=501 > x_2=500, and a_2=500 > x_3=0, but there is no x_3 in this case since n=2.

Hence, this seems valid.

In the first test case, a_1=3 > x_2=2, a_2=5 > x_3=4, a_3=4 > x_4=1.

So, this satisfies the condition a_{i-1} > x_i for all i from 2 to n.

Hence, choosing a_i =x_i for i from 2 to n, and a_1 > x_2, seems to work.

But in the second test case, a_1=2 > x_2=1, a_2=5 > x_3=1.

But in my approach, a_2 should be x_2=1, but in the output, a_2=5.

So, their a_2 is larger.

But both are valid, as long as a_i >=x_i and a_{i-1} > x_i.

Wait, no, a_{i-1} > x_i is sufficient for a_i =x_i to work.

But in the second test case, a_2=5 > x_3=1, which is fine.

Wait, but in my approach, setting a_i=x_i for i from 2 to n, and a_1 >x_2, seems to work.

But in the second test case, a_2=5 > x_3=1, which is fine.

So, their choice of a_2=5 is valid, but they could have chosen a_2=1, which is x_2=1, and a_1=2 >1, which would also work.

But perhaps they chose a larger a_2 for some reason.

Anyway, as long as a_i >=x_i and a_{i-1} > x_i, then a_i =x_i is acceptable.

Hence, to make it simple, I can set a_1 to be x_2 +1, and a_i =x_i for i from 2 to n.

This ensures that a_1 > x_2, and a_{i-1} > x_i for all i from 2 to n.

Wait, but in the fourth test case, a_1=501 > x_2=500, and there is no x_3, so it's fine.

In the fifth test case, n=3, x=[1,5]

a_1=2, a_2=1, a_3=5

Check:

a_2 mod a_1 =1 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2 =5 mod 1=0, but x_3=5

Wait, but x_3=5, and 5 mod 1=0, which does not match x_3=5.

Wait, this can't be right.

Wait, in the fifth test case, a_1=2, a_2=7, a_3=5

Check:

7 mod 2=7-3*2=7-6=1, which matches x_2=1

5 mod 7=5, which matches x_3=5

So, it's correct.

But according to my earlier approach, setting a_i=x_i for i from 2 to n, in this case, a_2=1, a_3=5, with a_1=2 >1.

Then, a_2 mod a_1 =1 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2 =5 mod 1=0, which does not match x_3=5.

Hence, my approach fails in this case.

So, setting a_i=x_i for i from 2 to n only works if a_{i-1} > x_i.

But in this case, a_2=1, and a_3=5, but a_2=1 < x_3=5, which violates the condition.

Hence, in this case, a_3 mod a_2 is undefined in some sense, because in Python, 5 mod 1 is 0, which does not match x_3=5.

Hence, my approach is flawed.

So, I need a better way.

Let me think again.

I need to ensure that for each i from 2 to n, a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

Which means a_i = k_i * a_{i-1} + x_i, for some integer k_i >=0, provided that a_i >=x_i.

To minimize a_i, I can set k_i=0, as long as a_{i-1} > x_i.

But if a_{i-1} <= x_i, then k_i must be at least 1, because a_i must be at least k_i * a_{i-1} + x_i, and a_i must be greater than or equal to x_i.

Wait, a_i can be equal to x_i if a_{i-1} > x_i.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, a_2=1, a_3=5, but a_2=1 < x_3=5, which would require k_3 >=1, so a_3 >=1*1 +5=6.

But in the output, a_3=5, which is less than 6, so it's invalid.

Wait, but in the example, a_3=5, and a_2=7, which is greater than x_3=5.

Wait, in the fifth test case, a_1=2, a_2=7, a_3=5.

Here, a_2=7 > x_3=5, so a_3 can be 5.

Because 5 mod 7=5, which matches x_3=5.

So, in this case, it's valid.

But if a_2=1 < x_3=5, then a_3 must be at least 1*1 +5=6.

Hence, in that case, setting a_3=5 would be invalid.

So, in general, if a_{i-1} <= x_i, then a_i must be at least a_{i-1} + x_i.

Otherwise, a_i can be set to x_i.

Hence, to make it simple, I can set a_i = x_i + k_i * a_{i-1}, with k_i chosen such that a_i >=x_i and a_i <=10^9.

But this seems a bit involved.

Perhaps there's a better way.

Let me consider starting from a_1 and building up the array.

Set a_1 to be x_2 +1.

Then, a_2 =x_2 + k_2 * a_1.

To minimize a_2, set k_2=0, so a_2=x_2.

But if a_1 <=x_2, then k_2 must be at least 1.

Wait, in this case, a_1 =x_2 +1 >x_2, so k_2=0 is acceptable.

Then, a_3 =x_3 + k_3 * a_2.

Again, if a_2 >x_3, then k_3=0 is acceptable.

Otherwise, k_3 >=1.

Continuing this way.

Hence, by setting a_1 =x_2 +1, and then a_i =x_i for i from 2 to n, it should work, because a_{i-1} >x_i in this setup.

Wait, but in the fifth test case, x=[1,5], so a_1=1+1=2, a_2=1, a_3=5.

But a_2=1 < x_3=5, which violates the condition that a_{i-1} >x_i.

Hence, in this case, it doesn't work.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the approach.

Let me try to set a_1 = max(x) +1.

Wait, but n can be up to 500, and x_i up to 500, so a_1 up to 501.

Then, set a_i =x_i for i from 2 to n.

Then, for each i from 2 to n, a_i =x_i < a_{i-1} = max(x)+1 >x_i, so a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i, which matches.

Hence, this should work.

In the fifth test case, max(x)=5, so a_1=6, a_2=1, a_3=5.

Check:

1 mod 6=1, which matches x_2=1

5 mod 1=0, which does not match x_3=5.

Wait, again, the same issue.

Because a_2=1 < x_3=5, which makes a_3 mod a_2 =0, not 5.

Hence, this approach is still flawed.

So, perhaps setting a_1 = max(x) +1 is not sufficient.

I need a better way.

Let me consider setting a_1 =x_2 +1, a_2 =x_2 + k_2 * a_1.

To minimize a_2, set k_2=0 if a_1 >x_2, else k_2=1.

But a_1 =x_2 +1 >x_2, so k_2=0 is acceptable.

Then, a_2 =x_2.

Then, a_3 =x_3 + k_3 * a_2.

If a_2 >x_3, then k_3=0, else k_3=1.

And so on.

But in the fifth test case, a_2=1 < x_3=5, so k_3=1, hence a_3=1 +1*5=6.

But in the example, a_3=5, which is less than a_2 +x_3=1+5=6.

So, perhaps their a_3=5 is invalid.

Wait, but in the example, a_3=5, and a_2=7, which is greater than x_3=5.

Hence, it's valid.

Wait, perhaps I need to follow the sequence as given in the example.

In the fifth test case, a_1=2, a_2=7, a_3=5.

Here, a_1=2 >x_2=1, a_2=7 >x_3=5.

Hence, a_3 can be set to x_3=5.

But according to my earlier approach, a_1=2 >x_2=1, a_2=1 +k_2*2.

Since a_1=2 >x_2=1, k_2=0, so a_2=1.

But in the example, they set a_2=7, which is 1 +3*2=7.

So, k_2=3.

Then, a_3=5 +k_3*a_2=5 +k_3*7.

But in the example, a_3=5, which seems inconsistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Let me try to think differently.

Suppose I set a_1 to be a large number, say 10^9.

Then, for a_2, set a_2 =x_2 +k_2*a_1.

To minimize a_2, set k_2=0 if a_1 >x_2, else k_2=1.

Since a_1=10^9 is much larger than x_2 <=500, k_2=0 is acceptable, so a_2=x_2.

Then, a_3 =x_3 +k_3*a_2.

If a_2 >x_3, set k_3=0, else k_3=1.

And so on.

This seems similar to my earlier approach, but with a_1=10^9.

In the fifth test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=1, a_3=5.

Then, a_2 mod a_1 =1 mod 10^9=1, which matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2 =5 mod 1=0, which does not match x_3=5.

Hence, this approach fails again.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a_1 to be x_2 +1, and then set a_i =x_i +k_i*a_{i-1}, with k_i chosen such that a_i <=10^9.

But this seems too vague.

Let me look for another strategy.

Maybe I can set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n.

Starting from a_1= some value.

Wait, in the first test case, a_1=3, a_2=5=3+2, a_3=9=5+4, a_4=10=9+1.

But in the example, a_4=9, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust this.

But in the second test case, a_1=2, a_2=3=2+1, a_3=4=3+1.

But in the example, a_3=11, which is different.

Wait, perhaps I need to set a_i =m*a_{i-1} +x_i, for some m>=1.

In the first test case, m=1: a_2=1*3 +2=5, a_3=1*5 +4=9, a_4=1*9 +1=10.

Which matches the first test case except for a_4=9 in the example.

But 10 mod 9=1, which is correct.

Hence, both are acceptable.

In the second test case, m=1: a_1=2, a_2=2+1=3, a_3=3+1=4.

But in the example, a_3=11, which is 3*3 +2=11, so m=3.

Hence, different m's can be chosen.

So, perhaps choosing m=1 for all i is a safe bet.

Hence, set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n.

And set a_1 =x_2 +1.

This ensures that a_1 >x_2, and a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i >=x_i +1 >x_i.

Hence, a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i, as required.

Let me verify this in the fifth test case.

n=3, x=[1,5]

Set a_1=1+1=2, a_2=2+1=3, a_3=3+5=8.

Check:

3 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1

8 mod 3=2, which does not match x_3=5.

Hmm, this is not correct.

Wait, what's going on.

Wait, according to this approach, a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i.

Hence, a_2=a_1 +x_2=2+1=3

a_3=a_2 +x_3=3+5=8

Then, a_3 mod a_2 =8 mod 3=2, which does not match x_3=5.

Hence, this approach is flawed.

Wait, why is this not working?

Wait, perhaps I need to set a_i =k_i *a_{i-1} +x_i, with k_i chosen appropriately.

In the fifth test case, to have a_3 mod a_2 =5, with a_2=3, a_3 should be 5 more than a multiple of 3.

So, a_3 =3*m +5, for some integer m >=0.

Then, a_3 mod 3=5 mod 3, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no.

a_3 mod a_2 = (3*m +5) mod 3=(3*m mod 3 +5 mod 3)=0 +5 mod 3=2.

But x_3=5, which is not equal to 2.

Hence, this approach is not working.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust m.

Wait, maybe I need to choose m such that 3*m +5 >=3, and 3*m +5 mod 3=5 mod 3=2.

But 5 mod 3 is 2, which does not match x_3=5.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose a_2 such that a_2 >x_3.

In the fifth test case, a_2=7 >x_3=5, so a_3 can be 5.

Because 5 mod 7=5, which matches x_3=5.

Hence, in this case, a_2=7 is chosen, which is greater than x_3=5.

Hence, a_3 can be x_3=5.

Similarly, a_1=2 >x_2=1, a_2=7 >x_3=5, a_3=5.

This works.

Hence, to make it general, I need to set a_i such that a_i >=x_{i+1} for all i from 1 to n-1.

Wait, no, I need to ensure that a_{i-1} >x_i for all i from 2 to n.

Wait, more precisely, for a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i to hold, and a_i >=x_i, I need a_{i-1} >x_i.

Because if a_{i-1} >x_i, then a_i can be x_i, and a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i.

If a_{i-1} <=x_i, then a_i must be at least a_{i-1} +x_i -floor(x_i / a_{i-1}) * a_{i-1}, but this gets complicated.

Perhaps it's easier to set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for all i from 2 to n.

In the fifth test case, a_1=2, a_2=3, a_3=6.

Then, a_2 mod a_1 =3 mod 2=1, which matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2 =6 mod 3=0, which does not match x_3=5.

Hence, this approach fails again.

Wait, maybe I need to set a_i =k_i *a_{i-1} +x_i, with k_i chosen such that a_i <=10^9.

But this seems too vague.

Let me think differently.

Suppose I set a_1 to be a large number, say 10^9.

Then, set a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n.

Then, a_i mod a_{i-1} =x_i, as shown earlier.

But in the fifth test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +1, a_3=10^9 +6.

Then, a_2 mod a_1 =1, which matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2=5, which matches x_3=5.

Wait, but in the earlier approach, a_3 mod a_2=5, which matches x_3=5.

So, perhaps setting a_1=10^9 works.

Let me check.

In the fifth test case:

a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +1, a_3=10^9 +1 +5=10^9 +6

Then, a_2 mod a_1=(10^9 +1) mod 10^9=1, which matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2=(10^9 +6) mod (10^9 +1)= (10^9 +6) - (10^9 +1)=5, which matches x_3=5.

Perfect.

Hence, setting a_1=10^9, and a_i=a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n, seems to work.

In the first test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +2, a_3=10^9 +6, a_4=10^9 +7

Then, a_2 mod a_1=(10^9 +2) mod 10^9=2, which matches x_2=2

a_3 mod a_2=(10^9 +6) mod (10^9 +2)=4, which matches x_3=4

a_4 mod a_3=(10^9 +7) mod (10^9 +6)=1, which matches x_4=1

Good.

In the second test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +1, a_3=10^9 +2

Then, a_2 mod a_1=1, matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2=1, matches x_3=1

Good.

In the third test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +4, a_3=10^9 +6, a_4=10^9 +11, a_5=10^9 +12, a_6=10^9 +14

Check:

a_2 mod a_1=4, matches x_2=4

a_3 mod a_2=6 mod (10^9 +4)=6, matches x_3=2

Wait, no, 6 mod (10^9 +4)=6, but x_3=2, which does not match.

Wait, this approach is failing again.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the way I set a_i.

Wait, in the third test case, x=[4,2,5,1,2]

If I set a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +4, a_3=10^9 +6, a_4=10^9 +11, a_5=10^9 +12, a_6=10^9 +14

Then:

a_2 mod a_1=(10^9 +4) mod 10^9=4, matches x_2=4

a_3 mod a_2=(10^9 +6) mod (10^9 +4)= (10^9 +6) - (10^9 +4)=2, matches x_3=2

a_4 mod a_3=(10^9 +11) mod (10^9 +6)=5, matches x_4=5

a_5 mod a_4=(10^9 +12) mod (10^9 +11)=1, matches x_5=1

a_6 mod a_5=(10^9 +14) mod (10^9 +12)=2, matches x_6=2

Perfect.

So, in this case, it works.

Wait, earlier I thought it didn't, but actually, it does.

Hence, setting a_1=10^9, and a_i=a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n, seems to work in all cases.

In the fourth test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +500

Then, a_2 mod a_1=(10^9 +500) mod 10^9=500, matches x_2=500

In the fifth test case, a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +1, a_3=10^9 +6

Then:

a_2 mod a_1=1, matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2=6 mod (10^9 +1)=6, which should match x_3=5, but 6 !=5.

Wait, this is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no, in the fifth test case, x=[1,5], so x_2=1, x_3=5.

Set a_1=10^9, a_2=10^9 +1, a_3=10^9 +6

Then:

a_2 mod a_1=(10^9 +1) mod 10^9=1, matches x_2=1

a_3 mod a_2=(10^9 +6) mod (10^9 +1)=5, matches x_3=5

Perfect.

Earlier, I mistakenly thought a_3 mod a_2=6 mod (10^9 +1)=6, but actually, (10^9 +6) - (10^9 +1)=5, so it's 5.

Hence, it matches x_3=5.

Hence, this approach works.

Therefore, I can set a_1=10^9, and a_i=a_{i-1} +x_i for i from 2 to n.

This ensures that a_i mod a_{i-1}=x_i for all i from 2 to n.

Also, all a_i's are within 1 to 10^9, since a_i =a_{i-1} +x_i, and a_{i-1}=10^9 + sum of previous x's, but in reality, a_i =10^9 + sum of x's from x_2 to x_i.

Given that x_i <=500 and n<=500, sum of x's is at most 500*500=250,000, which is less than 10^9, so a_i <=10^9 +250,000 <2*10^9, but the problem allows a_i up to 10^9, so it's acceptable.

Wait, but 10^9 + sum of x's could exceed 10^9.

Wait, 10^9 + sum of x's could be up
