Alright, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's asking for. So, I'm given an array x with elements x_2 to x_n, and I need to find an array a with elements a_1 to a_n such that for each i from 2 to n, x_i equals a_i modulo a_{i-1}. Also, each a_i should be between 1 and 10^9.

First, I need to understand what x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1} means. The modulo operation gives the remainder when a_i is divided by a_{i-1}. So, a_i is some multiple of a_{i-1} plus x_i. Mathematically, a_i = k * a_{i-1} + x_i, where k is an integer.

My goal is to find such an array a that satisfies this condition for all i from 2 to n, and each a_i is within the given range.

Let me think about how to approach this. One way is to start from the beginning of the array and try to find a_1, then use it to find a_2, and so on, ensuring that each step satisfies the modulo condition.

But another approach is to start from the end of the array. Let's consider the last element. For i = n, x_n = a_n mod a_{n-1}. This means a_n = k * a_{n-1} + x_n for some integer k.

If I can choose a_{n-1}, then I can choose a_n based on that. But I need to ensure that this choice is consistent with the previous elements.

Wait, maybe I can set a_{n-1} to some value and then set a_n accordingly. Then, move to a_{n-2} and set a_{n-1} based on that, and so on.

But I need to make sure that all a_i are within 1 to 10^9.

Let me look at the example provided to see if that gives me any insights.

In the first test case:

n = 4

x = [2, 4, 1]

And the output is:

a = [3, 5, 4, 9]

Let's verify:

5 mod 3 = 2 → matches x_2 = 2

4 mod 5 = 4 → matches x_3 = 4

9 mod 4 = 1 → matches x_4 = 1

Okay, that makes sense.

Another test case:

n = 3

x = [1,1]

Output:

a = [2,5,11]

Check:

5 mod 2 = 1 → matches x_2 = 1

11 mod 5 = 1 → matches x_3 = 1

Alright, seems consistent.

Looking at the function provided in the program:

def func_1(arr, n):

ans = [10 ** 9] * n

i = n - 2

while i >= 0:

ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]

i -= 1

return ans

So, it initializes ans with all elements set to 10^9, then starting from i = n-2 down to 0, it sets ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i].

Wait a minute, that seems suspicious. If ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i], then ans[i+1] = ans[i] + arr[i+1].

But in the modulo condition, a_{i+1} mod a_i = x_{i+1}, which means a_{i+1} = k * a_i + x_{i+1} for some integer k.

So, the relationship is a_{i+1} = k * a_i + x_{i+1}.

But the function is setting ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i], which seems different.

Let me check with the first example:

n=4, x=[2,4,1]

Initialize ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]

Set i = n-2 = 2:

ans[2] = ans[3] - x[2] = 1000000000 - 1 = 999999999

Then i=1:

ans[1] = ans[2] - x[1] = 999999999 - 4 = 999999995

Then i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - x[0] = 999999995 - 2 = 999999993

So, a = [999999993, 999999995, 999999999, 1000000000]

Now, check the modulo conditions:

a_2 mod a_1 = 999999995 mod 999999993 = 2 → matches x_2=2

a_3 mod a_2 = 999999999 mod 999999995 = 4 → matches x_3=4

a_4 mod a_3 = 1000000000 mod 999999999 = 1 → matches x_4=1

So, in this case, it works.

Wait, but is this a general solution?

Let me try with another test case.

n=3, x=[1,1]

According to the function:

ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]

i=1:

ans[1] = ans[2] - x[1] = 1000000000 -1 = 999999999

i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - x[0] = 999999999 -1 = 999999998

So, a = [999999998, 999999999, 1000000000]

Check:

999999999 mod 999999998 = 1 → matches x_2=1

1000000000 mod 999999999 = 1 → matches x_3=1

Again, it works.

Another test case:

n=6, x=[4,2,5,1,2]

Initialize ans = [1000000000,1000000000,1000000000,1000000000,1000000000,1000000000]

i=4:

ans[4] = ans[5] - x[4] = 1000000000 -2 = 999999998

i=3:

ans[3] = ans[4] - x[3] = 999999998 -1 = 999999997

i=2:

ans[2] = ans[3] - x[2] = 999999997 -5 = 999999992

i=1:

ans[1] = ans[2] - x[1] = 999999992 -2 = 999999990

i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - x[0] = 999999990 -4 = 999999986

So, a = [999999986,999999990,999999992,999999997,999999998,1000000000]

Check:

999999990 mod 999999986 = 4 → matches x_2=4

999999992 mod 999999990 = 2 → matches x_3=2

999999997 mod 999999992 = 5 → matches x_4=5

999999998 mod 999999997 = 1 → matches x_5=1

1000000000 mod 999999998 = 2 → matches x_6=2

It seems to work for these cases.

But is this a general solution? Let's try to understand why this works.

In the function, ans[i] = ans[i+1] - x[i]

But from the modulo condition, a_{i+1} = k * a_i + x_{i+1}

So, ans[i+1] = k * ans[i] + x_{i+1}

But in the function, ans[i] = ans[i+1] - x[i]

Which implies ans[i+1] = ans[i] + x[i+1]

Comparing this with ans[i+1] = k * ans[i] + x_{i+1}, it seems like setting k=1.

So, it's choosing k=1 for each step.

Is k=1 always valid? Let's see.

If k=1, then a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}

Then, a_{i+1} mod a_i = (a_i + x_{i+1}) mod a_i = x_{i+1} mod a_i

But since x_{i+1} < a_i (because x_{i+1} is the remainder when a_{i+1} is divided by a_i), this should be equal to x_{i+1}, which matches the condition.

Wait, but x_{i+1} can be up to 500, and a_i can be less than or equal to 10^9, so x_{i+1} < a_i should hold as long as a_i > x_{i+1}.

But in the function, ans[i] = ans[i+1] - x[i], which implies a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i

Given that a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}, substituting gives a_i = (a_i + x_{i+1}) - x_i

Which simplifies to a_i = a_i + x_{i+1} - x_i

This seems off. There's a inconsistency here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution.

Given a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}, and ans[i] = ans[i+1] - x[i], which is a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i

Substituting a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1} into a_i = (a_i + x_{i+1}) - x_i, which gives a_i = a_i + x_{i+1} - x_i

Subtracting a_i from both sides: 0 = x_{i+1} - x_i ⇒ x_{i+1} = x_i

This can't be generally true, unless all x_i are equal, which is not the case in general.

So, there's a problem with this approach.

But in the examples, it seems to work. Why is that?

Looking back at the first test case:

a = [999999993,999999995,999999999,1000000000]

Check:

999999995 mod 999999993 = 2 → matches x_2=2

999999999 mod 999999995 = 4 → matches x_3=4

1000000000 mod 999999999 = 1 → matches x_4=1

Similarly in other test cases, it seems to work.

But according to my earlier reasoning, it shouldn't always work because it leads to x_{i+1} = x_i, which isn't necessarily true.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the condition a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}

Given that a_{i+1} mod a_i = x_{i+1}, and a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}, then a_{i+1} mod a_i = (a_i + x_{i+1}) mod a_i = x_{i+1} mod a_i

Since x_{i+1} < a_i (because x_{i+1} is a remainder), this is equal to x_{i+1}, so it matches.

So, setting a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1} satisfies the condition.

Therefore, the function is setting a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i, which seems consistent with a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}

Wait, but in the function, it's using x[i], which is x_{i+1}, since arr is x_2 to x_n.

Wait, in the function, arr is [x_2, x_3, ..., x_n], so arr[i] = x_{i+1}

Wait, no, in the function, arr is [x_2, x_3, ..., x_n], and i goes from n-2 down to 0.

So, for i from n-2 down to 0:

ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]

Where arr[i] = x_{i+2}

Wait, no, arr[i] is x_{i+1}, since arr[0] = x_2, arr[1] = x_3, ..., arr[n-2] = x_n

So, in the function, ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i] = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1}

But earlier, we have a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}, so a_i = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1}

Which matches ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]

So, the function is setting a_i = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1}

But in the earlier reasoning, a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1}, which implies a_i = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1}, which is what the function is doing.

So, it's consistent.

But earlier, I thought that a_{i+1} = a_i + x_{i+1} satisfies a_{i+1} mod a_i = x_{i+1}, which seems correct.

Hence, the function should work.

But in my earlier reasoning, I thought there was an inconsistency, but perhaps I was mistaken.

Let me check with another example.

Take n=2, x=[500]

According to the function:

ans = [1000000000,1000000000]

i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - x[0] = 1000000000 -500 = 999999500

So, a = [999999500,1000000000]

Check:

1000000000 mod 999999500 = 500 → matches x_2=500

Good.

Another example from the test case:

n=3, x=[1,5]

According to the function:

ans = [1000000000,1000000000,1000000000]

i=1:

ans[1] = ans[2] - x[1] = 1000000000 -5 = 999999995

i=0:

ans[0] = ans[1] - x[0] = 999999995 -1 = 999999994

So, a = [999999994,999999995,1000000000]

Check:

999999995 mod 999999994 = 1 → matches x_2=1

1000000000 mod 999999995 = 5 → matches x_3=5

Perfect.

So, it seems that this approach works.

But is there any case where this approach fails?

Suppose that in the process of setting a_i = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1}, a_i becomes less than or equal to zero.

But according to the problem, a_i should be at least 1 and at most 10^9.

In the function, ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]

Given that ans[i+1] can be as low as 1, and arr[i] can be up to 500, so ans[i] could be as low as 1 - 500 = -499, which is less than 1, which is invalid.

But in the problem constraints, a_i must be at least 1.

So, if ans[i] becomes less than 1, it's invalid.

Hence, this approach isn't always correct.

We need to ensure that a_i = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1} is at least 1.

So, to fix this, we need to make sure that a_{i+1} - x_{i+1} >=1, i.e., a_{i+1} >= x_{i+1} +1

But in the function, a_{i+1} is set to ans[i+1], and ans[i+1] is ans[i+2] - x_{i+2}, and so on.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the initial value to ensure that all a_i are at least 1.

Let's think differently.

Start from a_n = some value, say 10^9.

Then, a_{n-1} = a_n - x_n, but ensure a_{n-1} >=1.

If a_n - x_n <1, then set a_{n-1} =1, and adjust a_n accordingly.

Wait, but if a_{n-1} =1, then a_n must be x_n + k*1, where k is an integer.

But x_n < a_{n-1} =1 is not possible, since x_n is at least 1.

Wait, x_n can be up to 500, so if a_{n-1} =1, then x_n must be less than 1, which is invalid.

Hence, a_{n-1} must be at least x_n.

Wait, more precisely, a_{n-1} must be greater than x_n, because x_n = a_n mod a_{n-1}, and x_n < a_{n-1}.

Hence, a_{n-1} must be greater than x_n.

Similarly, a_{n-2} must be greater than x_{n-1}, and so on.

So, in the function, when setting a_i = a_{i+1} - x_{i+1}, we need to ensure that a_i > x_i.

But in some cases, this might not hold.

For example, suppose n=2, x=[500]

If we set a_2=10^9, then a_1 =10^9 -500 =999999500, which is greater than x_1=500.

So, it's fine.

But suppose n=3, x=[499,500]

Set a_3=10^9, a_2=10^9 -500=999999500, a_1=999999500 -499=999999001

Check:

a_2 =999999500, x_2=499

Is a_1=999999001 > x_1=499? Yes.

a_3 mod a_2 =10^9 mod 999999500 =10^9 -999999500 =500, which matches x_3=500

a_2 mod a_1 =999999500 mod 999999001 =999999500 -999999001 =499, which matches x_2=499

So, it works.

Another case: n=2, x=[1]

Set a_2=10^9, a_1=10^9 -1=999999999

Check:

a_2 mod a_1 =10^9 mod 999999999=1, which matches x_2=1

Good.

But what if n=2, x=[999999999]

Set a_2=10^9, a_1=10^9 -999999999=1

Check:

a_2 mod a_1 =10^9 mod 1, which is undefined, because division by 1 has remainder 0, but x_2=999999999, which is not equal to 0.

Hence, this approach fails in this case.

So, the function is incorrect because it doesn't handle the case when a_i becomes 1, which leads to invalid modulo operations.

Hence, the given program is incorrect.

**Final Answer**

\[ \boxed{\text{False}} \]
